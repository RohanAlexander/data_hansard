2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament Assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That whereas the Fraser Government was elected in December 1975 after promising that pensions would be adjusted instandy and automaticaly in relation to quanerly Consumer Price Index Figures; And whereas that Government subsequently announced that pension adjustments should properly be made half yearly each May and November; It is the current intention of the same Government to legislate for pensions to be adjusted only once a year, and this constitutes a serious breach of generaUy accepted ethics, of Democrauc Government, and also deprives many needy pensioners of increases that are essential to their Subsistence. The foregoing facts impel the under-signed Petitioners to request the Australian Government to uphold the principle that trustworthiness of Governments should at all times be above question. And to appeal to the Parliament to prevent the imposition of funher economic hardship upon Australian Pensioners, by rejecting any Bill which has for its aim the introduction of annual adjustments of Pension rates. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Lynch, Mr Bradfield, Mr Les Johnson, Mr Barry Jones, Mr Kilien, Mr West and Mr Yates. Petitions received. Pornographic Publications To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That we the undersigned, having great concern at the way in which chUdren are now being used in the production of pornography call upon the government to introduce immediate legislation: 1. To prevent the sexual exploitation of children by way of photography for commercial purposes; 2. To penalise parents/guardians who knowingly allow their children to be used in the production of such pornographic or obscene material depicting children; 3. To make specifically illegal the importation, publication, distribution and sale of of such pornographic child-abuse material in any form whatsoever such as magazines, novels, papers or films; 4. To take immediate pohce action to confiscate and destroy aU chUd pornography in Australia and urgent appropriate legal action against all those involved or profiting from this sordid exploitation of chUdren. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will protect all chUdren and immediately prohibit pornographic child-abuse materials, publications or PETITIONS films.

Royal Commission on Human Relationships citizens of Australia reTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because the Report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships and especiaUy its Recommendations(a) Have been widely condemned for its suppon of unAustraUan, anti-fanuly, anti-child behaviour and morals such as incest, promiscuity, abortion, pornography, homosexuaUty, prostitution and brothels, et cetera. (b) Have been strongly criticised by the medical profession for the absence of any medical practitioner on the Commission or on its staff of 31 persons, and for the Commissioners action in rejecting or ignoring relevant medical evidence. (c) Have been discredited as irresponsible in adopting a new definition of the family, i.e., 'a varying range of people Uving together in relationships of commitment', which has effectively confused the real meaning and intentions of the Report where it refers to the "" family "". Therefore the Parliament has a responsibUity to the famUies of Australia not to adopt this controversial Report and its Recommendations. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Parliament will: (a) Simply receive the Report and not adopt its Recommendations, (b) Set up a Select ParUamentary Committee along the Unes of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strengthening family life and providing adequate protection for chUdren from physical and sexual abuse before as well as after binh in accordance with the UNO Declaration of the Rights of the Child as pan of Australia's suppon for the Year of the Child. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will take no measures concerning the Royal Commission on Human Relationships Repon that will funher undermine and weaken marriage, child-care or the family which is the basic unit of our society. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Kevin Cairns, Mr Dobie, Mr Fife, Mr Peter Johnson and Mr Ruddock. Petitions received. Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Austraha respectfully showeth: That the provision of payments for abonion through items of the Medical Benefits Schedule is an unacceptable endorsement of abonion which has now reached the levels of a national tragedy with at least 60,000 unborn babies being killed in 1977. Your peutioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will so amend the Medical Benefits Schedule as to preclude the payment of any benefit for abonion. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Malcolm Fraser, Mr Lynch, Mr Bourchier and Mr Stewart. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That as parents of children in government schools we maintain that it is the responsibility of governments to provide and maintain a public system of education of the highest standard open to all. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the members of this house assembled ensure that the Commonwealth Government maintain a broadly representative Australian Schools Commission to determine; - National priorities in education - strategies and allocation educational opponunity for all children - allocation of funds for the continued improvement of pubUc systems of education through General Recurrent and Capital Grants to Government school systems and Special Purpose Programs. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Bradfield and Dr Edwards. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we believe the Federal Government changes to the health insurance system are unjustified, bureaucratic. The planned aboliuon of bulk billing will place an unnecessary burden on the poor and the disadvantaged in our community. The decision to reduce the rebate paid from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the scheduled fee is an attack on real wages. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government should reverse its decisions on these matters and develop proper consultauon with the trade unions and the community. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Klugman and Mr Les MCMahon. Petitions received. Wine and Grape Growing Industry To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the recent Budget increase in excise on spirits would have grave consequences for the wine industry in South Australia, because it will cunail the sale of Brandy, because it will seriously affect the liveUhood of grape-growers and employees of wineries, because it will have a severe depressive effect on wineries and associated industries. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that The Federal Government withdraws this increase in excise on spirits, especially Brandy, so that the wine and grape growing industry in South Australia is not disadvantaged. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Blewett. Education Petition received. Uranium The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we are gravely concerned over the extreme weakness shown by our Prime Minister and his Government in his handling of the uranium mining situation in the Northern Territory. While the Parliament allows a small group of antigovernment advisers to Aborigmal organizations to delay the commencement of mining the great majority of Citizens and business people are being caused financial loss, and being denied the right to panicipate in a legitimate business. of funds to ensure equaUty of Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that permission be given-and not again withdrawn-for mining to commence immediately. by Mr Calder. Petition received. Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of Medibank the undersigned citizens of Australiarespectfullyshoweth: That the decision of the Australian Government to depan from its 1975 election promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 election campaign, that pensions would be inceased twice-yearly in line with increases in the C.P.I., will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. costly and artifically Your petitioners are impelled by this fact to call upon the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to review the above mentioned decision, and to determineThat pensions will be increased twice yearly in Une with rises in the C.P.I, as promised by the prime minister in 1975 policy speech. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Everingham. Petition received. Aged Persons Accommodation To: The Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. (a) The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth(a) That surveys reveal a substanual percentage of adults over the age of 55 years in the LoftusEngadine-Heathcote and Waterfall areas of the Hughes electorate, are in urgent need of special housing and nursing home accommodauon. (b) That many families in the area are experiencing difficulty in the placing of their aged parents in suitable nursing care; many cases having to be placed in care many kilometres from their famiUes and consequently causing great strain on the relatives concerned. (c) That this problem is aggravated by this area's geographical and pubUc transport isolation from the rest of the Sutherland Shire. (d) That Government subsidised nursing homes in other parts of the Hughes and Cook electorate have long waiting-lists to further inquirers. Your peutioners most humble pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will1. Acknowledge that there is a need for the construction of an aged persons complex in this area as already acknowledged by the Federal/State Co-ordinating Committee for Nursing-Home accommodation in N.S. W. 2. Take immediate action to provide sufficient funds in the current financial year to finance the construction and maintenance of an aged-persons complex, providing hostel and nursing bed accommodation in this area. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of we the undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showethThat because this budget will further increase the number of persons unemployed, because it reduces the average worker's spending power by $10 per week, because it will reduce the income of pensioners, because it is unfair in placing a greater burden on the poor rather than the rich, and because it is driving this country into a depression. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that The Federal Government withdraws this budget and provides Australia, within this session of Parliament, with a revised budget that increases in Australia, lowers unemployment, removes the burdens placed on the disadvantaged, and revives business and consumer confidence in the country. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of NSW respectfully showeth that the recent changes to the Health Insurance Act and proposed cuts in funding to health and welfare services discriminates against the middle and low income earners of Australia. Your peuuoners therefore humbly pray that: 1 Bulk billing be restored for all patients. 2 That the health fund rebate be restored to 85 per cent. 3 That doctors not be made responsible for determining which of their patients is on sufficentiy low income to warrant bulk bUling. 4 That the federal government fully fund the community health program. 5 That hospitals and other health and welfare institutions and organisations be federally funded at a level equal to that of their 1977-78 funds, taking inflation into account. 6 That health funds not be allowed ""optional deductibles"", that is, to remove from their schedule of benefits any item which they do not wish to insure against. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Charles Jones. and in fact, have closed their lists Petition received. Medibank To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. A petition of the undersigned respecfuUy showeth: That we the undersigned employed at Colgate Palmolive Pty. Ltd., Balmain, Sydney, N.S.W., hereby express our disgust at the negative document called the 1978 Budget. We also call for Medibank to be reinstated in its original form. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les MCMahon. Petition received. South Australian Country Rail Services The Budget To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That any downgrading or closures of Country Rail Services in South Australia would have grave consequences for the RaUway Industry, Primary Industry, Individual Country Communities and the State as a whole and calls on the Parliament to ensure that the Federal Minister for Transport takes the necessary action to maintain all existing services. 2.

3,Mr HAYDEN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,I ask a question of the Prime Health Insurance Minister. I refer to an answer given by him yesterday in which he said that basically whatever information was available to his Government in relation to matters concerning Maralinga had been available to the previous Labor Government. By way of preface I point out to the right honourable gentleman that last night I contacted former Prime Minister Whitlam and two former Ministers who served in the Defence portfolio- Mr Barnard and Mr Morrison. Mr Whitlam could not recall any information reaching him on plutonium buried at Marahnga and Mr Morrison told me that certainly nothing on this matter had ever come to him. Mr Barnard said that to the best of his recollection he had been informed that there was radioactivity at Maralinga as a consequence of nuclear tests but he is quite certain,19
4,Mr HODGMAN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order is that, firstly, the Leader of the Opposition is giving information and secondly, it is hearsay.",20
5,Mr SPEAKER,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"As to the first point, the Leader of the Opposition is giving information but I extend privUege to the Leader of the Opposition to proceed with his question. As to the point about hearsay, this is a legal concept and not a parliamentary concept.",20
6,Mr HAYDEN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"The honourable member is anything trying to make this place too difficult to function. To conclude where I left off, Mr Barnard said that he is quite certain that he was told nothing any time about the burial of plutonium. In view of this, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will support the unsubstantiated assertion he made report. yesterday by making available to me for my personal study whatever papers and documents relating to this matter the Prime Minister claims were available to the Whidam Government.",20
7,Mr KILLEN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"If I may presume to answer question on behalf of my right honourable friend, the answer to the substantive part of the obtained question is yes. But may I point out to the Leader be of the Opposition that the principal report dealguard. ing with what is buried at Maralinga is a report known as the Pearce report? That report was given to the Government in 1968. It has a British classification on it. It is a report that was pared following what is compendiously debe scribed as a clean-up at Maralinga. The operable ation was known as Operation Brumby. The report is there and I can assure the honourable gentleman- I do this in no conflictual state at all-that the report has been available for government since 1968 to study. I would be only too happy to make that report avaUable to the honourable gentleman.",20
8,Mr HAYDEN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"In other words the existence of was made known to Whitlam, Barnard and Morrison?",20
9,Mr KILLEN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"I appreciate the seriousness of my honourable friend's question. I will be seekmg, if it meets the convenience and agreement of the House, to make a statement on this matter later this afternoon- I understand there are one or two other matters to be dealt with-and then I will be tracing the history. When the honourable member for Maribyrnong was Minister for the Environment and Conservation it is a matter of record that he considered recommendations from a body known as AIRAC-the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council-and gave his approval with respect to those recommendations. For myself, I would find it absolutely unbelievable that a Minister so circumstanced as the honourable member for Maribyrnong-that is, the Minister with the ministerial responsibUity at the time-woul d have accepted recommendations without having sent for the entire file. NA",20
10,Mr HODGMAN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"Has the Minister for Defence seen the assertion in the Australia Financial Review that he suggested to Parliament yesterday that there might be no need to do about the radioactive waste buried at MaraUnga other than to upgrade the pohce guard? As I did not hear the Minister say anyat thing like this yesterday and a check of Hansard this morning has confirmed my recoUection, I ask the Minister whether there is any truth in this",20
11,Mr KILLEN,RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL,"It was a matter of astonishment and dismay to me to read in this mornings Australian Financial Review a report which was prepared by one of its employees- I place emphasis this on the word 'employees'-and which said: The Defence Minister, Mr Kilien, who only two weeks ago Cabinet acceptance of the view that action had to taken, suggested to Parliament yesterday that there might be no need to do anything other than to upgrade the police I said no such thing and I suggested no such thing. I leave it to the sense of fairness and reason preof this House to determine whether anything can read into what I said yesterday that would enthat inference or that conclusion to be drawn. I did not mention the word 'police'. Honourable members will find in a week's time a report which will state: 'As was reported in the Australian Financial Review, Ktilen said nothing else other than to upgrade the poUce guard'. As I said before-and I repeat it-this is a pernicious, wicked and odious technique. It has long been practiced by this man. I invite the editor of this it newspaper to submit what I said in this House yesterday to any five editors throughout Austraha to enable them to judge whether that is a fair, reasonable and accurate report. I do not know whether his actions represent dishonesty or incompetence but, for my part, I beheve that the person concerned would not be capable of reporting accurately a minute's silence. HEALTH: DIVULGING OF INCOME TO NA",20
12,Mr YOUNG,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,Is the Prime Minister aware that as from 1 November hundreds of thousands of middle income earners and lower income families will have to suffer the humiliation of divulging to their local general practitioner their financial standing in order that the local practitioner can determine whether these people are socially disadvantaged? Is the Prime Minister prepared to give the Parliament and the people of Australia the same information that these hundreds of thousands of families will have to give to their local doctor? Is he prepared to tell us his total income for the year 1977-78 and how much tax he paid on that income?,21
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,"The honourable gentleman draws analogies which have no relevance whatsoever. He seeks to suggest that a Budget proposal in relation to changes to Medibank will cause difficulty and hardship for a large number of Australians. I do not beheve that this is so. I believe that general practitioners have a very close knowledge and understanding of the circumstances of disadvantaged people within their communities. I would add that general practitioners have acted in this way not just in recent times but for generations. It is well known that over a long period of public service before the days of medical insurance general practitioners did not always charge the full cost for the services they rendered to people who were less well-off in their communities. If doctors could distinguish such people in those times without any onerous conditions attaching, I would certainly beheve and hope that they could distinguish such citizens in the present circumstances in which the Commonwealth, through its approach to medical care for disadvantaged people in the Australian community, will make sure that such people get full medical cover without unreasonable burden being placed upon them. Doctors will do this in the same way that they have defined and distinguished between such people over a long period of medical practice. Doctors know the real circumstances of the disadvantaged people in their own areas.",21
14,Mr YOUNG,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,Most doctors these days make the patients pay cash.,21
15,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,Order! The honourable gentleman will remain silent.,21
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,"I am quite certain that this will continue to occur. There is nothing new to be said in relation to the other matter that the honourable gentleman raised. It is well known that Sir Nigel Bowen is conducting an inquiry into these matters to see whether it is appropriate for there to be some kind of declaration to be made in respect of the incomes of members of Parliament and perhaps other people also. The honourable gentleman knows quite well that if he can succeed in having the assets of a particular person disclosed, he can then move on to another person, under the present circumstances, merely by the process of asking questions.",21
17,Mr YOUNG,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,Why don't you tell us what we want to know?,21
18,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,Order! The honourable member for Port Adelaide will remain silent.,21
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,I would like to suggest that one person who has disclosed his assets in this Parliament,21
20,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Port Adelaide has asked his question. I have asked him to refrain from interjecting previously and I do so now. The honourable member will remain silent. I call the Prime Minister.,21
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,I suggest that the very fact that one person has disclosed to the media part of his assets has not resolved the question about his own particular status. Again I have no criticism of that. I just make the point that disclosure of that kind does not end the questioning from persons with suspicious minds. The fact that a certain person has disclosed this informadon would lead to the possibility of many more questions than would have been asked had he not made any disclosure at all. NA,21
22,Mr GRAHAM,TRADE FIGURES,Is the Deputy Prime Minister concerned about trade figures which were released yesterday and their implication in particular for the future of the Austrahan economy? Can he indicate what action the Government can take in an effort to redress this situation?,21
23,Mr ANTHONY,TRADE FIGURES,"I think that everybody in this House would be aware of the importance of mamtaining a strong balance of payments situation. None of us can treat this matter lightly, because the welfare and well-being of this nation depend very much on sustaining a strong export performance. A major responsibUity of my portfolio is to foster and encourage the development of more exports from Australia. Over the past year the Government has announced the upgrading of the market development grants scheme to encourage people to sell. We have also introduced the market expansion grants scheme, which is another means of giving incentive to people to find more markets. We have estabUshed the Overseas Project Development Corporation, which will give construction, consulting and other companies the chance to perform overseas. Of course, one of the important roles of my Department is to keep a close eye on the prices that are being obtained for commodities sold overseas to see that we receive a proper and appropriate price for commodities we might sell. Another area of importance in my Department is the encouragement of investment in resources, particularly resources which are export oriented. In developing those resources we want to see the maximum amount of processing carried on here so that we get the added value of Austrahan contribution to the upgrading ofthose materials. We have developed committees in conjunction with the States to see that this matter is thoroughly examined. Australia participates in a joint study group with Japan to see how more processing might be done here. Yesterday, in answer to a question, I mentioned that Canada was moving ahead with uramum and that it had a number of projects that would be developed. In fact I am told that within the next five to six the exports of uranium from Canada wiU double. This means that Canada will be able to earn hundreds of millions of doUars worth of extra overseas currency. I only hope that it will not be too long before Australia will be able to start sharing some of the benefits from the development of the vast uranium deposits we have in this country. At a time of business stagnation or slackness and a high degree of unemployment it is unbehevable that people should be resisting the development of uranium, which can bring so many benefits to this country as well as to other countries around the world. If there were any doubts left about the uranium question I could understand people having qualms, but the uranium question has been subject to all types of examination not only in this country but also in other countries and everybody has accepted that under controlled and regulated circumstances uranium development should go ahead. I only hope that with Austraha having such rich deposits of uranium the whole community might soon be able to gain the benefit of the development of this commodity. NA NA",21
24,Dr KLUGMAN,STAFF,Can the Minister for Health remember saying that the Government's new health insurance proposals wtil lead to excess staff at the Health Insurance Commission and promising that government departments and private health funds would be asked to employ the surplus staff? Is he aware that the funds in New South Wales have allegedly placed a black ban on all Health Insurance Commission employees who have previously worked for private funds? Will he try to prevent such discrimination against persons who have generally given good service to a government authority?,22
25,Mr HUNT,STAFF,"The only advice that I have had has been from the honourable member for Prospect. I have asked him to supply me with any evidence that might come into his possession which suggests that such black banning is taking place. So far no evidence has come to me on the issue. However, I did receive an assurance from the representatives of the health insurance funds that they would do everything in their power to take staff that was surplus to the requirements of the Health Insurance Commission in cases where they had vacancies as a result of the changes that would occur to the health insurance system in Australia following the modifications to come into effect on 1 November. I wtil, however, discuss the matter with the Executive Director of the years Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia. I will report that allegations have been made of this sort of action being taken by some funds, I presume, in New South Wales. I would be surprised if the funds adopted this attitude, in view of the assurances they gave me personally at the meeting that took place soon after the Budget was introduced. If any member of the House has any evidence of such black banning I would be very grateful if he gave it to me. NA",22
26,Mr LLOYD,FRUIT CANNING INDUSTRY,"Is the Minister for Trade and Resources aware that European Economic Community fruit processors are being paid subsidies which will enable them to compete on better terms with imported canned fruit? What steps is the Government taking to protect the interests of the Australian fruit canning mdustry in this important export market? Furthermore, with regard to canned fruit, can the Minister advise whether he has yet received any response from the Canadian Government as a result of his efforts to persuade that Government not to eliminate our tariff preference on canned fruit going to that market?",22
27,Mr ANTHONY,FRUIT CANNING INDUSTRY,"I am aware that from 1 July this year the European Economic Community introduced a canned fruit production subsidy. That subsidy affects mainly our exports of peaches which make up 40 per cent of our canned fruit sales to the EEC. The actual subsidy being offered is approximately $6 a carton, which represents about 40 per cent of the landed cost for us to put canned peaches into the EEC. In fact, for an EEC canner to be able to qualify for the subsidy he has to guarantee producers in the EEC $325 a tonne. That compares with $170 a tonne in Australia. So we can see the vast difference in the cost of production between Austraha and the EEC and we can see the relative efficiency of the two countries. But with that huge subsidy the EEC is undercutting Australian sales and is making it difficult for us to maintain the share of the market which we have traditionally had for very many years. The subsidy is not the only matter causing us great deal of concern. Import duties are imposed, averaging 24 per cent. An additional levy is made for the sugar content. There are licensing arrangements involved and there is the matter import deposits. All of these matters make it more and more difficult for us to maintain our normal volume of trading in canned fruit to the EEC area. The Minister for Special Trade Repbeen resentations will shortly be in Brussels making representations on our behalf. Although the arparticular rangements have not beenfinalised,most probas ably I will be participating in further multilateral trade negotiations later this year. One of areas of very great concern want to see at least the maintenance of our present trading position rather than any restrictions being placed on it. As far as Canada is concerned, that Governyear ment has received a report which suggests that ought to eliminate the tariff preferences which exist between Australia and Canada. I have been vigorously trying to persuade the Canadians that the special tariff preference arrangements exist between our two countries should be maintained. These arrangements are very important to Australia for the export of sugar and canned fruit. It is very important for Canada to be able maintain market penetration into Australia of chemicals and manufactured goods. At the moexpected ment I am waiting for a final response on this matter. I am hoping that the Canadian Governin ment will give consideration to maintaining status quo which has existed for a number of years. NA NA",23
28,Mr BOWEN,NEGOTIATIONS,Has the Prime Minister received a letter from the Confederation of Australian Industry expressing concern that Australia's negotiating position at the Multilateral Trade Negotiations has been framed without any information being made avaUable to industry of the detaUed options and consequences? Did the Confederation also state its concern that agreement may be reached particularly in relation to a 40 per cent tariff reduction without regard to the prior views of Australian mdustry or without regard to the consequences for industry generally? Does the Prime Minister intend giving Australian industry any opportunity to comment in an informed way on prospective MTN agreements before any such agreements are reached?,23
29,Mr ANTHONY,NEGOTIATIONS,"A special industry committee has been formed on the MTN which has been operating for a number of years. It has been a looking at aU the relevant matters relating to the MTN round of negotiations. A complex series of matters has to be examined, not only the levels of tariff protection but also the various forms of of non-tariff barriers that are operating, and the various codes that we are trying to introduce so as to put a little more order and discipUne into international marketing arrangements. There have certain levels of consultation. Letters have been sent out to mdustry people. If there is any group that wants to be better informed to the overall situation I shaU be happy to look at its requests and I shall have further examined the the particular complaint that the honourable is the fact that we member makes.

30,Mr BUNGEY,BUDGET DEFICIT,Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to reports that the Government's Budget deficit for the first quarter of this financial is higher than for the corresponding period it of last year? I therefore ask the Treasurer whether the latest figures indicate any significant departure from the estimated deficit given in his which recent Budget Speech.,23
31,Mr HOWARD,BUDGET DEFICIT,"My attention has been drawn to those reports. The short answer to the second part of the honourable member's question is no. to The Budget deficit for the first three months of this financial year is $2,50lm and it is to be that in the normal pattern of seasonal developments that will get greater untU later on the financial year when of course it will reduce. the There are a number of special reasons why the deficit appears a little larger in the first three months than on a superficial examination would be consistent with the Budget estimates. For example, the effect on the revenue side of the ation increases does not become apparent until 1 November when increased deductions through the pay-as-you-earn system will commence. The increased collections of customs and excise have not been fully reflected. In addition, there have been a number of areas where payments to schools and tertiary institutions have boosted outlays simply because of the timing of those payments occurring in the first three months. There has been the payment in full of the sharing entitlements of local government students. authorities under the tax sharing arrangements in thefirstquarter whereas in the same quarter 1977-78 some $60m of those entitlements was not paid until after that quarter. Because of changed administrative arrangements for the Northern Territory there has been a bunching effect so far as payments to the Northern Terripresent tory are concerned during thefirstthree months. Overall, in respect of those reports, I would say that to read into thefiguresfor the first three months significant evidence that there has been substantial departure from the Budget estimates is quite erroneous and quite misleading. I believe that thefiguresproduced to date do not support those suggestions. NA",23
32,Mr FRY,STUDY LEAVE CONDITIONS,I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to possible changes in study leave conditions which pose a threat to the academic standards of Austrahan universities. Has the Government received the second report of the Tertiary Education Commission on study leave? Does the Government intend to table the report and allow some discussion of it? When does the Prime Minister intend to make a stateprocedures ment on the issue?,24
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,STUDY LEAVE CONDITIONS,"The matter is currently under examination by the Government. There have been some early discussions in relation to it. When the Government's decisions are made the Minister for Education will be making a statement in relation to the matter. think it ought to be pointed out that there been a real degree of generosity in some of the study leave arrangements made by some instisettlement tutions around Australia. Study leave has not been restricted merely to those who need relief from academic duties and studies during an academic year. It has been extended to adlegislation. ministrators, and if study leave is necessary year in seven for administrators in universities, why would it not be necessary for administrators in other walks of hfe? I think it has been quite right to examine these provisions which overall, taxhaving in mind the additional staff numbers required, cost about $40m a year. I know that the direct costs are very much less than that-the costs of fares and other things-bu t the fact that institutions have to carry a much larger number of staff to cater for the study leave provisions costs a total of about $40m a year. Another way of looking at it is that if study leave were not being undertaken to the same extent, the same number of staff would be able to tax look after the needs of a much larger number of I do not think that this is an entirely simple question, and the Government will be in looking at it having in mind the best needs of the students of Australian universities and colleges the of advanced education. It will certainly want to preserve academic standards, but there must be a question mark on whether the generosity of the arrangements is entirely necessary for the achievement of that. To take one simple example, I think the suggestion that people must travel overseas to a foreign university to study a and to live and work within its environment for a year or two is not necessarily appropriate in all circumstances in Australia in 1978 and beyond. There are a number of very good universities in this country and I should have thought that it would be just as appropriate for study leave to be taken by somebody from a Melbourne university in another university in Australia. So a number of matters are not unrelated to this issue. RANGER AGREEMENT: NORTHERN NA",24
34,Mr RUDDOCK,LAND COUNCIL,Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs keeping in touch with the Northern Land Council concerning implementation of for obtaining a decision on the proposed Ranger agreement? What is the current position?,24
35,Mr VINER,LAND COUNCIL,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I am keeping in touch with the Northern Land Council to follow what is happening in carrying out the procedures of the I land rights legislation with regard to the has proposed Ranger agreement. The House will recall that, following litigation, it was a term of that there would be consultation with various communities and with the traditional some owners to determine which communities are affected and require to be consulted under the A meeting has been going on at Oenone pelU in the uranium province area over the last couple of days. I expect to receive a report tonight and will be in a position to advise the House more completely tomorrow on the result of that meeting. That is not to say that there will be a final decision tomorrow or within the next few days on whether the Ranger agreement will be agreed to by the NLC. However, it may be of some interest to the House to know that not only have I been keeping in contact with the Northern Land Council but also that last Friday I found that a Mr Muller travelled to Darwin and had some discussions with the Northern Land Council. When I inquired about who Mr Muller was I found that he was employed as an electorate assistant by the honourable member for Reid. I found also on further investigation that Mr Muller is currendy acting in a new position of assistant private secretary to the honourable member and that that position was approved recently by the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Muller is therefore entided to travel at government expense on the business of the honourable member for Reid. Honourable members will recall that when I went to Darwin late in September at the time of the litigation I discovered that there was a web of intrigue involving the Labor Party spreading throughout Arnhem Land. Since then further evidence has been coming to hand as to just how far the Labor Party is involved in pursuing its own political interests and not the interests of the Aboriginals. Not only has Mr Muller been involved recently, but also I ought to inform the House just what he was on about. He suggested to the Northern Land Council that what it ought to do was to delay as long as possible the discussions that are now going on within Aboriginal communities. Mr Muller said that the Labor Party is going pretty well at the moment-in its eyes-and that there will be an election in 18 months and if negotiations can be strung out over those 18 months there will be a Labor government and, of course, it would not allow uranium mining to conunue. That is blatant action of a vested nature and of a political kind by the Australian Labor Party. It is designed not only to frustrate the negotiations that have been carried out with regard to the Ranger mining but also to destroy the credibility of the Northern Land Council. We know also that the Labor Party inspired a move to bring down the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Galarrwuy Yunupingu. I have no hestitation in expressing my complete confidence in the capacity and the credibility of Mr Yunupingu in seeking to fulfil his statutory responsibilities and those of the Northern Land Council under the landrightslegislation. But events involving the Labor Party do not stop at Mr Muller. I have also discovered that in the last day or so Mr Bob Collins, the Labor Party member for Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory Assembly, was instrumental in organising a charter plane to take people to Goulburn Island for a rally, so it was called, to meet Mr Yunupingu.",24
36,Mr YOUNG,LAND COUNCIL,Would you rather be wrapped up in shonky land deals or undertakers' businesses?,25
37,Mr VINER,LAND COUNCIL,"So I think the web of intrigue is becoming more apparent. As the days go by, the honourable member for Port Adelaide might wish to know, we will gather more and more evidence of the involvement of the Labor Party, of its attempts to destroy the Northern Land Council and the credibility of its Chairman and hence of its attempts to frustrate the Ranger negotiations.

38,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,MEDIBANK STAFF,Is the Minister for Health aware of the acute and growing concern of Health Insurance Commission employees about their future following the Budget statements-statement s now almost two months old-o n Medibank? Will the Minister make a detailed statement on the employment prospects of the staff of Medibank? Will the Minister give an unqualified assurance that no staff member currently employed by Medibank will be unemployed or under-employed after 1 November as a result of the Government's Budget decision concerning Medibank?,25
39,Mr HUNT,MEDIBANK STAFF,"I am aware that there is concern amongst members of the staff of the Health Insurance Commission about their future employment. I made it perfectly clear, in making the statement, that there would be staff-the number is yet to be determined-that would be surplus to the requirements of the Health Insurance Commission some time after 1 November. As a consequence of our concern, a very close examination is being undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission, the Department of Health and the Public Service Board of the implications of the new arrangements that will apply. I have met the staff associations and have had a lengthy conference with them. The staffing requirements of the Department of Health for certain functions that will go across from the Health Insurance Commission to the Department of Health for the processing of bulk-billed claims for pensioners and disadvantaged people have not yet been finalised. It is expected that offers of employment will be made to a significant number of members of the staff of the Health Insurance Commission in the very near future. I have asked the Health Insurance Commission and the Department of Health to try to expedite their discussions with the Public Service Board so that we can clarify the position of a great number of staff members who, at present, are not quite sure whether they are going to be unemployed. Undoubtedly a number of processing centres will cease to function some time in the New Year. We also have had discussions with the Pubhc Service Board to ensure that where redeployment is possible within the Public Service that will be done. As I indicated earlier, I have had discussions with the Voluntary Health Insurance Association of Australia to try to ensure that where there are vacancies in the funds it should attempt to make every effort to employ those who are surplus to the requirements of the Health Insurance Commission as a result of the new arrangements as from 1 November. I cannot give any guarantee whatsoever that there will be no unemployed people as a result of the changes from 1 November. I have made it very clear that there will be surplus staff after 1 November. NA Mr THOMSONM y question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is the Minister aware of Press reports referring to an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into the sugar industry? Can the Minister inform the House of the nature of the inquiry into the sugar industry? Is there a statutory requirement for a draft report? Do Press reports referring to the need for the issue of a draft report conflict with the views of people in the industry?",25
40,Mr SINCLAIR,SUGAR INDUSTRY INQUIRY,"It is true that the problem of establishing a fair and adequate domestic price for sugar has been a matter of some controversy over the last few years. This Government has given very real sympathy to the requests of industry, particularly since export prices have fallen. The problem of the sugar industry in finding in the domestic market a price that helps to offset the ever escalating costs which affect the industry has become far more serious. It is equally true that there are three principal components of the sugar industry. When we talk about a domestic price we are essentially thinkexperimentation ing of the end price, but the industry is divided into those who are cane growers, those who are sugar millers and, of course, the two sugar refiners. It was felt, because of the difficulties adequately establishing cost movements affected the cane growers particularly, that a form of inquiry was necessary. This inquiry, however, is not one which has been initiated the normal course. It comes rather because of Commonwealth Sugar Agreement which is an gentleman agreement negotiated between the Government of Queensland, which in fact owns all the sugar in Australia, and the Commonwealth Government. Under that Agreement there is an obligation for the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government to have negotiations whenever the domestic price of sugar is to be determined. It was out of that Agreement that it was felt that the IAC was the most appropriate body to undertake an inquiry into the sugar industry. Belatedly there seems to have been a feeling by a number of people, particularly consumers, that a draft report was necessary. However, at the time of the initiation of the inquiry there was correspondence with the industry and with the Queensland Government-the owners of the sugar-by which it was estabUshed that there would be one report which would be a final report. It, of course, will be pubUshed and it will be avaUable for comment at that time. The big percentage of sugar growers seems to be very much in favour of persisting in that course of action. I have in fact communicated with the industry and while it is true that some producers are in favour of a draft report they seem to be only a minority. The big percentage of cane growers is certainly in favour of the course that was initiated at the time the IAC inquiry was first commenced. I would stress that this is not a normal IAC inquiry. It is an inquiry conducted under the auspices of the IAC in order to investigate all aspects relating to the production and costing of sugar production, milling and refining in Australia. It is not an inquiry in the normal sense but the IAC does provide a very suitable vehicle by which a broad based inquiry can be undertaken. As it is not a normal IAC inquiry I do not the see anything abnormal in accepting the continued requests of the cane growers and the sugar industry that there should be only a final report. NA NA",26
41,Mr HAYDEN,MARALINGA,I ask a question of the Minister for Defence. What was the purpose of nuclear at Maralinga in which discs of plutonium were explosively shattered? Were these tests directed to the development of highly advanced nuclear weapons? Were they carried in out in breach of the spirit of an international ban as they on nuclear testing?,26
42,Mr KILLEN,MARALINGA,"This question or a question comparable with it was asked of me by the in honourable member for Reid on or about 9 the December 1976, and I replied to the honourable in a letter which I believe was dated either 3 or 4 February 1977.1 will be advening to that question and that letter in the statement. I propose to give later. 1 asked of the appropriate British authorities the explicit question which my honourable friend has asked me. I have received a categorical assurance that there was no breach of the moratorium at that time, that there was no nuclear explosion at that time and that the tests that were conducted were nuclear experimentations designed to determine what difficulties would have been postulated by, say, a nuclear weapon being involved in a fire or being subjected to severe stress. Beyond that I would say to the honourable gentleman that I think that this issue would be covered by me in particular when I make that statement; but I would seek to emphasise to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House that, as advised, there is no evidence whatsoever that the United Kingdom Government at the relevant time in any way breached the nuclear moratorium.

PRIME MINISTER'S PECUNIARY NA",27
45,Mr ARMITAGE,INTERESTS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Why did the Prime Minister choose to give his evidence in secret to Mr Justice Bowen's inquiry on pecuniary interests? In the spirit of the Bowen inquiry, will the Prime Minister declare now his sources of income, apart from official salary and allowances, and his tax payments? If the Prime Minister will not do this and will not even state in public his views on pecuniary interest declaration",27

48,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTERESTS,"The matters that come out of the Bowen inquiry will be perfectly plain to all members of this House when the inquiry is completed, when its report is made, when the Government has made its decisions it and when the report is published. At that time the view of the Government will become That is as it should be. I have a view that in government Ministers, and especially I, should be in a position of having personal views that Ausare unrelated to government views that might emerge on matters that can become ones of policy. I believe that that is a very good reason for giving evidence to the Bowen inquiry in the way in which I did. Quite obviously, I have no knowledge of what that inquiry might report. Decisions that we will make about this matter in the end will be decisions of the Government; not decisions of the Prime Minister or any I have no wish to be on public record in a manner contrary to the view of the Government as Government's view will emerge in the proper course of conducting its affairs. It is a very old business for people to ask of a Minister or a Minister, questions such as 'What is your Where does it come from?'. I believe these matters are not properly related to the of conduct of the business and the affairs of this I Parliament. I believe that there is an attempt to to establish some air of suspicion where there ought to be none and to destroy the prospects for a trust between parliament and the people, because it is not just a matter which concerns a or an opposition; it is a matter which concerns parliament and the people. I have pointed out on a number of occasions that the question of trust between parliament and the people is fragile; it is not one that, for example, can be supported or improved by having a register, which might not be a full and complete one- a register which would lead to more questions being asked than might otherwise be the case. I have said on many occasions that we will be examining the report of the Bowen inquiry. If, as a result of that report, requirements are placed upon members of parhament, I and everyone on this side of the House will fulfil those requirements. I can see no reason why the Opposition should attempt, first in my case and then, going down the hne, in the case of some other Ministers, to establish by selective questioning of kind a particular circumstance, and to reveal cumstances which to this point are the affairs of a person or a person's family. UNITED NATIONS TROOPS: NAMIBIA",27
49,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,INTERESTS,"I direct to the Prime Minister a question which concerns the United Nations Security Council proposal to station 7,500 United Nations troops in Namibia during that country's transition to independence. Is the Prime Minister aware that, given the size of Namibia, this would represent the greatest concentration of United Nations forces in any area of dispute since World War II, except of course in the open conflict of the Korean war? For example, it is nearly six times the concentration of troops that was present in the Congo. In order to further the aims of attaining a workable and reasonable compromise during Namibia's transition to independence, will the Government suggest to the Secretary-General of the United Nations or to the United Nations itself that there could be reasonably a very substantial reduction in the number of troops proposed for that country?",28
50,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTERESTS,"As my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear, there has been some examination by the Government.

What I have been complaining about privately to journalists, and wrote about in an article in last Sunday's Canberra Times entitled 'How can we get the media to look beyond the trivialities?', is that the media is inclined to report material at length when it involves personal attack or criticism and is inclined to ignore the reporting of complex examination of basic philosophical or economic concepts such as the conflict of value systems.

86,Mr NIXON,INTERNATIONAL AVIATION POLICY,"by leave-For the information of honourable members. I table the report submitted to me by a committee which reviewed the economic regulatory aspects of Australia's international civil aviation policy, together with a statement of policy decided upon after Government consideration of that report. I seek leave to have the latter document incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA NA I am pleased to table the mittee which reviewed the economic regulatory aspects of Australia's international civil aviation policy. Apart from minor corrections, editing has been made only to protect confidential material supplied by commercial interests which made submissions to the committee, and to delete detailed comment relating to issues that impinge upon Australia's relations with foreign countries. Arrangements are in hand for this document to receive general distribution. The committee sought the assistance of the Bureau of Transport Economics with its work on factors affecting the demand for international travel. A paper prepared by the Bureau and discussed in the repon has been released today also. Honourable members will recall that the Government instituted this review late last year. The committee which undertook the work comprised senior officers of the Department of Transpon and Dr C. A. Gannon, Associate Professor of Economics at Monash University. It was given extensive assistance by a range of organisations, associations and individuals whose contribution the Government gratefully acknowledges. The views of die State Governments were also sought and taken into account. Present Policy Australian policy in this area of civil aviation has been directed to the development and operation of safe and efficient scheduled services to areas of the world of principal travel, trade and political interest to this country. The aim has been to encourage the development of fares and freight rates that are as low as possible and consistent with commercially viable operations by carriers. A funher objective has been to secure continued Australian participation in the provision of these services. This has been achieved by designating Qantas Airways Limited, a wholly Government owned company, to operate the services aUowed an Australian carrier under the air services agreements we have with other countries. Regulation of non-scheduled operations has been supportive of maintenance of scheduled services. As the House knows, this policy has been pursued on a bipartisan basis by successive governments. It has been extremely successful in many ways, allowing the continued and very rapid development of Australia's international air services. In 1977, using the air mode, approximately one million short term visits overseas were made by Australian residents and in excess of 500,000 short term visitors came to Australia. Present air services allow Australian residents to travel to all parts of the world with relatively little inconvenience and with journey durations so shon, even for the most distant destinations, that would have been considered for impossible 25 years ago. Freight movements by air into and out of Australia grew to over 80,000 tonnes in 1976, representing 10.4 per cent of the total value of impons and 4 per cent of the total value of exports. Air travel to any part of the world can be arranged from most major towns in Australia. The traveller is afforded a wide choice of carrier, times of carriage and price options. Fares have fallen in real terms and, in some cases, in actual money terms over the past decade. However, the policy has been called increasingly into question. The principal complaint and the most imponant in having the Government decide upon the review, is that the present arrangements do not allow the development of lower fares and freight rates that can be offered to the public. Quite obviously, price is the primary focus of public and government attention and properly so. The cost of air travel to and from Australia impacts both on Australian residents travelling abroad and on visitors to Australia. The latter, in turn impacts on Australia's tourist industry. report submitted to me by a comLess commented upon is the underlying inefficient use of resources associated with the current arrangements, which in turn has led to problems and disquiet in both the aviation and the travel industry. This is evident most in unauthorised discounted travel, avaUable only to some members of the public and some retailers of travel. The discriminatory aspects of this practice are offensive, I know, to all honourable members. It needs to be recognised that Australia's aviation agreements with other countries were developed largely during a period when international aviation was much less technologically sophisticated than it is today. The route structure and pattern of our overseas air services during their developmental phase were governed largely by the technical capabUities of the aircraft of those times. Today's aircraft are more sophisticated and more economic in their operation than those of yesterday. They provide the means for a new policy basis to satisfy the public's desire for lower international air fares. The policy itself has not been clearly set down and discussed by this House for many years, despite significant changes in the manner of operation of international air services, their dramatic growth and a very radical shift in the pattern of demand for these services. Details of the policy are little understood outside those close to government or the industry. Aspects of the regulatory arrangements and methods of fare construction have become so complex as to be not readily comprehended by members of the public. The Review Report When the Government considered this matter late last year it saw that changing existing arrangements to permit lower fares to be developed would involve choice between alternative courses. Each of these had advantages and disadvantages. It was clear that change could affect adversely the level of scheduled service frequency from all pons in Australia, panicularly at the smaller pons such as Penh and Brisbane. Change would impinge upon the activities of all scheduled carriers serving this country, and upon Australia's civU aviadon arrangements with other governments. These were among the major problems the committee was asked to address. I believe the repon provides a useful summary of present policy, its benefits and defects and provides a basis for informed discussion of future arrangements in this dynamic industry. Optional courses for future policy both in respect of passengers and freight arrangements are discussed, as well as a wide range of associated matters that are of pubUc importance. The report confirms there is gross under-utilisation of existing capacity of such magnitude as to indicate a serious inefficiency in the present supply of air services. Arrangements made with other countries, aimed at having capacity avaUable on a route bear a reasonable relationship to the needs of the travelling public, are obviously not working appropriately, a problem not unique to Australian experience. The report underlines that existing constraints which impinge most directly on the carriers' ability to lower fares, are the inability, when required, to restrict or reduce capacity to reasonable market needs and the inability to establish, within a multilateral fare fixing machinery, fares structures which embrace an optimal mix of fare types. As a result of the present manner of fixing fares, trafficflowsarise which do not correspond to the most economic manner of carrying traffic on » route and travel tends to be encouraged over relatively short sectors which are more expensive to operate. Carriers of intermediate countries have had undue influence on both the level of capacity and fares between countries at each end of a route. The repon also points to the lack of international agreement about defining scheduled and non-scheduled services, the latter being more commonly known as charter services. Charter services are not only regulated individually by each country, but, usually, separate passenger and freight charter operations. The report emphasises that no one country can unilaterally change international civil aviation pohcy. As a UK Committee of Inquiry on this subject said some years ago 'the air transport industry of by the policies and standards of other countries and it is not possible to start afresh and rewrite a policy unilaterally'. The existing arrangements represent a complex balance of national and commercial interests struck over a period of many years. Policy change must take full account of this. However, the review committee considers the welfare benefits possible from seeking and securing improved arrangements make embarking on a course of change leading to reduction of inefficiencies in the present system well worth whUe. The Government endorses this view. Objectives of Changed Policy The Government decided changed policy should satisfy certain objectives. The primary objective with respea to international air passenger services is to facUitate, in concert with other countries, the development of air service arrangements that aUow the needs of the widest possible range of resident and visiting passengers to be satisfied in a safe, efficient, rational and commercially viable manner. Particular attention must be given in the design of changed air service arrangements to the expansion of opportunities for low cost travel by the, now, large proportion of total passengers who are principaUy concerned with the price of travel, often termed the 'price sensitive' segment of the market. At the same time, however, the full implications for all passengers of changed arrangements must be assessed, especiaUy where certain arrangements favour one type of consumer at the expense of others. This interaction arises because both the demand and the supply of the various types of air service are interdependent. In shon, Government has a responsibUity to all types of passengers, including those travelhng for business or leisure, those resident in major gateway capital cities and those resident elsewhere, those who want travel flexibUity and the immediate avaUabUity of service, or service 'on-demand', and those who are able and prepared to plan in advance and travel without interruption to their destination at a lower fare. The Government recognises that the travel needs of various categories of passengers range over a variety of air service characteristics-suc h as price, schedule, frequency, seat avaUabUity, flexibUity in routing and the ability to make stopovers on route, comfort and in-flight amenities. However, the relative importance attached to these individual characteristics differs greatly among passengers. The most price sensitive passengers are wUling to forego many desirable air service characteristics, or' quality' of service, for a lower fare. Other passengers need a higher quality of service, for example, the avaUabUity of a seat 'on-demand' and a frequent departure schedule, and are wUling to pay a higher fare for it. In practical terms, meeting thisfirstobjective requires recognition of the interdependence between different types of air service and the need for an appropriate balance to be struck between provision of opportunities for travel at low fares and the provision of higher quality air services, but at higher prices. The increasing demand for the services provided by the air transport industry is largely attributable to the growth in leisure travel. Rising incomes and expanding purchasing power coupled with increasing leisure point to a continuation of this growth. regulatory provisions exist for The Government attaches particular importance to the development of tourism to Australia. It sees tourism as a means of earning foreign exchange and creating additional employment opportunities. Tourism also contributes to regional development. any country is closely influenced As some 98 per cent of all short term visitors to Australia travel by air, the travel and tourist industry in Australia stand to benefit from the increased numbers of overseas visitors which are expected to come to Australia as a result of lower air fares. New arrangements for lower international airfares will provide further stimulus to the travel and tourist industry and follow a series of initiatives taken by this Government to assist the development of tourism in Australia. I refer, in particular, to extension of the Expon Market Development Grants Scheme and the investment allowance to the tourist industry, establishment of a Travel and Tourist Industiy Advisory Council, and a record 37 per cent increase in funds this year for the Australian Tourist Commission which will enable the doubling of its overseas promotional activities. In the Ught of these developments, growth prospects for the travel and tourist industry are extremely favourable with consequent benefits in terms of increased employment opportunities and foreign exchange earnings. The Government has reaffirmed that it will maintain the long standing poticy objective of securing Australian participauon in the provision of our international air services. As the repon discusses, the nations of the world have never agreed on a multilateral approach to the economic regulation of international cdvU aviation, preferring to establish air service anangements between them on a bilateral basis. The national interest considerations that influenced this approach are reflected in the almost universal reservation by countries of market opportunities for their national carriers within these bUateral arrangements. Australia has its own particular interest in participating in the operation of international air services to this country. It is an island nation where alternative transport by land is impossible and by sea is not attractive or readily available. National defence planning reUes on the existing infrastructure of civilian transport modes, including both the air transport resources and the supporting facUities that allow aircraft to fly. WhUe other countries continue to pursue objectives perceived as meeting best thenown national interest, concern would always remain in Australia about the vulnerability of dependence on other countries for the provision of our international air services. Not least, the Government accepts that other countries have legitimate expectations and concern about the development of their own aviation interests. Other governments have a clear right to seek, as they do, a fair and equal opportunity for their carriers to participate in the provision of national air services between their own and other countries. The Australian Government respects these rights, just as it wishes Australian interests respected. However, within anangements organised on this basis, there can be legitimate concern about the possibilities of inefficiencies arising. Carriers from some countries will be more efficient producers than those from others. Careful regulation and appropriate governmental intervention will be required to avoid disadvantage to consumer interests. The Government has funher decided that, at least until 1981, Qantas Airways Limited shall remain the sole Australian carrier designated to exercise therightsAustraUa bas under the air service agreements it has negotiated with other countries. The primary reason for retaining single designation is the relatively small size of our international air travel markets and the difficulty of sensibly accommodating additional airlines within these markets. Most routes from Australia are, by world standards, lightly travelled. As an example, passengers uplifted or discharged between all Australian pons and London during the year ended June 1977 were less in total than passengers uplifted between Los Angeles and London. On the latter route the British and US authorities have only recently agreed to the designation of two national carriers by each country. This is a single sector journey for modern wide-bodied aircrafi. By contrast, London is served from five Australian gateway points and no less than 12 carriers are able to carry passengers on services to London where no change of carrier is required en route. The Government has decided that it will review the policy for single designation in 1981, taking into account the state of the industry at that time and, in particular, whether expansion in travel, expected as a result of new arrangements, demonstrates significant growth in passenger numbers on major routes. Additionally, the next few years will be a period of change, during which Qantas will have to adapt to substantially altered circumstances. I would add that the Government is confident that Board, management and employees of Qantas wiU conunue to improve the efficiency of the Company's operations. Australians can be proud of the contribution Qantas has made to the development of our international air services and its success in an industry that relies heavUy on advanced management and technological skUls. It has an enviable safety record which has been won by the care, dedication, training and skills of its employees. Qantas also has an excellent reputation internationally for the quality of service it provides its passengers both 'on ground' and in the air. The Government has every confidence that it will respond to the challenge change will bring. We endorse the long standing view that Australia's international air services as a whole should be financially self-supporting and fare levels adequately remunerative. In short, the Government does not accept that there should be subsidisation of international air services, although it recognises that at certain times on certain routes, for example, in developing a new route, this objective may not be satisfied. The Government believes that changed anangements should be understandable to the consumer. In particular it is anxious that new fare anangements and the justification for their determination at particular levels should be capable of being readUy understood. It accepts that the range of fare types may stUl be wide and that, necessarily, there will be conditions attached to many. They should, however, as the Committee suggests, be capable of being set out in a way which allows consumers to appreciate their differences and readUy choose between them. New arrangements should also aim to avoid the developinterment of practices that lead to discrimination concerning the price paid by selected groups of consumers or retailers. Although fare levels remain agreed between governments, reductions, wherever possible, should be available to allFuture Policy The Government has concluded' that these policy objectives are best achieved by seeking to negotiate air service arrangements with other countries based upon the exchange of the first four freedoms of the air. These arrangements should provide for the supply of a full range of different types of air travel by the designated airline of Australia and of the country with which we have negotiated the bilateral air service agreement. The level of supply should be directly related to genuine end-to-end traffic. There should be concurrent development of new fare structures that reflect the economies to the carriers such arrangements allow. By fare structure, I refer to the different types of service or ticket types available, the conditions that attach to each, and their associated fare levels. The term freedom is, as the repon points out, largely a misnomer. Freedoms are essentially privileges granted by countries to the carriers of other countries. These freedoms are described on pages 4 to 7 of the report. The House will recognise that the new policy involves an exchange only of rights for carriage between Australia and another country. Essentially, it involves agreement about the carriage of genuine 'end-to-end' passengers between Australia and the other country concerned. It is important that there should be wide general understanding of the reasons that led the Government to this change of policy. The primary objective of achieving a fare structure that caters to all passengers' demands and equitably serves those demands at the lowest possible cost, rests on the achievement of: high aircraft utilisation high average load factors, and overall efficiency in the production and distribution of air travel. High utilisation and high average load factors are predicated upon two basic underlying conditions. Firstly, there should be an appropriate level of total seat capacity relevant to demand for travel on a particular route or air service market. Secondly, there should be a fare structure capable of ensuring that the total demand for individual flights is related as closely as possible to the total seat capacity available. Different load factors are appropriate to different market segments, or groups of passengers whose purpose of travel differ. The market segment which includes those passengers who wish to travel 'on demand', for example, requires a lower load factor if seats are to be normally available on request. Clearly, this market than the market segment embracing passengers who are prepared to accept conditions on their fare, such as committing themselves to booking in advance. A careful and thorough consideration of alternative arrangements led the Government to the conclusion that the basic economic characteristics of both the supply of and demand for air services point towards the pre-eminence of structuring the supply of air services in terms of serving true origin/destination markets. By structuring air service arrangements on an 'end-to-end' basis, that is an exchange of third and fourth freedoms, the full economies of serving the true underlying flow of traffic in such markets can be realised. The emergence of whole aircraft charter operations which are, of course, by their very nature substantially designed to serve traffic flowing on an 'end-to-end' basis between one country and one other country, that is third/fourth freedom traffic, demonstrates the economic advantages of the 'endto-end ' arrangement. Whole aircraft charter operauons are predicated also upon high load factors. These are achieved by exploiting the fact that whereas the supply of air services cannot be 'stored'-sea t capacity on a particular flight is a commodity which perishes immediately the flight is operated-som e demand can be 'stored'. This is done by using advance purchase and often, in addition, group travel and round trip conditions. These conditions consolidate passenger demand around particular times of departure and return. However, whole aircraft charter services serve only those classes of passengers who are able to meet the conditions on travel that these arrangements impose. In other words, whole aircraft charter operations segment of the market. They ignore the needs of other classes of passengers, most notably those seeking regular 'on demand'travel, who have untU recently, been the traditional market for scheduled carriers. The arrangements we propose can incorporate the advantages that charter services capture, yet simultaneously maintain, at an appropriate level, scheduled air services. This is especially important for a country such as Australia where the international gateways serve markets of different and federation of States that are geographically widely separated. Illustratively, much has been made of the well-publicised offer by a UK carrier to offer lower fares on a once weekly charter service between either Sydney or Melbourne and the UK. Approval of that proposal on its own would have ignored the fact that both the demand for, and the supply of, the various types of air services are closely related and cannot be considered in isolation. Visitors to, or travellers from other parts of Australia would have been denied reasonable access to these lower fares. A large number of passengers both at the port served and elsewhere would wish to travel at the lower fares but would be unable to have their requirements satisfied. In short there would be gross under supply and a rationing problem created leading to extensive public dissatisfaction. If the Government had then simply extended services of this type to meet demand further problems would have arisen. Significant scheduling changes would have been made which would have impacted adversely on service availability and frequency, particularly at the smaller gateways of Brisbane, Perth and Darwin. This would have most adverse affects on business and tourism and for Australian travellers in those centres and the regions they serve. segment should pay a higher price Additionally, these developments would have happened without any regard to our relations with those other countries whose interests would have been anected. The arrangements we propose are expected to offer approximately five times the number of seats at lower fares than would have that proposal-indee d off-peak seat availability alone is proposed to be twice that total. Most importantly, such seats will be offered to and from all Australian gateways. There is a second aspect of the demand/supply relationship which is very important. Demand for air services varies throughout the year by season and direction of travel and this variation is very significant on certain of our routes. The level of capacity available cannot be varied to a significant degree. Consequently, if air services are obliged to cater for demand throughout the year the level of capacity provided will be dictated by peak demand. The arrangements we propose, which allow all types of services to be met, when combined with control of capacity on the basis of true 'end-to-end' traffic, allow the total cost of accommodating demand for all types of services at all periods of the year to be minimised. Fare structures can be developed that are responsive to market needs and efficient in satisfying demand on a year round basis. In particular, they allow fares to be set in such a way that peak demand is priced to reflect that it is the principal determinant of the capacity levels. This allows aircraft investment decisions to be soundly based and the problems of excess capacity minimised. The latter are, of course, at the heart of unauthorised discount selling of air travel and the arrangements we suggest will go a long way towards reducing its incidence. are specialised to a certain The Government reviewed very carefully whether the arrangements proposed would lead to inefficiencies in the production and distribution of air travel. Within heavily regulated industry this is always a matter of concern. It concluded that it would not, although this will require continued Government interven'ion to ensure that consumer's interests are protected. the public utility character of Carriers will compete on practically all air routes to secure their market share. modest sizes associated with a Air services to and from Australia are not provided in isolation, but exist within a total international environment. Prices on other routes impact upon those to Australia. Development of improved equipment, innovative pricing arrangements, new management procedures, marketing, design and engineering concepts spread quickly throughout the industry. The incentive for this to proceed remains. I propose to ask the Qantas Board to make officers available to meet with officers of my Department to establish whether comparative efficiency measures the Company has already developed to assess its performance against foreign airlines can be extended and the results reported regularly to Government. More critical analysis of fare proposals and service arrangements will be developed within my own Department, and I expect the Bureau of Transport Economics to take an increased interest in research relating to this industry. A further consideration which weighed very heavily with the Government in deciding to propose to other governments the arrangements I have outlined is that they take into account, and respect fully, the bilateral character of international air service arrangements. Such arrangements are directed towards establishing agreement, between Australia and each other country, that the air transport facility shall be directed towards carriage of traffic which is genuinely moving between the two countries. It will permit the airUnes of that carriage and the development of movement of passengers, and hence the enhancement of tourist opportunities The Government believes that many other governments around the world willrespectour proposal. It does not seek to assert any pre-eminent role for the Australian carrier in air service arrangements, although on most routes from Australia, Australian originating traffic predominates. It concedes that the carrier of the other country has an equal interest in the carriage of this traffic. An examination the Government has had undertaken of the effect of the changed arrangements indicates that many countries with which we have air service agreements will benefit from change. The lower fares which we believe are possible will generate large numbers of new travellers, benefiting not only consumers but also the airlines and the tourist industries of each countiy. Carriers can operate in an environment which allows a satisfactoryreturnfor the significant investment made in providing thenservices. In a very few cases the arrangements will impact adversely on the carrier or tourist interests of another country. Any initial loss of tourism revenue to those countries, because of an increased number of passengers moving on a direct 'end-toend' service not stopping over en route, should be offset, within the short to medium term, by generation of additional passengers destined for that countiy. In the main, travellers stay longer at their country of destination than they do during a stop-over and make higher expenditures on the purchase of local goods and services. The Government has been obliged to weigh up the very considerable consumer welfare benefits possible in changed arrangements against a few, initially adverse, effects on other countries. We are confident these can be overcome in the medium to longer term. I ask the House to note that alternative methods of securing lower fares, such as permission for whole charter operauons, apart from adversely affecting the quality of scheduled services and not satisfying the Government's requirements that services should be distributed around Australia, would also disadvantage other countries and their carriers. This would happen without the Government endeavouring to explicidy address the problems that arise or seeking to secure, in consultation with other governments, arrangements for future operauons that took account of mutual interests. The Government envisages that significant cost savings to the carriers are possible under the changed arrangements, apart from the overall economies that will flow from the improved institutional arrangements. I would underUne that the report presented a series of policy options. The Government's decisions do not explicitly adopt any one of these. Obviously, the policy we have adopted is closer to the option described by the Committee as 'operations by designated national carriers alone in a third and fourth freedom market' than it is to others. However, the Government noted the advantages and disadvantages attaching to the different options in the report. It felt that certain of the advantages of different choices could be achieved by adopting the policy I have outlined. Passenger Fares I said earUer that I wished new fare structures to be more readily understood by consumers and that the justification for the level of individual fare types be more readily comprehended. Without in any way prejudicing results of discussions that are about to commence I felt I should indicate to the House some general characteristics of new fare arrangements that we would prefer. each country to concentrate upon Different routes have different travel demand characteristics and it is important that passenger demand preferences be identified and satisfied. Some work on surveying passengers'requirements has already been commenced by my Department and the Bureau of Transport Economics. This will be developed further. We are not averse to the availability of a wide range of fare types but we would want them to be designed in a systematic and efficient way that reflects satisfaction of passenger preferences and as far as possible the associated costs. To the extent possible the basis of fare structures should be rigorously documented. As an illustration, evidence presented to the Committee indicated thatfirstclass travel on some routes appeared to be under-priced. Obviously, where this exists it should be corrected. It is inappropriate that there should be crosssubsidisation of a fare, which provides higher quality of service, from lower priced fares. On some routes travel by persons visiting friends and relatives is a major part of total travel demand. Such travellers have little need for accommodation arrangements attached to their fares and are principally interested in access to lowest individually priced fares. On other routes, holiday excursion travel predominates and group inclusive fares may provide a more appropriate vehicle for ensuring the development of lowest cost travel arrangements. Even in such cases the Government would hope to have lower fare types available for individual travel. Briefly, we want fare types which are responsive to passenger preferences and systematically and efficiently based upon costs. The report notes that such fare structures may be difficult for a consumer to comprehend at first glance. However, the different types of fares can be readily partitioned into smaller groups of fare types, to which most passengers would wish to direct their detailed choice. I propose to ask my Department to consult with the airline and travel industry with a view to developing an improved presentation of fares to consumers and having travel literature explain satisfactorily the conditions that attach to these. New fare structures should, to the extent possible, avoid some of the current unsatisfactory fare construction principles. Pro-ration of fares, for example, an arrangement wherebyrevenueis divided amongst carriers on multi-carrier passenger journeys, leads to significant dilution of revenue on some routes, which, in turn, leads to carriers pressing to maintain fares at artificially high levels. I would make clear, passengers wishing to stop off or transfer at another country to proceed to other destinations will have the facility to do so. But this will be at fares which reflect the higher cost this facility incurs. We shall seek appropriate arrangements with the authorities of other countries to have carriers observe the fares governments have agreed upon and ensure that selling arrangements are not used to subvert these. Considerauon is also being given to further amendment to the Air Navigation Regulations to limit such infringements. Implementation Following an examination of the report by the Government discussions were held with the United Kingdom authorities as the UK is at important overseas air route. These discussions confirmed that, if the changes we proposed are introduced significant fare reductions were possible. However, both Governments recognise that changed arrangements impact upon our air service agreements with other countries and that it would be appropriate for discussions to be held with those countries before any final agreement is reached. The House will be interested to have an indication of the types and levels of fares which the discussions with the UK authorities led us to consider might be developed between the five Australian gateway points and London under changed arrangements. ThefiguresI will quote are for Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. There will be appropriate adjustments for Perth and Darwin. A new fare structure is proposed. A new range of advance purchase fares, both return and one way, would be introduced. The APEF return would be $998 for the peak periods, currently $1,150, shoulder $870 currently $1,050, off peak $568 currently $850. This is close to the level which had been proposed for charters, while still retaining the benefits of scheduled services. The one way APEF fare would be peak $582, shoulder $532, off peak $432 compared to the current economy excursion one way fare of $695 at all times of the year. The advance purchase period would be shortened from the current 90 days to 45 days. There would be no minimum or maximum stay conditions. The economy would be reduced from $1,880 to $1,450 return but without stopover. A new type of fare with different conditions is suggested for introduction between economy and first class fares which would retail at $1,950. First class fares, it appears, should be increased with the exact level to be determined but probably with different service conditions. I must stress these are provisional before the recent fuel price increase and the implementation of these arrangements is subject to the solution of some maining practical problems and to the outcome of negotiations with other countries concerned. However, they lustrate to the House the significant are confident it is possible to achieve under the arrangements we propose. The Government has now authorised negotiations to mence with a number of other governments and these will proceed as quickly as possible. The House will understand that it is impossible for me, ahead of these negotiations, indicate what changed arrangements and fare levels may apply in the future to those countries. Such arrangements and fares demand the concurrence of the governments conto cerned. Nevertheless significant savings in most fare types are believed to be possible under the proposals we will be advancing to those countries. Priority is to be given in the first instance to negotiations with countries along the Australia-UK/Europe route. I shall make a more detailed statement upon the arrangements agreed as soon as I am able. I have instructed my officers to endeavour to reach sufficient agreement to me to make a further announcement before Christmas. I cannot say with certainty at what stage changed arrangements and fares on the various routes will be introduced. I am hopeful at least some of the new fares can be introduced early next year. Related Matters There is a range of related issues which the Government will have to address in the light of discussions and agreement with other governments. Among the more important is whether or not our air service agreements should continue to allow carriers to discuss fares, in thefirstinstance, within the IATA framework. the end of our longest and most Originally, the Government was attracted to the idea of having the Australian carrier withdraw from the LATA traffic conference system. As the House would know the Australian Government has moved increasingly outside the IATA framework in determining fares that apply on many of our international routes. However, IATA is itself re-examining the methods whereby passenger fares and rates between countries are decided and, in particular, a proposal that the carriers of the two countries concerned should have a primary role in deciding the fares to be recommended to their governments for carriage between the two countries. At the same time, such arrangements would allow carriers from other countries who may be affected by these decisions to participate in discussion of the fare levels. There are advantages in proceeding this way, as well as disadvantages. There remains the whole range of IATA resolutions which go to the facilitation and organisation of travel, which are very generally observed around the world. Many are called into the structure of the tariff structures approved for travel to and from Australia. Consumers' ability to move with ease from anywhere in Australia to points throughout the world depend upon this industry framework. The resolutions cover interline and clearing house arrangements, reservation procedures, rules on format of tickets and so on, which have been developed over the years within IATA. They define the produce offered the consumer, provide valuable trade facilitation and considerable consumer protection. The manner in which such arrangements might continue if IATA was no longer supported have not been properly addressed by governments. It should be noted that these industry association arrangements benefit non-IATA members also, which rely upon this framework. only as they were agreed Before taking any decision on this matter the Government rewishes to see what new arrangements IATA itself develops and, importantly, take account of the views of other governdo ilments with which Australia has bilateral air service level of fare reduction we agreements. The arrangements we propose preclude, at this time, significant charter operations running in parallel with schedcomuled services. Indeed, the arrangements we propose are essentially multi-service arrangements. However, the need for true non-scheduled operations will persist. Travel to to off-line points, for example, to permit immigrants to this country from South America to visit their homes on occasions of special significance, such as Christmas, will need be catered for. Single entity charter arrangements should still apply. There should be room for charters to be operated for route development purposes. For the time being, the Government will continue to apply existing policy and I shall address this matter again after we have spoken with other countries. It will be apparent that carrying more passengers per aircraft will have the effects of increasing passenger seating density and, even allowing for significant generation of allow traffic because of lower fares, of reducing frequency. The Government, therefore, proposes to retain considerable interest in the question of passenger comfort. Many of our routes are amongst the longest in the world and standards appropriate to shorter sectors may not be suitable to Australia. However, it must relationship between certain comfort standards, for example, seat width and pitch, and the costs of providing the service, and, hence the fare at which it is available. Proposals discussed with the UK authorities, however, were predicated on retention of standards very standards for the passengers travelling on least expensive fare types. Because total frequency may decline it will be necessary in the short term to allow certain foreign carriers and Qantas to call at more than one Australian gateway on the one flight to ensure that a reasonable frequency from all gateways is retained. Domestic airlines object dilutes their own traffic base and hence their ability to lower fares. However, the Government considers that, as the passenger is travelling principally for the purpose of an international journey, overall public interest is, in general, best served by the arrangement. The crease the number of direct flights between discrete city pairs. These reduce cost to the intemauonal carrier, avoid stops for international passengers and, importantly, reduce demand on ground infrastructure. Freight The Government is yet to take a decision on future arrangements that may apply to the carriage of air freight. Of the options listed within the report the Government is initially attracted to Option D, which provides greater flexibility on the part of Government to vary the charter operators' access to import cargoes and to vary the rules for export cargoes that may be carried by charter operators. However, the Government recognises that operators of combined passenger/cargo services, that is to say, multiservice carriers, would have to be in a position to respond more quickly than they are rangements to the competitive pressures that change would create. If this option is to work, it will be essential that this ability to respond be secured, or freight charter operators would seriously erode the revenue the multi-service carriers can earn. This could prejudice lower fares. It is proposed that further consultauon be held between my Department, designated and charter operators, import and export interests and freight forwarding interests to explore whether criteria can be determined which would allow this regulatory relaxation to be made. This would remove the principal causes for complaint about existing freight arrangements voiced to the committee. Conclusion The report indicates that change will involve the Government considering more frequently problems concerning the economic regulation of the industry. I believe this to be entirely appropriate. Further, will present to ensure that issues affecting consumers and producers of international aviation services are raised and discussed in the Parliament. The Government will, of course, continue to support the work that has commenced within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on this matter. It trusts the report and associated research will contribute to these intergovernmental discussions.",30
87,Mr NIXON,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"The Government has agreed that Australia's overseas air service arrangements should be changed. In making this decision we are cognisant of the very real difficulties that change will involve. We are equally aware, however, that whtie the existing arrangements have allowed the rapid development of inbe realised that there is a direct ternational air services, they are in many ways inefficient. In particular, they are not appropriate to expanding the opportunities for lower cost travel. The report, in fact, confirms there is gross close to existing economy class under-uttiisation of existing capacity of such magnitude as to indicate a serious inefficiency in the present supply of air services. It is the Government's aim to introduce lower fares on our international aviation routes on a completely non-discriminatory basis. In other words, fares to this practice claiming it wtil be avaUable to all members of the public. In addition, appropriate selling arrangements will be established which do not unduly advantage one section of the travel industry as against aim is, as traffic grows, to inanother. In accordance with our determined policy the Government has decided to seek to negotiate changed air service arrangements on an end-toend basis, that is, an exchange of the Third and Fourth Freedoms of the Air. The Government considers that the full economies of serving genuine end-to-end traffic could best be realised by this course. I draw the attention of honourable members to page 6 of the report for an explanation of the Freedoms of the Air. It is our intention that the airlines of each country should supply a full range of different types of air travel, able under current bilateral arthat is, from the lowest possible cost travel, which necessarily will have conditions attached, such as advanced purchase, right through the range to first class, which offers on demand travel the successful introduction of with higher quality of in-flight service. To put it quite simply, the objective of the policy is to get better utilisation of expensive aircraft by filling empty seats. By achieving this, the cost to the airUnes of each passenger carried will be reduced thus enabling a lower range of fares to be offered. There will also be some important side benefits such as the conservation of fuel- a matter of increasing importance-and the more efficient use of airport facUities in the medium to longer term. I welcome the opportunity this As well as reducing fares, the arrangements we are seeking to negotiate will provide reasonable frequency of service at all Australian gateway airports, not merely just at our largest cities. This is a most important point not only to the Australian residents who use Perth, Brisbane and Darwin as their international gateways, but also to the promotion of tourism to Australia and to regional development. The need to retain the international significance of Perth, Brisbane and Darwin was one of the major considerations in our decision not to support at this time the well publicised proposals of a United Kingdom carrier to offer lower fares by what were described as charter type services between Australia and the United Kingdom. There were, of course, other proposals put to the Government advocating alternative methods for providing lower cost travel. None of these proposals, however, individually addressed how fares could be lowered on all routes to and from Australia. They did not address the question of how a reasonable level of service frequency could be continued to be operated to all Australian gateway points. They did not give consideration to how changed arrangements would affect other countries with which Australia has bilateral air service agreements. While the United Kingdom charter operator's proposal was to operate two DC-10 aircraft a week between the United Kingdom, Europe and Sydney, it would not provide any opportunity for visitors to other centres to have access to lower fares to Australia. Nor would it have allowed Austrahans who did not live in Sydney to have the opportunity to use these lower fares. The fares therefore would have been quite discriminatory. More passengers both at Sydney and elsewhere would wish to travel at the lower fares than the number of services could accommodate. In short, there would be gross under supply and a rationing problem created leading to extensive public dissatisfaction. If the Government then simply extended services of this type to meet demand further problems would have arisen. Significant scheduling changes would have been made which would have impacted adversely on service availability and frequency, particularly at the smaller gateways of Brisbane, Perth and Darwin. This would have most adverse affects on business and tourism and for Australian travellers in those centres and the regions they serve. Additionally, these developments would have happened without any regard to our relations with those other countries whose interests would have been affected. The arrangements we propose are expected to offer approximately five times the number of seats at lower fares than would have the UK operator's proposal. Indeed, off-peak seat availability alone is proposed to be twice that total. Most importantly, such seats will be offered to and from all Austrahan gateways. The UK operator argued that the lower fares he was proposing would generate additional traffic. But the Government accepts fully that lower fares will generate additional traffic. In fact, many of the proposals we will be advancing to other countries rest for their economic justification upon significant generation of new traffic. The Government's proposal will allow the full range of different travel requirements to be met within the one air service. This will permit those consumers who are prepared to travel under charter type operations at lower fares to do so. In addition, however, it will provide sufficient capacity for those who wish to travel at short notice or with more flexibility in their travel arrangements. The Government's proposal will permit maintenance of reasonable frequency levels at all airports and, as traffic grows, allow the development of more city-to-city direct service. The new arrangements we have proposed for lower international airfares will provide further stimulus to the travel and tourist industry. They follow a series of initiatives taken by this Government to assist the development of tourism in Australia. I refer, in particular, to extension of the export market development grants scheme and the investment allowance to the tourist industry, establishment of a Travel and Tourist Industry Advisory Council, and a record 37 per cent increase in funds this year for the Australian Tourist Commission which will enable the doubling of its overseas promotional activities. In the light of these developments, growth prospects for the travel and tourist industry are extremely favourable with consequent benefits in terms of increased employment opportunities and foreign exchange earnings. Whilst it is not normal practice to be specific about details of proposals under negotiation, I am compelled to be on this occasion. There has been a great deal of Press speculation and some criticism concerning the Government's endeavours to reduce air fares wherever possible on our international routes. This has had its effects on the travel industry. It has also affected public confidence and led to consumer difficulty in planning future travel arrangements. In order to put at rest this Press speculation and to overcome some of the uncertainty it has caused in the travel industry and within the Austrahan community, I have agreed, in consultations with the British Government, to outhne today the indicative fare levels I am hopeful of achieving on the United Kingdom-Australia route. I make the point that the fares I am about to outline are indicative only. There is no firm agreement on this matter between the British Government and the Australian Government. The fare levels proposed could alter depending upon circumstances such as prevailing currency rates of exchange, world fuel pricing policy and the details of the final agreements negotiated. The new fare structure proposed will provide a new range of advance purchase fares, both return and one way. The advance purchase excursion fare return would be $998 for the peak periods. Currendy is it $ 1,150. The shoulder fare would be $870. Currently it is $1,050. The off peak fare would be $568. Currently it is $850. These fares are close to those which had been proposed for charters while still retaining the benefits of scheduled services. The one way APEF fare would be: Peak, $582; shoulder, $532; and off peak, $432. This is compared to the current economy excursion one way fare of $695 at all times of the year. The advance purchase period would be shortened from the current 90 days to 45 days. There would be no minimum or maximum stay conditions. Importantly, the economy fare would be reduced from $1,880 to $ 1,450 return but without a stop-over. A new type of fare with different conditions suggested for introduction between economy and first class fares which would retail at $1,950. First class fares, it appears, should be increased with the exact level to be determined but probably with different service conditions. The figures I have just quoted are for direct services from Airlines. Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane to London. Appropriate adjustments are proposed for Darwin and Perth. I must stress again these are proing visional only as no final agreement has been reached with the United Kingdom Government. believes They do illustrate to the House, however, the nificant level of fare reduction we are confident is possible to achieve under the changed arrangeAustralian ments we propose. The Government has now authorised negotiations to commence with number of other governments and these will prothe ceed as quickly as possible. The House will understand that it is impossible for me, ahead these negotiations, to indicate what changed rangements and fare levels may apply in the spur. future to those countries. Nevertheless significant savings in most fare types are believed to be possible under the proposals we will be advancargue ing to those countries. Priority is to be given in the first instance to negotiations with countries along the Australia-United Kingdom route. I shall make a more detailed statement upon the arrangements agreed as soon as I am able. have instructed my officers to endeavour to reach sufficient agreement to allow me to make a further announcement before Christmas. I am hopeful at least some of the new fares can introduced early next year. The level of fares and fare types between Austraha and any other country require approval of both the Austrahan and at least the government of the other country. I stress that changes cannot be made unilaterally. What the Government is proposing is a radical change in the structure of our air service arrangements. We beheve, however, that these will be generally acceptable to many other governments. They respect fully the bilateral character of air service arrangements. The Government has agreed on the approach the Australian delegations will take in negotiating changed arrangements with other countries. I repeat that priority is to be given in thefirstinstance to negotiating these changed arrangements with countries along the kangaroo route. Negotiations with other countries will commence as soon as practicable. The speculation that we propose to terminate the operations of some European carriers now flying to Austraha is not true. The Government has considered proposals that can be discussed is with governments in Europe aimed at maintaining the operations of those carriers. We would, however, expect that our policy objective could be achieved and lower fares introduced. Mr Jull-Including KLM Royal Dutch",36
88,Mr NIXON,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"Including KLM. The new arrangements we will seek are aimed at maintainthe right of Australia to participate equally in our international air services. The Government Qantas is a relatively efficient carrier. sigWe propose to maintain the long standing poticy it that Qantas shall remain the sole designated airline to operate services allowed an Australian carrier under our air service agreea ments. The Government will, however, review position in 1981 to determine whether or not our overseas air travel markets have grown of sufficiently to allow the possible designation of aranother airline to provide a further competitive I make the point in answer to those who will that those proposals will create a monopoly situation that this is not the case. Nor is it a simple duopoly. Passengers wanting a wider choice of airlines to many destinations can do so but at higher cost and a change of aircraft. For the many who want direct services there will be I initially a choice between two competing carriers at least, and possibly more later. If whole plane load charters had operated on a regular basis almost certainly the same limitation of choice be would have appUed because of our small market size. International air services to Australia do not exist separately. Change and pricing on many routes affect pricing on our routes. Allegations that the Government is unduly protective to Qantas are simply not true. What the Australian Government is doing is protecting Australia's rights to participate in international air services. It would indeed be foUy to leave arrangements solely in the hands of overseas operators. Whilst the Government has not taken a firm decision on pohcy in respect to future freight arrangements, we are attracted to the idea of changed regulatory practices aimed at removing the principal complaints voiced to the review committee. I have directed that consultation on how these changes might be introduced between my Department and those interests affected take place. Finally I impress upon the House that there is no short cut to introducing lower fare types that will be avaUable universally and which will be capable .of being sustained. It is essential in a country the size of ours that the needs of all classes of travellers all over the Commonwealth be met as competely as possible. This is a most important pohcy consideration. It is important both to Australians wishing to travel and to Australia's own tourist industry. Within the constraints imposed by the very real difficulties involved in achieving change the foregoing outlines what the Government is seeking to achieve. I commend to all honourable members the report of the review committee and the accompanying documents I have just tabled. In their consideration of the proposals I have outlined I urge honourable members to consider the real benefits which can flow to Australia and to the people of this nation from the successful development of the new fare arrangements. I present the following paper: International Aviation Policy-Ministeria l Statement, October 1978. Motion (by Mr Groom) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",38
89,Mr MORRIS,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"The statestatements ment by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) and the tabUng of the international civU aviation poUcy review comes on the first anniversary of the announcement that that review would be conducted. I have had barely two hours to examto ine the Minister's statement, the report and attachments, which in total number some 754 proval pages. The report contains a series of options. some of them the Government appears to have given support, and others it has rejected. It unclear from the Minister's statement which is which. I invite the House first to recall the manthing new. ner in which the review has been conducted and the Government's performance in relation to international aviation poUcy. The Government, in term. its handling of the cheaper air fares issue, has achieved, I beheve, a previously unsurpassed record for ineptness, irresponsibility and obsessional secrecy. It has faUed to consider in an open and frank way the interest of mUlions of Australians in overseas travel. Twelve months ago, when the Mmister announced the review, the Opposition responded that the review should be by way of a public inquiry in which the needs and wants of air travellers could be canvassed and the claims and counterclaims of competitive airline operators could be tested and evaluated. The Minister for Transport in his usual style replied: What the public will be able to evaluate is what conclusions the Government comes to, and that is the important thing. That is where the Opposition and the Government are in stark contrast. We believe that there is a role for consumer participation in aviation; that there has to be an end to the private club of the bureaucracy and the industry getting together and telling the people what they are to pay and what service they are to get. In other words, the Australian people would be gratuitously afforded the opportunity to view the verdict but not the evidence. That is what the Minister has done today. The public has been given the opportunity to view the verdict but not to view the evidence which was submitted. So instead of having a frank, responsible and informed public discussion on the air travel needs of Australians we have witnessed a succession of contrived, competitive leaks which have served to create confusion in the public mind, which have caused the public to defer travel and to have unsupported expectations of 11 cheaper air fares, and which have caused considerable difficulty for the Australian tourist industry. The Minister was a direct contributor to the raised expectations because of the regular he made that he was sympathetic to Sir Freddie Laker's proposals. He virtually invited Sir Freddie Laker to submit a firm proposal. However, the fact is that the Minister was well aware that before Laker Airways could fly Australia it must first receive approval from its the United Kingdom Government. That aphad not been obtained. In short, for a year To the Australian public has been fobbed off, misinformed and deceived. The Minister's longis awaited statement can best be described as a false pregnancy, because it does not tell us any",39
90,Mr BAILLIEU,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,'Phanto m pregnancy' is the,39
91,Mr MORRIS,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"I do not think the Minister would like the term 'phantom pregnancy'. Let us call it a false pregnancy. Everything the Minister has said today we have read in the newspapers during the last eight to nine months, but some of it was more accurately reported in the newspapers than it has been presented today. The report does not set any firm dates for the introduction of cheap air fares. It contains no firm decisions and it leaves many questions unanswered. From this side of the chamber I want to emphasise the view that I have expressed for a year on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. That view is that we believe that there is substantial room for reducing international and domestic air fares, that there should be a frank and public discussion of the whole subject of the aviation industry, including the needs and wants of air travel consumers, that there should be a discontinuation of the private club of the aviation industry and bureaucracy deciding what is good for air travellers, and that there has to be consumer participation in the decision-making process within the aviation industry. We reject utterly the high air fare policies of the present Government which has brought forward this long overdue report. In the time remaining to me I want to turn to the Minister's speech. He referred to the Govern the ment deciding to negotiate changed arrangements on an end to end basis-thir d and fourth freedoms of the air. Later in his speech he stated that it was untrue that the Government ments proposed to exclude any airlines from What he does not say is that the most likely result of the negotiations in relation to these third fourth freedoms on an end to end basis will be that the airlines that he mentioned-the y have been mentioned recently-wil l withdraw from Australia. So the effect will be the same: They will not be excluded but they will be squeezed out by the new conditions. The Minister went on to say in his statement: It is our intention that the airlines of each countiy supply . . . the lowest possible cost travel . . . We do not take issue with the scale of fares he has announced. I think that they will provide an opportunity for many thousands of Ausinterests tralians to see their relatives abroad, to re-join their families. But the Minister went on to say: . . . the objective of the policy is to get better of expensive aircraft by filling empty seats. We are right back to square one. The basic equation of airline operation is that more bodies and more seats mean lower air fares for all travellers. But the Minister only a few weeks ago presented himself to a transport conference as the champion of free enterprise. I would have thought that somewhere in the report or in his comments there would have been reference to the ability of competition to produce efficiency. In effect, what the Minister has said is that competition is out; it is inefficient. He says that the only way in which to get efficiency is by total regulation, by third and fourth freedoms negotiations, in spite of the comments he made a few weeks ago about free enterprise. The Minister's statement goes on to refer to 'all Australian gateway airports'. But he does not say anything about the recent increase in domestic air fares, a matter about which he has remained silent for some weeks now. The recent increase in domestic air fares has direct relevance to this statement and to the pohcies which the Minister has sought to enunciate, because one of the main factors in the minds of people proposing to come to Australia is how much it will cost them to travel within Australia when they get here. We cannot look at international air fares in isolation. They are inseparably linked to the cost structure of the domestic aviation industry. If the Government is genuine in wanting to help and to expand the Australian tourist industry it must accept the relevance of that point. In referring to proponents of other proposals the Minister air service later in his statement said: They did not give consideration to how changed arrangewould affect other countries with which Australia has Austraha. bilateral air service agreements. and The fact is that whatever proposals are put forward by other countries, they first must receive the approval-the y have to receive it at some stage anyway-of the government of the country of origin for the proposals which they seek to negotiate. So it is not an argument to say that we cannot consider their proposals or that they have not thought about how such proposals will affect other countries. They must first get the approval should of the government of the country of origin. The Minister later in his statement referred to the sigthat nificant scheduling changes which would have impacted adversely on service availability. In the of the public I would Uke the Minister at some later stage to expand on that statement, because nowhere in his statement, from what I have read of it so far, is there any indication of utilisation the likely changed frequency of scheduling of services. Mr Nixon-You need to read the report. Mr MORRIS As the Minister points out, I have not had an opportunity to read all of the report, but I have not seen any information in this regard. I hope that he will expand at some stage on the alteration to the frequency of scheduled services. The Minister then went on to say: . . . these developments would have happened without any regard to our relations with those other countries whose interests would have been anected. I referred earlier to the fact that other countries have to have the stamp of approval of the country of origin. The Minister then went on to say: The Government's proposal will permit maintenance of reasonable frequency levels at all airports; and . . . allow the development of more city to city direct service. The question which is immediately raised is: To which cities is the Minister referring? Does he mean that there will be more services to Perth and Brisbane? Does he mean that more gateway cities into Australia will be established? Does he mean that there will be more services of international aircraft operating within Australia. Those points, I believe, are important to the Australian tourist industry and the Australian economy. Again I ask that at some stage the Minister elaborate on these matters for the information of the Australian public, if they are not stressed in the detail of the report. The Minister went on to say in his statement: The new arrangements we have proposed for lower international air fares will provide further stimulus to the travel and tourist industry. He went on to refer to the record 37 per cent increase in funds this year for the Austrahan Tourist Commission. What the Minister is doing is taking the future and putting it in the past. The 37 per cent increase in funds this year for the Australian Tourist Commission has only just been announced. It did not have any effect on the tourist industry in the past year. But what has had an effect on the Australian tourist industry has been a 27 per cent cumulative increase in domestic air fares in this country in just over two years. That has had a retardant effect on the Australian tourist industry. What else has had an effect has been the fuelling and the promotion by government departments of leaks of the contents of this report. It is quite clear that over recent months one department has been leaking information contained in the report in an effort to get its point of view across and in an effort to damage maybe what the Department of Transport was trying to do, maybe what the Minister was trying to do, or maybe what a competitor airline was trying to do. All of that could have been avoided if the inquiry had been made public, if the airlines had been called before the inquiry to substantiate their claims. I see that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) is in the chamber. He is the Chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism. Many of the airlines which made submissions to the review committee made submissions to the Committee on Tourism. They were able to appear in public before that Committee. They were able to put their case. The same process should have been followed in respect of this review. Later in his statement the Minister sought to give the impression that some special favour is being granted to the Australian public by the making of this announcement today. The Minister stated: . . . I have agreed, in consultations with the British Government, to outline today the indicative fare levels I am hopeful of achieving on the United Kingdom-Australia route. Let us look at the difference in the way in which the United Kingdom deals with its residents and the way in which we are dealt with by this Government. The statement which the Minister made has been presented to the Parliament in such a way that its contents are apparently to be regarded as a favour or some special dispensation to the public. The Minister is coming clean. Let me turn to the United Kingdom Daily Telegraph of 9 August, the day after the negotiations took place between senior officers of the British Government and officers of the Austrahan Department of Transport. I will read two sentences from that newspaper: A spokesman for the Department of Trade whose senior officials last week concluded a further round of talks with the Australian opposite numbers in Canberra said that the two governments had reached a broad measure of agreement about reducing the return air fare to $570. That is a $2 difference. That is how the matter has been dealt with in the United Kingdom. Frankly, it has been handled in a much more open way than it has been dealt with here. So the Minister is not giving anything away at all in announcing the fare schedule today. The other point on page 7 that I would like to raise with the Minister is that he referred to the economy air fare being reduced from $1,880 to $1,450 without stopover. No mention is made of the penalty to be incurred for a stopover. On page 8 he refers to the priority being given to the Kangaroo route to London. Mr Nixon-It has to be negotiated. You know that.",40
92,Mr MORRIS,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"On page 8 the Minister refers to the preference for the Kangaroo route to London. No reference is made to the Pacific. On page 9 he goes on to make a more detailed statement. I hope it will not be on the second anniversary, this is the first anniversary. He goes on: T am hopeful some of the new fares can be introduced early next year'. December this year is the peak season and most of the airlines will be almost sold out or well on the way to being sold out of seats at this stage for December. As I recall it, January is the peak season for traffic coming from London to Australia. April, May and June are peak months so we are going to look at some time post high season. Is it to be March or April or is it to be after the high season when the airlines can get all the business they want anyway? In my mind there is a grave doubt that we are going into April, May or June rather thing like February or March, as the Minister is trying to indicate. Then he says on page 10 the speculation that it is to be proposed to minate the operation of some European flying to Australia is not true. I outlined what was proposed in respect of KLM. It is quite clear from the negotiations that have occurred to date that what is going to happen is and UTA will be squeezed out of the new end to end arrangements. At the same time the GovernMinister. ment is trying to negotiate better trading terms with the European Economic Community and UTA happens to be the airline of France, a prinof cipal in the EEC. Likewise with Holland and KLM. If we turn to the ASEAN situation we the have the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr paragraph: Peacock) saying in Perth only a fortnight ago that Australia's relationships and influences are being judged more directly by the countries the region in terms of our capacity to contribute to economic co-operation. Clearly negotiations with countries between London and Australia are very much linked up with foreign policy. It could well be that foreign policy in respect of other activities will be important than where we rate in aviation prioridealing ties with those countries. Yet in the repon the Minister's statement today scant mention has been made of the very serious imphcations inthought volved there. With the EEC we had a trade last year of $4,518m, with ASEAN countries things $1,410m. Both those areas will determine relationships with Australia more on economic co-operation and trade than on airlines alone. I refer the Minister to page 262 of Volume I of the partment report. It states that most air service agreements can be terminated only with 12 months notice. would have thought that the Minister would could have mentioned that in his speech.",41
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"Mr MILLAR - the Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Morris- I seek an extension to speak for the appropriate time. Mr Hodges- I move: That the debate be now adjourned. Mr Morris-On a point of order, an arrangement was made that I would be allowed to speak for the sametimethat the Minister took in making his statement.",42
94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"That arrangement is no immediate concern of the Chair. There is not a motion before the House. Mr Morris- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, could I put the request for an extension of than sometime through you to the Minister? Mr Nixon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that that the honourable member for Shortland be alterlowed to proceed under whatever is the approcarriers priate rule of the House. Motion (by Mr Scholes) agreed to: That the honourable member for Shortland be granted an that JAT, KLM extension of time.",42
95,Mr MORRIS,FOR INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES,"I thank the House and the On page 262 of Volume I of the report it states that most air service agreements can be terminated only with 12 months notice. Because the importance of that sentence I would have thought that it would have been mentioned in Minister's speech. It goes on to say in that The Governments of those countries would make strong representauves and may use other political or economic of means to express their dissatisfaction. I mention this in relation to ASEAN and to the EEC. It is quite clear from statements made and visits to Australia recently that there will be further actions if what I believe is going to happen in respect of the Government's policy on this issue does take place. There will be retaliation. more The report goes on at paragraph 9.2.4, when with full economies, to say that full and in economies may not be reflected in fare reductions for up to 2 years. Again, I would have that this would have been spelt out in a more detailed way, a more specific way to put in their proper perspective. Later in paratheir graph 9.2.5 these words appear: The committee has not discussed this aspect with the Deof Employment and Industrial Relations as the incidence and spread of staff reductions cannot be determined precisely ahead of a government decision. I The reference there was to the fact that there be staff dismissals with the implementation of a change in pohcy. Again I want to emphasise fact that it appears to the Opposition in this matter that the relevant departments which should have been deeply involved right from the very beginning have not been involved, namely, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Depanment of Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister nods his head. However, there has not been any evidence to date of direct foreign policy involvement. The Minister himself stated on 2 October: 'There have been no consultations with the ASEAN nations.' I accept his statement. If it is not conect then he has told a mistruth but they are his words. Let us compare that with the United Kingdom and with the United States of America. In the case of the USA on issues such as this, senior officials of the State Depanment must be present at discussions. In the United Kingdom officials of the Foreign Office must be present. Here we have this report and it is quite obvious that there has not been top level representation from the Department of Foreign Affairs when these discussions have taken place. I turn to page 264 of the report and the concluding comments: The Committee believes the Government should consider whether any policy change should not be subject to review within a period of, say, no more than live years. Again I want to pin point the Minister's failure grasp the complexity and magnitude of the changes in aviation pohcy. When he announced this review his words were: 'The pohcy the report recommends will determine the Government's pohcy for the next 20 years.' It was only 15 years out because the report says: 'We must look at again in five years and Qantas must be looked again within three years.' Here again is a failure to understand and to grasp what is my concluding minutes I turn to the Pacific scene. I think it is a pity from Australia's viewpoint that the approach of the Government has been attempt to browbeat American airlines agreeing to what this Government wants to implement across the Pacific. I would have preferred to see some kind of conciliatory approach, some form of getting together. I happened to be in America when some of the statements were made in Australia and they did not fool anybody. Just Uke the peanut and the pumpkin, it does not have any effect. It might be good copy back in Australia but it does nothing to enhance Australia's stature abroad with that kind of proach. If we are serious in stating that United States offers a major potential source tourist traffic to Australia and that we are looking to the United States to see people come in large numbers to this country to develop our tourist dustry, it is a funny way to go about winning them to Australia. Let me say in respect of what has happened on the regulatory scene in America to effects of the new approach of introducing a little bit of competition-no t too much, just prizing open the door in a free enterprise country and letting in some competition in the aviation scene-the results have been tremendous. It is quite inaccurate-as has been stated here in Australia-that it has been a faUure. It has been a resounding success. There has been an increase of about 30 per cent in traffic across the Atlantic and an enormous increase in domestic air travel within the United States. It is sheer mischievousness to tell people in this country that lower air fares in the United States and a less regulatory approach there have been a failure. The opposite is the truth. When the Minister is negotiating with the United States on a nation-to-nation basis, the Opposition would like him to put forward a more responsible, conciliatory and informative approach to the negotiations. We want to see more tourists in Australia. We want to see a maximisation of the traffic. The days in the aviation industry offixingthe capacity first and forcing a market to fit the capacity have gone. We should be to about expanding the market and then looking at a review of the capacity. In conclusion, I remind the Government that civil aviation was invented for the benefit of people, not for the benefit of governments. I am confident that the people of this country will be properly dissatisfied with the it report that has been presented today. They will at view it as a catalogue of reasons why cheaper international air fares will not be available in the involved. In reasonably near future. Mr Hodges- I apologise to the honourable to member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I thought into that he had had equaltime.I move: That the debate be now adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. GOVERNMENT'S OVERSEAS NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",42
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BORROWING PROGRAM," Mr Speaker has received letters from both the aphonourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) the and the honourable member for St George (Mr for Neil) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order in107, Mr Speaker has selected one matter, that is that proposed by the honourable member for Adelaide, namely: The Fraser Government's failure to justify its vast overdate about the seas borrowing program. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",43
97,Mr HURFORD,BORROWING PROGRAM,"Our country's economy is drifting deeper and deeper into depression. The conservatives who rule us, namely, those members of the Liberal and National Country parties who sit opposite, have not got the answers to the grave economic problems which face our country. Their pohcies are wrong. As every day goes by those pohcies are seen more clearly to be wrong. The magnificent vote for Labor last Saturday in New South Wales shows that the Austrahan people now realise increasingly that the conservatives' economic pohcies are wrong. The time is overdue for the policies to be changed or for the Fraser Government to resign. The time of lying to the people about the reaUties of our economy must cease. This Parliament is the forum in our country where all the issues of concern to the Austrahan people must be raised without fear. I raise without apology the sensitive issues of Australia's reserves, Australia's balance of payments, on which we had a report today from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia's balance of trade on which we had a report yesterday, and Australia's overseas borrowing, on which we had a statement last Friday from the Treasurer (Mr Howard), whom I am glad to see in the House. The Labor Opposition in this national Parliament would be neglecting its duty if it did not probe the Fraser Government on this vital area of national policy making. The Australian people are not concerned only about unemployment. Labor has at last flushed out the Government on that grave issue. Some of our opponents at last are facing the truth on that issue because of the work we have done in flushing them out. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has come clean on the true facts about that issue. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been forced similarly to come clean on that issue, if only half-hearted way. But that is not the only issue relation to the Australian economy. The Australian people are also gravely concerned about our reserves. Are we paying our way as a nation? That is a question that legitimately should be asked. Why is there the need for these vast borrowings overseas? It istimethe Fraser Government wasflushedout and forced to come clean on that issue too. Why is it that these same people who made such an issue of overseas borrowings at the time of the Whitlam Government are seen so clearly to be indulging in those practices which they criticised so severely just three years ago? That is one of the serious questions being asked today by so many of the Australian people. Could it be because they were lying to the Australian people at the time of the so-called loans affair? The evidence points to that. Did they mislead the Austrahan people then? Or is it because circumstances have changed? Is it because their poUcies have led to a worsening of our balance of trade? Are we now importing more than we are exporting? Has their policy of devaluation two years ago been a disaster? Are we paying out too much on invisibles-freight , insurance and so on? Have the conservatives who rule us no policy in this area to save us from making these large invisible payments month after month? Is this why our reserves have been dropping? Is this why we have had to embark on this borrowing program, the latest announcement being made by the Treasurer only last Friday? Or is the crisis due to the Fraser Government-promoted stagnation in another way? Because our level of economic activity is so low, does this mean that overseas investors have no confidence in us? There is no capital coming in for real income and job producing programs. Traditionally we have covered our adverse balance of payments in this way. We are no longer able to do so because of the Fraser Government-promoted lack of confidence, not only in this country but also on the part of those who would properly invest in this country. We have no inflow of overseas capital. Is that the problem? Or is it a combination of all the factors raised in the questions I have just put to the House? We of the Labor Opposition have our answers to those questions, and I will indicate some of the answers as the debate progresses. But our important function today is to flush out from the Government the answers to these grave questions. It is the Liberal and National Country party members, or in particular the Fraser in a Government Ministers, who must be put on the in spot, who must face the facts and face the truth. For it is only when we force them to face reality, or to resign, that we shall achieve the necessary change to correct policies for our country. In other words, until we as a nation face reaUty, or in particular until the Government faces reality, we shall not adopt correct economic policies or any other policies. Let us have a httle realism from the Government today in this debate on our overseas position. Will the Treasurer come clean on this issue, as we forced the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to come clean on the issue of unemployment? For the sake of our nation, will the Treasurer please come clean in this debate today? Here are some of the facts which have prompted this debate. Yesterday the Australian Bureau of Statistics issued the latest figures on our balance of trade. Exports and imports were both covered. The results for the month of September were the worse for many years. The results for the quarter ended September were the worse for well over four years, namely, since the height of the international recession. Let me highlight how serious the situation is by quoting a few figures. For the quarter ended September 1977 there was a surplus of $276m; for the quarter ended December 1977, a surplus of $402m; for the quarter ended March 1978, a surplus of $27lm; and for the quarter ended June 1978, a surplus of $104m. Those figures related only to the balance of trade. I am not taking into account the very serious invisibles figure. However, in spite of this surplus of trade for the quarters I have mentioned, we find that in the September 1978 quarter, the results for which were announced yesterday, there was a deficit of $4m on the balance of trade alone. For the month of September the deficit alone was $72m. In the Budget Papers we learned that the Government was expecting a current account deficit of $3,000m for the 1977-78 financial The noted merchant bankers and international economic commentators, Hill Samuel Australia Ltd, are now predicting that Australia's account deficit will be closer to $4,000m than $3,000m in the current financial year. A second fact that must be faced is that, in spite of overseas borrowings, our reserves have run down in the last four weeks by an amount approximating Parliament? $200m. Is that reaUstic? A headline in one newspaper states: 'Dogs barking as Fraser ponders'. The gold and foreign exchange regive serves have taken such a pounding that they below the crucial $3,000m mark. The figures show that at the close of business last Wednesings day reserves stood at $2,986.8m, which is $66.5m less than the figure the Wednesday belating fore. But this amount includes a $35m boost from the month's revaluation of gold so that underlying change just for that week ending Wednesday was a drop of $101.5m. This drop follows falls of $70m and $92m in the previous two weeks. That means that there have been only two weeks since the end of April when there has been an increase in the underlying change in holdings. I have taken this information from against newspapers and government releases. that no one is going to make the charge in this debate or at any othertimeor will suggest in any way that it is not the proper function of the Opposition toflushout these facts and to seek from responsible Ministers a reaction to these sorts of facts that are being published in newspapers and are being canvassed round the country generally. The balance of payments figures that I mentioned earlier were released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They paint a similarly gloomy picture-a n adverse balance of $85m for September and of $205m for the three months ended September 1978. The greatest tragedy of those figures, month after month, quarter after quarter, is the net figure for invisibles-freigh t insurance and so on. I would like to hear from the Government as to what it intends to do about this large pay-out. What is its policy to ensure that this country is not drained more and more by these invisible figures? A third part of this problem which has to be faced is contained in the Treasurer's statement of last Friday about borrowings. Over and above the $2.5 bUUon-that is, $2,500m-which the Fraser Government has already borrowed since it took office, it is now borrowing a further $600m from the Japanese. What is the explanation to justify the borrowing of such a vast sum? We have not heard one in this House. A year. proper explanation has not been given in any Press release that I have seen. At the same time. I ask: What is the explanation for the haste surcurrent rounding that announcement? What is the reason for the premature announcement before the terms and conditions of the loan had been finalised? Is this an indication of concern? If so, should we not learn about that concern in this To highlight the vast extent of these overseas borrowings by the Fraser Government, let me some more salient facts. Lastfinancialyear are the Fraser Government borrowed $ 1,750m overseas. So far this year it has announced borrowworth over $ 1,000m. The announcement reto the Japanese loans is only the latest of a long line of borrowings. Total government borrowings overseas has now reached the level the where the Government owes foreign financiers $280 for each man, woman and child in this country, compared with only $90 a head when the Fraser Government took over in November 1975. That does not include the proposed $600m Japanese loans. If we take them into considerthe ation, for each man, woman and child in this country, we are going to be owing $320 as the $90 at the time the Fraser GovernI hope ment came to office.",44
98,Mr HOWARD,BORROWING PROGRAM,Did you say $320?,46
99,Mr HURFORD,BORROWING PROGRAM,"Yes, $320 as against $90.1 again ask: What is the reason for this extraordinary state of affairs? How do we reconcile this situation with-this is just one example-the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the AM program after the devaluation in November 1976. The Prime Minister said: Is there a man here who would say they would sooner Australia into hock to the tune of $ 1,000m rather than devalue? This was said by the man who proposes to put into hock to the tune of $3,000m before this year is out. On top of putting us into hock to this extent, he has devalued the currency. Those words were said by the man who so cynically made such a thing of the 'loans affair'. At the negotiations that were conducted in stance were for the purpose of developing this great country and of"" keeping its ownership in placed Austrahan hands. To date there is no such purexternal pose to be seen in relation to the Fraser Governextent ment's proposed borrowings of $3,000m. All the Prime Minister is doing is shoring up the serves, which have been plummeting wards because of his Government's inept formance, its gross economic mismanagement. Is the latest premature borrowings announceject ment to stop speculation? If so, let us hear facts. On the This Day Tonight program on 2 December 1976 the Prime Minister, when justifying the then devaluation pohcy, said: Now nobody could guarantee that borrowing $ 1,000m would stop the speculation. What has changed? Are we ricocheting from one shoot from the hip policy to another? That is genuine and legitimate question. The fourth set of facts which must be faced lates to the repayment of these vast loans. Under a Labor government there would be some public expansion, some development, so that the the necessary funds would be generated for repayprogram. ments. Under the conservatives, we have stagable nation. The repayments and the interest on debt are going to be a substantial drain on future Budgets. By 1981-82 repayments of rowings amounting to $53 lm will have to be made and interest payments will require at least $250m a year. If we have any more devaluations of the Austrahan dollar compared with the borrowed currencies, the position will be even worse. The amounts needed to meet these debts will be increased. These enormous costs add up to another reason why the Treasurer is duty bound to tell the Australian people, through this House, why this is being done. We give him that opportunity in this debate on this matter of pubhc importance. The nation is entitled to know whether the Government expects an improvement in our balance of payments situation in the near future and, if so, by what amount. If an improvement is expected, what will cause the turn-around? I have aheady shown that the Hill Samuel organput isation expects the opposite, namely, a worsening of the situation. The Labor Opposition believes that there will be a turn-around in the present deus pression prognosis only if there is a change in pohcy. We are not the only people who are concerned about this matter. On my desk yesterday was a copy of Canberra Comments, a pubUcation of the Australian Chamber of Commerce. I quote least from that document. Under the heading 'Balthat inance of Payment', the document states: In the Chamber's opinion too much reliance was being on a revival of foreign investment to help balance our accounts. In the meantime there was a limit to the that the balance of payments could be underpinned by official borrowings. reThere we have one of the Government's great downsupporters-the Australian Chamber of perCommerce-makin g the same point that I am making in this debate and in so doing I am giving the Treasurer the opportunity to respond. We rethe present stagnation economic pohcy. We the believe that the country requires an expansionary poUcy. We want to stop the present drift.",46
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BORROWING PROGRAM,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
101,Mr HOWARD,BORROWING PROGRAM,"There are few subjects which require such sensitive and non-rhetorical treatment as those involving the international credit of this country reand the operation of this country's external economic policy, as this subject does. This matter of importance is about the aUeged faUure of Government to justify its overseas borrowing I thought it interesting that the honourmember for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) canthis vassed our borrowing program almost as an afterthought, doing so about two-thirds of the existing borway through his speech. If one were listening to a debate on this subject for the first time, one could be forgiven for believing that the Opposition had just discovered that it is part of the poUcy of this Government to borrow substantial amounts overseas on oflicial account. There is nothing new about this policy. This policy has been in place. It has been stated publicly as being in place. It has been frequently referred to and frequently reaffirmed by spokesmen for this Government over a period of about 18 months. I take the honourable member for Adelaide back to a statement that was made by my predecessor, the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Lynch), on 25 August 1977 when he announced an on-going borrowing program by the Government and to a statement made on 27 September 1977 by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer in which he announced borrowings of about $850m over and above that on-going borrowing program. On 5 February this year I issued a detailed statement on Australia's external economic position. The statement read: The Treasurer said that he wanted to make it quite clear that, should any additional supplementation of Australia's international reserves be required in support of the Australian dollar, the Government would not hesitate to take substantial further borrowings over and above this planned program. Through the latter half of 1977-78, as the honourable member for Adelaide well knows, this Government continued to borrow significant sums on official account. So the first thing would say to the House is that there is nothing new about the fact that this Government is bordifferential rowing substantial sums on official account to supplement our reserves. Suggestion that the position has flushed out and discovered thing that we have been concealing from the Australian people makes me think that it is Van Winkle from Adelaide who has been comthe pletely obUvious to what has been happening the conduct of this country's external economic policies over the past 18 months. We have made no secret of the fact that, given current economic circumstances and pending the resumption of higher levels of private capital inflow, it entirely appropriate that this Government should borrow significant amounts on official account. The fact that we are able to borrow these amounts should be, in one respect anyway, a matter of some satisfaction. It indicates the enormous respect in which the Australian Government and this country are held. It indiobjectives cates, I suggest, the respect that the pohcies which are being pursued at the present time this Government are attracting. The credit worthiness of this country in international institutions ought to be a matter of satisfaction and not a matter of carping whingeing criticism. As a second proposition I say to the House not only is there no secret-and there has not been any secret for the past 18 months-that part of our pohcy to borrow significant amounts overseas, but it is an indication of the intercurred national credit worthiness of Australia, and it something which is wholly consistent with the economic circumstances of Australia at the present time. It is something that we believe is to the benefit of the Australian economy in the present circumstances. Nobody denies, as indeed the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out, that we live in a very difficult trading world. I tltink he recognises that, as the Opposition spokesman on trade matters. It is something that my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has referred to frequently. We do live in difficult international trading circumstances. One of the great problems of this country remains our lack of international competitiveness. I do not think the honourable member for Adelaide wants me to remind him too frequently of what our lack of international competitiveness underis all about. It is aU about the fact that the domestic cost structure of this country is still far too high. The principal reason it is far too high is that a few years ago we started to pay ourselves more money than in effect our productivity justified, and we are stUl suffering the consequences. If the I honourable member wants to know the real reason we do not have a more comfortable between imports and exports then I would put to him that it is the cumulative effect Opof the way in which our international competisometiveness has declined. The adjustment is a slow process and the Rip adjustment process is further compounded by general sluggishness of world trade, a slugin gishness which, on aU the indications, is not going to disappear quickly. The situation is going to improve slowly and in the meantime there is a strong imperative on this Government to do what it can not just to equal the economic and is trading performance of our partners with which comparisons legitimately can be made but to try to out-perform our trading partners, to have a tougher and more competitive domestic economy, to be more successful in reducing our domestic cost structure and to be more successful in reducing our rate of inflation. Those are the to which our economic policies are directed. But in the meantime it is necessary for by us to have appropriate external economic policies-externa l policies that recognise the money difficulties of the world trading scene. This country for many years has been a net importer of capital, as the honourable member for that Adelaide knows. There is nothing new about the fact that the Government of this country borrows it is money overseas on official account to supplement our reserves.lt is something that has ocnot just in the last 18 months; it is someis thing that governments from time to time have done. I would just Uke to put a few facts on the table about the size and scope of those borrowings because the honourable member for Adelaide mentioned $324 as being the per person debt after the completion of the latest yen package. That figure is correct. I do not dispute thatfigurebut I put it in context. I point out to the honourable member that after the present package of yen borrowings has been completed the Commonwealth's external debt wiU amount to about 5 per cent of the gross domestic product compared with 6.5 per cent of our GDP a decade ago. Was anybody saying a decade ago that 6.5 per cent of our GDP was too great an external debt? Does the honourable member for Adelaide know that the percentage of GDP to our external debt now is lower than it was 10 years ago? Does he reahse that the relevant percentage for export income in 1977-78 is 38.3 per cent whereas 10 years ago it was 53.2 per cent? Did he lay those facts on the table? Did he come clean with the Parliament and the Australian people when he talked in rhetorical terms about the $324 per head debt? Did he come clean with those figures? I suggest to the honourable member that if we are to have a serious debate about a serious subject that affects us all on both sides of the House we ought to put all of the facts on the table. I think some of these facts are extremely relevant. I point out to the honourable member for Adelaide that of course the question of exchange fluctuations so far as international borrowings are concerned is important. I think the House might want to know-and this is particularly relevant in respect of the yen borrowing-that an analysis of the composition of the Commonwealth's overseas debt by foreign currencies reveals that prior to the recent yen package-and I will come to the situation after the yen packagethe break-up was as follows: United States dollars, 46 per cent; Deutsche mark, 26 per cent; yen, 6 per cent; Swiss francs, 12 per cent; and Dutch guilder, 7 per cent. As a result of the recent yen borrowing the yen component will be 19.7 per cent, which is significantly below the denomination of our overseas debt in United States dollars. I think that these are facts of which the House ought to be aware. I would just Uke to dweU on two other tilings. Firstly, the honourable member for Adelaide is concerned about capital going out of Austraha. That is a very legitimate concern for an Opposition spokesman on trade matters. If ever anything was calculated to drive overseas capital out of this country it was the alternative budget proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), a budget which would have destroyed the anti-inflationary strategy that this Government has followed over the past two-and-a-half years, a budget which would have renewed suspicion by overseas investors that this country had lost its economic nerve as far as getting the fundamentals right and a budget which would have renewed wage pressures. It spent about a paragraph and a half on wages policy and what was said about wages pohcy represented complete non-recognition of the facts of economic life. If ever an economic policy is calculated to undermine this country's international economic respectability it is one which ignores the reaUty that until we get the fundamentals of this economy right, and unless we have the nerve to persevere with getting them right, we are not going to survive and prosper in extremely difficult world economic conditions. The second thing that I would Uke to say about the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide is that he referred onlyfleetinglyto the activities of the former Government in the area of overseas loans. I do not want to go into that in detaU-fa r be it from me to do so-bu t let me say two things very quickly about it. As he well knows, it was not just a question of the relevance of borrowings of that order to policy at the time that concerned the then Opposition. It was the lack of orthodoxy, the possibly lack of legaUty and the odd way in which a country, which had proven before that and has proven since that it can be a successful borrower in an orthodox manner on official account, acted through little known intermediaries. It was the presence of those elements which caused the then Opposition its principal concern. Surely the honourable member for Adelaide does not suggest for a moment that one can draw any comparison at all between what occurred then and what has occurred now. Of course, the borrowing program of the present Government is done in accordance with the most orthodox, proper and legal means, and any suggestion that any comparison can be drawn between the activities of some of his former ministerial leaders and what has occurred over the past 18 months is not really doing the honourable member for Adelaide justice or credit. I conclude simply by saying that over the past 18 months this Government has followed a policy of borrowing substantial amounts on official account to supplement our international reserves. That policy is both appropriate and desirable in current circumstances. It is consistent w:th the objects of our external pohcy, having regard to the difficulties and restraints under which we are operating. Naturally the Government believes that there should be no secret about the need to do this in circumstances that require it. We have not been flushed out on this subject. We have been totally open about both the reasons for and the size of our international borrowings. As long ago as 20 months or more the Government made it clear that we would be embarking upon a substantial program of overseas borrowings. We gave our reasons then and we repeated them earlier this year. They were referred to again in the Budget Speech and they are constantly referred to when announcements of overseas borrowings are made by the Government. So far from there being any lack of explanation by this Government, I do not believe that the honourable member for Adelaide has made out a case for explanation.",46
102,Mr DAWKINS,BORROWING PROGRAM,"What text the Opposition wanted in this debate was an planation of why the Government has embarked on this massive loan raising exercise and an cation of how long we can expect it to continue be borrowing money overseas in such vast currency amounts. We did not get from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) an adequate explanation of that. What we got was a recitation of previous announceinterest ments. What we got was simply an announce that ment of what has already happened. I do not less think that is good enough for either this Parliament or the Australian people. I think that this is a fundamentally crucial question, and the Oppofocus sition has not raised it frivolously. We reaUse it is a sensitive issue, and what we were seeking from the Government was some explanation as to how much longer we can expect this sort of tivity to be going on and against what backment ground we can expect it to be going on. Before getting to the core of the argument want to respond to a couple of the quaint explaginning nations which the Treasurer gave. For instance, he blamed the poor position of Australia's curtransactions. rent account on the fact that we have priced selves out of the market and that our internal cost structure had increased too rapidly. I would very intrigued to discover from the Treasurer how he thinks that the internal cost structure has influenced our trade in commodities as it has been in the area of trade in commodities which has particularly adversely influenced our balance on current account. The point is that the internal cost structure not had any bearing at all on the declining value of our commodity sales. Again I would be in the trigued to know how the internal cost structure has had a crucial bearing on the invisibles ponent, which continues to be of such massive proportions. The internal cost structure has very Uttle to do with the extent of the invisible payments, which have always been a great burden to this country. The Treasurer said that he thought it was entirely proper for Australia to be moving away from United States dollars into yen in the loan raising in which the Government is engaging.",49
103,Mr HOWARD,BORROWING PROGRAM,I did not say that.,49
104,Mr DAWKINS,BORROWING PROGRAM,The Treasurer said that he thought that under the circumstances it was reasonable to increase the proportion of the loan raisings in yen.,49
105,Mr HOWARD,BORROWING PROGRAM,A reasonable mix.,49
106,Mr DAWKINS,BORROWING PROGRAM,"That is right. The point is that we do not have to do that by expanding our loan raisings. That can be done within the conof the existing level of borrowings by switchexing around the currency in which those borrowings are held. So that itself is not an adequate indiexplanation. Indeed it would be better to hold to borrowings in US doUars, because the Australian is in fact improving against the US dollar and is declining markedly against the yen. So it is more expensive for us to be paying the in yen rather than in US dollars. I think on those couple of points the Treasurer was than candid in his explanation to this House. What the Opposiuon has tried to do today is to some attenuon on the balance of payments that situauon, which is one of unreheved gloom. I do not think that anyone would dispute that claim. I guess in the context of the general state of the aceconomy that the gloom on the balance of paysituation would surprise no one, but it is serious to the extent that it reveals the failure of the Government's economic strategy because if I the Government's economic strategy were beto work we would have expected one of thefirstsigns of that success to be in our overseas It is not necessary for me to remind ourthe House that this Government's strategy is based very firmly on the hope that there will be be an increase in the amount of inflow of overseas capital, because we have been told that as a result of an increased flow of foreign private capital into this country there will be an increase in investment and, therefore, an expansion of job opportunities. In fact the situation which is unfolding is exactly the reverse of what one has would have expected had the Government's economic strategy begun to work. We find that balance on the current account continues to be strongly negative and that it is substantially comworse in the September quarter of 1978 than it was in the September quarter of 1977. Indeed, in the last three months there, has been a progression of larger deficits. As the honourable member for Adelaide has correctly pointed out, Australia's international hquidity continues to decUne. It has now fallen below $3,000m and is falling currently at the rate of $63m a week. The Australian dollar, of course, is now worth 10 per cent less than it was worth 15 months ago, and crucially the level of capital inflow into this country, although higher than at this time last year, has in fact been falling since the introduction of the Budget, the prime aim of which was to encourage the inflow of foreign private capital. I trunk that that last istic is very interesting because it reveals that Budget has not had the desired impact. It should be seen also in the context of the report from HU1 Samuel Australia Ltd to which the honourable member for Adelaide referred. HU1 Samuel does not expect there to be an increase in the level of private capital coming mto Australia in the near future. The latest annual figures avaUable show that for the 12 months to June 1977 there was an inflow of $1.3 bUUon and that for the 12 months to June 1978 the inflow was only about $342m. I think that in this area a very serious problem exists, because it reveals that a fundamental and important plank of this Government's economic strategy is in fact falling to pieces. What is the Government proposing to do about this problem? We have seen that its response to the deteriorating situation of our current account, which of course has been exacerbated by the fact that the inflow of private capital has not been what the Government expected it to be, has been to move to borrow quite massively overseas. It wiU shortly have in the order of $4,000m of overseas borrowings. I think it is important that I say that the Opposition is not ideologically opposed to overseas borrowings. What it is opposed to is the way in which the borrowing has been done and the lack of explanation that has been given. I say quite frankly that the Labor Party is not opposed to borrowing money from overseas for the purpose of job creation in this country; but that is not what this Government is on about. Where is the investment which the Government has been able to inspire as a result of these massive borrowings? What has to be remembered is that if there were some investment in this country of those foreign loans at least we would have some way servicing the massive debt which we will face up to in the near future. The honourable member for Adelaide pointed out that the repayments which wiU be a charge on the Budget very soon will be in the order of $500m a year. That will have a very important impact on the domestic economy. When those repayments become due it will have a very important impact on the size and shape of the Budget. I think that these are the questions about which the Government really has not come clean. It really has not told us for how long we will be borrowing at this level and how it intends to service those debts in the years to come. The solutions to these problems, I admit, are not simple. One of the ways in which some action has to be taken is to attempt to reduce the deficit staton the current account. I am bound to say in the passing that this problem is not helped by the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) approving a price cut in our iron ore that is shipped to Japan. That will only exacerbate an already serious problem. Secondly, some action is obviously needed in the area of the inflow of private capital. That is the one objective which the Government has confidently set for itself, and yet it is an area in which the Government has been shown clearly to have faUed. What this reaUy reveals is the isolation of this Government from the rest of the world economy. The policies of this Government are quite out of tune with most of the major economies. So long as we continue to follow those, policies this economy will be left high and dry.",49
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BORROWING PROGRAM,Mr Martin)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,50
108,Mr HODGMAN,BORROWING PROGRAM,"The Opposition's matter of public importance today stands exposed as an exercise in cant and hypocrisy, barefaced effrontery and unashamed humbug. Who would have thought for one moment that so soon after the evil event the Opposition would have had the gall to bring into this chamber a debate on the question of overseas loans? It demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt the massive guUt complex of the Australian Labor Party with respect to the loans affair of 13 December 1974 and thereafter. It proves once again that the ghosts of Khemlani, signed and unsigned letters of introduction, Iraqi breakfasts, temporary purposes and midnight clandestine deals with thefinancialprostitutes of the world in darkened alleyways still loom large in the minds of members of the Opposition. They do not seem to be able to remember the details of of constitutional conspiracy, deceit and deception, have to incompetence and irregularity. Colleagues of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) got theirfingerscaught ***"" o o in the till. I beheve that after today the honourable member for Adelaide ought to be called 'Honey Hurford' because if ever anybody got his fingers caught in the honey jar today it was him for having the effrontery to bring such a poppycock matter of pubhc importance into this House. With his frequent references to 'flushing out', he reminded me a litde of the man who one morning by mistake took Harpic instead of Eno's salts and went clean round the bend. The honourable member repeatedly talked about flushing out this and flushing out that. He does not have to flush very hard because today we have a Treasurer who, and a government which makes pubhc all dealings in relation to overseas loans. The honourable member needs just to pick up a Press statement issued by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and dated 6 September 1978. He will see in chapter and verse the dealings and details of proposed loans from the Deutsche Bank, which is certainly not a backyard procurer of finance and certainly not an intermediary of finance such as those intermediaries with which the Labor Government dealt. It is all in the Press statement in black white. The honourable member can see the interest rates, the terms and the details. If he not happy with that information, he can look the next Press release, No. 105, which was issued on 5 October. He will see that the Government has been negotiating loans with organisations such as the Long Term Credit Bank, the Mitspeeches subishi Trust and Banking Co. and the Nippon Life Insurance Co. These are not Khemlanis; they are not backyardfinanciers;they are not midnighters. We deal in the open. We are government which will continue to deal in the open so that the people can see exactly going on. What is wrong with the Labor Party? It seems to equate loans with the number of people a prime in the population. What an extraordinary propform of osition! It is not a question of per capita; it is a seas question of the capacity to repay; it is a question leading of the credit rating of the nation. Thank Australia now has a AAA credit rating. It have it in 1974; it did not have it in 1975.1 beheve that it is due to the proper policies of our Government, to the integrity of our Treasurers since we came back to power in 1975 and to the rectitude of our economic planning that we have that AAA credit rating. What is the position? As the Treasurer said, present the Commonwealth's external debtthat is, taking into account the end borrowingshas will amount to 5 per cent of the gross domestic product. This compares with 6.5 per cent ade ago. More importantly, I believe, due respect to the Treasurer, is the fact that the relevant percentage for export income would be 38.3 per cent at 1977-78 levels compared with 53.2 per cent a decade ago. What is the Opposition on about? The honourable member for Adelaide admitted that Australia's reserves, balance of payments, balance of trade and overseas borrowings are sensitive issues. What is the Opposition trying to do in this matter of public importance today? I do not like to rake over coals so I will do no more than to remind the Parhament and the nation that it was on 4 October 1977 that this House took the most unprecedented step of formally censuring one of its members for his economic subversion and total irresponsibility with respect to the strength and standing of the Australian dollar. I refer to that incident because it involved a formal censure by this House of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden), who is now the Leader of the Opposition. It ill behoves the honourable member for Adelaide and his colleague to come into this chamber in such a gloomy way, as Jonahs and Jerimiahs, and and to knock and whinge. They are talking about total overseas borrowings in excess of $2,000m. is They did not seem to be too keen to talk about at proposed borrowings of $4,000m for temporary purposes; they did not seem to be too concerned at that time about what they were doing to Australia. I want to quote from a couple of which were recorded in 1975 just to see how they line up with what we have heard this afternoon. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott), in an epic speech on 9 July a 1975, which is recorded on page 3642 of Hansard of that date, quotes the present Leader what is of the Opposition as saying: The Australian Government's international reputation as borrower is such that it does not need to use any intermediary. In the past it has always confined overloan negotiations to dealing directly with principals; financial institutions in overseas capital markets. God, That is what he said. What did the former did not Treasurer, Mr Crean, say? He said: Australia shouldMr Dawkins-What has this to do with it?",50
109,Mr HODGMAN,BORROWING PROGRAM,"I know the honourable member does not Uke this. He is one of the gutity ones. He was in the Parliament then. He was reat moved later and he is back again now. He was one of the guilty ones. The honourable member a gutity conscience. Yet he has the gall to come in here and preach to us about the proa decpriety of borrowing overseas. A former with all Treasurer, Mr Crean, said: Australia should, I suggest, carefully preserve its reputation as a steady and cautious borrower on official account. (Quorum formed).",51
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BORROWING PROGRAM, clear Before the honourable member for Denison sumes his speech I would remind him that matter before the Chair is the Fraser Governrangements ment's failure to justify its vast overseas ings program. I would suggest that the honourDepartment able member should keep his remarks relevant to that subject.,52
111,Mr HODGMAN,BORROWING PROGRAM,"Certainly, sir. In fact, I make the point that, unlike with those who the effrontery to bring this matter into the chamber today and those who covered up and who dealt by darkness and at night time, we have a Government, a Treasurer and a group people ranning this country who make it quite curious. clear what are their dealings. We do not go round in the middle of the night deaUng with people whom I have described as the financial prostitutes of the world. In order to demonstrate my point, I refer to the epic speech of the honourable member Wentworth in 1975. He said: Why was it that this Executive Council Minute approved a borrowing of $4,000m for temporaiy purposes when the borrowing was known to be and was intended to be term borrowing for long-term purposes? How did the Governor General come to approve a resolution for such temporary purposes when the borrowing was for indefinite purposes? What was the reaction of the Treasury? Nobody has asked those questions about our last two loans. Nobody has had to stand in this House and say: 'For what are you borrowing Deutsche marks and yen on the basis of tempormore, no less. ary purposes?' Nobody has thrown one jot of suspicion against this Government. I believe it is contemptible for the honourable member for Adelaide and his coUeagues to come into this House today and endeavour to impugn the integCouncil, rity of the present Treasurer. The implication was that we do in 1978 what they did in 1974 and 1975 and nothing could be further from truth.

112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BORROWING PROGRAM,Order! The mention honourable member'stimehas expired. The cussion is concluded. NA NA Ministerial Statement,52
113,Mr KILLEN,MARALINGA,"by leave-In the 1950s a series of nutests was conducted in this country by the reUnited Kingdom Government. The tests were the conducted pursuant to a memorandum of arbetween Australia and the United borrowKingdom. FoUowing adniinistrative changes my became the principal repository for the records of this subject. This process was completed in 1974. The Mmister for Defence has since that time been ministeriaUy responsible for those records. It would seem that rumour, innuhad endo and conveniently selective recollection place an obligation upon me every six months or so to seek to quieten pubhc agitation which is now fomented with respect to the Maralinga tests. of The motives of the activists seem, at best, I emphasise that the records I am deaUng with are precisely the same records that have been available to the last several Australian again governments. The records have not been added for to or subtracted from. Precisely the same historical mformation is there as existed during the Whitlam Labor Governments. The honourable members for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), WUls (Mr Bryant), Hindmarsh a long- (Mr Clyde Cameron), Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), Capricornia (Dr Everingham), Oxley (Mr Hayden), Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), Blaxland (Mr Keating), Grayndler (Mr Stewart) and Reid (Mr Uren) and Senators Bishop, Cavanagh, Wheeldon and Wriedt still remain in this Parliament. I repeat that the information I draw upon is the same information that was available to them-n o A government led by Mr Whitlam estabhshed the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory which is referred to as AIRAC. That body superseded the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee. AIRAC endorsed proposals the concerning the MaraUnga area. It recommended the Minister for Environment of the day-that is, the present honourable member for Maribyrof nong (Dr Cass)-and the recommendations put before the honourable gentleman were accepted by him and clearly by the then Government. I this not in any sense of political conflict disbut to illustrate the fact. The honourable gentleman-that is, the honourable member for Maribyrnong-coul d scarcely have taken the decision he did without the consideration of all relevant information, that is, the consideration of the records available to the Government of which he was a member, and to this Government. Governments and Ministers clearly have duty to be concerned with the national interest. There are those who scoff at that interest but scoffing serves no more noble purpose than to dulge a lively and vulgar sense of personal ity. For myself, and I am certain that I speak all people of reason, I cannot see that national interest is aided one jot by wild gations and rumours relating to the Maralinga experiments. I will try once more to put some of the more conspicuous of these allegations and rumours rest. There is no unexploded device buried at MaraUnga. I trust there is no ambiguity about that. Investigation has turned up no evidence that nuclear waste from power stations in useful Britain-o r from any other country-wa s buried at Maralinga or anywhere else in Australia. There were not 800 tonnes of nuclear waste buried at Maralinga, nor anything remotely proaching that amount. There is no evidence, logic and certainly no credible hypothesis port an accusation, so dear to the imagination the former Deputy Leader of the Oppositionthat is, the honourable member for Reid-tha the British broke the moratorium on atomic plosions in the atmosphere in the period from 1958 to 1961. The first atomic explosion in Australia ocrecord curred 26 years ago last week, and curred 21 years ago this week. There were subsequently some experiments on radioactive substances related to nuclear weapons technology but no further atomic explosions. I emphasise the words 'no further atomic explosions'. I emphasise those words because the Melbourne Age newspaper, commenting editorially today, had some difficulty distinguishing between an atomic explosion qua atomic explosion and clear experimentation. I do not complain about that fact. However, one gets a little weary being catechised and criticised when some of authors themselves are not too bright on fundaoccasion. mental science. This point has been made clear many times before, though I notice that even Minister today comment which is usually notable for its Hansard? accuracy in matters has confused this matter. If a newspaper can confuse the matter in its editorial, which I take it would be written by the leader writers as a reflective, contemplative collection of words, there would be many other people of goodwUl and reason who would be confused. MaraUnga is an area which on all the extensive evidence so far compiled is safe for most ordinary purposes excepting long-term occupation of a few localities. It is an area where there will be a an on-going task, which this Government is addressing, of long-term management brought the about principally by the burials in the area of a intotal of about 20 kilograms of plutonium. All of vanthat and much more has been made plain before. for It is a matter of regret that men who were the members of Whitlam Labor governmentsallegovernments led by Mr Whitlam and administrations which professed a close interest in nuclear matters-mus t realise the untruth of some of the rumours and misinformation and sheer fabrications that have appeared on this subject to yet they have chosen to remain sUent. They had three years to appraise themselves of the facts and I do them the credit of assuming that they did. In my judgment, they could have made a contribution to rational discussion of this subject and could have aUayed public fears aroused by sUly sensationaUsm. They have not done so. One must ask the question: Why? They aphave taken the matter further than that. In no February 1977, I discharged an undertaking I to suphad made to the then Deputy Leader of the of Opposition-that is, the honourable member for Reid-to supply information to him. I wrote him t a letter which recapitulated the salient facts exabout the Maralinga burials-the same information that had been available to the Government in which he was a Mmister. I asked his permission to let me put that information on the of this House. He would not ageee. I say the last octhis with some warmth to my",52

115,Mr KILLEN,MARALINGA,I am most grateful to the honourable gentleman that at long last he will permit me to put the mformation on the public record. On eight occasions I tried to contact the honourable gentleman and I could not get a renusponse. I say this to him: I have endeavoured over the years to treat him with courtesy and of with honour. He disappointed me enormously the that he did not respond more readily on the,53
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARALINGA,Is the seeking leave to incorporate the letter in,53
117,Mr KILLEN,MARALINGA,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate the letter in Hansard. Leave granted. The letter read asfollowsDear Mr Uren, In Parliament on 9 December 1976 you asked a Question about British experiments at Maralinga in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I promised to make inquiries and respond to you before Parliament resumed. This important matter, which is essentially one of long term environmental management, has become confused and distorted by several unfounded allegations, in particular that an unexploded nuclear weapon is buried at Maralinga; that radioactive waste was brought from British nuclear power stations and buried at Maralinga; and that about 800 tonnes of nuclear waste material, including plutonium, is buried at Maralinga, which is what the South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy was reported on 20 December 1976 to have said. Thorough investigations of all the records and evidence taken from Australian officials who held responsible positions at thetimehave revealed no evidence at all supporting or in any way substantiating these allegations. The radioactive debris at Maralinga is derived from three sources-Britis h nuclear tests that area some fifteen to twenty-five years ago; washings from British service aircrafi which participated in the tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh airfield for cleaning and maintenance, and nuclear medical waste from the University of Adelaide. This debris was disposed of in various ways, including storage in steel and lead boxes, massive concrete slabs, ploughing in, and fencing and area control. WhUe it is true that some 800 tonnes of rubble are buried in 21 pits, this contains some 20 kUograms of plutonium and it is a mistake to describe it aU as 'nuclear waste material'. These arrangements were incorporated in a report by the British Government so that residual their tests would be recorded for posterity. This report, issued in 1968, is held by both the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments. Surveys of the MaraUnga area were undertaken in 1967 and 1972 by the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee. In December last year Professor H. J. deBruin of Flinders University accompanied a party of South Australian Department of Health officials on a survey in and around the Maralinga township. Hereported'that no trace of radioactivity in excess of natural able on or near the dump'. These past surveys have not ment for any Government to institute additional or different control and safety measures. But the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council recently recommended-in December 1976-that a further survey be made and the Government is taking steps to arrange this. Should a need for any new measures become apparent this Government, and I have no doubt its successors, wiU take appropriate action. I know that you will agree that this matter must be kept underregularreview and brought regularly to the attention of the Government of the day by AIRAC or its successors in the future. You referred also to the 'moratorium' during which the British Government, along with the US. and Soviet Governments, accepted a self-imposed obUgation to refrain from the testing of nuclear weapons. This lasted from September 1958 until September 1961, when, you will recall, the Soviet Government resumed testing of nuclear weapons. During this period the then British Government conducted various experiments at MaraUnga. The detaUs of these experiments were, and remain classified. The British Government has 3 February 77 advised that: 'No atomic devices were exploded during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, and no unexploded nuclear device was buried.' I do not consider that a Royal Commission isrequiredinto these matters or could serve any useful purpose now. The forthcoming environmental survey should add further data assisting governmental decisions about the continuing secure management of the material at MaraUnga. As I say, it will be important to keep under regular review the adequacy of the protective and control measures in the MaraUnga area. Yours sincerely, D.J. KILLEN. The Hon. T.

May I explain to the honourable gentleman and the House why I had not released the letter previously. I have a very old-fashioned view which reflects a value I hold. I will not release the text of a letter from me without the perburial in pits, covering with mission of the recipient of the letter. Some people have urged me on this occasion to break what is regarded as a nicety. I still hold to that view. If I write to any honourable member in this House or to any person outside it, unless I have that individual's permission I will not release the letter. I radioactivity at sites of am grateful that the honourable gentleman has now relented. The honourable member for Reid has accused me of misleading this Parhament. I make no attempt to disguise the fact that I am intensely resentful of that charge. I say this to the honourable gentleman: I would never consciously mislead this House because I place the greatest value background radiation was detectupon frank and open deahng with all those who to date established a requiresit in it. Neither will I accept the view that I may have unconsciously misled the House on this issue. As a consequence- I acknowledge that it may be tedium- I propose to deal with all die information I have given to this House on the question of the Maralinga tests. I trust the House will acknowledge that I am the custodian of the records relating to the Maralinga tests. That is where my ministerial responsibiUty starts and that is where it stops. I add to that the fact that I share part of a corporate responsibUity insofar as I am a member of the Government. On 2 December 1976, Senator Gietzelt asked in the Senate the following question: (1) Did the then Minister for Supply, Mr Garland, state on 14 September 1972, 'AU radio-active waste buried at three places in Australia, Monte Bello, Emu and Maralinga resulted from experiments conducted at those places'. (2) What radio-active material is buried there and what the Ufe span of such material and of the containers in this material was buried. (3) Has the maintenance of this area been brought attenuon of the Government. (4) What precautions have been proposed to be taken in the active waste is not interfered with or exposed atmosphere. (5) What measures have been taken to ensure that the knowledge of the existence of the material is passed from government to government and from generation to cisely generation. (6) In view of the Government's decision on the Fox quiry and the potential danger to the Australian people the lethal legacy of the past, will the Minister treat these matters as urgent. The Minister representing me in the Senate profurther vided this answer: The Minister for Defence has directed that an inquiry conducted into all aspects of the material buried at Maralinga as a consequence of the tests conducted under auspices of the memorandum of arrangements between the United Kingdom and Australian Governments. The House will recall that at that time there been a most exhaustive study and report issue referred to as the Pearce Committee report. This report was published clean-up operation known as Operation Brumby that took place in 1967. On 8 December 1976, Mr Whitlam, the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy asked me: (1) What steps have been taken to verify the allegations by Dr John Coulter and Mr Avon Hudson on the radio program AM on 2 and 3 December 1976 that the British Government had flown radio-active waste including plutonium from nuclear power stations in Britain to Maralinga, where it was secretly buried at night. (2) Are the assurances given by the Minister for Supply in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on 14 September 1972 (Hansard, pages 1384 and 1503) still valid. I replied: (1) There has been thorough investigation of all the records and evidence has been taken from Australian officials who held responsible vestigation has turned up no evidence whatsoever supporting the aUegations that radio-active waste was brought from nuclear power stations in Britain for burial at Maralinga. (2) The assurance given by Mr Garland in 1972 remains valid regarding risk. In addition to debris from experiments carried out in the area, some small quantities of radio-active material from the following sources are also buried at Maralinga: (a) Washings from British Service aircrafi which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh airfield for cleaning and maintenance. (b) Nuclear medical waste from the University of Adelaide. On 9 December 1976, the honourable member for Reid asked me the following question: o 11 n r. i vrueopuxiiiTiAnTnr i *r rL:J p cuDi D ]771 1/^.1 Is it true that, during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, Australia co-operated with is the British in conducting secret atomic 'Trigger' tests at which Maralinga and that waste and debris from these tests were buried at MaraUnga?

Thatrelatesto the major point of the honourable gentleman's question. I am innot aware of any explosions that took place between 1958 from and 1961.I am aware of certain trials, which I distinguish from explosions, as presently advised, that took place. They were conducted pursuant to an agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia. Nevertheless, I will make inquiries as may seem appropriate and inform the honourable gentleman. To my knowledge the last explosions that were conducted at Maralinga were in 1955-56.1 think be there are four members of this House who have survived the poltiical explosions in the interregnum-the honourable the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Fremantle, the honourable member for Mackellar and I . We have survived those explosions. The Gang of Four were in had attendance-if I can explain to the honourable on the gentleman-at Operation' Buffalo'. This was a series of tests at Maralinga. I in 1968 following the continued: I think that was the series of tests. I give my friend, the Leader of the Opposition, an assurance that I will make appropriate inquiries. Rather than wait until such time as the Parliament resumes, I will convey such information as I gather to the honourable gentleman. I put it to my honourable friend that there is nothing in that reply that is not absolutely factual. I invite the honourable gendeman not to indulge in speculation. If he wants to make a charge that I am misleading the House I hope he will produce clear, explicit evidence. Pursuant to the undertaking I gave the honourable gentleman I wrote to him on 3 February 1977. That is the letter that now, after 18 months or more, the honourable gentleman has agreed to be incorpositions at the time. This inporated in Hansard. As I said to the honourable gendeman and some of his colleagues, the letter is not a polemical letter. It is a straight factual account of the mformation that was avaUable to me. Then, on 16 February 1977, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham) asked me the following question: I address a question to the Minister for Defence. It relates to the Minister's undertaking to provide the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with information about the contaminated debris buried at Maralinga in South Australia subsequent to the atomic tests there some 20 years ago. Is the Minister yet in a position to release this information? If so, can he inform the house of the results? I repUed: The answer is yes. I wrote position on the third of this month, conveying to him informadon concerning the tests. With customary courtesy the honourable member for Reid interjected: lt took a long while to get to me. I replied: The truth will ultimately some regret to me that on two occasions I telephoned the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's office asking for proval to release the letter old-fashioned view, but I am not in the habit of ters that are written to people. My staff has subsequently been in touch with the honourable gentleman's office least eight occasions, to no avail. If the Deputy Leader Opposition would indicate that he is agreeable to my making public the letter which I wrote to of this House. I ask him, Mr Speaker. The silence is deafening. That being the case, and the honourable gentleman not being disposed to release the contents of the letter, I will tell the House the substance of the letter, without the personal flourishes of goodwill. In 1968 the British Atomic Energy Weapons Research establishment made a repon concerning material buried at Maralinga. That repon was known as the Pearce Committee report. It was classified by the United Kingdom Government. As a consequence, this Government is in no position to declassify it. About the middle the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council appointed an ad hoc committee to consider further the material buried at MaraUnga. In December of last year its port was considered by AIRAC. The principal recommendation of that report was that the Government should underMaraUnga take a further detailed study of all ecological and environmental factors associated with the burial of material at Maralinga. The Government is presently attending to that recommendation. On 9 March 1977, the present Leader of the Opunrestricted position asked me the following question: Can he provide a full list of all have taken place in Australia giving the date, the size, location and purpose of each. I replied: Yes. The list is as follows: With the co-operation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) I seek leave to to include the list in Hansard. Leave granted. The list read asfollowsDate Location 2 October 1952 Monte BeUo 15 October 1953 Emu 27 October 1953 Emu 16 May 1956 Monte Bello 19 June 1956 Monte Bello to the Deputy Leader of the OpApproximate Date Location size 27 September 1956 .

On 15 March 1977 Senator Georges asked the Minister representing me in on at the Senate a long question. I seek leave to include of the the text of that question and my answer in him, it would save the time Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as follows(1) What are the results of investigations into radioactivity levels and the effectiveness of waste disposal at MaraUnga. (2) What radioactive material has been disposed of at Maralinga and in what quantities. (3 ) Is the Government considering any measures to rectify of last year this waste disposal problem at Maralinga. Senator Withers-The Minister for Defence has provided rethe following answer to the honourable senator's question: (1) DetaUed requirements for the condition in which was to be left when British activity closed down were laid down in 1967 by the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee set up by the Australian Government. After the British clean-up operation of that year the AWTSC reported to the Australian Prime Minister of the time that they 'were satisfied Maralinga was radio-logically safe. Permanent and access could be made to all but a few small areas and even they could be occupied on a short term basis without risk'. In 1972 a further survey confirmed the 1967 level nuclear explosions which of confidence. (2) There were three sources of the radioactive material at Maralinga, viz. debris from British experiments 15 to 25 years ago; washings from British service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island (in the Pacific) in 1957-58; and nuclear waste from the University of Adelaide. The essential requirement in the clean-up process referred in (1) above was to monitor radiation levels and record these in detail-not , in every case, the weight volume or chemical composition of the debris and accompanying rock, sod, etc., that was being disposed of. The relevant report was submitted to the Australian Government of the day, forwarded to the South Australian Government, has been available to all subsequent governments-bot h Australian and South Australian-and was made avaUable to the Australian Ionising Radiation Approximate Authority Council when that body, set up by the previous size Australian Government, considered the MaraUnga debris.

The Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council recommended in December 1976 that a funher survey be made and the Government is taking steps to arrange this. Should a need for any new measures become apparent as a result of this survey, or other period review, this Government, and I have no doubt its successors, will take the necessary acuon.",56
120,Mr KILLEN,MARALINGA,"I thank the House. The facts these: There have been seven occasions on information has been sought from me regarding the Maralinga tests. I have given the facts every occasion. I try to be sympathetic to honourable member for Reid knowing as I do personal experience of war, but I am saddened that he has allowed prejudice-blind , untrammy melled prejudice-to control his thinking and attitude on this matter of importance. I have explained that the British exploded atomic devices in Australia, three at Monte Bello, seven at Maralinga, and two at Emu Field near Maralinga. Between 1955 and 1963 the Brilife tish also conducted a series of other scientific experiments with radioactive substances at Maralinga. The Maralinga and Emu areas were the subjects of a large scale clean-up operation conducted in 1967 to bring them to intertory ofit. nationally acceptable standards set by the Australian Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee. That is Operation Buffalo to which I have ferred and which led to the Pearce Committee's report. In 1968 the Austrahan Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee informed the government of the day that it was satisfied that the area radiologically safe, that permanent and unrevolved stricted access could be made to all but a few small areas and that even they could be occupied on a short term basis without risk. It was recogrecommendations nised at the same time that periodic re-appraisals would be necessary. The first was carried out 1972. It confirmed the 1967 level of confidence. There was no survey conducted on the ground There in the period 1973-74-75. Consideration was given, however, by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), who then had niinisin terial responsibility to developing new means survey. That much is historical. In December purpose. 1976 the Austrahan Ionising Radiation Advisory Council-AIRAC-endorse d proposals for a further review which should extend to an ecoEmu logical survey of the area. These proposals were accepted by the responsible minister-the Ministhe ter for Environment, Housing and Community Development-wh o authorised the new survey May 1977. The field work was commenced in which August 1977 with the assistance of two South Australian Government departments. These Maralinga. 17 IU were the Department of Mines and the Department of the Environment. The work involved speciaUst assistance from the Australian Radiation Laboratory, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Bureau of Meteorology. It would not be inappropriate, I suggest, if I were to point out to the House that the AIRAC study which came into existence in 1974 was are commissioned by the Labor Government. The which AIRAC report of 1976 draws on the Pearce Committee's report quite extensively. I accept on what my friend the Leader of the Opposition the said at Question Time today, that he had not his seen the report, that his former Leader, Mr Whidam, had not seen the report and that two of predecessors in office, Mr Morrison and Mr his Barnard, had not seen it. That may be an accident of administrative behaviour but I say that 12 there has been no attempt whatsoever to disguise the existence of this report. The AIRAC report refers to the Pearce Committee's report. For the of me I find it an astonishing proposition that the honourable member for Maribyrnong, as the Minister responsible at the time, would have taken the decisions he did with respect to MaraUnga if he had not looked at the entire hisWith the agreement of my colleague the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community reDevelopment (Mr Groom) I inform the House of the present position, which is that the radiological and chemical analysis of the large number of soU, water and biological samples collected in was 1977 is now substantiaUy complete. This has in a great deal oftimeand labour. AIRAC will shortly consider the technical reports from the co-operating laboratories and will prepare its for the Government. In 1977, as a result of consultation between Ministers, it in was decided that an examination should commence of the long-range questions of mangement associated with the Maralinga area. were issues to be addressed of Commonwealth and State powers and responsibUities and of suitable administrative arrangements, bearing mind that the area does not have relevance to of any practical, contemporary Australian defence It was also decided subsequently to join the Field area to this study because the proximity of Maralinga and Emu Field suggested that same, or similar, long-range environmental management measures should apply to both. in This work now awaits the findings by AIRAC will, of course be basic to further definition of the practical issues to be resolved at It has additionally been decided to include the Monte Bellos in the general review. A joint Defence-AIRAC reconnaissance of the Monte Bello site will, in fact, commence later this month. It has been in the planning for the past two months. These actions now mean that all the former It nuclear weapons test sites in Austraha are receivcause, ing close attention. That this is now happening does not mean that new facts or new phenomena have been advised to the Government which heighten concern about the sites. mean is that-2 0 to 25 years on-it is time to reassess what impediments, if any, stand in the way of their being opened up further to normal every-day activity. The Government is proceeding in a methodical way to develop the most appropriate arrangements that can be made for the long-term management of these sites, based on the best scientific advice it can obtain. Yet another of matters which this Government has had under active consideration-and one which lay behind Cabinet's recent deliberations-relate s to Australia's obhgations under the agreement with signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency consequent upon our accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Our attention to this matter has led to a appraisal of whether any of the material buried at Maralinga, while safely buried from the standgovernments point of surface radiation hazard, may also be 'safeguardable' under the precise terms of Australia's agreement with the IAEA. That agreement was signed since the burials were made. I remind honourable members opposite that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was ratified by the Labor Government and the acwhich cession to that Treaty was an act of the Whitlammission led Government of the time. The agreement with half-kUogram the IAEA was also made by the Whitlam-led Labor Government. I invite honourable viduaUy gentlemen and all people of fairness to reflect whether those substantial commitments and responsibUities would have been entered into steel without some consideration at least being given to the Maralinga area at the time. If that were the case, it seems to me to be a very curious gap. I also remind honourable gentlemen that the Pearce Committee's report describes where the 800 tonnes of rubbleuranium is buried. The AIRAC report makes the most exphcit references to it. I say this not in any 'rubble'-i heat and, above aU, not in any sense of hostUity. I do not believe that there is the sUghtest scope partisan conflict on this issue. An analysis of the documentary records of the burials suggests that one pit does contain material in sufficient quantity to be safeguardable, and disposed of in such a way as tofitthe new criterion 'practicably recoverable'. Honourable members should notice that the language used suggests that one pit does contain material. does not assert this; it suggests it. This is bepursuant to the IAEA agreement, we will take seriously our obligations and we will respect the safeguards. We must accept the criteria that is being suggested to us and they must be propWhat it does erly considered. The reconnaissance on the ground that Cabinet has now authorised is intended to test the conclusion reached from the documents and, if it is verified, to establish the practical measures to effect exhumation. It is essential to emphasise here, and for this House and the Austrahan public to understand, that there is no direct relationship between the recoverabUity and radiation levels at Maralinga. The fact that one pit contains plutonium in a form of burial which may make its exhumation practicable has in fact nothing whatever to do surface radiation. There has been a regrettable tendency to sensationaUse this subject in ways that have left the impression in some people's minds that there is one particularly 'hot' or dangerous pit at Maralinga which should have close been the subject of special measures, from a health viewpoint, which recent Australian have faUed to take. That is not the case, and in the interests of rational discussion on the matter I extend what I have just said to include the Whitlam Labor Government, of which the honourable member for Reid was a member. I also point out here that 'discrete', a term it has been revealed was used in my subto Cabinet, does not mean there is a solid lump of pure plutonium metal buried at Maralinga. The term relates to an indidistinct quantity that was buried, comon prising discs which were shattered during experiments, after which the plutonium was put into cylinders, along with the material surrounding it, and the group of cylinders buried together in the one pit. This aggregation of concentrated material in sealed containers in the one spot is in sharp contrast to the remainder of the plutonium at MaraUnga which is dispersed in more than I emphasise the word n the pits. Thefirstrequirement will be to conduct the refor connaissance. That reconnaissance shall say whether or not the plutonium is recoverable. If it is recoverable it will certainly be no easy task to undertake under properly controlled conditions. It needs to be kept in mind that recovery would involve two processes: Exhumation of the burial, and extraction of the plutonium. For practical reasons, the Government would greatly have preferred to have dealt with this matter as part of its broader program for the long-term environmental management of the general area. It has, however, decided that action on the halfkilogram should be accelerated, and that is what my Cabinet submission was about. One reason was that, if the material is indeed recoverable, our international obligations require that it be dealt with. The second was that, even if the risk of circumstances arising in which the plutonium might be exhumed illegally are infinitesimally small at present, the material should not be left there-if recoverable-agains t an unforseeable future. It is characteristic of a certain kind of so-called journalism in this country that certain sections my Cabinet submissions were reported accuhave rately, while other parts were selected for distortermine tion to contrive a mixture that would create sensational impact and alarm the public. My tonium, submission did not suggest that the material currently a terrorist threat; it did not say there were no deterrents to its theft; it did not suggest could, under the present circumstances, be stolen; and it did not say that the (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had been warned that the material created a terrorist problem. What I did say is that the material could conceivably, in the future, become ariskin a terrorist context-if in its present burial state. I could not readily envisage circumstances which that threat might materialise. But I know that one of the requirements for the burial situation. to become a threat would be the widespread dissemination of knowledge of the potential recoverability of the material before it had been recovered by the authorities. That is why the possibiUty of recovery was being closely held until the reconnaissance had been conducted. was an obvious responsibUity to withhold that consideration untU the reconnaissance done. It was an act of irresponsibUity that blazoned it across the newspapers. mind that made thefirstimproper revelation to a newspaper. That act of revelation is to be deeply despised. It merits no mere indignation but the severest sanction. There has been an enhancement of surveillance over the airfield site. When journalists from Adelaide sought last Friday to prove otherprevent wise, one of the policemen to whom they had, in fact, arrived at MaraUnga that morning. That did not stop the Press in question from alleging that no new measures had been takenanother instance of people saying what they want to believe about this matter, not what is true. I do not intend to state here the detaUs of the additional measures. They certainly include more than one additional poUceman. They are adequate. In applying itself to the task of selectively misreporting a leaked Cabinet document, one newspaper has also suggested that the document demonstrated that the Atomic Energy Commission could not handle the substance if it were exhumed. That, quite simply, is another untruth. The point is that by exhuming the burial, Australia would be obliged to enter the plutonium it contains on the inventory of fissionable materials in Australian territory which Australia maintains with the IAEA under its obligations deriving from the nuclear non-proliferation of treaty. Substances entered on such inventories to be subjected torigorousanalysis to detheir exact quantity and characteristics. a But the point is that we do not want the pluwe have no use for it, and the costly task was of undertaking a thorough analysis of the material would meet no practical Austrahan purit pose. Britain, by contrast, would not be obliged under the NPT to characterise the material when Prime Minister taking it into inventory. This is one reason why the return of the material to the British may be the more desirable left option. Much, however, will depend on whether the reconnaissance on the ground verifies the judgment reached from the analysis of the docuin ments. Arrangements have been made for a joint do investigation with British officials of the Sir, those are the facts and those are the considerations. Those are the actions this Government is taking. We wtil not let the pointless events of the past few days deflect us from the reIt sponsible, rational and measured approach we have been adopting in this matter. I present the had been following paper: Radioactive Material at Maralinga-Ministeria l StateIt was an evil ment, 11 October 1978. Motion (by Mr Staley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Staley)-by leave-agree d to: That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speaking for a spoke period not exceeding 35 minutes.",57
121,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"The Opposition will always adopt a bipartisan policy when discussing a matter of truth and public interest but in this case we say and propose to prove that what we have had is a series of half-truths, misleading information and a cover-up for some period of years. The statement read by the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) is some 26 pages in length. Pages 6 to 14 are matters of record; I think that is clear. Therefore, we have to look at what the defence of the Government is. We acknowledge immediately there is a problem. The Mmister himself says that. There is plutonium there. For thefirsttime this is acknowledged as a problem. Now after 25 years some action has to be taken by the Government. We are not here to malign any particular Minister but let us look at the record to see how it is put to the Parhament today. On page 1 it says quite forcibly, in effect: 'Well, people hke myself and all my former colleagues should have known what happened. The records were available to them.' We only took office in 1972. We had no knowledge of the matters that were there as far as Maralinga was concerned. It is a very weak argument indeed to say that because we were in Government we should have known what happened at Maralinga some 20 years before that. I have taken the liberty-no t knowing the Minister was going to make that statement-to discuss the matter with some of my colleagues who were responsible, not the least of whom would be Mr Barnard. I obtained a most illuminating answer when I telephoned him this morning. He said: . I never knew there was any plutonium there. I asked my Department what was there and they said: 'All you have to worry about is the question of contamination.' In other words, he was misled by the Defence Department. This is a very serious accusation to make because the Minister has made it on the basis that we should have known and that our Ministers did not behave properly. I put it to the Minister that an honourable man, Mr Barnard, made an inquiry from his own Department and he was misled. Mr Killen-Whom did he ask?",60
122,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"You can ask Mr Barnard. You know him well. He would not be telling a he. The other point is, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said today, he also inquired of other Ministers. But I shall take the onus of saying I spoke to Mr Barnard this morning. If you look at the Hansard you see Mr Barnard asking questions in 1972, before obtained office, of your present compatriot, the Minister for Special Trade Representations, Garland, who was giving answers in 1972 which were misleading as to the present situation. Mr Barnard, who said he had received information on a high level that there was some problem at Maralinga, got an answer from Mr Garland to this effect: There have been a series of tests and they are enumerated. There are no real problems. We have monitored the area. We know what is there and we have discovered nothing unexpected. This is the position of your predecessors, your governments of the earlier period. They would now come into this House and say: 'All the responsibility is with you people. You should have known.' That is the information that we are expected to rely upon, information given by Ministers in answers to questions in 1972 and we would accept that to be the situation. So why would Mr Barnard go off suddenly in 1973 and 1974 to find out whether there was plutonium there when the answer was given by the Defence Department-o r the Minister for Supply in that case, and it is not exempt-as to what the position was? It was misleading information of the Government at the time and it is still the position. We want to make it very clear that they went on to indicate what had happened about the burial and there were no real problems. Then you get into the problem of doubtful physics by the Minister then saying in 1972 that the particular waste disposal material was only of concern for its halflife of 15 or 20 years when he really meant 150 years and 250 years; he forgot to use the multiplying factor of 10. Let us look at the situation as to what has happened that might have encouraged this Government to take a little more got interest in the situation. I want to put it on this basis, not on the basis that we were supposed to find out something, but there could have been people in the Defence Department who did go to the trouble of finding out something. I do not know. I have never met the gentleman I propose to mention but I have a feeling when I look at the Press reports of February 1977 that there is a bit of a clue as to the situation. It comes from the Chief Defence Scientist, Dr Farrands, and I would wager now that Dr Farrands was not satisfied at all and he was in a position to find out after the Labor Government left office. You see clearly the position as outlined in the Sydney Morning Herald of 11 February 1977: Doubts cast on nuclear dump. You can see a reference to Dr Farrands's report we as being studied by the Minister and that: . . . Mr Kilien has received separate advice Mr . . to improve the nuclear waste safeguards. This is very mteresting because I would say that is the source which started the Government saying that perhaps there is something more serious. Dr Farrands is telling us that perhaps what we were told for years before is not really true. My colleague, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), was raising questions about safeguards at the time, pursuing the whole question of information coming out of the Government. I would say it was because there was a person, another scientist in the Defence Department, who said: 'Let us have another look at this situation. Is it true that all the information is given?' So it is understood that Dr Farrands found that the radioactive waste, although emitting no radiation at ground level, was buried in a way which was not adequate by today's nuclear standards. Now we want to have the truth for the people of Austraha, the people of South Austraha and the Government of South Australia because this is the most serious aspect of the cover-up position. You are not exempt at any stage, by bringing in the defence here that: 'You should have known'. The position occurred in the early 50's and carried through into the 60's. The person responsible, obviously, was Sir Robert Menzies. We are not raising that in any indictment of him but his own Minister, Mr Beale, has raced into print to clearly show, as recently as 6 October, that when he was the responsible Minister he did not know what was gomg to happen. He was in the category of'no need to know', that is, as he said, the then Prime Minister had made a decision and he was not to be told. He then said that he became furious. Tbis quesuon of temper and temperament is always a veneer for ignorance. It does not add up to any strength in a Minister. The plain fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister of the day, Sir Robert Menzies, decided and told the British they could carry out the explosions in Australia. He did not tell anybody else, including his own Ministers. Let us have that on the record. It is very difficult to duct a post-mortem examination on a body that has been underground for 20 years when one is trying to do it from the surface. The real pomt would have been to have very looked at the problems when the explosions took place over that period of time, but that was not done. That is the position about which we are complaining. We do not know exactly what hapis pened. Obviously Menzies did know. Beale United professes to know on the basis that he got a bit excited and was told about it. He might have been told about it, but what was done about What was buried there? The issue is now dragged out on the basis that everything is in order. The Government has said that it entered into an agreement in 1968 which was a mutual exclusion agreement that there was no responsibUity on either side. When we look at who was mvolved in 1968, Ministers such as the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the present Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) were in the Cabinet in that period. What action did they take before they signed the clearing agreements? There is no mention of this in the Minister's statement, not a word. The poor unfortunate member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), who is not here today, I trunk can gain some comfort from this statement. At least he set up the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Committee. At least he created it and encouraged it to do something about the matter, and the Minister for Defence admits that. The Minister is stUl relying on that body to get some further information. Do not let us have an indictment dealing with a particular period of time and say what should have happened in the 1950s and 1960s. We got more information yesterday from a Press release issued by the British High Commission than we have ever got from this Government. In a statement of one and a half pages the British High Commissioner had no trouble at all in telhng us that there had been a series of explosions there up to 1963. Mr Kilien-Not explosions.",60
123,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"We will argue that in a moment. We do not want to get involved in the fine detaU of higher physics because neither of us is going to pass. At this stage let us look at the statement. Apart from nuclear explosions, there were some minor experiments. The period I am talking about is up to 1963. A very interesting aspect is raised by the reporter whom the Minister has maUgned today. He was just doing his job as a reporter for the Australian Financial Review, and he said that we should look at the notes conmade by Eisenhower's special adviser, a fellow called Kistiakowsky, who made an entry in his diary in 1960, saying that he had a discussion with Lord Penney, the British scientist, about what was happening at MaraUnga. It was to be a secret matter indeed and it was to be on the basis of the latest technology for triggering nuclear devices by using a small nuclear reaction, not a full explosion. That may be the situation. It interesting to note that it is on record in the States. I do not think that this Government knew about it. It was never told. If we look at what was happening then in the defence area, it? and perhaps this is relevant today, there are people in Australia who deem that they have more responsibiUty to their own group than to a parliament or to a Minister. That is a very serious situation. A very small coterie of people say that they know what is best for Austraha. There are nuclear scientists who are not interested in the general pohtical management of Austraha. They want to see atomic weapons or nuclear proliferation because that is their particular bent. That situation can flow through a defence structure, and a parUament can be denied accurate mformation about what happened. I have no doubt that Lord Penney would have discussed this with Australian scientists, but did they put it on record? They might have told Menzies at the time but he did not tell anybody else, and there we have the position of the Maralinga cover-up. In the statement yesterday issued by the British High Commission there is reference to the fact that 'experimentation', if not nuclear explosions, occurred up to 1963. It covered an extensive period of time. There was a further explosion, which has not been detailed here, at Christmas Island-the British Christmas Island, not the Australian Christmas Island-whic h apparently involved the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. The washings from the aircraft were buried at MaraUnga. That explosion was in addition to all the others. So we have this position of explosions over a long period of time. The Government in Australia apparendy was informed about the tests but did not teU the Parliament about and, obviously did not know what was happening to, the residue of radioactive material or plutonium. Yesterday we learned from the British that at least half a kUogram of plutonium was buried in a special segment caUed a discrete mass. That resulted from 'minor experiments' which involved the shattering of smaU discs of plutonium into numerous fragments. The Minister is prepared to go on record and say that there was nothing wrong with that, that it did not really amount to a nuclear explosion, that it did not amount to experimenting with a triggering device which might detonate a larger bomb. But what did it do? That is the question that the honourable member for Reid has raised. Was it in one way a breach of the agreement made by the super powers, including Britain, between 19S8 and 1961, that no atomic tests would be conducted? That issue is somewhat wide of the issue we are discussing today, which relates to the residue, to the faUure of government policy, and to a cover-up. But we got yesterday from the British High Commission the information that they were experimenting at least in some form with the shattering of plutonium discs into numerous fragments. I have no doubt that the world at large would be interested to know what actuaUy happened. They would not have been doing that just as an exercise. Where is the Government's poUcy on the issue of nuclear proliferation and the problems of waste? The Government is anxious to export uranium at any price, at any time, and as much as it can get out of the ground, if the people of Austraha will let it. Yet as soon as a problem appears on the Government's doorstep it is gasping to find a solution. The Government has no real supervisory or regulatory commission to organise what is happening in Australia in relation to radioactive wastes and their safeguard and treatment, or in relation to plutonium. The Government is selling to the world the natural oxide from which plutonium is created, from which nuclear wastes are created. It could not care less if it exported those troubles somewhere else. It is interested only in the money. But when we have our own problems in Australia the Minister shows great concern, as he should. There has been a great cover-up by previous governments, and there should not have been. The people of Austraha have been misled. I come now to the critical situation of what has been happening since 1976. Obviously a situation flows from Farrands making some investigations and statements. The Minister was informed about it, and questions were asked in the House. He had to write letters in answer to letters written to him. In the Minister's letters, and we can see again the inconsistency of this, he referred not to a discrete mass of half a kUogram of plutonium-h e did not know, or if he did know he did not disclose it-bu t to a mass of some 20 kilograms of plutonium, which indicates just how unsatisfactory the whole situation is. I have no doubt that if the Minister had known he would have said so, and he obviously was not told. That is the sort of thing that can happen. It is a very dangerous and disastrous situation when Government Ministers are not informed by the so-called elite, who have no responsibUity to the democratic process. Perhaps we ought to get Dr Farrands here and ask him how it happened. I understand that he would have some views about the situation. He would have some views about people who should have disclosed information previously. This is an important part of democracy. We have a Government which does not have a poUcy for uranium. It reUes on some specious argument that Ministers of a Labor Government should have known. But we are talking about the period from 1952 to 1963. We are talking about the likes of Sir Robert Menzies, Howard Beale, Mr Garland and others. It can be readily seen that they were the ones who should have known, could have known, and failed. The Parhament was misled in 1972 and it was misled again recently by the Minister's letter, which said that there was no real problem. Mr Kilien-That is simply not true.",61
124,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,It is simply true and the Minister knows that now. We learned from the British High Commission that the existence of half a kilogram of plutonium was not disclosed before. The Minister would have disclosed that information if he had known of it. When he wrote the letter of 3 February he was not told. Mr Kilien-It was not until the Australian Safeguards Office,63
125,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"Let me make the point: I suggest that Farrands knew. I suggest that a number of other people knew. The nuclear scientist, Titterton, however, has said that it did not exist. He must have egg all over his face. He was responsible for giving some advice and he has gone on record as saying: 'How could it possibly exist? It is worth $250,000. You do not think we would leave it there?' Now it is known to be there, and that is the situation we face in this Parliament. The Parliament has been misled. The people of Australia have been misled. The truth has not been told, and we now have to wait for a team of British scientists to come here from the United Kingdom to tell us what is there. How sUIy can you get! These are very serious matters indeed because they relate to the poUcy of the Government. What aids does the Government have to supervise the situation? We have nothing like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States, which is composed of two scientists and two others and which investigates, on an bUity independent basis, the nuclear activities of the government and its departments. That is what we need in this country. We put that to the Government on 3 May as being a reasonable proach that would get the Government off the hook from the point of view of its mistakes or inabUity to understand a report to the Parliament as to what was happening as regards nuclear waste, plutonium and general activities. We the ridiculous example of the possibiUty of a train carrying uranium oxide being lost in Rockhampton. All that the Minister for National policy. Development could say when answering a question on this matter was that it was the responsihad bUity of the Queensland RaUways. How ridicutoday lous is it to have this sort of lack of control what we are about. The Minister talks about there being 800 tonnes of rubble. There is a lot of argument about the use of the word 'rubble'. A fair section of it is high level radioactive waste with a long life and the Minister has no right to come into this chamber and say that it is rubble and does not count for anything. There is a considered opinion that it counts for a lot because it is high level radioactive waste. The plutonium has a Ufe of 24,000 years and the other high level waste has a Ufe of 150 years to 200 years. Is it buried in safe containers? Nobody can give us the answer to that. That is the pomt we are making. We have not been told the real position. We were never gomg to be told the real position untU the Minister, for some reason known only to himself, decided to make a Cabinet submission about this half-ltilogram of plutonium. We are not here to attack the Mmister as to whether he was talking about terrorism, but I remind him of a Courier Mail article which states: The Defence Minister last night admitted that dangerous plutonium waste existed at Maralinga in South Australia 'in a potentially recoverable form by potential terrorists'. Mr Kilien-Potential .",63
126,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"Yes. I think it is a fair argument to say that a potential terrorist is Ukely to have some abUity to get at the waste. The Minister made that remark about potential terrorists, but now he is saying that we need not worry about the word 'potential'. The British came out and said: 'That's damn ridiculous. How are you going to get rid of the over-burden and get to it?' Mr Kilien-The scientists do not agree on it.",63
127,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"I am here to argue the case for telling the people of Australia what they want to know. They want the truth and the facts and they want to know where the responsiUes. Let us put the matter on the basis of what has happened today. The real issue is this: The governments of the 1950s and the 1960s should have found out about this matter as they aphad the chance to do so, but they did nothing about it. The secret agreement between Australia its and Great Britain is not to be disclosed at alland that is a serious matter. WUl we ever know what actually happened? WUl we ever know had what is buried at MaraUnga? That is the problem. We should not have been left with this problem. It is an indictment of our not having a This brings me to another point. I have just handed to me a copy of an urgent message from Don Dunstan, the Premier of South over Australia, to the Prime Minister. Mr Dunstan is very concerned about what is happening. He makes the point that the South Austrahan Government has been unable to get any information on this matter for a long time. Mr Kilien-It has the reports.",63
128,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"It has not got the information. Let me hit the Minister with this problem. I spoke with Mr Hudson, a Minister of the South Austrahan Government, who said: T saw Jim Kilien in late 1976 and I went and saw the Department. I got the strong impression that the Department was covering up the whole thing because I could not find out any more information. Kilien said he would let me have some information, but later on he said that it was a matter for Newman. I have heard nothing from him since'. That is the position. 'Since' is two years ago. The Minister himself was promising to make statements in 1976 and 1977, but no further statements were made. Mr Kilien- I wrote to the honourable member for Reid. I honoured every obligation.",64
129,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"A statement in the Age of 5 February says: . . . Mr Kilien will soon provide details of nuclear waste buried at Maralinga . . . Mr Kilien is also expected to reveal for the first time the extent and nature of weapons testing at Maralinga. I am not holding the Minister to that statement, but when we look at what Mr Hudson said we see that it adds up to the fact that he was very concerned. Today the Prime Minister has received a telex from the South Austrahan Premier saying that he wants a full public inquiryand he is entitled to that inquiry. He is entitled to know what the position is, because the Minister, according to his statement, is going to leave the Premier with the whole problem. The Minister's statement indicates that as soon as the Federal Government gets a clearance it will opt out straight away. It will say: 'The site has been cleared. It is all a matter for the South Australian Government now. They can have it'. That appears on page 20 of the Minister's prepared statement. It refers to the issues to be addressed by Commonwealth and State powers and responsibUities and to suitable administrative arrangements. Reading between the lines, that means that the South Austrahan Government is going to cop the problem. That is what this is all about. There has to be a situation whereby we have this Parliament a full and frank disclosure of the past and a fuU understanding of the present problems. We need a government with an underthat standing of environmental and safety issues; government with a policy as to how to control nuclear waste disposal. It is no good relying on an economic theory that we can just give the problem to someone else overseas and not worry about it ourselves. The Government has a moral responsibUity to have the same sort of Nuclear Regulatory Commission as the United States. If we had such a body now we could appeal to it as an independent group to give us an analysis of the situation. Indeed, if it had existed in the 1950s and the 1960s, the present incompetent situation would never have arisen. We would never have had this outmoded method of waste disposal whereby we expect the people of South Australia, particularly the Aborigines who move across the area, to put up with the situation from the point of view of hazards. We just do not know what to do and the British have left us with the problem. Perhaps they will now want the plutonium if it is worth a quarter of a mUlion dollars. We would be happy to think that they were wUUng to take it originally. But it is not so much the plutonium, it is also the high level radioactive waste. We can see the extent of this problem by reading what Mr Dunstan said. He said: On a matter of such fundamental significance to public health and safety as the proper disposal of plutonium and other high level radioactive wastes, it is essential that the fullest information on security and other precautions should be assembled. The South Australian Government therefore urgently requests that you estabhsh, without delay, a full public enquiry into all aspects of the disposal of plutonium and other radioactive substances at or near Maralinga, whether these substances are derived from the English tests carried out in that area or otherwise. My Government believes that a searching pubhc enquiry of this nature is essential if full and effective information is to be gathered, and the quite understandable fears of the public at large are to be allayed. I seek your, urgent attention to this matter, and a response as soon as possible. I should be glad to discuss these matters with you directly or to make available senior officers to pursue matters of detail. That message was sent today. It shows the concern that the South Australian Government has had on this matter for two years. I would assume that nothing would have happened had Farrands, or someone else, not raised this matter in 1976 or 1977 because that was when there was some signal that all was not well. That was what alerted us. We want a person Uke Farrands to be advising the Government on this issue. We do not want the miserable approach that has been adopted today of saying that the Labor Government should have known. We were all named, in in a litany of seats. The Minister knows very well that we were misled in 1972 by the then Minister for Supply when he gave an answer to the effect he knew what was there and there was no a problem. I spoke to Barnard today and he confirmed that he had relied on that answer. When he asked his own Depanment about the matter he was told that there was no plutonium there. Mr Kilien-To whom did he speak?",64
130,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"The Minister can ask him. To whom did the Minister speak in 1976 and 1977? The Minister wrote a letter on 3 February and never disclosed the fact that there was a separate, discrete mass of plutonium. The Minister did not mention that. Mr Kilien-That did not emerge.",65
131,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"No, it did not emerge, but the plutonium emerged there in 1955. Why did it not emerge in 1967 and 1968 if the Government had a clearance agreement with the British? It would have had to emerge from the point of view of the facts. But how can we get the facts ifwe have to allow a lapse of time of 10 or 15 years-in this case, 25 years? How can the Minister argue a case on that basis when his Government had the responsibUity to reveal the facts? That is what this is all about. When the Opposition tries to seek information, which is its responsibUity, a cover-up process goes on. When a journalist does his duty in the interests of the ParliamentMrKillen-Duty!",65
132,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"Yes , duty. What did is he do that was so secret? The British High Comthe mission releases a Press statement saying the same thing. What was so secret about it? How ridiculous can the Minister get in talking about the Crimes Act or something else! The British had no compunction about saying: 'Of course responsibUity there is a special half a kUo there. We will tell how it happened. It happened in six or seven vaUd minor experiments concerning sphtting a disc of plutonium'. There was no secret about it, but it was never told to the Austrahan nation, to the Australian people. That is the problem we face today. It is the problem of a government faUs to have any poUcies in this regard. The deceit and deception surrounding Maralinga was very much a forerunner of the deceit and decepexpected tion of Vietnam. That is the real issue. In the of Vietnam there were letters, other forms of corthe respondence and false issues. The letter that went to Washington from people who held very high office was to the effect that it would be good political hokum to sent a battalion to Vietnam. The White Paper on our involvement ister in Vietnam points up this fact: How is the Government going to run a strong democracy if it faUs to take its own people mto its confidence.",65
133,Mr HODGMAN,MARALINGA,How do you run a strong democracy with a weak Opposition?,65
134,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,That is the point we are making. How do you expect to maintain a strong point of view?,65
135,Mr HODGMAN,MARALINGA,A weak Opposition destroys a democracy.,65
136,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"We are weak in numbers but we are pretty strong today from the point of view of truth and honesty. I do not think anybody in Austraha would accept the ratbag sort of answer that has been given, that is: 'We will name the Ministers who should have known in 1972'. Mr Kilien-We did not say that.",65
137,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"Not even you would stoop to that level, to suggest that because someone is able to name some Ministers in the past they are the ones to blame, knowing very well that the whole issue is one of secrecy and cover-up. Only today a member of a responsible State government claimed that it has been trying for two years to get information.",65
138,Mr HODGMAN,MARALINGA,This is not one of your better performances. It is one of your worse performances.,65
139,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MARALINGA,"I am not interested in your judgment of people. I am interested in what happening to the people of Australia. That is issue today. Cut out the smart interjections. Talk about whether the likes of Menzies, Beale and others did not do their job by Austraha. That is the question today. Perhaps the Minister for Defence, who is sitting opposite, is exempt from in this respect because he was not a you member of Cabinet at the time. But it is not a argument for a Minister to come in here and malign aU of my coUeagues, some of whom are no longer members of this place, on the basis that they should have known. The Minister knows what the situation should have been. He that in this matter. We have urgedstill knows that the Government has not policies the Government to set up an independent group. It cannot now be to rely on information given by a decase partment that perhaps does not always want to disclose the information or is unable to disclose mformation. We have the ridiculous situation that we do not know what is buried at Maralinga. a The British know, but we have no access to the information. It is wrong, quite wrong, for a Minto come in here and say: 'Everything will be in order, we are going to get the British out to advise us'. My suggestion to the Government is that there should be a public inquiry. Accordingly, because of what has happened, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this House censures the Government for its incompetence and failure to adopt responsible nuclear policies and its misleading and contradictory tish atomic weapons tests and forthwith calls upon the Government to appoint an independent committee of inquiry to report upon(1) the disposal of plutonium and all other radioacuve waste materials in Australia, (2) the health of the Aboriginal populauon near the weapons test area environmental management of those areas, and (3) the need to estabUsh a nuclear safeguards, safety and security commission.",65
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MARALINGA,Is the amendment seconded? ,66
141,Mr UREN,MARALINGA," I second the amendment and I wish to speak now. There is one certain thing which can be said about MaraUnga: This Parhament and the Australian public have not been told the full story. Instead, a succession of Liberal-National Country Party Ministers have made misleading and contradictory statements to the Parliament and outside the Parliament about Maralinga. Public concern has been answered with a series of untruths and halftruths about the testing that took place at MaraUnga and about the waste that now remains and the hazard within this country at present. There are many unanswered questions and unresolved problems associated with Maralinga. There are serious questions concerning the health of Australian citizens, especiaUy Aboriginals, concerning Australia's sovereignty and whether the Australian Government always has been kept informed of events on Australian soU, concerning the hazards of waste which remains at Maralinga and the cost to Australian taxpayers of policing the nuclear waste for 300,000 years, the time it will take before it loses its toxicity. The Opposition beUeves that a fuU pubUc inquiry must be held in order to answer these questions. It is time that the pubhc was given all the facts about Marahnga. Answers to legitimate health and safety concerns are long overdue. It is clear that many problems associated with Maralinga have not been resolved. The Government's earlier slick assurances about nuclear wastes, nuclear safeguards and the health risks of radiation are even less convincing when we examine the record at Marahnga. It simply cannot or will not provide a straight-forward answer to the most basic questions. We must now be given the answers. MaraUnga is a stark example of the bankruptcy of this Government's uranium pohcy. So many problems are still unresolved in relation to the whole nuclear business. Let us look at the statements which were made by successive Liberal Ministers. On 14 Sepstatements about Britember 1972 in this House the Minister for Supply was asked a question by Mr Barnard concerning whether nuclear wastes had been brought from Britain for dumping at Maralinga. Later the same day the Minister produced a pubUc statement and later that day he spoke in the adjournment debate in the House in which he in South Australia and the future said: AU radioactive waste buried at three places in AustraliaMonte Bello Islands, Emu and Maralinga-resulte d from experiments conducted at those places.",66
142,Unknown,MARALINGA,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,66
143,Mr UREN,MARALINGA,"If we now look at the answer given on 16 February 1977 by the Minister for Defence to a question on notice from E. G. Whitlam we find that he revealed that the waste from Christmas Island nuclear tests which resulted from washings of the British aircraft that flew to Edinburgh airfield in South Australia, were buried at MaraUnga. This directly contradicts earlier statements by the then Minister for Supply. Why did that Minister not provide this information to the House in 1972? Was he aware of these facts? If not, why not? What is clear is that this Parliament was misled by the Minister who now serves as the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland). I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the four statements to which I have referred. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsRadioactive Waste",66
144,Mr BARNARD,MARALINGA,"I ask the Minister for Supply: Have quantities of radioactive waste from British nuclear establishments been dumped in Australia? In particular were lead-lined boxes of radioactive waste flown from Britain and buried on the Maralinga testing site? If so, how much of this material was dumped? When did the dumping start and when did it cease? Why was this practice not disclosed to the Australian public?",66
145,Mr GARLAND,MARALINGA,"The honourable member has been careful not to make any statement about the source of the allegations and I think that that in itself is significant. I have no knowledge of the allegations he has made and I will certainly look into the matter. Referring to those areas in the MaraUnga region which I mentioned in an answer to a question yesterday, might I say that the British Government spent a very large sum of money making areas as safe as possible by pouring great quantities of concrete to fill in areas that had been dug deep, and in restoring the surface area as much as possible. All of this took place nearly 20 years ago. The radioactive material present in those areas has in the main a half Ufe of some 15 or 20 years, I think, from memory and so its effect, deep and buried and covered as it is, has been very much diminished in that time. However, I will make inquiries in relation to the particular charge which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made. Statement by Minister for Supply NA (Statement by the Minister for Supply, the Hon. R. V. Garland, M.P.) The Minister for Supply, Mr R. V. Garland, during the Adjournment Debate in the House of Representatives on 14 September, said: 'Today I was asked a question by the Hon. the Deputy Leader of the Opposition which implied that radioacuve wastes from Britain had been flown to Australia and buried at Maralinga. 'Because of the nature of the allegation implicit in Mr Barnard's question, I had urgent inquiries made of the Depaitment of Supply. As a result I have been informed follows: ""There is no known foundation for the allegation. ""All radioacuve waste buried at three places in Australia, Monte Bello, Emu and Maralinga, resulted from experiments conducted at those places. ""Relatively small areas at ively for the disposal of waste from experiments in Australia. The places were never intended for the burial of radioactive waste from Britain. ""No request by the British to bury, in Australia, waste from their nuclear establishments has been made and certainly no such permission has ever been given. ""We have monitored the areas, we know what is there and we have discovered nothing unexpected in our monitoring either in nature or quantity. ""Of course we have never produced nuclear weapons or bombs in Australia. So it is clear that the original radioactive material required for the range of experiments had to be brought from Britain. It is possible that in some cases it arrived by air in lead-lined boxes. ""But what is buried at Maralinga and the other places is purely the radioacuve waste from the experiments ducted with this original material. ""As I indicated this morning, buried in the Maralinga area is covered by thick layers of concrete and is well below the casual entry is insignificant. Two of these sites remain in the new Woomera prohibited area and the third, close to the Maralinga airstrip, is adequately fenced so that it can properly controlled should Maralinga itself ever be used centre of population or as a tourist attraction. ""These sites are not considered dangerous for visits"".' Statement by Minister for Supply",66
146,Mr GARLAND,BURIAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) for finding that me to speak now. During question time today the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question which implied that radioactive wastes from the United Kingdom had been flown to Australia and buried at Maralinga in South Australia. Because of the nature of the allegation impUcit his question, I had urgent inquiries made by the Department of Supply. As a result, I have been informed as follows: There is no known foundation for the allegation. All radioactive waste buried at 3 places in Australia-Mont e Bello Islands, Emu and Maralinga-resulte d from experiments carried conducted at those places. Relatively small areas at those places were used exclusively for the disposal of waste from experiments in Australia. The places were never intended for the burial of radioactive waste from Britain. No request by the British to bury in Australia waste from their nuclear establishments has been made and certainly no such permission has ever been given. We have monitored the areas, we know what is there and we have discovered nothing unexpected in our monitoring either in nature or quantity. Of course we have never produced nuclear weapons or bombs in Australia. So it is clear that the original radioactive material required for the range of experiments had to be brought from Britain. It is possible that in some cases it arrived by air in lead lined boxes. But what is buried at Maralinga and the other places is purely the radioactive waste from the experiments conducted with this original material. As I indicated this morning, all the radioactive material buried in the Maralinga area is covered by thick layers of as concrete and is well below the surface where the risk from casual entry is insignificant. Two of these sites remain in the new Woomera prohibited areas, as gazetted today, and the third, close to the Maralinga airstrip, is adequately fenced so that it can be properly controlled should Maralinga itself ever be used as a centre of population or as a tourist attraction. These sites are not considered dangerous for short term those places were used exclusvisits. I gave a copy of these remarks to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition after dinner. I take this opportunity to advise the House as the information I have just given was not avaUable by the end of the question time today. It might be of interest to honourable members to know-this information was sought of me quite recently by another honourable member-that there were 2 explosions at Emu Field in 1953, and 7 at Maralinga in 1956 and 1957.1 think I indicated at question time today, or impUed, that it was earUer than that. One of those explosions occurred on 4th October 1956 and, according to the file, no fewer than 23 members of the Parliament were present, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and 7 members ofhis Party. I do not by these remarks wish to provoke the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, though I seem to have been able to do so on more than one occasion quite recently. However, he is at the table now and I would be most interested to hear the basis of the allecongations and the circumstances which he sees. all the radioactive material Answer by Minister for Defence Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Defence, upon surface where the risk from notice: (1) What steps have been taken to verify the allegations by Dr John Coulter and Mr Avon Hudson on the radio be program AM on 2 and 3 December 1976 that the British as a Government had flown radioactive waste including plutonium from nuclear power stations in Britain to Maralinga, short-term where it was secretly buried at night. (2) Are the assurances given by the Minister for Supply in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on 14 September 1972 (Hansard, pages 1384 and 1503) still valid. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's quesformula to enable tion is as follows: (1) There has been thorough investigation of all the records and evidence has been taken from Australian officials who held responsible positions at the time. This investigation has turned up no evidence whatsoever supportin ing the allegations that radioactive waste was brought from nuclear power stations in Britain for burial at Maralinga. (2) The assurance given by Mr Garland in 1972 remains valid regarding risk. In addition to debris from experiments out in the area, some small quantities of radioactive material from the following sources are also buried at Maralinga: a. washings from British service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh Airfield for cleaning and maintenance. b. nuclear medical waste from the University of Adelaide.",67
147,Mr UREN,BURIAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE,"I thank the House. Let me now turn to the record of the present Minister for fence. On 9 December 19761 asked the Minister whether secret atomic trigger tests were conyet ducted at Maralinga between 1958 and 1961. In reply he said: I am not aware of any explosion that took place between 1958 and 1961. I am aware of tinguish from explosions, as presently advised, that took place. In a letter to me dated 3 February 1977 he said: The details of these experiments were and remain classified. However, in a book entitled Scientist at the White House, which is the private diary of George Kistiakowsky, who was President Eisenhower's scientific adviser, we find an entry for Wednesday, 30 March 1960 on pages 289 and 290 where the following remarks appear: Penney reached independantly regarding the one-point safety tests, namely, that so long as the total explosive force (of HE and nuclear charge) is due predominantly to the HE explosion and the nuclear reaction is just observable by instruments, this should be called an experiment and not a weapons test. Penney, ofcourse, was head of the United Kingdom Atomic Weapons Research EstabUshment. This book was pubUshed before the Minister said that such detaUs were classified. Was the Minister aware of these detaUs? Did he know that they former were on the public record? If not, why not? If he to general did not know, why did his Department not knowledge. know? Clearly the statement the letter to me on 3 February 1977 was quite false in that regard. Clearly his statement to the guidance Parliament in reply to my question on 9 Housing December that no explosion took place between of Defence. 1958 and 1961 was also false. The reply he gave to the Leader of the.Opposiuon (Mr Hayden) ology this morning was also false. The comments of George Kistiakowsky show that the Minister's Environment. sharp distinction between explosions and trials was more than misleading. It was a deception, if the not by the Minister, then certainly by his departpose mental advisers. I have stressed that all along. If radioactive we look at what Lord Penney said on the traUan Broadcasting Commission program AM last Friday, the Minister's deception becomes physics, clearer. He said that radioactive material was oratory tested in Uttle mock explosions at Maralinga. I later stress the word 'explosions' and because the Minister said that there were no explosions. Lord Penney referred to the explosions as small nuclear tests. The strong inference that these tests were subsequent to the atomic tests of 1957. We have had no explanation by the Minister for Defence of his statement in the House on 9 December 1976 and his letter to me on 3 February 1977. We do not know whether Dethe Minister for Defence has been fully informed by his Department-and it seems that he has not been properly informed-o r whether his Department has been fully informed by the British authorities. We in this Parhament do not know the full story of what has taken place at certain trials which I disMaraUnga. There are further examples of the Government's confusion. On 9 August 1977 the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, Mr Newman, in a statement announcing a scientific study of the Maralinga site, said: Radioacuve substances remaining after the low yield atomic tests at Maralinga from 1955to 1963 . . . This contradicts the statement by the Minister for Defence on 9 December 1976.1 seek permission to have that incorporated in Hansard. the same definition as I did Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, Mr Kevin Newman, today announced that a scientific study of the possible dispersal of radioactive material in the Maralinga area of South Australia has commenced. The survey will provide informadon on land within the Maralinga atomic test range which could be returned use. It would also contribute to general scientific Field work for the survey will begin on Thurswhich he made in day, 11 August.

The survey team will include experts in ecology, health meteorology, geology/hydrology. The field party will collect soU and biological samples for subsequent labanalysis. The analysis phase of the survey and the processing and interpretation of the data will take some keep saying it months to complete.",68
148,Mr UREN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"I thank the House. We have had no explanation from the Government of this conwas tradiction. The Minister for Defence says that there were no explosions after 1956 and the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development admitted that there were massive low yield atomic explosions through to 1963. The control. pubhc is left in the dark. The Government has buried had over a year to explain this contradiction, but tonium in its usual arrogant manner Some hysteria has been created about the possibility of terrorists acquiring the plutonium which their is buried at Maralinga. The Minister for Deissued fence, not the Opposition, raised this matter in a Cabinet submission which mentioned a discrete mass of plutonium of about half a kilogram. But and a statement issued yesterday by the British High December Commission said that there were six separate versity containers of plutonium. It therefore appears Maralinga that the Government had not been fully tivity informed by the British authorities Cabinet submission was presented. It may be that the difficulties for terrorists of acquiring this material are very great-I make that clear-but this is not the major issue. I stress that in my view this is not the major issue. smokescreen for the serious environmental quesShould a need tions which are raised by the existence of 800 Government, tonnes of radioactive rubble, including 20 ter must kilograms of plutonium, which is buried at to the Maralinga. In a letter to me on 3 February the Minister for Defence said that it was essentially a matter of long term environmental manBritish agement. I seek leave to have that letter incorments, porated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsDear Mr Uren, In Parliament on 9 December 1976 you asked a Quesuon about British experiments at Maralinga in the late 1950s and early 1960s. I promised to make inquiries and respond to you before Parliament resumed. This important matter, which is essentially one of long term environmental management, has become confused and distorted by several unfounded allegations, in particular that an unexploded nuclear weapon is buried at Maralinga; that radioactive waste was brought from British nuclear power stations and buried at Maralinga; and that about 800 tonnes of nuclear waste material, including plutonium, is buried at Maralinga, which is what the South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy was reported on 20 December 1976 to have said. Thorough investigations of all the records and evidence taken from Australian officials who held responsible positions at the time have revealed no evidence at all supporting or in any way substantiating these allegations. The radioactive debris at Maralinga is derived from three sources-Britis h nuclear tests and experiments carried out in that area some fifteen to twenty-five years ago; washings from British service aircraft which participated in the nuclear tests at Christmas Island in Edinburgh airfield for cleaning and maintenance, and nuclear medical waste from the University of Adelaide. This debris was disposed of in various ways, including storage in steel and lead boxes, burial in pits, covering with concrete slabs, ploughing in, and fencing and area While it is true that some 800 tonnes of rubble are in 21 pits, this contains some 20 kilograms of pluand it is a mistake to describe it all as 'nuclear waste it chose not to do so. material'. These arrangements were incorporated in a report by the British Government so that residual radioactivity at sites of tests would be recorded for posterity. This repon, in 1968, is held by both the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments. Surveys of the Maralinga area were undenaken in 1967 1972 by the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee. In last year Professor H. J. deBruin of Flinders Uniaccompanied a pany of South Australian Depanment of Health officials on a survey in and around the township. He reported 'that no trace of radioacin excess of natural background radiation was detectwhen the able on or near the dump'. These past surveys have not to date established a requirement for any Government to institute additional or different control and safety measures. But the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council recently recommended-in December 1976-that a further survey be made and the It is a Government is taking steps to arrange this. for any new measures become apparent this and I have no doubt its successors, will take appropriate action. I know that you will agree that this matbe kept under regular review and brought regularly attention of the Government of the day by AIRAC or 1977 its successors in the future. You referred also to the 'moratorium' during which the Government, along with the US. and Soviet Governaccepted a self-imposed obligation to refrain from the testing of nuclear weapons. This lasted from September 1958 until September 1961, when, you will recall, the Soviet Government resumed testing of nuclear weapons. During this period the then British Government conducted various experiments at Maralinga. The details of these experiments were, and remain classified. The British Government has 3 Feb 1977 advised that: 'No atomic devices were exploded during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, and no unexploded nuclear device was buried.' I do not consider that a Royal Commission is required into these matters or could serve any useful purpose now. The forthcoming environmental survey should add further data assisting governmental decisions about the continuing secure management of the material at Maralinga. As I say, it will be important to keep under regular review the adequacy of the protective and control measures in the Maralinga area. Yours sincerely, D. J. KILLEN The Hon. T. Uren, M.P., Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 3c-5 1st Floor, Granville Towers, 10 Bridge Street, Granville, N.S.W. 2142.",68
149,Mr UREN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"I thank the House. This is where the Government's record is most disturbing. For a start, the Minister for Defence says that there are 20 kilograms of plutonium at Maralinga; but 1957-58 and which later flew to I am privately informed that actually 41 kilograms is buried at Marahnga. Nowhere has the Government set out in a straightforward way what radioactive materials are buried there. We have never been told for how long these materials will remain toxic, for how long we will have to continue to monitor them and how much that will cost the Austrahan taxpayers. We know that plutonium is deadly for hundreds of thousands of years. We do not know where these materials could move in the ground water and in the food chains over these long periods of time. The glib answers of the Minister for Supply in 1972 were that the materials had a half-hfe of 15 to 20 years. We know now that that is nonsense and that the plutonium is there. He had plenty of opportunity to correct himself but he did not do so. In a letter to me on 3 February 1977 the Minister for Defence made reassuring remarks about surveys of the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee, but we know how reUable they were. That Committee was shown to be a group of nuclear hawks. It consistently supported French nuclear tests in the Pacific and said that they sented no health risk. That view has been totally discredited in this country. It is well known that the Ranger inquiry commissioners were less happy with the objectivity of the Committee's most prominent member, Professor Sir Ernest Titterton. The Minister for Defence also mentioned the 1968 report of the British Government's waste which remains at Maralinga. But where is that report? In signing a memorandum of agreement at that time the Austrahan Government sold out the Australian people's interest to the British Government. What protection has the Austrahan Government against the enormous cost of poUcing this plutonium over the years. The waste at Maralinga has never been made public for independent assessment. It is the extreme secrecy of the Liberal-National Country party governments and the gross negligence of the nuclear hawks which advise them which has left future generations of Australians with the legacy of Rum Jungle and now of Maralinga. On 9 August last year the then Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development announced a scientific study into the Maralinga wastes. Why did it take so long? Why was not this done in 1972 when this matter was first raised? There are serious health questions associated with Maralinga which have not yet been answered. I was contacted last year by a group of men who had been Commonwealth policemen at MaraUnga in the 1950s. Four of their group of seven have died of cancer since working at Maralinga. This sample may not prove anything in real terms but it raises serious questions which must be further investigated. But the Government refuses to do this. The United States Government is now engaged in a study of the health of personnel previously involved in atomic tests. I asked the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) on 11 April this year whether he would institute a sinular inquiry but he refused to do so. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the question and answer. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsAtomic Tests: Radiation (Question No. 921) Mr Uren asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 11 April 1978: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the United States Government's follow-up study on personnel who were involved in their past atomic testing programs. (2) Will the Australian Government institute a sinular inquiiy amongst all persons who worked at Maralinga, South Australia, during the years 1950 to 1965 in order to ascertain pre- what ill-effects they may have suffered.",69
150,Mr HUNT,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) AU personnel working at MaraUnga were subject to stringent health procedures. Their activities in the field were strictly controlled and they were constantly monitored to ensure that they were not exposed to dangerous radiation. The majority of those who were conducting and monitoring the tests at MaraUnga were UK personnel. Any follow-up studies on those persons would be a matter for the UK Government to decide upon. Because of the stringent monitoring procedures undertaken at the rime and the fact that they were not exposed to dangerous radiation, there is no proposal to institute studies on Australians who were in support of the UK activities at Maralinga from the rear areas.",70
151,Mr UREN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"I thank the House. The Minister tries to brush the issue aside by saying that strict monitoring procedures were undertaken at the time. This is irrelevant. Cancers do not show up for many years after the cause. What efforts were made to monitor Aboriginals who were in the vicinity of Maralinga during and after the tests? We have heard nothing from the Government on these serious charges and questions raised by Mr Connolly, a business man of Perth, Western Australia in December 1976. The whole Maralinga story is one of negUgence, dishonesty and secrecy on behalf of Liberal-National Country party governments. The pubUc would know nothing of the serious unresolved problems associated with Maralinga if it were not for the courageous attitude of a few people who previously worked at Maralinga and some public servants. I must give credit to Mr Brian Toohey, a journalist from the Australian Financial Review.",70
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable members time has expired.,71
153,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,I seek leave to make a personal explanation because I have been misrepresented.,71
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,The honourable member for Hindmarsh may proceed.,71
155,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"The Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) stated during the course of his address that I among others should have known, or did know, that there had been this storage of plutonium at Marahnga. The innuendo at any rate was that I was supplied with the information which has been extracted from the present Minister over the last couple of years. The Labor Cabinet was never told any of the facts relating to Maralinga. I am satisfied that former Prime Minister was not told. If he was told he certainly did not tell the Cabinet. The Minister for Defence in the Labor Government has assured the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) that he was not told. The Minister for Defence went on to suggest that even though I was not the Minister for Defence, as a member of the Labor Cabinet I had an obUgation to seek the mformation. Mr Kilien-On a point of order, by any test of parliamentary procedure this is not a personal explanation. It is an argument, and an argument should be heard in the normal course of debate.",71
156,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"Order! The pointtaken by the Minister for Defence is not irrelevant. The honourable member for Hindmarsh had reached the pomt at which I felt obliged to require him to address himself more specifically to the point on which he claimed to have been misrepresented. I ask him to proceed to do exactly that. Mr Kilien-On a further point of order, the honourable gentleman has not spoken in this debate. A personal explanation can only find its fountain of origin in the fact that the member who claims to have been misrepresented has spoken in the debate and another member has misabused what he has had to say. I submit with firmness but with respect that the only basis on which the honourable member for Hindmarsh can intervene in this debate is not by way of personal explanation but by way of argument.",71
157,Mr YOUNG,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,I wish to speak to the point of order. The point of order raised by the Minister does not stand up. The Minister in a speech he made just a couple of hours ago in this place made an accusation against the honourable member for Hindmarsh. Obviously the honourable member has the right to defend himself against that accusation.,71
158,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Order! The honourable member for Hindmarsh has the indulgence of the Chair to make a brief statement on the basis that he has been misrepresented. The honourable member may proceed.,71
159,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The facts are that the department deUberately withheld the mformation from our Government, from the governments preceding us and from the governments since we were in office. I know-and I can say now from my own personal knowledge-that there is at least one officer of the department, whom I may yet name, who has boasted of the fact that he has the withheld information and has told the National Security Council of the United States that Defence will not give information relating to defence to the Australian politicians nor to the Government because it does not trust them with such information.",71
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Order! The honourable member for Hindmarsh is now debating the matter. I ask him to state briefly the matter in which he personally was misrepresented.,71
161,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"Yes, I have been misrepresented because it has been alleged that I knew. It was said that if I did not know I should have known. The Joint Intelligence Organisation has deliberately withheld this information from us and has boasted about it to the Central IntelUgence Agency. Mr Kilien- I rise to order. This is an intolerable state of affairs. This is not a point of order; it is argument, and argument, Mr Deputy Speaker, must be presented to this House only by way of participation in debate.",71
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Order! The Minister for Defence is in error if he believes that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is speaking to a point of order. He has the indulgence of the Chair to make a statement on the score of his misrepresentation. I feel that the honourable member fbr Hindmarsh is rather exceeding the entitlement flowing from the indulgence of the Chair. I ask him very briefly to round off the point on which he claims to have been misrepresented.,71
163,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"Yes. I say categorically that the Labor Cabinet was not given the information which has since been squeezed out of the Minister for Defence. Not one of the former Ministers who were named by the Minister for Defence during the course of his remarks as having this knowledge, or as having been in a position to get this knowledge, was told or was put in a position of knowing about this. The Minister for Defence has been deceived by the Department, and the head of the Department ought to be sacked.",72
164,Mr CONNOLLY,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"To make any sense at all of the convoluted logic of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) would require that I was a Nobel Prize winner in atomic physics. Since I do not claim capacities in that field I merely want to bring back to this debate the degree of logic which was introduced into it by the Minister fbr Defence (Mr Kilien). It was plain from the Minister's opening statement that the problem of plutonium waste disposal in the Maralinga area has been handled in the best interests of the Austrahan people, and no matter what the Opposition has cared to say to refute this it has utterly failed to do so. We have just heard an ex-Minister of the previous Administration admit in this House that the Ministers of that Administration were incapable of controlling the bureaucracy which was meant to advise them in the first place. We were told earlier by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass), when Minister for the Environment and Conservation, established on behalf of the Labor Government the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council. If he was doing his job, if the Council was doing its job and if he was able to advise Cabinet of what that organisation was all about, he most certainly would have been in a position to know what was going on at Maralinga. Let us get the situation in perspective. This is Austraha. It is not the United States of America, Great Britain or France. We have no massive industry here involved in plutonium or atomic physics. We do not have a major problem of waste disposal at this stage. But we have allowed this debate, led essentially by the honourable member for Reid, to become a massive emotional issue.",72
165,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Scaremongering .,72
166,Mr CONNOLLY,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"It is a total example of scaremongering. We are trying to demonstrate, and it has been effectively demonstrated ever since the early atomic testing commenced at Maralinga and later at Emu, that at all times, within the confines of known scientific knowledge of the time, all actions were taken to ensure that the necessary protective measures were introduced at those locations. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), quoted a news release of the British High Commission out of context. Let me put the matter into context. The news release stated: Nuclear experimentation at Maralinga ended in 1963, after which is was decided to decontaminate the site. The detailed requirements for this operadon were laid down by the Australian authoriues and these were fully implemented by the UK in 1967. When independent Australian surveys had confirmed that the site was radiolog lly safe, a TerIca mination Agreement ending the arrangements for British use of the atomic weapons proving ground at Maralinga was signed in September 1968. I trust that we are all aware of the problems associated with atomic waste. But let me make a simple reference to the work of Mr Justice Parker who, in commenting in his report on the United Kingdom Windscale inquiry, made this observation: It is not true that plutonium is highly radioactive. Its principal isotope, plutonium 239, is relatively stable and as a consequence its half life is very long and its radioactivity per unit mass very low. Mr Justice Parker went on to say: It is not true that in all circumstances very small amounts of plutonium are lethal. Insoluble particles when inhaled are certainly hazardous in small quantities. Considerably larger amounts could be eaten without appreciable harm. The honourable member for Reid has talked about the effects of radiation on the health of Aborigines, the policemen and other personnel who have been working in this area and so forth. He apparently wishes to ignore the simple fact that the health survey which was conducted in the area of personnel involved in those projects in 1972 and the survey which is now being conducted again by the AIRAC shows that, on the earUer definiuon of the evidence, there is nothing whatsoever to demonstrate that the plutonium in the ground, which is buried considerably below the surface of the area, and is surrounded by metal and concrete, has demonstrated any physical UI effects on personnel within the general area. The AIRAC is conducting another survey which is in the process of being completed. I hope that we will see the results ofit in the near future. But at this point there is absolutely no evidence- I emphasise that there is no evidence at all-for the honourable member for Reid to make allegations of this type in the Parliament. The survey of as early as August 1972 demonstrates quite clearly the total sense of responsibiUty of this Administration in terms of the weUbeing of the Aboriginal community and the personnel involved in these projects. Let us look at the other two questions which are raised in this glorious motion of censure of the Government which has been moved by the Opposition. Firstly, it deals with the disposal of plutonium. I made the point earlier that Austraha, unlike other nations, is not a primary user of large quantities of radioactive substances. At this point in time we do not have a major problem of knowing what we wtil do with it, but what has been decided through negotiation between the Commonwealth Government and the States is that the States are responsible for solving this problem within the definition of their boundaries. As far as the Austrahan Atomic Energy Commission is concerned they are perfectly able to solve the problem of the disposal of nuclear waste on their own. The third point raised by the Opposition is that we need to establish a nuclear safeguards, safety and securities commission. Again, the Opposition has simply chosen to ignore the fact that the Australian Safeguards Office, which has already been established, is the body which in fact dictates how the Austrahan Government is to maintain standards acceptable to the Australian Atomic Energy Agency and other international bodies, to maintain standards in accordance with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and other agreements. This is exactly the sort of organisation this country needs. We do not need a massive comthe mission. We do not need the type of organisation which exists in the United States of America cause the ground rules relevant to this nation's involvement in this area are so totaUy different what are found in other countries. Quite clearly, the situation is simUar to that which we find often in this House. The Opposition is basing argument in this case on what is nothing more than a leaked Cabinet document. That document having been leaked, various people-of course, members of the Opposition are certainly not angels in thisfield-have demonstrated their pacity to quote it out of context and to use bits and pieces of it to support a case which cannot stand up under close scientific examination. may soon reach the situation when Cabinet subconsidered missions will have to be written not for the benefit of the Ministers of the government of the day but for the benefit of the media because within 24 hours of such submissions being ten the person responsible has to be prepared defend himself before the television cameras, on radio and in the newspapers of Australia. I put it quite fundamentally that no government, irrespective of its political colour, wtil be able to conduct its affairs in the interests of the Australian nation if time after time we allow ourselves to become baited on the hook-that is aU we are doing-of some person who wishes to leak a matter which is in fact a Cabinet document and a Cabinet secret. The Opposition today is encouraging civil servants and other people to break the law. The Opposition is prepared to do this because it does not have the capacity in its ranks to oppose the Government on constructive grounds. It expects civU servants who are supposed to have taken an oath of loyalty to breach that sacred trust to serve its short-term petty political aims. That is all members of the Opposition stand for. They are not interested in the welfare of Australia, they are not interested in the system of Parliament and they are not interested in the Westminster system of government. At no time has the Minister raised in this House a current or imminent threat in terms of access to the plutonium which has been found in the area of Maralinga. Should access be gained to plutonium waste, the submission put forward by the Minister makes it quite clear what the position wtil be. Should at any time in the future some unforseen circumstance show that it is possible to gain access to the material, even though at the present time with given technology this is not so, obviously it is the responsibUity of the government of the day to take every conceivable protective device necessary to ensure that interests of the Australian people are always covered. That is precisely what the Minister did. beIf he had not prepared that Cabinet submission, if he had been prepared to go along, as the Opto position was when in government, painfully unaware of the realities and then to come into the so Parliament years later and say: 'We did not its know because nobody told us', and if he was to demonstrate an incapacity as a Minister, the Opposition would have something to argue about. The Minister went to the Cabinet because he had the facts. He had to put them on the record. caWhat is so sad in terms of the future of this country is that no longer can a secret document be regarded with the sanctity that it should be We regarded when it is taken before a Cabinet and by the elected government of the day. According to new criteria of the International Atomic Energy Agency-the IAEA-whic h the writWhitlam Administration agreed to accept into 1974, the Government has been required to examine all records of previous nuclear experiments to see whether any contarninated material was buried in Austraha in relation to which the new and very rigid criteria of the IAEA could perhaps apply. As I have said, we were required to do that under the NPT and as a signatory to the IAEA agreement. As a Government, we have carried out our responsibility, which is what the Opposition, when in government, flatly refused to do. Honourable members opposite now stand up and defend themselves for their inaction by saying that they did not know the gun was loaded. Obviously, the IAEA requires that any recoverable plutonium must be adequately safeguarded. The Agency's new rigid criteria were framed for the very reason that it appreciated that what might be unthinkable today could nevertheless become a possibility at some time in the future. If the plutonium is recoverable it will be recovered but it is the only viable position that this Government, in all conscience, could take on this particular matter. I commend the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) for the lucidity ofhis explanation. In relation to this matter the people of Austraha have nothing to fear but fear itself, a fear which is being generated on this occasion by an utterly irresponsible Opposition which when in government had access to all the files, to exactly the same files to which the Government has access today. Members of the Labor Government chose not to act, perhaps because they could not read. That is for them to decide. They should not come in here three years later and complain, because when they were in Government, when they had the responsibility for the welfare of the Australian people, they demonstrated a total incapacity to carry it out. An allegation has also been made by the honourable member for Reid and others that perhaps Great Britain breached the moratorium on nuclear explosions in the atmosphere. There no evidence that he has put forward, there is evidence that any member of the Opposition has put forward this evening, to demonstrate any nuclear experiments conducted after completion of nuclear tests in the atmosphere breached in any sense the moratorium on nuhand, clear explosions. I accept the statement of the British Government and I quote it for what it is. The British Government has stated that no which atomic devices were exploded during the morathe torium on nuclear weapons tesdng between 19S8 and 1961. I accept that not merely on trust but thembecause I believe that it is logical that that position should be accepted. It is not entirely beyond credibUity that the British could have detonated an atomic bomb in the atmosphere at the MaraUnga-Emu area and concealed the explosion from every one of the many Australian scientists, officials and servicemen who were present but how is it then that at every single nuclear test over those years many Australians were present as scientists, servicemen and organisers of the explosion sites? They know what it looks like. They know what the mushroom cloud of an atomic test is all about. Now we are being told that somehow or other the British Government may have conducted secret clandestine tests on Austrahan soU surrounded by Australian scientists and servicemen. As I said, if there is any logic at all in the argument of the Opposition, it is quite obvious that it will not stand up to close examination in this case. In 1968 the British Atomic Energy Weapons Research Establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga. That report, as the Minister has pointed out already, was the Pearce committee report. It was accepted by the Austrahan Government and last year, 1977, the Austrahan Ionising Radiation Advisory Council appointed a further ad hoc committee to consider the material buried at Maralinga. The Government has done all that can be done to make sure that the situation is totally safe for all those concerned.",72
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,74
168,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has moved an amendment which isfiercein its terms and which makes savage allegations. It is an amendment deserving of an answer, albeit in a brief space of time. I seek to trespass upon the time of the House to answer the amendment and some of the charges is made by my friend the Deputy Leader of the Opno position. Central to the honourable gentleman's speech this afternoon was his lamentation that that 15 former Ministers in Whitlam led Labor the Governments had not been told about Maralinga and what was buried there. In shortthat is the central complaint that came from the honourable gentleman. He presented it as an indictment, firstly, of the Public Service cannot answer for itself, and, secondly, of Government because it did not tell the honourable gentlemen. The truth is that 15 of",74
169,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,You made the accusation.,74
170,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"I Ustened to the honourable gentleman in, I thought, almost unbecoming silence. Perhaps he can Usten to me. I know it hurts him.",74
171,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,The truth hurts.,75
172,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,I know it hurts you. I named the 15.1 wiU name them again.,75
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,You name 15.,75
174,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"You cannot take it. You are a squealer, a Uttle squealer. There were 15 Ministers and you were one of them. What did these 15 Ministers, including the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), with his fierce, passionate interest in nuclear matters, do? They acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1974. That was their action. One would have thought that when they acceded to the Treaty one of the 15 would have turned to someone and said: 'Have we got any obUgation under this Treaty?'",75
175,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"Didn' t they do it! Oh, come on!",75
176,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"No , there was not a word from them. Surely one of them would have been able to say it. I suspect that one of the 15 would have been at MaraUnga during Operation Buffalo when the bombs were exploded. Surely one of them would have said: 'Oh, we must have some obligation.' What a commentary on their powerful sense of inquisitiveness. Not one of the 15 had the cerebral sense of inquisition to say: 'We may have some obligation.' The Nuclear NonProUferation Treaty refers directly to the International Atomic Energy Agency with all of its requirements. That agreement was entered mto by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1974 and these 15, this football team of inquiry, all determined to find out what is gomg on",75
177,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,What about your team?,75
178,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"Then , one of them, the honoursition able member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde has Cameron), under the thoroughly specious preheard tence of making a personal explanation, said evening that he knew nothing about it. The South Australian Government has had the that Pearce committee's report on Maralinga for years. What a commentary on the powerful state of relations between the Whitlam led Labor Government and the Dunstan led Labor word Government in South Australia. Now they are complaining about it. If the honourable gentleman reads the Pearce committee's report he will see that plutonium is referred to. Then, there the mquiry of the Austrahan Ionising Radiation Advisory Council commissioned by another the 15, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass). This report contains repeated referto ences to plutonium. Am I to understand that years Ministers appoint committees of inquiry and do not bother to inquire, even over breakfast, what is gomg on or to say: 'What are you domg? Tell us something about it.' The AIRAC report contains a map reproduced faithfully from the Pearce committee's report but not one of the 15 bothered to inquire about it. That is the central feature of this argument and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to exculpate the 15 by saying: 'Nobody told us about it.' I thought the whole purpose of ministerial authority was to inquire into what is going on. One of the scurrilous charges made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this afternoon was to claim, under the cloak of anonymity, that desperate companion of the desperate",75
179,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,Who ?,75
180,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,You .,75
181,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,I would have to be a companion of yours to be desperate.,75
182,Mr KILLEN,SCIENTISTS TO STUDY MARALINGA AREA,"I reckon you are desperate indeed. Not one of the 15 bothered to inquire in the years 1974 and 1975.1 admit that they had some distractions in 1974 and that things worsened a bit in 1975 but such was the powerful, passionate, continuing interest of the 15 that they did not even bother to inquire what happened at Maralinga. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was acceded to and signed with all the palaver in the world. Then the IAEA agreement was entered into, but not one of the 15 had the sternness of character to say: T want to know what is going on'. How does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition explain the attitude of the South Australian Government? Let us proceed a Uttle further with this matter. This afternoon, the Deputy Leader of the Opposought to say that the British Government not told him what is going on. Has he ever of a chap called Harold WUson? I thought this that Mr Whitlam and Sir Harold WUson were on the best of speaking terms. I would have thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition at that time, the honourable member for Reid, would have said: 'Look, Gough, why don't you ring up Harold and ask him what is happening'. Not a was said, despite the splendid, lively relationship which existed between the two men. The second argument which was presented by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this after is noon relates to the description of plutonium. I have already adverted to the fact that there are of reports on this matter on record. The same records which are avaUable to me are avaUable the honourable gentleman. In 1974 and in the that followed the scientists turned to these reports. They reached the conclusion that some of the material was potentially recoverable. The honourable member for Reid has difficulty in understanding the term 'potentially recoverable'. Let me seek to illustrate it to him. The honourable member for Reid is potentially intelhgent. However, there will need to be a great deal of excavation before that potential realised. The Austrahan Safeguards Office came into existence following the accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the agreement. As a consequence of that, the scientists wanted to know whether we had an obligation pursuant to those two agreements. That is the test. If the obligation did exist and if there were no response by this Government, then we would be deserving not of mere reproach or rebuke, but of a very severe indictment being presented against us. Because of that I, as the custodian of these documents- I have no other ministerial responsibiUty-sai d to Cabinet that Aldred.K.J. consideration must be given to this matter. That jBaillieu, M. is the central feature. The honourable member for Reid has passed j over to me a book. The magnificent simphcity of i his mind is such that he agrees with anything written that suits his mind. He had no sense of in- , quisitiveness or inquiry when he was in govern- < ment. However, here is a book written by a J character in relation to whom the Deputy Leader , of the Opposition this afternoon said-and I quite « agree with him-that one would have to cough j one's way through the name in order to proi nounce it. We have no opportunity of producing ' the author of the book here and cross examining ' him. The honourable gentleman says that it is i written there; ergo it is true. Yet it suited him not to beheve me when I pointed out in a letter writ- , ten to him on 3 February 1977 what the United i Kingdom Government had told me, namely, j that no atomic explosion had occurred at i Maralinga in those years. Oh no, he did not want ' to believe that. Why is it that he beUeves some- ] thing which is written in the book which suits his J cause and purpose, yet he will not believe any informadon supphed to him on the authority of a British Labour government? He can put that in Armitage, J. L. his pipe and smoke it. Does the honourable \Blewett, member intend to say that the present Prime iBrown, John Minister of the United Kingdom is an Cameron, Clyde accomplished Uar and a polished tergiversator? ,Dawkins, Does he intend to say that Sir Harold WUson iFitzPatrick, J. rnisled this Government and did not even bother Fry, to inform the last Labor Government of the BriiHowe, B. L. tish Government's actions? With the utmost of Hurford, CJ . goodwill I say to my honourable that the facts that have been given to them come Jones, J Charles 'from the records that are avaUable both to this Government and to the Opposition. The facts are 1 ithat the Opposition has elected to say: 'Ah, we <did not bother to send for them'. That is an inidictment of the Opposition. On the basis of the :argument presented by the Opposition today, I isay that honourable members opposite are deis :serving of a long time in opposition.

It is one of the biggest blunders the Government has made in the Budget. Before granting leave to the Minister I put on record that we are opposed to this move.

190,Mr SCHOLES,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,There is a question before the Chair.,77
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,The Chair has not put the question. The question is that the motion be agreed to.,77
192,Mr SCHOLES,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS," I repeat that yesterday the Government guillotined as a matter of urgency income tax Bills through here in order to avoid debate in the House which is refor the financial affairs of the nation. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carriek) has made it quite clear that the Senate can have two full days to debate those Bills if it wishes. I want to know why the Governbut ment is afraid to debate in this chamber. On this occasion it is going to force Bills through this House that cannot be considered in the Senate I tomorrow because the Senate has already given the time to the income tax Bills. These Bills will not be considered in the Senate until next week. The Opposition, in seeking to test the legislative committee proposition-and there are some do extremely complicated clauses in these Bills We which are coming before this House with a lot of is explanation required as to meaning, effect and 11 manner in which they will be implemented by the Government-believe s it is appropriate that say as it had a party meeting today and could not given notice before today of its intention to move to a legislative committee position, should be able to test the new system by having these Bills referred to a legislative committee. The go Minister's proposition in suspending Standing is to ram the Bills through the House so that proper examination cannot take place in this chamber.",77

It means that there is plenty of time to debate the measures. What it means is that we are adjourning at a later hour instead of adjourning at 10.30 p.m. as would normally be the case.,77
194,Mr STEWART,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"Can we have it written into Hansard that the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) is not going to doublecross us again? Can we have it written into Hansard that the social legislation that is about to come before the House will be given due and proper consideration by the members of this House? This House is the House that represents the people. Members of this House have the closest contact with the men and women throughout Australia. This Government will allow the other chamber to talk on and on and on about this legislation. We are going to have a cognate debate of the Social Services Amendment Bill. We are going to have a cognate debate of the National Health Bill, and the National Health Bill and the social services amendments that were announced in the Budget are now the cause of this Government's unpopularity. In most of the electorates in New South Wales approximately 60 to 75 per cent of the people voted for the Labor Government last Saturday. want to know why the Minister for Primary Inthis dustry, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the back bench members of this Government in this House are all running scared. You talk a lot about freedom of speech and the rights of individuals, but you are taking away from the members on this side the right to express an opinion on why you have put a means test on pensioners over seventy. have changed the health scheme so that nobody in Australia, including the Minister himself, understands what is in front of the people Australia after 1 November 1978. Why is the Government running scared? Is it afraid to allow us to express our opinions this House? As I said, it has allowed the House that it used in 1975 to getridof a duly and propare erly elected government to talk on. Those people in that House have to face the electors only once every six years. This is the House that counts, and the Government is now trying to push through a motion abolishing the 11 o'clock rule so that it can start to by exhaustion. During the Committee stage of the legislation I judge that it will continually move the gag. I ask: Will the Leader House (Mr Sinclair), who is at the table, give a clear undertaking that we will not sit through until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. in order to get this legistant lation through? I issue this threat: If we do through, I will see that every rule is pulled out the Standing Orders in order to frustrate this Government in its efforts to take away the rights of members on this side of the House, the June. members of the House of Representatives, who truly and properly represent the people of Austraha.",77

If we are to be faced by problems which the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), for example, might find so difficult, then let us understand that we are going here into become a group of people divided and afflicted by difficulties, and we should not be.

202,Mr YOUNG,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"It must be obvious to everyone now that consideration of the most important Social Services Amendment Bill and Repatriation Acts Amendment Bill under present circumstances would be reprehensible. These matters should have the most serious consideration. The Opposition objected yesterday to the way in which a multiplicity of bills were put together and rushed through this House. It was made known to us that if the vote had been split and such as the taxing of annual leave and long service leave had been put as separate issues some members of the Government parties would have considered voting against them. That will never be tested. Now we find that other Bills are to be rushed through late at night. At least nine speakers are listed and three hours and ten minutes is available for debate. Obviously if all the speakers take up their full time the debate on these matters of the utmost importance will go to 12.15 a.m. or 12.20 a.m., when no one in Austraha will be able to hear it. This Government's only tactic is to put these Bills through on Wednesday when the House of Representatives is not being broadcast-to rush them through late at night, if necessary. The Bills will not be debated in the Senate until next week. As the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Stewart) has said, the Government is placing far more importance on the right of the Senate to debate the Bills than it is on the right of the House of government, the House ofRepresentatives, to debate them.",78
203,Mr GRAHAM,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,Bullshit.,79
204,Mr YOUNG,SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS,"It should be obvious to all honourable members opposite that they are dragging this House down. They are making a spectacle of themselves and of the Administrauon in the way they are handling this business. What is the great rush? On the present sittings, the Parhament is due to complete its business at the end of November. Normally we would go into early December. What is the great rush in the Government trying to whack through all the Bills associated with the Budget in such a short debating period? The Government will not allow even its back benchers to speak. They have been told that on important matters such as social security they are allowed three speakers. Is that all the members who want to speak on the Government side? How is it that six of Opposition's 38 members want to speak but only three of nearly 90 Government members want to speak? Are Government members ashamed to speak on these Bills? Are they bowing to the dictates ministry, which is telling them that they are not expired. allowed to speak? Are they bowing to they dictates of the ministry in not splitting the vote on some of these vicious measures which are part and parcel of the Budget Papers? The Government is just making an absolute spectacle of itself, and the results that occurred recently in New South Wales represent the opinion of this Government that is held throughout Austraha. The Government is trying all sorts of devious means to get these measures through. The Government is doing anything at all-tellin g lies, deceiving the public and deceiving the Parhament-as long as it can rush these Bills through and keep everybody on the back benches tame. As was pointed out, it does not matter how much time is available for senators to speak in the Senate. They can have all the time they hke. But when it comes to the pensioners of Australia, the Government is allowing only three speakers from each side of this House. I say to those sitting on the Government back benches to have a good look at themselves because they are there for two more years while they bow to these sorts of dictates. They should have a look at the results of the Ballarat by-election in a few weeks' time. Those honourable members opposite who are being cowered by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and by the Ministry are closing their mouths rather than speaking on issues which are of the utmost importance to a wide range of people in the community. They are not game to speak. This legislation is being rushed through tonight in case anybody goes to water over the weekend. It is being rushed through in case the pensioners go to some of the back benchers of the Government and say: 'Please, we want our pensions increased twice annually. That was the promise of the Government. Will you go back and vote for it?' Honourable members opposite will say: 'Yes, we will. We will try to convince our Party room'. But the Ministry is not going to allow that to happen. Yet that happened with the funeral benefits legislation. It happened with the proposal concerning the family allowance and the earnings of people such as newspaper boys. But it is not going to happen on some of these major issues. Every pensioner is going to lose $3 a week next year because of these measures-and they have to be rushed through tonight What a spectacle of administration this is! It ought to be voted against. If the Government were doing the right thing by the Parliament it would bring the legislation on at a proper time tomorrow.",79

227,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"It is quite obvious that Governword ment members are bursting with good spirits tonight-in spite of the steep rises in excise It is a matter of melancholy record for that so many Government members tonight should treat such an important matter with such frivolity and careless indifference. I know the amounts of money going to individuals are relatively small-a n increase in the standard of pension of $51.45 to $53.20 a week-but the increase is important in that it vitaUy determines the living standards of great number of expense Australians. It affects literally millions of Australians-Australian s who are amongst the most dependent, deprived and vulnerable in community and who, in common with the great bulk of serious minded citizens in this comthose munity, genuinely believe that members of the $45 Government would regard a debate on pensions and associated matters with the greatest earnestport ness. If those people had been in the Parliament tonight witnessing the behaviour of Government members they would have been appaUed. They would have been disabused for all time if they ever beUeved that there was any genuine concern resting in the ranks of the Government towards the position of pensioners and people in this community who are dependent on social security The behaviour of Government members tonight was deplorable. One Government member was even moved to seek to dissociate himself 1978 from his colleagues. He sought to leave the Second Reading chamber. He was restrained in a completely improper way by the Government Whip. The outrageous behaviour of Government members and their insensitivity towards the most dependent and the most needy groups in the community who are covered by the matters we are going to indiscuss tonight were displayed in a way that no credit to the Government. I suggest the to honourable members in the Government ranks who Uke to go back to their electorates and the profess concern for pensioners at pensioners' Bill meeting that they extend the same kind of concern into the House tonight and, more than that, demand from the Government that there is a full the and adequate debate of this important matter. The Bill before this Parliament at present represents the most extensive and sustained assault social security benefits that this country has seen. This Bill continues the Government's curious notion of welfare reform. 'Wheelan the wrecker' had the same approach-demohtio n with haste and without concern. It is a sad testimonial to a simple but unavoidable fact about Fraser Government-on e cannot trust the of the Fraser Government and, least of all, the word of its leader. This Bill catalogues duty. broken promise after broken promise of the the House Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Let us consider the Bill. Under this Bill the least well off, the aged and the invalid, are dethat prived of $60m of pension payments in the course of a full year so that big business can be rate supported by the Government. What sense of equity is there in that sort of poUcy? Supporting mothers have sacrifices imposed on them at the of their infants to keep intact the Prime Minister's strange notions oftherightsof the better off and the privileged in our community. Let the us hear Government members stand up and defend that. The oldest people in the community, over 70 years of age, henceforth will pay a m penalty in a full year to assist wealthy mineral development corporations. What sort of supwUl Government members give to that sort of injustice? Mothers and infants will be denied maternity benefits so that the tax avoidance family trusts, devices used with such great effect by the Prime Minister and the deputy leader of his Party, can be preserved. Who amongst the Government ranks are going to j .istify that? Migrants and dependants will have benefits withdrawn so that the top income earners in the community can avoid a more equitable revenue contribution. Who amongst the Government ranks will excuse that? By their behaviour tonight Government members have shown that there is no concern about this rampant injustice which is going to be imposed upon the community as a consequence of the Bill now before the Parhament. Students from poor homes and on austere students' benefits will have family allowances withdrawn but well off people who have no real need, comparatively, for those benefits will remain unaffected. The unemployed without dependants will be starved into submission as a penalty for becoming the victims of Fraser's steamroller economics. The unrelieved attrition against the unemployed who are under 18 years of age that has been experienced in the past three years continues unrelieved. Who amongst the Government ranks is going to justify and explain that sort of treatment? The dependent children of pensioners are exploited for the third budget in a row-the tfiird consecutive Fraser Budget. Presumably in the view of Prime Minister Fraser their nutritional and other needs decline by the equivalent of the rate of inflation each year or, more obviously, those children starve a litde more and are a litde worse clothed each year because of this malign neglect. The Fraser Government saves money at the expense of poor children to pump up the profits of oil exploration companies. This Bill represents miserable welfare It reflects ice age social concern. It displays social welfare thinking at its most primitive and least caring. I recognise as well as anyone who has basic understanding of the economic condition of this country the problems of handling the economy at present. Of course, there are certain priorities in handling the national economy such as bringing down inflation, but this should be done not at the cost of double digit unemployto ment or worse conditions for business, and certainly not at the cost of neglecting the needs people who are totally or largely dependent government policies for their livelihoods. Any government which proposes either explicity or implicity, as this Governmnt does both scores, that the most needy in the munity must be neglected and their deprivation accentuated whilst it concentrates in a narrow minded and ill-informed way on a particular aspect of economic management is not worth the great honour of being in office and administering the affairs of this country. It is not worth the confidence of the people of the community. Clearly that is the inference to be drawn from the New South Wales State election and, two weeks earlier, the Werriwa by-election. Both of those were a solid confirmation that the people of this country have no confidence in the Government of the nation, that they have no respect for the dishonour, lack of integrity and lack of credibility of the Fraser Government. All of this and much more of the same ilk comes from the same man, Fraser, the man who made a determined bid to rob pensioners of their funeral benefits-ca n one imagine anybody carrying out a meaner tactic-to take back some of the established benefits of handicapped people and of war veterans and to tax paper boys. All of this 'grand design of social welfare reform'-that is placed in inverted commas to indicate the clear sarcasm-come s from the same man, Fraser, the man who promised tax cuts at an election eight months ago and this week introduced substantial tax increases in their place. This is the same man who in 1975 promised to preserve Medibank, to adhere to wage indexation and to bring about economic recovery in three years. He is the same man who last year promised a 2 per cent reduction in interest rates by this month and falling unemployment from February on. None of those promises has been honoured. He is the same man who claimed in Sydney a fortnight ago that his Government had boosted spending for pensioner housing but who in doing so blatantly ignored the way in which aged persons' homes housing programs have been set back by the pohcy. policies ofhis Government. When the Whitlam Labor Government was in a office and I was Minister for Social Security we generously increased the rate of government subsidy for aged persons' housing constructed by voluntary agencies from $2 for every dollar raised by the agencies to $4 for every dollar. One of the first actions of the Fraser Government was revert to the $2 for $ 1 subsidy. In 1976 the Fraser Government announced a of three-year program of financial support for aged on persons housing of $225m, but by discreedy applying restraints to the availability of funds it ensured that when the three years ended $75m on was still unspent. Some generosity, some display comof concern for the aged people of the community! Where among the ranks of Government members are the defenders of that sort of deprivation? He is the same man who said a fortnight ago in Sydney again that his Government had given greater emphasis to child care oblivious of the simple fact that in 1975-76 in our last Budget we allocated $64m for this purpose. In this year's Budget the allocation is $65.1 m. This means very simply that in real terms-that is allowing for the erosion of inflation-ther e is effectively a $ 12.1m or a 21.7 per cent reduction in the allocation of finance for this area. So we come to the conclusion that Prime Minister Fraser's word is his bond. That is a bit like having Richard Nixon as your personal adviser, or even worse having the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) use the same skills he applied in writing prospectuses for Patrick and Partners to write the Prime Minister's policy speeches. Perhaps the honourable member for Macarthur did just that. If so, that explains all but excuses nothing. This Bill turns the clock back- a long way back-o n social welfare reform in Australia. Let us look at some of the effects of this Bill. It partly dismantles pension indexation at a cost of $60m to pensioners. It delays cost of living adjustments to pensions by 16 months. This is quite contrary to the promises of the Prime Minister, who in his 1977 campaign speech said: We have taken politics out of pension increases by linking tbem automatically with the consumer price index. Echoing him faithfully, his Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) in December year said: I have had lots of people say to me: 'You have given us dignity because you don't argue about our rises every six months'. Eight months later those statements become half-true. How soon before they become the full lie? The Prime Minister says that he is justified reducing the indexation adjustment arrangement ments from twice yearly adjustments to once yearly adjustments because mflation is down. is down to a httle below 8 per cent, which is still high by historic standards. In 1971 and again 1972 the MCMahon Government introduced twice-yearly adjustments to pensions. At that time inflation was less than 5 per cent. Clearly the record of the MCMahon Government exfor plodes the falseness of his ahbi for'fleecing'pencharged sioners. Let us be clear about another aspect of pension indexation. This Government, as distinct from the Whitlam Labor Government, is adjustin ing pensions according to its indexation arances rangements in response to movements in the consumer price index not in response to movements in average weekly earnings, for which we were responsible. The Labor Government had fulfilled a promise when it went out of government in 1975. We promised in 1972 that if elected we would strive to establish the standard rate of pension, then at about 19 per cent of average weekly earnings, at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings within the normal term-that is, the three-year term of Parhament. We achieved exactly that. It is a simple calculation to establish that if there had been in the preceding decade regular adjustments of pensions according to average weekly earning movements and at the commencement of that period the standard rate of pension had been 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and accordingly still 25 per cent at the end of that period, the rate of pension would have been considerably higher than if the pension over the same period had been adjusted according only to movements in the consumer price index. In that 10-year period average weekly earnings increased by 173 per cent but the consumer price index increase was only 75.7 per cent. In monetary terms that means simply that instead of being $38.75, as the pension was when we left office, it would have been only $14.20. Over the long haul pensioners will be far worse off under the Fraser indexation program than under what we were proposing. Let me continue with some of the defects of the Bill. It opens the back door for the reintroduction of the means test. In his 1975 policy of last speech the Prime Minister said: We stand by our commitment to abolish the means test on pensions. But he did not tell us that he was going to knock it over as he stood beside that commitment. This Bill neglects the needs of dependent children of pensioners for the third Budget in a row. In November 1975 we increased the allowance for dependent children of pensioners to $7.50 a in week. In our three-year period of office that paywas regularly adjusted. That was in clear contrast to what had gone before, when for years It there had been scarcely any adjustments and most often none at all. The allowance is still in $7.50 a week today. If the payment had been indexed according to movements in the consumer price index it would be $9.70 a week or $2.20 more a week than it actually is. So much the sense of justice and moral obUgation disby the Fraser Government. This Bill denies famUy allowances to students receipt of student allowances such as allowmade under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme but it leaves the wealthy alone. Let me illustrate that point. If a member of this Parhament decides he wants to provide, say, $3,000 a year for one of his children who is attending university or a college of advanced education, the family allowance for that child will still be intact. In a relative sense that payment will represent no great sacrifice as against the sort of sacrifice of providing just a modest level of support for a student child of a person on a modest to lower middle income. Yet we find that because of the tight means testing arrangements and because of the changes to the arrangements for the payment of family allowances people in receipt of TEAS allowances-that is, very simply stated, people among the least well off in the community-wil l find that they will be deprived of the family allowance. These people have a far greater need for that payment than any person in this House. It becomes no person in this House to support such an iniquitous proposal. Not only that, but in fact there has been a persistent erosion of the living standards of people Examples-Famil y with: 1 child 2 children 3 children 3 children, of whom 1 st child is student over 16 3 children, of whom 1st and 2nd children are students over 16",82
228,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"This Bill attacks the unemployed. It strives to falsify unemployment benefit costs to the Budget. It seeks to rig Budget figures. So once again we get the concept of rubbery Budget costing-the concept that was enunciated first of all by the former Treasurer after the Budget last year. At least he was honest enough to put that much distance between himself and the Prime Minister, who had demanded that rigwithdrawn. ging of the Budget. This brings me to a humorous little conundrum that floats around today in the precincts of this House. Question: What is the cost of rubbery Budgetfiguring?Answer: KeepAssistance ing Phil Lynch as the Minister for Industry and Commerce. 11 OCtODCr i_ ^ "" lo& i\J2r li m TJ T:T*T» T i e r ?

That is the impact in this area of this Bill. Again, this Bill totaUy ignores family aUowances. In real terms a fanuly is worse off now as against 1975 by between $2.96 in the case of one dependent chUd and $7.86 in the case of three dependent chUdren if one makes an allowance for the child endowment and tax rebate which Labor introduced in late 1975 and which were effective from the beginning of 1976, updated according to cost of living movements and measured against the fanuly allowances paid at the present time. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table which displays that exact point. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsWeekly payment Percent under endowment/ Weekly payment change rebate scheme under family Weekly F.A. of 1975-76 in allowance difference 1978-79 doUars 1978-79 of payments C.E. $ $ $ 6.46 3.50 2.96 -45.80 11.49 8.50 2.99 -26.00 18.74 14.50 4.24 -22.60 19.44 14.50 4.94 -25.40 22.36 14.50 7.86 -35.20 This Bill is an assault against the family. The maternity aUowance is gone. The Budget is consistent with the erosion of the position of the famUy overall as a result of various initiatives taken in this Budget. The substantial increases in personal tax which have been introduced in this Budget are most damaging in their effect against families-agains t famUies on middle and modest incomes. Again, it is famUies who will suffer most of all because the housing mortgage subsidy is It is famUies who suffer because the dependent chUdren of pensioners are receiving no increase in their dependant allowances. It is famUies who will suffer because the students receiving allowances under the Tertiary Education Scheme will no longer receive the famUy allowance. It is famUies who suffer overall because there has been no adjustment to offset inflation in the last three Budgets, including the present Budget, which have been introduced at the hands of the present Government. This Government, by its record, is against families. Everything that it has done in the welfare field, including the effects of the taxation adjustments, erodes the position of the family, and especially the position of the middle and the modest come families. Families are paying for the comfort of the privileged under Fraser ment adnunistration. The most depressing aspect of all of this is means by which it is achieved. The total revenue on an annual basis which is saved by these variof ous measures would fall much short of $200m and in the current fiscal year it will fall well of $ 100m. I repeat that the people who are deprived, denied and disadvantaged by these measures are amongst the most needy, the most dependent and the most vulnerable munity. It ill behoves one of the wealthiest men in this Parhament to be responsible for the imposide sition of such discrimination and disadvantage. repeat that the rniserableness of these measures which in a full year will raise much less than $200m and much less than $100m in the course of thisfiscalyear pales into insignificance what is available to be raised in the community the Government raised revenue according to sense of proper social equity. For instance, the Government could introduce an excess profits tax-that is, a resource rental tax-o n mineral velopment companies in this countiy. I am talking about mineral development companies which are battling to get on their feet and are set back and disadvantaged by the adversity of world trade at the present time. I am talking about the really wealthy and prosperous mineral development companies in this country of which there are several at the present time. If that sort cent of tax were introduced, the Government could Austrahans. raise $150m in a full year. There would be no of Australian need to deny the pensioners of their twice-yearly indexation adjustment of their pensions. I windfall addition to the profits of crude oil producers derived directly by the adjustment in wealth crude oil pricing imposed by the Government have were to be ehminated byredistributingthrough revenue means back into the community, there would be another $340m available to the are Government. In that way, family allowances could have been adjusted in some respect at least. If a capital gams tax were introduced for tal gains in excess of $200,000, would be available to the Government. If personal tax rates for the highest 2 per cent of income earners were adjusted on a fairer basis, another $200m would be available. If the investment allowance were scrapped, another $400m would be available. If family trusts which are used as tax avoidance measures-famil y trusts are so beloved by so many members on the Government side of the chamber for that inreason-were aboUshed another $100m of revenue would be avaUable. In aU, the Government Governcould have avaUable $ 1,490m. Nearly $ 1,500m would be avaUable in the the form of additional revenue to the Government if it proceeded to raise revenue according to a scale social and economic justice and according to a system of progressive levies. If that were done, short there would be no need for such mean and being penny-pinching discrimination to be imposed upon the more needy and the more deprived people in the community-the most trusting in our compeople in the community. It may seem that honourable members on this of the House have something of a preoccuI pation about capital gains taxes. I recall that when I first mentioned the matter in this House in the course of this session, although it was certainly not thefirsttime I have mentioned it in the against House by far, honourable members on the if Government side, including the Prime Minister a (Mr Malcolm Fraser), were muttering that the Opposition was seeking to discourage initiative and resourcefulness among enterprising sections deof the community. That is nonsense! Let me not quote from one of many analyses avaUable on the distribution of wealth in Austraha. This which document is entitled 'Who's Got What in Australia: The Distribution of Wealth', and has  . . . 1 per cent of the adult populauon owns 22 per of personal wealth; the 'top' 5 per cent, 46 per cent; and the 'top' 10 per cent, almost 60 per cent of the wealth of Half of all Australians own less than 8 per cent wealth. The top 5 per cent own more than the bottom 90 per cent put together. f the Mr Raskall goes on to state in his report: The results disclose that the top 2,000 people own as much as the bottom 2,225,000. The wealthiest 10 per cent 220 times the wealth of the poorest 10 per cent. Why does this Government therefore resort to taxing and disadvantaging so many people who amongst the poorest 10 per cent, as it is obviously doing in this BUT before the House, when there are such generous opportunities avaUable to raise revenue among the top 10 per cent of people and other people in that high income area capiwithout discomforting them or disadvantaging another $300m them in any way? It may also seem that we have something of an obsession in respect of famtiy trusts where they are used not for legitimate purposes but as tax avoidance measures. I pointed out in the House a little while ago in the course of this session that it is possible for a man who is supporting a wife and two children and who earns $33,000 a year from sources other than wages and salaries effectively to avoid $4,950 of his tax Uability by Examples-Famil y with: 1 child 2 children 3 children 3 children, of whom 1st child is student over 16 3 children, of whom 1st and 2nd chddren are students over 16",85
229,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The point I am making is that this is an inequitable Government, quite apart from being an obviously dishonest one. Its promises are made to be broken, and to be broken promptly. That is bad enough. But it is the rampant injustice of what it is doing in this area which is totally intolerable. There can be no sense of compassion, no display of caring, no evidence of concern in the ranks of a government which is prepared to preserve intact all of the advantages which I have outlined for privileged groups in the community, which are wealthy, and which are best able to afford a Uttle more sacrifice, and to do that at the expense of people least able to bear additional disadvantage. I have to observe that on the basis of dence avaUable, the Fraser social welfare pohcy is a poUcy of a mean tightwad. But I must that it cannot be said the Prime Minister mean tightwad. I have seen the expense account from his last trip overseas. The last tiling I could ever say after an examination of the expense account is that he is a mean tightwad. But he preaches austerity to pensioners, the unem- $2m ployed and their dependent chUdren and to himself students from poor homes while concurrendy a searching for ways to improve his own comfort. So he spends $250,000 on renovations comfortable Lodge for his own accommodation. I presume that the Lodge is being accommodate the wit and wisdom of the Cabinet. In such circumstances I would have thought that it required only a marginal addition, if any Canberra at all. The Prime Mmister indulges trips on a scale and with a display of extravagance that have not been witnessed exploiting one of his tax avoidance devices- a fanuly trust.

Leave granted. The document read asfollowsFRASER'S CUTS IN SOCIAL SECURITY 1. Aged persons accommodation program was cut from $71m in 1975-76 to $45m in 1976-77. The $45m was to be the first year of a three-year program of $225m. The three year program is now a $150m program, leaving it $75m short. The subsidy was halved from $4 to $1 to $2 to $1 in August 1976. 2. States Grants (Home Care) program froze the subsidy on welfare officers for two years. This year they are paying the subsidy on extra welfare officers put on by local government, but cut the subsidy from and local government will not be able to match the Commonwealth grant in many cases. 3. Child care budget has been consistently reduced, mainly in the area of grants to the States for pre-school services. Salary subsidies which in 1975 paid 75 per cent of a pre-school teacher's salary now pay on average about 40 per cent. 4. Australian Assistance Plan was abolished on 31.5.76 without warning and in spite of promise to await evaluation. Though Senator GuUfoyle urged the States to take it up, the Commonwealth has not done so in its own Territories. 5. Money for welfare rights officers has remained at 1975-76 level. No new officers have been appointed, and shoestring organisations are increasingly subsidising this Commonwealth initiative. 6. Community Information Centres funding remains at 1975-76 level with no new centres estabUshed. 7. Social Welfare Commission abolished in 1976, with promise that its work would be taken over by the Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. Two years later it is just beginning operations, and no welfare research has been done. 8. Social Welfare Planning Units within State Welfare departments, previously financed by Social Security, were dropped completely in 1976. 9. Homeless Persons Assistance Program, introduced in 1975, with expected expenditure of $20m, has spent only mUUon in three years, and no funher appUcants are being approved. 10. Grants to ACOSS, ACROD and Australian Council on the Ageing have not increased for three years. 11. 28 new legal aid offices income tests severelytightenedso that many pensioners are not eUgible for legal aid. 12. Taxation of spouse and chUdren's allowances for those on unemployment, sickness and special benefit introduced in 1976 budget, along with taxation of supplementary benefit for sickness beneficiaries. No other pension or beneficiary category has these allowances taxed. 13. Supplementary and dependent cluldrens' aUowances have not been increased since May 1975. all taxpayers-betwee n $ 114 and 14. Unemployment benefits for single under-18 year olds has not been increased since May 1975. 15. Special benefit for prisoners on remand was withdrawn in Februaiy 1978. Married prisoners can claim if they cannot get State welfare. 16. Unemployment benefit has been made harder to obtain under the following harsh guidelinesBenefit not given to claimants fading the work test on appearance or demeanor grounds: Single persons over 18 obUged to move from home if work available elsewhere; Benefit not avaUable for school leavers for six weeks after completion of studies; SkUled persons forced to accept unskUled work; Income statements to be delivered personally; Persons voluntarily leaving a job must wait six weeks for benefit; Identification no longer establishable by bankbook, or driving Ucence; must have birth certificate, insurance policy, rates notice etc; CES work test faUure results in cancellation of benefit whatever the personal or fanuly situation; $2 to $1 to $1 to $1. States Post Office address no longer acceptable, and benefit terminated if such address given: Payment of benefit made in arrears from 1.11.77, meaning an average wait of a month without payment of any kind; Payment not made to persons laid off during ChristmasJanuary work shutdown, even when they have no hoUday pay; The Director-General and State Directors are knocking back six times the number of recommendations from Social Security Appeals Tribunals in favour of claimants than a year ago. 17. The Government transferred responsibiUty for migrant welfare from Social Security against the wishes of the the migrant communities to Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. 18. Maternity allowances which were introduced in 1912 have been abolished- a mere .1 per cent of social security spending. 19. Family aUowances, which replaced the tax rebate for dependent chUdren, have dropped in value by 17 per cent because they were not indexed for inflation. 20. The Government unsuccessfully tried to aboUsh funeral benefits in 1976, but were prevented by some of their own Senators.

243,Mr NEIL,FRASER,"As I said, the speech of the Leader of the Opposition is both inaccurate and hypocritical. It is typical of members of the Australian Labor Party to seek to disrupt debate in this House by taking spurious points of order, as one just did, because they do not want to hear proper debate on the matter. The Opposition knows full well when it claims that this Bill is an attack on welfare that all it has to do is to look the figures in the Budget Speech to see that this year's allocation for social security is a record amount of more than $7,000m, an increase of 6.8 per cent. There can be absolutely no claim on the part of the Opposition that this is a measure which in any way reduces social welfare in general. The second reason why the Opposition's claims are hypocritical is that it knows full well that the main way in which a government can assist underprivileged persons is to conunue to reduce inflation, and that is what this Government is doing. In the three years between 1972 and 197S inflation increased enormously in this country. The report of the Henderson Committee of Inquiry into Poverty stated quite clearly that the worse effect upon poor and underprivileged persons had come from inflation and that the major cause of their difficulties had come from inflation. It is perfectly clear that if inflation returned to a rapid rate it would produce economic disruption once again. It would erode the purchasing power of every dollar that is given to pensioners. It would squeeze the abihty of companies to produce in the national interest. It would lead to higher interest rates, more and more economic chaos and a deep recession. How can that in any way assist the pensioners in this country? It cannot. The recipe which the Leader of the Opposition has just outlined is to go back behind the times, to introduce his program by stealth and to introduce all types of capital gains taxes, which are even being rejected now in America, and the so called windfall taxes-the socialist program all over again. The Opposition would remove the investment allowance. It had three years in government to do something about family trusts but it did nothing about them. It has said that people must get used to paying more tax. That is its policy, as announced by its shadow Treasurer. The Opposition would reintroduce its entire sociaUst program, which could lead only to more inflation, more economic disruption and a squeezing of the purchasing power of every doUar that is given to every pensioner in this country. It would lead to the ruin of the country and to the destruction of the Uving standards of Australian pensioners. We on this side of the House wtil not have a bar of what the Opposition is seeking to do. Let me reiterate what this Government has done for persons covered by the social welfare budget. Over the past few years there has been a tremendous increase in the benefits and assistance provided by the Government. This is in stark contrast with what the Opposition did in at government, particularly in its last two years in government. The Leader of the Opposition talked about welfare housing. I well remember and I should imagine that honourable members remember that in about October 1975 the Labor Government froze all outlays for welfare housing. Projects that were about to start, projects with a week to go before settlement or before commencement of buUding, were stopped. That happened all round Australia. Companies were thrown into disarray. Voluntary agencies had to stop their programs. Many people were forced to leave their homes and had no welfare housing to go to thereafter. That happened when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. This Government made arrangements to overcome those problems. The other thing the Labor Government did in its last few months in office was to introduce the vicious Budget known as the Hayden Budget which had a tremendous effect upon aged persons, particularly those superannuants who had a Uttle extra income. All honourabale members will remember that they had an extremely low threshhold of taxation. Following the report of the Asprey Committee the Labor Government was convinced for some reason or other that low income earners were not paying enough tax. So it increased the tax rates at the lower end of the scale. This particularly hurt aged persons who had a Uttle more income, especiaUy superannuants. The worse feature ofit all was that once they got above the threshhold they paid tax on the entire amount of their income. In 1977 this Government brought in a revision of the tax system designed specificaUy to assist elderly persons and over a quarter of a million pensioners were released from the vicious burden that had been imposed on them in the 1975 Budget. Furthermore, this Government introduced a scheme whereby tax was paid only after",89
244,Dr EVERINGHAM,FRASER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. I think is important that these untruths be heardThe bells being rung",90
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER, proportion Order! There is no necessity to do other than draw my attention to the state of the House. Ring the bells.,90
246,Mr HODGMAN,FRASER,I raise a point Deputy Speaker. Can it be recorded in Hansard that there were only three Labor members ter present in the House when the quorum was over called.,90
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER,Order! There is no substance to the pomt of order. Members should not take frivolous points of order. (Quorum formed).,90
248,Mr NEIL,FRASER,"The basic and incontrovertible is that in the Budget of 1977 this Government introduced a system whereby tax is not payable to up to an indexed amount of $3,750 for a full financial year. Tax is payable thereafter, but only on the excess. That is where the vast number of persons in this country earning below that figure benefited. Those earning a small amount above that figure also benefited because each individomic ual pension is below the threshhold. Tax is payspect able only over and above the threshhold. That is the vital difference between what this Governhas ment did and what the previous Government did. There are a number of matters in this Bill with which I do not agree. I agree with the eral principles of the Government, with the attack upon inflauon and with the aUy and I agree that it is necessary to face the problems of current cost outlays. This is one of the most important problems we face today in order to get the deficit under control and in order to run the economy soundly. There are aspects in the Bill which I do not support, and I do not propose to support them tonight. One of those aspects is the fact that indexation of pensions will occur annually and the other is the fact that pension increases for persons over 70 years of age will be means tested. I am prepared to agree that these measures have been seen by the pubUc as being mean measures. I am prepared to agree that the Government must look carefully at the types of measures which, although involving only a relatively small amount of money, can do damage to the Government's credibiUty. They do not affect the basic thrust of the Budget. They do not affect the vaUdity of the Government's economic policy. However, I accept also that they have resulted in electoral damage to the Government. it I accept that a pan of the vote in the recent New South Wales State election was attributable to Federal matters, but it was only a relatively small of the vote. The State election was clearly fought on State issues. Nonetheless, this Government must be wary of measures which involve the saving of relatively small amounts of expenditure for the loss of a great deal of support of order, Mr from the community. I want to canvass those two matters. The matof means testing pension increases for persons 70 years of age is one that causes concern, but I believe that it is one which is capable of being solved. Before the 1975 election the Government campaigned on the basis of the removal of the means test for persons over 65 years of age. Members of Parliament have to face the tremendous dUemma of choosing between committing themselves to statements that have been fact made and the matter of directing welfare to areas of need. We must seek as much as possible direct welfare to areas of need. If it is directed indiscriminately we will find that the public purse simply cannot afford the outlay. If persons who are not entitled to welfare and who can well look after themselves are given assistance from the public purse we will find that the whole econstructure wiU be in peril. However, in reof this matter, it seems to me that a solution to be found. I do not think necessarUy that the solution is to be found simplistically by saying that the Government's measure is to be condemned entirely. I would prefer the Government gento find a policy which overcomes the double effect of both means testing and what I would Budget genercall the taxation effect. The original decision by the Labor Party to tax pensions in the Crean Budget in about 1973 was taken on the basis that it would then remove the means test. Of course, the means test was not completely removed; it was removed only in relation to those persons over 70 years of age. Since that time persons over 65 years of age, and to some extent now persons over 70 years of age who are subject to meanstestingof pension increases, have found that a significant proportion of the extra dollar to which they would otherwise be entitled in fact has been eroded by a combination of means testing and tax provisions. It seems to me that the Government should be seeking to blend together these two proposals. It is not sufficient to say that the two proposals, namely tax and means testing, can be run completely separately because the effect on the individual is very serious. What we should be doing is implementing a policy which will enable us to combine the two proposals so that we provide justice for all and ensure that people are not subject to the double jeopardy of taxation and means testing. Until that time comes-and I hope it will come soon-in the vacuum, while we are waiting for such a pohcy, I consider that the imposition of a means test for persons over 70 years in respect of their pension increases is a retrograde step. I am also concerned about the way in which this measure is being implemented. Many elderly people have received forms from the Department of Social Security in the past few weeks and they are causing confusion and concern to them. Those people over 70 years and up to 80 years seem to be able to handle the situation fairly well. But, many of the persons who are over 80 years become quite alarmed, indeed terrified, when they receive forms from the Department inquiring into their income situation and asking them all sorts of questions which they had thought they would not have to answer once they reached that stage in life. If a pensioner who is asked what is his weekly income has a bit of money in the savings bank or some other type of interest, then, of course, it is very difficult for him to fill in the forms and to seek proper advice. I hope that the Government will at least make sure that every faculty is given to these elderly persons to assist them to understand what is occurring. That would be the humanitarian thing to do because a great deal of worry and distress has been caused to elderly persons. The second matter relates to the fact that penthem. sion increases will occur only once a year. This a proposal that I do not support, and I do not tend to support it tonight. Whether the Bill taken as a whole or whether that clause is dealt with separately in Committee, I will not vote with the Labor Party, having been elected as a Liberal member of the Parliament, but I will leave the chamber and reduce, at least by one, the numbers on this side of the chamber who will support this clause, or Bill, as the case may be. My reason for following that course is this: In 1975 the Liberal-Country Party coalition campaigned on the basis of automatic and instantaneous indexation of pensions. That was clearly understood by all concerned to be referable to a three-monthly period because that was the usual period between indexation increases at that time. The words 'automatic' and 'instantaneous' could have left no misimpression in the minds of the community. When the Government came to office it was faced with an extremely serious position, and it was decided that, in view of the situation, six-monthly increases would be appropriate. There were arguments put forward, because of the drastic situation that we had taken over from the Labor Party, that made that decision tolerable. However, the Government now proposes to move to 12-monthly increases. This is unsatisfactory. In my opinion, the proper solution is for the increases in pensions to be of the same frequency as are the national wage determinations. That would be reasonable and fair. As the national wage determinations are now to occur every six months, having moved up from occurring every three months, obviously it follows that I take the view that pension increases should be every six months. If that change were to occur, that would also be reasonable. The pensioners would then be no worse off than the person who is receiving the national wage. Mr Humphreys- I draw attention to the state of the House. The bells being rung Mr Katter- I raise a point of order. Would it not be an act of sheer hypocrisy and contempt for the pensioners if there were only two or three Opposition members sitting in this House?",90
249,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER,Mr Drummond) There is no substance in the point of order. (Quorum formed.),91
250,Mr NEIL,FRASER,"I simply cannot understand the mentaUty of Labor members who take the spurious attitude of calUng for a quorum when a member of the Government is agreeing with I want to pay tribute to my colleagues, paris ticularly the Government Whip and the Deputy inLeader of the Liberal Party because in our Party is we are entitled to have full and proper democratic debate. It has been proper for me to lead the debate for the Government in this case, even though I am making criticisms of the Government in these particular regards. That is something that the Labor Party does not allow because, of course, if a Labor member does not follow the Caucus line he is expeUed from the party. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to refer. I think it is long overdue that the Government solved the anomaUes that arise in relation to those persons who receive an aUowance under the tertiary education assistance scheme, on the one hand, and others who are entitled to the unemployment benefit. There is a disincentive for some young persons to go to a college and study when there are those who take the unemployment benefit. It is a serious anomaly that erodes the morale of young persons seeking to better themselves, and that anomaly should be rectified. The maternity benefits decision is unfortunate. Indeed I suggest that we might think in terms of aUowing the famUy aUowance at sometimein the future, when finances permit, to be paid during the period when women are expecting a chUd so as to assist them with preUminary expenses. As far as the 100 per cent tuberculosis allowance is concerned, the Government Members Ex-servicemen's Liaison Committee is considering the question of those persons in relation to the new health scheme. We believe a proper system can be worked out to assist those persons. In all, there are deficiencies in the Bill. These have been the subject of comment by myself and perhaps by other members. In general, the Government is expending large sums of money on welfare and it to be supported for the massive outlays that it has undertaken in very difficult economic times as part of its overall humanitarian program in assisting the underprivileged in our community.",91
251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER,Mr Drummond)Order! The honourable member's time has got expired.,92
252,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"It is appropriate that the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) spoke about hypocrisy bement's cause he certainly speaks with much expertise the topic. I understand that I am to be followed in this debate by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), who certainly would not be far behind the honourable member for St George. The honourable member for Denison is prepared to vote against the Government on question of the Curran scheme to protect tax avoiders on the basis that it is contrary to Liberal Party pohcy, but we wiU see tonight whether will vote against the Government's decision reduce the means test for pensioners and on reduction of social security and repatriation pensions. If ever there was hypocrisy surely the honourable members for St George and Denison have Ulustrated it many, many times in this House. The honourable member for St George has just argued that the pensioners and the ex-servicemen should carry the fight against inflation. He talks about inflation and says that that is the reason for all these cuts; therefore the pensions have to be cut. Let us look at another untruth that Liberal Party members and Country Party members keep on repeating. They talk about reduction in taxation by this Government. Let us look at page 217 of Hansard of 15 August of this year. In 1975-76 the net payment ofincome tax by individuals was $7,019m. This year it is estimated to be $10,341m, an increase of $3,322m, or nearly a 50 per cent increase in two years in which this Government has been in power. It talks a lot about reducing taxation but has not done anything about it. Mr Bourchier-On a point of order, I would Uke the honourable member for Prospect to tell me how much that would have been had we not introduced indexation which saved",92
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER,Order! There is no substance in the pomt of order. The honourable member for Bendigo knows better.,92
254,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"For the benefit of the honourable member for Bendigo I shaU repeat thefigures.The net payments of income tax by individuals in the 1975-76 Budget was $7,019m. This year the estimate is $ 10,341m, an increase of $3,322m; that is from a Government which believes in reducing taxation. How much would we have got from other governments that would have been honest about it? Mr Bourchier-How much would they have if we had not introduced indexation. Can you tell the truth?",92
255,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"Peopl e cannot live on what they would have paid. Having read this GovernpoUcy speech last year when it was anon nounced in the House that the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs would introduce a Repatriation Act Amendment Bill, I assumed it would provide certain benefits. The only repatriation benefit that was promised in the last policy speech was that allied ex-servicemen would receive equal the treatment with United Kingdom ex-servicemen, but it has not happened. What has happened instead is another series of broken promises so far he as this Government is concerned. The Prime to Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) probably does the not remember because he remembers only things that are convenient for him. What is happening in this particular piece of legislation is the abolition of six-monthly automatic adjustments of repatriation pensions in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. How will the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Burns) vote on that issue? How will the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for St George vote on that particular issue? They talk big but we will see how they vote on this particular piece of legislation. The Government has reintroduced a means test, an income test for pensions, for example, for those over the age of 70 on the service pension. This particular piece of legislation removes the sustenance aUowance and abolishes acceptance of pulmonary tuberculosis as being war caused. There were five more lies,fivemore broken promises in that particular section of the poUcy speech where the ex-servicemen were promised that their conditions would remain at least the same and would in fact be improved. As I said earlier, the Prime Minister's memory is always conveniently faulty. He has forgotten his promises just as he has forgotten when the former Minister for Administrative Services gave him certain information about the rort that the Government went for last year in Queensland.",92
256,Mr YATES,FRASER,What has that to do with the Budget?,93
257,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"It relates to the Budget because the Prime Minister makes certain promises, makes certain statements. The Prime Minister expects certain credibUity but he is lymg. He is lying continuously.",93
258,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER,Order! The honourable member for Prospect will withdraw that remark.,93
259,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,The Prime Minister is telUng deUberate untruths. I withdraw the word 'lies' and the House can judge for itself as to what the Prime Minister said and what the net results of the Prime Minister's statements were.,93
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER,I ask the honourable member for Prospect to withdraw the aUegations entirely.,93
261,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"I withdraw that it was a he and ask the House to judge how the performance of this Government has measured up to its promises, to the particular and specific promises that it made and broke. Let us look at the social security position as far as this particular amending piece of legislation is concerned. What is the Government domg in this particular piece of legislation? It is removing indexation of pensioners and benefits from a six-monthly to a yearly basis. Let us see what was said by the Minister for National Development (Mr Newman), who was then in charge of the legislation, when he introduced it back in 1976. He said: The Government has given a commitment to protect social security pensions from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting pension levels each six months according to the movements in the Consumer Price Index. The honourable member for St George said: We are keeping meticulously to the promise to adjust the benefit every six months. The Government said in its pohcy speech that it would not interfere with the abolition of the means test for those over 70. What has it done? It has reintroduced the means test for those over 70, not only ex-servicemen but also other people over 70. It has broken that particular promise and it will be interesting to see the administrative cost of checking on the means test for those over the age of 70 and finding out just how much the net saving is to the Government. The Government talks a lot about the famtiy. Just before election time it came out and found royal commission reports, et cetera, which allegedly were supported by the Labor Party and which may have had some adverse effect on the famUy. But this particular Government has aboUshed the maternity allowance just when it changes medical insurance schemes and reintroduces medical costs as far as confinements are concerned. For thefirsttimefor approximately four orfiveyears there is an actual medical cost involved for confinements. This is the exact time when this Government decides to abolish the maternity allowance which is supposed to cover that particular cost. As far as the famUy is concerned, by not indexing family allowances, which replaced indexed taxation deductions, the Government is reducing the value of those family aUowances. Certainly it is reducing them by comparison with the savings that would have applied to all taxpayers. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which I showed earUer to the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). Leave granted. The table read asfollows1st child . . . 2nd child . . . 10.32 3rd child . . . 15.48 4th child . . . 20.64 Sth child . . . 25.80 6th child . . . 30.96 In this table the $200 child tax rebate introduced in rebates. This would now be at least $269 per child, that is $5.16 obtained by indexing by 13 per cent in 1976-77, by",93
262,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"The table shows quite clearly that every taxpaying family in this country will lose a significant amount of money because of the Government's failure to index family allowances. If we had continued with the Labor Party scheme, the so-called Hayden scheme, under which a tax rebate of $200-no t a deduction from taxable income but an actual rebate-wa s introduced in the 1975-76 Budget, to be indexed in line with other tax rebates, that rebate would now be $269 per child. That is $5.16 per week per child for a taxpaying family. Those figures are obtained by indexing the amount by 13 per cent for 1976-77, by 10.9 per cent for 1977-78, and by only 7.6 per cent for 1978-79. Those are the exact figures that this Government has used in relation to allowances. What would have been the net result of that? Under our scheme, a family with one child would have received a tax rebate of $5.16 a week plus child endowment of 50c, making a total payment of $5.66 a week. AU that that family receives now is $3.50 a week. There is a loss to the famUy of $2.16 a week. A famUy with two chUdren would have been entitled to a tax rebate of $10.32 a week, with cluld endowment of $1 for the second chUd and 50c for the first chtid, making a total of $11.82 a week. That family now receives $3.50 for the first child and $5 for the second chtid, making a total of $8.50 a week. There is a loss to the family of $3.32 a week. SimUarly, for a famtiy with three chUdren there is a loss of $4.48, for a fantily with four chUdren a loss of $5.89, for a fantily withfivechUdren a loss of $6.55, and for a family with six chUdren a loss of $7.46 a week. That represents a net loss to every taxpaying famUy in this country and is in addition to the extra taxation which is being levied. As I indicated earlier, there has been an increase of nearly 50 per cent in individual pay-asyou-earn taxation since this Government came to power. What is the Government doing about (C) (D) (A) (B) 1977-78 Cumulative (A + B - D ) Tax-rebate Child (A&B) Family total of Loss to now lost endowment Cumulative allowance family taxpayer's (cumulative) under Labor total unchanged allowance family $ a week $ a week $ a week $ a week $ a week $ a week 5.16 .50 5.66 3.50 3.50 2.16 1.00 11.82 5.00 8.50 3.32 2.00 18.98 6.00 14.50 4.48 2.25 26.39 6.00 20.50 5.89 2.50 34.05 7.00 27.50 6.55 2.75 41.96 7.00 34.50 7.46 the 1975-76 Hayden Budget has been indexed in line with other tax per week per child for a tax paying family. These figures are 10.9 per cent in 1977-78, and by 7.6 per cent in 1978-79. family allowances in this Budget? It is not indexing fantily aUowances; it is aboUshing family allowances for those children in receipt of allowances under prescribed educational schemes. Let me quote from the Bill before the House. On page 8 of the Social Services Amendment Btil the following prescribed educational schemes are set out: (a) the scheme known as the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; (b) the scheme known as the Adult Secondary Educauon Assistance Scheme; (c) the scheme known as the Pre-School Teacher Education Assistance Scheme; (d) the scheme known as the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme; (e) the scheme known as the Commonwealth Teaching Service Scholarship Scheme; (f) the scheme known as the Post-Graduate Awards Scheme; The parents of those students wtil lose the family allowance from now on. The Government is taking away the family allowance from the parents of students who are entitled to an allowance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, and we all know that a severe means test is applied under that Scheme. In other words, the Government is taking away the famUy aUowance from those parents whose chUdren quaUfy to receive a benefit under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and other schemes, yet it is not removing the family allowance from those people who earn much more. If a parent earns a very large amount of money, earns too much for his student child to receive the TEAS allowance, and is able to send his chtid to university or to some other tertiary institution, there is no attempt to remove the family allowance. However, the famtiy aUowance payable to those parents who quaUfy under the means test will actually be removed. An attack is being made on migrants' children Uving abroad and it is very difficult to judge the significance of this. The Opposition has asked for this legislation and the repatriation legislation to be referred to one of the legislation committees which have been set up by this House. That request has been refused. I am sorry it has been refused. I usuaUy try to argue rationaUy on these BUls. We try to get mformation from the Minister in charge of a Bill or from the Government's advisers, but on this occasion we will not be able to get that information. Let us look at the contents of this particular legislation for which honourable members opposite will be voting. I am quite sure that honourable members opposite wtil not know the significance of their votes. They wtil not know what they are voting for. I draw attention to clause 16 of the Social Services Amendment BUT which will change the wording of section 83AAD of the Act. Two words in that section are to be changed and I will read both the section and the amending clause to the House. I challenge the honourable member for Denison, who has legal quaUfications. Mr Burns-They are pretty poor. They are only from Tasmania.",94
263,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"I know they are only from in Tasmania. Nonetheless, honourable members opposite wtil be supporting this legislation. not saying necessarily that I would not support but I would like an explanation of the reason the changes. The present wording of the Act states: A benefit shall not be granted to a person who is ing parent unlessI emphasise the world 'unless' because that being changedThe Director General considers the supporting parent should have taken action to obtain maintenance from the person or persons who is or are the father or fathers or the mother or mothers as the case of the child or children in relation to whom the first mentioned person is the supporting parent and that that person has taken such action to obtain such maintenance as the Director General considers reasonable. That is the wording of the present legislation, and by substituting the word ' if for the word 'unless' it is being amended to read: A benefit shall not be granted ing parent if the Director General considers that it is reasonable that the supporting parent should have taken action to obtain maintenance from the person or persons who is or are the fathers or fathers or the mother or mothers as the case may be of the child or children in relation to whom the first mentioned parent is the supporting parent and that person has not taken such acuon to obtain such maintenance as the Director General considers reasonable. We have asked a number of lawyers to look at this and a number of Opposition members have looked at it. We cannot see the difference. We cannot see the significance of it. There may be a terribly obvious explanation, I am not denying that for a moment, but I would Uke to have some intelUgent discussion in one of the legislation committees that we have set up, hopefully for just this purpose, in order to get that explanation and to come to a reasonable opinion without having to divide the House. It is completely pointless that we are forced to divide the House when members on both sides of the House, in some cases, do not know what they are voting for or against. We waste about 10 minutes on every division when we could have a short discussion with somebody who knows what the legislation is aU about. That might resolve the problem altogether because we might agree with it. Similarly, there is other legislation deaUng with the non-payment of benefits for certain children overseas. I do not know what chUdren are involved in that case but I fear that it is an attack on certain members of the migrant community. There is no doubt that in the Department of Social Security a strong anti-migrant bias exists. One has to look only at the attitude in Sydney as far as Australians of Greek origin are concerned relation to social security payments. It is quite ridiculous, I would argue, that some hundreds of I am cases have allegedly been brought against it, beneficiaries who are of Greek origin and almost for none against people of any other origin. Let us assume for a moment that these cases are based on fact. There must have been a concentration on a supporta particular grouping in the community to obtain evidence against them. Surely an across-theis board investigation would not reveal that 1,000 plus people of Greek origin and none of any that it is reasonable that other origin were in receipt of social security benefits to which they were not entitled. I just do not believe that it would. I repeat: There is an obmay be vious anti-migrant bias amongst the members of the Department of Social Security and, I think, amongst the members of the Commonwealth Police Force who were involved in this matter. I make that statement, but I would be very happy to withdraw it if it could be shown that I am wrong. to a person who is a supportThat bias in the Department of Social Security is all the more reason for our getting some explanation as to why the changes have been introduced. Similarly, we do not know exactly what the changes to the Repatriation Act will mean. We do not know how many people will be mvolved and just what kinds of tests will be imposed for people who are presently receiving benefits for pulmonary tuberculosis. Just how strict will the tests be to relate pulmonary tuberculosis to service? We all know that certain people are much more susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis than others. All kinds of factors are involved in a frank case of pulmonary tuberculosis. All of us have been exposed to tubercle cillus at some stage, but very few of us become sufferers of pulmonary tuberculosis. How will the Department of Veterans' Affairs decide what was due to war service?",95
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRASER, ever Order! The honourable member's time has tation expired.,96
265,Mr HODGMAN,FRASER,"The credit contribution of the Opposition to what I beheve is an important debate can be described only as pitiful and disgraceful. The shabby and somefar what rambling diatribe by the honourable appreciation member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) was, to say the least, disappointing for a man who is reputed to be one of the most intelligent members of the Parhament. In my respectful submission, his formance tonight was nothing short of disgracepassion. ful. (Quorum formed). When in due course the pensioners of Austraha read Hansard they will be interested to learn that during the debate these social welfare Bills tonight three quorums were called by the Labor Party. On the first Dicky. occasion three Labor Party members were present, on the second occasion three were present and on the third and last occasion four were present. That means that the average tendance of the Labor Party in this chamber ing the forming of a quorum over the last hour has been three and a half. That is indeed flattering. Mr Haslem-Whic h one is the half?",96
266,Mr HODGMAN,FRASER,"We do not need to look too hard to see which one is the half. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would not have believed that this important debate dealt with 27.8 per cent total Budget outlays. We are talking about propriation of $8,015m, an increase of $524m the actual expenditure last year for social security and social welfare, which amounted to $7,490m. Of that total appropriation of $8,015m some $6,602m is to be expended on pensions and benefits payable under the Social Services Act. That represents an increase of $399m over that paid in 1977-78. So we see that the Labor is the great poser. It beheves that it can con pensioners every election time into believing that it is genuinely concerned for them. Members of off the Labor Party have been revealed tonight as posers and hypocrites, prepared once again to play politics with the pensioners of Australia in a most shabby and disgraceful manner. The honourable member for Prospect, having slunk out of the chamber at the conclusion of his ba- remarks, has now come back into the chamber. He concluded his remarks by accusing the entire Department of Social Security of being antimigrant. He also tossed in the Commonwealth Police Force for good measure. That would be one of the most irresponsible accusations I have heard in my life. I do not have a great repufor defending pubhc servants or Ministers, but I do say on this occasion that the honourable member did little credit to himself, did little to the people in this chamber and did little credit to those who are going to read this debate by his outrageous allegation. These officers are from being anti-migrant. I place on record my of the officers of the Department of Social Security in Tasmania, from the Director down. I place on record my appreciation of the present Director-General of Social Services, Mr perLanigan, for his approachability and his comReally, how anybody like the larrikin member for Prospect can stand in this chamber and describe the Department of Social Security on as anti-migrant and get away with it just makes one wonder. No wonder he is called Tricky Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall come back to the atlegislation and say in specific terms to the durhonourable member for Prospect that I do not take any great pleasure in responding to him when he called the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) a hypocrite. The honourable member for St George has more character and more courage than many honourable members on the other side of the House. I do not believe it is appropriate for him to be described as a hypocrite when he has the courage ofhis convictions to stand up and speak out on matters of of the conscience. The honourable member for an apProspect made a big statement about whether on the honourable member for St George would do this or that. Apart from Captain Sam Benson, I do not remember any member of the Labor Party standing up on a matter of conscience and saying: T disagree with what the Party machine has said'. I do not recall any member of the Labor Party crossing the floor. I do not recall Party Labor members abstaining from voting. Of the course they would not because they are prisoners of the Left, and if they move one inch out of line, goes the head. It is tragic to see captive brains, genius brains, such as those of Dr Blewitt, a prisoner of the Left, locked into a situation where they cannot excerise their independent will and conscience. I will not speak at great length because heve the matters to which I want to advert are clear cut. It does not worry me one iota what honourable member for Prospect says about me or indeed even thinks about me. The fact is that want to put my position clearly in this Parliacise ment, as I have done from the day Ifirstwalked into this chamber and as I will continue to do until the day I walk out of here. Unlike the honourable member for Prospect, who thinks he is immortal, I recognise that the day will when I will walk out of here. I want to avert to three specific matters beheve are matters of importance. I am proud to be a member of a party in which the conscience of its members is recognised. That, I think, of the most valuable things about being a member of our party. Back in 1975 in what was fairly heated campaign, if one might say so, what was a campaign in which the Labor Party sought to generate a phoney constitutional the people of Australia were looking to real value. In particular, the pensioners of Australia were looking for some alternative to the they wretched, rotten, despicable government which had decided to tax them most viciously as it had done in the Budget of 1974 and the Hayden ror Budget of 1975. We went to the pensioners of Austraha and said: Tn order that politics may be taken out of pensions, we will grant automatic vote. and instantaneous indexation of your pensions'. As the honourable member for St George has recalled, in 1976 we made history in this country by being the first government to legislate for automatic pension increases. It is something which we can be very proud, and that legislation was in pursuance of the pledge given during December 1975 Federal election campaign. Mr Bourchier-It was a promise kept.",96
267,Mr HODGMAN,FRASER,"It was indeed a promise kept and, if I might say so, a promise kept is promise which will be respected. I must say that at that time. I found it difficult to accept that monthly increases were 'automatic and instancision. taneous' in view of the fact that the cost of living was indexed quarterly. But nevertheless, Uke honourable member for St George and many mto other honourable members, I went along with it. I would find it legally impossible and, as a matter of conscience, completely impossible that annual indexation, as I see it, is either automatic or instantaneous. So I find myself in exactly the same position as the honourable member for St George in respect of that provision. I do not believe it is consistent either with the pledge that we made in 1975 or indeed with I be the comments that we made in 1977 that we had 'taken politics out of pensions'. For those reasons the I wish to make it quite clear that unlike those prisoners on the other side of the House who are I just Uttle minions and pawns I am going to exera conscience vote on this matter, and I will not support the provision. (Quorum formed). The numbers on the Labor Party side have increased sUghtly on this occasion but once again come it demonstrates their absolute contempt and their absolute lack of concern for the welfare of the pensioners of Australia. And shame on those which I people who sit opposite. They are condemned for their poliucal cynicism for once agam playing politics with pensions and with pensioners. The is one extraordinary thing about the rabble on the other side of the chamber is that even when we a on this side are agreeing with them they are so in thick that they have to interrupt us. It is most incredible. They interrupted the honourable crisis, member for St George when he was agreeing with the comments made by the Leader of the Opposiuon (Mr Hayden). They are so stupid, are so incompetent and they are so insensitive to the needs of the pensioners of Australia that they will remain in opposition at least until horthe year 2001. The next matter I want to ",97
268,Mr HOLDING,FRASER,Tell us how you are going to,97
269,Mr HODGMAN,FRASER,"I would like to ask the honourable member when he has ever voted according to his conscience and crossed the floor. of He would not have the intestinal fortitude to cross the floor. He is not going to worry me one the iota. As my colleague the honourable member for St George said, after all he is a pohtical retread-a n escapee from the Victorian Parliament. I now turn to the question of means testing the over-70 year olds. I take a contrary view to that expressed by my colleague the a honourable member for St George. I do not believe that the decision to means test increases for sixpensioners over the age of 70 years is a good deI believe it to be a decision which is distressing a large number of people, which will be the an administrative nightmare and which intrudes my concept of social justice. It is a provision which I find totally unacceptable. I would therefore not be prepared to cast my vote in support of to argue that provision. Lastly I wish to turn to a matter which has not been discussed by any other honourable member, and it is the question of maternity allowances. I beheve that the question of maternity allowances is a matter of some importance. I am staggered-no , I am not really staggered that members of the Labor Party are not concerned with maternity and motherhood. They are carrying the can for the abortion racketeers in this country at the moment.",97

275,Dr KLUGMAN,FRASER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you heard what the honourable member for Denison just said. He said that we did not speak about maSpeakerternity allowances. In my speech I spoke for about three minutes on the abohtion of maternity allowances, and I pointed out that for the first time mothers will now have to pay for their confinement, and this is at atimewhen the Governhe ment is abolishing maternity allowances.",98

I cannot the Chair but the last remark made by the honourable member for Denison was most offenthem. sive. He accused the honourable member for Prospect of being the last of the racketeers. Mr Neil-He did not. Mr Keith Johnson-You had better check the merecord tomorrow. That is what I heard him say and it is extremely offensive to any member of this House.

312,Mr HOWE,PAIRS," I think that his most members would agree that the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) and the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) are both people of remarkable intelligence. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Denison tonight chose to waste the time of the House by devoting himself as he did in the great bulk ofhis speech to trivia instead of devoting himself to sustained criticism of a Budget against which I am sure he has more profound objections than were reflected in his speech. This Social Services Amendment Bill represents an important stage in the development of this Government's pohcies. It marks the point where the failure of the Government's overall economic strategy begins seriously to affect the Government's capacity to maintain effective programs on social services and social security. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle), who began her Ministry back in December 1975 with considerable optimism concerning the Government's pohcies, is now the victim of the prolonged economic recession in which those policies have produced. In until December 1975 the Minister for Social Security spoke of the fact that Australia could not be prosperous nation with so many people out of work. However, she claimed that the resources her Department would be directed towards solvconcern ing this massive problem. She said: The opening up of wider and unexplored employment areas will certainly ease pan of the problem . . . The reahty has been that rather than this Government opening up wider and unexplored rate areas for employing more people, least partially responsible for narrowing those opportunities and plunging the country more into recession. Unfortunately for the Department of Social Security the effect of this prolonged cession has been to increase enormously the responsibilities of the Department while the Government constantly seeks to restrain pubhc expenditure across the board. It is just nonsense for members on the Governwould ment side to claim that the increases in this Budget represent any improvement in the real repeatedly situation of social service beneficiaries. The Government must spend more because more people are receiving social service benefits and many more people will continue to receive social service benefits as long as this Government pursues its present economic course. It is for reason that the Government has introduced into this Bill a number of changes which in no sense can be described as reforms. They have to be recognised as representing a attempt on its part to restrain spending in the social security area for no rational reason other than its desire to save revenue in oblique ways which have the less dramatic political impact. Of course, many of these changes represent the reverse of what the Government had promised in previous election speeches. Thus the Minister is drawn more deeply into the web of dishonesty and deception which is the hallmark of this Government. One can run through the series of measures which are part and parcel of the Social Services Amendment Bill. Perhaps I could refresh the minds of honourable members by recalling those measures to which speakers on this side of the House and most of the speakers, if not all of the speakers, on the other side of the House have drawn attention. The Government had promised repeatedly that pensions and benefits would be indexed oh a biannual basis. However, clause 6 of this legislation ensures that this year's increase pensions and benefits will be the last increase November 1979, thus effectively eroding the real value of the pensions and benefits which a are being paid. Biannual indexation was being held up by the Government and the Minister for of Social Security as evidence of the Government's and, indeed, as proof of the Government's credibility. On 28 September the Minister was asked in the other place whether there was some suggestion that the Government would change its pohcy on biannual indexation if the of inflation fell. In answer to that question it has been at the Minister said: The policy itself and the introduction of that policy into relegislation made no qualification. Therefore no argument is produced to answer the suggestion. We cannot accuse the Government and the Minister of lying because to do so be unparliamentary. But the reality neveryear's the less is that this is a Government which says something in terms of its policy if there is a vote in it but when it comes to the many crunch it does not deliver. It is undoubtedly true that the failure of in this dexation will drive a larger number of people, particularly people in receipt of the unemployment benefit, into poverty. This has been established by a table which I seek leave to incorporrather desperate ate in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsCouple with 2 children unemployed . . . Couple with 5 children unemployed . . .",99
313,Mr HOWE,PAIRS,"The table emphasises the desperate situation of the family where the usual income earner is unemployed. It underlines the sinular plight of the single parent with child. In the first case, the unemployed household with two dependent children will by November 1979 have fallen $20 below the poverty line. In the case of the single parent with child the gap will have reached $25. Quite clearly the elimination of biannual indexation does not explain those figures alone but it does contribute to what is a desperate situation. I beheve that the principal point that should be emphasised is that people dependent on pensions are highly dependent on the marginal dollar income and what may appear on the surface to be minor if not rational cost saving devices can have a major impact on the situation of people living on or around the poverty line. This is, of course, especially the case where people are solely dependent on pension and benefit income. We must place that change within the context of some other relevant facts. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) referred to the fact that the allowance for dependent children of pensioners is not indexed and remains at $7.50 a week. It would have been $9.70 a week if indexation had been continued. Family allowances which have been introduced on a nonmeans tested basis are not being indexed. Thus the real value declines from year to year. The permissible earnings for pensioners remains at a fixed figure which means that pensioners who are able to attract additional income lose their pension once that income rises to $20 a week for single pensioner and $34 a week for married pensioners. One can go on and refer to a number of other measures that are included in the Bill. It provides for the introduction of an income test on further pension increases for people who are 70 years age and over which suggests that the Governthing ment is reneging on its repeated promise to eliminate the means test on old age pensions. One must underhne again that whatever might be the Gap between Gap between Benefit Poverty benefit and Poverty benefit and level line poverty line line poverty line Nov. 78 Nov. 78 Nov. 78 Nov. 79 Nov. 79 $ S $ $ $ 102.90 124.50 13.10 130.70 19.30 + 8.50 FA 126.20 178.10 24.40 187.00 33.30 + 27.50 FA 64.70 85.50 16.80 89.80 25.10 + 3.50 FA rationality of this policy it is not what the Government went to an election on. To renege on that promise within a matter of months of an election represents dishonesty and treachery on the part of the Government when we relate the situation to that section of the population. One can go on to refer to the elimination of family allowances for students under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. One can talk about the removal of maternity allowances. That is certainly not the sort of thing one would have wanted to mention last year. One could talk about the shift from the weekly payment of benefits to the monthly payment of benefits. This represents a saving to the Government in this year of perhaps $30m which could have made a difference to many people's family income. Finally, and most significantly, we have in this legislation extremely shabby treatment of the unemployed. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Guilfoyle, has earned a reputation for fighting vigorously to protect the interests of her Department. However, despite frequent expressions of concern, she does not have a very impressive record of fighting to protect the interests of the unemployed. We have to be reminded of the early days of her ministry. Honourable members will remember that the Minister was going to root out the cheats, the chisellers and the bludgers. So we had the tightening up of the work test guidelines, the introduction of identity checks, and the Umitation of people's classifications so that people who were skUled workers had to be prepared to take unskUled work. We had the shifts in policy so that the unemployment benefit could not be paid to school leavers and we had the example of the Karen Green case. In this Budget we can afford another $7m for Department of Social Security staff to try to cut of down the rolls by what they estimate to be somelike 17,000 people at a reported saving of $50m. This is related to an attempt to force people who are genuinely unemployed out of a situation in which they regard themselves in a real sense as part of the work force. We know that hundreds of thousands of Australians are currendy not registered for employment but, nevertheless, they are interested in being part of the work force. This Government is frightening people out of the work force. It is creating an atmosphere in which people who have rights are being denied thoserights.The reaUty is that despite those measures in this financial year we will see in excess of $900m spent on unemployment benefits notwithstanding that thousands of people will be denied their right to receive proper unemployment benefits. This will be the case when unemployment ing benefits are paid at rates which for many people will mean Uving well below the poverty Une. only are people being dissuaded their right, that is unemployment benefits, but also at the same time those benefits are being paid at an abysmal and shamefully low level. Single people are receiving $36 a week. That figure has not changed since 1975. We know what that means. It means that not only can people not afford to live independently but also when they go back into their family situation they are then dependent upon their families. It costing more money for famUies who are very often-indee d in the majority of cases-lowe and middle income families. They are being asked to cany a burden for which the Governreer ment ought to take responsibUity. We see also that the benefits paid to people will be indexed annually rather than biannually. This means that November 1979 will be the first occasion which they will receive an increase after the crease which is provided in this Budget. One could go on to look at the treatment of the unemployed by the Government in its social seducing curity policy. The pretensions of the Government, like those of the honourable member for Denison, have been very great. The Government has stated consistently that whatever it might for the average man it will really look after person who is in trouble. I resist the suggestion from any honourable member on the other side of the House that the unemployed in the overmism whelming majority are in any sense bludgers second-class citizens. In a real sense, the unemconfront ployed are the scapegoats. They are being made scapegoats by this Government for a system which is breaking down in a fundamental way. They reflect the irrationality of late monopoly capitalism, which does not place a value on people and which benefits from the existence the reserve army of unemployed supported minimally not out of profits but predominantly out of income tax. As the Minister for Social Security has repeatedly pointed out, 60 per cent of all personal mcome tax goes into pensions and benefits. That is the crux of the problem. We are increasingly building a society in which an increasingly less equitable tax system is being asked to bear a larger and larger burden which flows down from failures of the economic system. We have a government in power which is on about providing an increasing income tax whUe transferring larger and larger subsidies to large scale and monopoly capital. This is a government which wiU move inexorably towards Umitehgibility for benefits such as unemployment benefits because its focus will not be on people Not and their need but will be more and more on from receiving large scale capital. This is why the alternative Budget proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) makes so much sense. It represented a strategy designed to protect the interests of working people by using the tax system to make real transfers of wealth to the lower mcome groups via a resources tax and capital gains taxes, the is development of universal systems of health and social security, and the opening up of meaningful r work opportunities for the unemployed. It is extraordinary that a Minister who began her cain the Ministry speaking about the need to fine down bureaucracy has moved to add further and further to that bureaucracy by adding thousands of additional employees and increasing the on emphasis on surveUlance powers whUe doing inlittle to make any contribution towards solving the fundamental problems which are giving rise to an ever-increasing social welfare bill. This Government's economic faUures are proan enormous social cost. That cost will grow and grow. We are producing a generation of bitter Australians who are being maintained do on the perimeter of society as non-participants the and as spectators. They must increasingly come to question this society and the current social system. I guess that in this there is room for optibecause we need to be thinking more rador ically about our society and the problems that it. It is simply not good enough to be encouraging millions of Australians to accept a second-class standard of Uving whtie the lucky, the tough or the powerful enjoy the security of their ruling class situation. This Parliament is increasingly taking on the of appearance of unreahty as it lurches on from Budget to Budget without encouraging any real debate about the need for any fundamental changes. We are increasingly as a Parhament unrepresentative and therefore unable to sympathise with the situation of a larger and larger number of Austrahans. It is as if we had no empathy for the insecurity that is felt by people about the possibility of being entirely dependent on minimal benefits which are rarely established as a right. We have no sense of the sheer marginality of existence in the working class electorates of Austraha where there is now virtually no freedom of choice. We have Utde or no capacity to experiment with change and our sense of what represents a high standard of community facilities is abysmally low. We constantly allow ourselves the luxury of extraordinarily high standard facilites for the few whilst permitting and even encouraging the poorest quaUty services for the less powerful-and in education we have a classic example of that. We have a Umited commitment to equaUty of opportunity but no sense of the fact that people cannot equally grasp opportunities. We rely in an unthmking way on the so-called private sector, despite ever-abundant evidence of its injustice, irrationaUty, and the lack of any effective control by workers or consumers over investment decisions. The poor, the unskUled and the working people of this country almost never influence important priority decisions, and in a real sense we no longer have any feeUng for what their priorities may be. We are the victims of myth and rumour and each day social divisions grow rather than dirninish. This Parliament is an isolated, classbound institution and this Bill simply reflects that fact. We need a new approach to social security. We need simpUfied legislation. We need more estabUshed rights and less arbitrary discretion being practised by Directors-General or other members of the Department of Social Security. We need more independent and more representative tribunals. We need to be aiming for the reduction of inequality and not the mere elimination of poverty. We need to decentraUse and make Government bureaucracy more responsible. The Government spoke about that, but what happened to the BaUey report? We need to remove all sense of distinction between the deserving and the undeserving poor. Perhaps more than anything else, what this legislation is about is the re-enforcement of that particular distinction, which belongs in the nineteenth century, where the Tory Party opposite belongs as well. We need to give all Australians access to adequate welfare services, on the assumption that they contribute to people's real income. We need to recognise that social security wiU continue to absorb a very high proportion of the Commonwealth Budget, but ensure that it is not paid for by working people in the main; that it is genuinely redistributive. It is this last proposition that people are coming to doubt. There may well be a tax revolt in this country. What that may be about is the inequality of the current taxation system. Let us not talk simplistically about simply reducing taxes for everyone, and at the same time ensure that the greatest benefit goes to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his class. Let us have a real look at the equity in the taxation system and see which of the parties can win an election on that issue. I have no doubt which party it will be. Mr Armitage- Iriseto a point of order. Prior to the introduction by the previous Labor Government, of the 11 o'clock rule, it was the convention of this Parliament that when .the House was to sit mto the early hours of the morning, such as 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock-as obviously will happen tonight-suppe r would be provided for members at 11 p.m. I rise to ask whether this convention is to be observed-o r yet another convention is to be broken-and whether arrangements have been made for members to be provided with supper tonight?",101
314,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The Chair is not aware that any special arrangements have been made for honourable members but I suggest that the vigour that they have been displaying tonight indicates that they could carry on without sustenance until breakfast time. Mr Armitage- Mr Deputy Speaker, I reaUse that you might not have been in the Parliament when that convention was observed; but it was certainly observed prior to 1972.",103
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I have ruled on the point of order. The honourable member for Chifley knows better than to resume discussion on the point. (Quorum formed).,103
316,Mr MCVEIGH,PAIRS,"To organise and manage a nation properly requires outstanding people-me n and women who seek responsibUity and who know challenge. This legislation is the product of the activities of such men and women. Notwithstanding a difficult economic environment we are not neglecting our senior people, our young or our handicapped. This Budget humanises and dignifies our economic system. The total outlay on social security and general welfare items is 27.8 per cent of estimated total Budget oudays, an increase from $7,490.3m last year to $8,014.7m this year. Incidentally, it is worth reporting that in 1973-74, under the adrninistration of the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), the total allocation was a paltry $ 1,200m. We are dealing with a huge number of people. There are 1,756,000 pensioners in Australia and 4,305,000 chUdren are covered by the various famUy aUowance and assistance schemes. The Government's pohcy is to give help to people in the greatest need. It is a real human, Christian phUosophy. I believe that it is appropriate to recall in this debate some of the utterances of the present Leader of the Opposition when he had the honour of delivering the Chifley Memorial Lecture in 1973. He said: Social welfare and economic are too often discussed in isolation from each other even though it is common for discussions of either subject to pay lip service to the importance very often economic policy and social welfare policy are perceived as being antagonistic when in fact they are necessarily complementary. It is for governments as the ultimate makers and implementers of social and economic policy to establish a consistent and systematic set of priorities which can be superimposed on those of the various specialist interests, and quite clearly no government is in a position to satisfy all the demands of a population at a given time. Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition when deUvering the Chifley Memorial Lecture in 1973. In this legislation the Government has done all those things and has been responsible. It has been a responsibUity that has been very difficult to exercise. I do not want to harrow the same ground but in 1975 the Government received an inheritance from the Treasury which in effect made us a bankrupt nation. That has been the difficult road for us to hoe ever since. I want to correct some of the utterances of the Leader of the Opposition, and I want to be NA NA Date pension increase first payable (a) Standard married October 1972 . . . . . . March 1973(c) . .

I say merely that he flirted rather dangerously with the truth in some of the statistics he quoted. He criticised this Government for not increasing old age and social security pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly income in accordance with the plan of the Labor Government. Thefiguresare interesting. When the Fraser-Anthony Government was returned to the treasury benches in December 1975 the average weekly mcome was $166.90. The standard single pensioner rate was 23.2 per cent of that amount and the combined married rate was 38.6 percent.",103
317,Mr LLOYD,AND COMBINED MARRIED RATES OF PENSION,Les s than 25 per cent. policy are two subjects which,104
318,Mr MCVEIGH,AND COMBINED MARRIED RATES OF PENSION,"I take on board the point made by the honourable member for Murray, of the other. The result is that who said that it was considerably less than the 25 per cent which the Labor Government sought to achieve but which it never even remotely attained. Yet at present, with the average weekly wage for the June 1978 quarter being $215, which is an increase from $166.90, the percentages are 23.9 per cent, which is a significant increase from the 23.2 per cent under the Labor Government, and 39.3 per cent for a married . couple, compared with the 38.6 per cent under Labor. I have a table which indicates that the Leader of the Opposition flirts dangerously with the truth and does not give the facts. The truth is that we have improved the situation with regard to social security pensioners. I seek leave to have that table incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.

319,Mr MCVEIGH,WHICH THAT RATE OF PEI SION WAS FIRST PAYABLE,"We also want to correct some other anomaUes because of the fear that has been put in the minds and hearts of pensioners by speeches that we have heard from members of the Opposiuon tonight. I want to make it crystal clear that every person, when he or she reaches 70 years of age, will receive the pension which is presently appUcable. In effect every person, when he or she reaches 70 years of age, will receive a pension. A means test wiU be imposed on any increases that are granted from dme to time. We are not recreant to the trust that was placed in us and we have Uved up to our promises which were part and parcel of promises given in the various election campaigns. I disagree with previous speakers from the Government side and I want to place emphasis on the total umbrella, the fuU sphere, of government activity. I appreciate the remarks of previous speakers, but I want to dissociate myself and my party from those remarks. In the final analysis when a government, through its sound economic policies and fiscal responsibiUty, creates an economic climate wherein the rate of mflation wiU be down to 5 per cent at the end of this financial year, it is reasonable that pension* be indexed only once a year. I stand firmly behind the Government because it is one of responsibUity and one which will not sell out for cheap, short term poltiical gain. Those poUcies are true and we colossal not denying a promise that we gave. We are assuring the pensioners that the prices of basic commodities like a loaf of bread and a tin of jam, on account of our financial policies, basically wtil be stabilised for 12 months. In that situation surely it is reasonable and responsible for a government to keep matters such as pensions and social security payments out of the pohtical arena and for them to be indexed forward according to movements in the consumer price index during the 12 months ending on 30 June. We are not denying pensioners anything. What we are giving them is total security. I want to talk about total security, including assistance in the area of housing. We have made it easier for people to obtain finance through various schemes and particularly through initiatmonwealth ives in the area of aged people's housing. In electorate of Darling Downs at present there accommodation for 74S aged people in various government aged housing institutions. It is interesting to note that in the term of our Government over 500 new self-contained hostel and nursing projects, providing some 15,000 beds, have been approved under the program of accommodation for aged people for the three year period 1976-79. More importantly, the program will be extended to a fourth year. In 1977-78 some 609 approved premises received a personal care subsidy for 16,166 aged people who needed special attention or who were over 80 years of age. This subsidy amounted to $ 12.6m, which is an increase of $ 1.5m over the subsidy in 1976-77. Some 400 senior citizen centre projects have been funded, to a colossal value of $28.5m, between 1976 and 1979. We have rationalised the income free pension for persons aged 70 years and over. From November 1978 it wtil be replaced by a fixed weekly pension rate of $51.45 for a single person and $85.80 for a married couple. Increases will be subject to an income test. The complex means test was removed so that a person's assets were not taken mto consideration under the formula; only income was taken into account. When all these matters are taken into consideration we as a government can stand secure in the knowledge that we have looked after our aged people and those who are what we might term the handicapped and unfortunate in our society. It is all very well to mention matters out of context in regard to the Budget, but if the matters are analysed in detaU they wiU indicate that we can be proud of them. I wish now to talk about the problem of unemployment and the payment of unemployment benefit. I was amazed at the rather curious pluratity of the logic expressed by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), who preceded me in the debate. All he wanted to speak about wasrights.We as responsible Australian citizens have an obligation to hold a balance between our rights and responsibUities. We want to ensure that the benefits are directed to those who are genuinely unemployed. A government surely would not be entitled to be regarded as a real government if it sat idly by and allowed that sort of situation to continue. Recently 182 people in Sydney were charged with defrauding the ComEmployment Service and the Demy partment of Social Security of between $6m and is $6.5m. There were 1,200 suspected cases of fraud. One officer in Sydney is under threat of sentence for lodging 351 forged applications involving amounts totalling $260,000. It is appropriate in those circumstances to suggest that the Government is not tough enough in policing the payment of unemployment benefit. I pay tribute to those who are unemployed and who are genuinely seeking work. They are victims of circumstance, and the hearts and minds of the Austrahan people go out to them. But I am not prepared to stand idly by and see the taxpayers' hard earned money being fraudulently used by people who are out to defeat the system. Mr Braithwaite-Parasites , that's what they are.",105
320,Mr MCVEIGH,WHICH THAT RATE OF PEI SION WAS FIRST PAYABLE,"My colleague the honourable member for Dawson aptly described them as parasites. These parasites have to be brought to heel. Notwithstanding the tremendous pressures exerted on society by civil Uberty groups, it is apI propriate these days to investigate the possibUity of introducing a system of identity cards. If suppUed those who are currendy unemployed with identity cards it would cost $ 1.3m. That smaU amount of money compared with the trauma amounts of money that are being fraudulendy misappropriated. University students, people who want to make cash transactions and people travelUng overseas have to produce positive proof of their identity. If we are serious about overcoming fraud and if we are serious about directing the taxpayers' money to those most in need, surely there can be absolutely no objection to our introducing a system of identity cards photographs in relation to people who receive social security benefits. I hope that some of 700 extra staff whose salaries are being appropridiscrimination ated in the Budget will be trained especially in methods of identifying the people who should ceive social security benefits. I hope that some sophisticated techniques will be evolved so that these staff members can make appropriate inveswrong tigations without causing offense. If we have intestinal fortitude we should stand up and be counted on this very important issue in order ensure that money which is appropriated for purpose of relieving those who are unemployed and those who find themselves in hardship does not go to other members of society. The aUowances we make avaUable for handioff capped people are another matter about which we can be tremendously proud. It is good to see that the Government has been very humane in its treatment of these very special people. would be appropriate also to give praise to those people who labour in spastic centres and for ganisations concerned with subnormal people. need. Only a few weeks ago, due to the initiative of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) who is a man of great compassion, a deputation of interested people led by the honourable member was able to see some of the things which are done in spastic centres and in homes for subnormal people. I know that the heart of the honourable member for Petrie was softened, and I am sure that the hearts of decent, honest people would have been softened, at the sight of a person who had no arms and no hands typing as good as any typist in Australia by means of an antenna on his head. I pay tribute therefore to any government which makes funds avaUable to decent Austrahan people who give of their time and energy to bring the light of day to unfortunate people such as those seen by the honourable member for Petrie and me. Mention has been made of famtiy allowances. think it is appropriate at this time to bring to the attention of people the fact that this Government we is a government of compassion and tolerance. It is to be regretted that through the mass media is a prior to the announcement of the Budget much was occasioned to, and much uncertainy was instilled in the minds of, many Australian famUies. The people who did this have no ethics and that is to be regretted. Family aUowances are part and parcel of our scheme. I advance the thought to the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) and the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) who are at the table, that when considering forward planning for good, decent living for all and Australian people, they bear in mind that under the arrangements for the payment of family althe lowances and tertiary assistance there is some against big famihes. I believe that the real strength of Australia is in our famUies, rethe big famUies that have pioneered the harsh land of Australia and made it one of the great trading nations of the world. I believe it would be for any government deUberately to design any poUcies in the long term that discriminated against large famUies. We find under the existing to arrangements that no famtiy can receive at one the and the sametimea family allowance and a Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, that the one child famUy is better off by $1.75 a week, that the two-chtid family is better off by 25c a week and that thefive-childfamily is worse by $ 1.75 a week. That is to be regretted. One appreciates the difficulty the Government faces in a tight economic situation, but I hope that the Ministers will as part of the forward plaiuting It provide as part and parcel of the Australian social security scheme extra assistance to large orfamUies because they are the famUies most in I want to correct a statement which was made by members of the Oppostion about secondary aUowances for students. Students in the last two years of secondary school can stUl get the fanuly and student allowances and I hope that those people who are facing traumas because of incorrect information on the subject sent out by Opposition members from time to time can take heart from the fact that families can still receive the student allowance in respect of secondary school children as well as the family allowance. I offer the suggestion that for future planning we should consider the indexation of family allowances. I know that the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) advanced an argument in relation to what has happened in this area. If we want to encourage Australian families and encourage mothers to stay at home we must index family allowances. The Labor Party comes in here with great criticisms, but let us examine what it did. In 1974 it reduced the education expenses allowance from $400 to $150 per annum again discriminating against the large family. It is appropriate that the taxation system should be redesigned to help large families and allow mothers to choose from alternatives available to them. There is no greater resource than a good, large family with the mother staying at home to look after it. We need to change our direction. I believe that it is appropriate to transfer the unemployment benefit paid to young people to mothers to enable them to stay at home. It seems to me to be reasonable, desirable and just where a married woman is holding down a position and an unemployed youngster is getting the unemployment benefit for the unemployment benefit to be paid in the form of an allowance to the mother to enable her to stay at home and for the young person to be given the opportunity to work. Unless people engage in work when they are young they will lose an appreciation of the work ethic. It is disappointing to see that the number of women in the work force increased from 444,700 in November 1961 to 1.4 million in 1977. The number of married women as a percentage of all women in the work force has increased from 42 per cent to 65 per cent in 1976. The taxation system needs to be one that taxes the family rather than the individual. It is wrong, I submit, in an overall tax strategy to have a situation where it is better for the wife to work and pay a lower rate of income tax than would be applicable if the extra money were earned by her husband. We do not seek to interfere with the right of a mother to work if she wishes, but we believe that those who do not want to work must not be made to work and that those who do want to work should feel free to do so. This is a responsible government. Much criticism has accrued to it. Most of that criticism has been unjust. I want to uphold the social security part of this Budget as a decision by a Government which wants to preserve basic family life, which wants to look after old people and which looks after old people in its total concept, not in isolation, but as part and parcel of fiscal responsibibty wherein each and everyone has a special right and a special role to play.",106

324,Mr HAYDEN,WHICH THAT RATE OF PEI SION WAS FIRST PAYABLE,"The honourable member for Darling Downs criticised me for saying earlier tonight that when the Labor Government left office the standard rate of pension was 25 per cent of average earnings. It was. The rate of pension which was introduced in about November 1975 was 25 per cent of average weekly earnings for the June quarter of that year. That is the proper and relevant basis to use to make that sort of measurement. It is the same sort of principle that the Government uses with its indexation; namely, until now, indexation has been on the basis of the half year to the June quarter. It will be the full year to the June quarter. It would be nonsense trying to measure a pension increase in relation to either the consumer price index or average weekly earnings for the December quarter when thosefiguresdo not come out until the succeeding new year. Mr MCVeigh- I seek to further the information that I gave in my speech.",107

Surely the types of committees we have established-the legislation committees-were set up for the purpose of getting some explanation from either the Minister in charge of the legislation or the Assistant Minister. It is quite obvious that this legislation will not be debated in the Senate before next week. So I cannot possibly see any reason why a legislation committee cannot meet for half an hour at sometimetomorrow so that those of us who are interested in this can get some explanations. This probably would save us a lot of bother in dividing on about seven parts of the social security legislation. It just strikes me as being a much more sensible approach.

Such referral shall be on motion moved by any Member, of which notice has been given, and shall be carried without any dissentient voice. A committee may be ordered to report by a specified date.

Standing Order 141 indicates that a notice of motion becomes effective only when it appears on the Notice Paper. The notice of motion which the honourable member for Prospect has foreshadowed does not appear on the Notice Paper. Mr Stewart-Speakin g to the same point of order, Standing Order 133 also states: Notice of motion shall be given by a Member by either stating its terms to the House and delivering a copy to the Clerk or delivering a copy of its terms to the Clerk.

365,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The repon on the operations of the registered medical and hospital benefits organisations under section 76A of the National Health Act, in respect of the year 1976-77, was tabled on 19 September 1978. (2) The Government recognises that the effectiveness of information contained in the repon must be reduced by delays in its publication. Steps are being taken to minimise such delays. (3) The main reason for the delay in tabUng the repon under section 76A of the National Health Act in recent years including the 1976-77 Repon has been the late lodgement of annual returns by many of the registered organisations. It seems that these delays have been largely due to administrative difficulties within the by changes to the health insurance arrangements. I understand, for example, that a number of organisations have had transitional problems following major changes to the Scheme from 1 October 1976. (4) The organisations in their annual accounts for 1976-77 within the statutory time of three months after the close of thefinancialyear are: New South Wales Grand United Order of Oddfellows, Friendly Society of New South Wales Health Insurance Commission Hibernian Australasian CathoUc Benefit Society of New South Wales Hunter Medical Benefits Fund Limited New South Wales District, No. 85, Independent Order of Rechabites, Salford Unity, Friendly Society Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Limited Manchester Unity Independent Order of OddfeUows, Friendly Society in New South Wales New South Wales Teachers' Federation Health Society N.I.B.

However, action has been taken against organisations under the provisions of sub-section 75 (3) of the Act on specific matters, although it has not been found necessary to initiate prosecutions under these provisions to date. I might add it has been decided that in future extensions under sub-section 76 (2) extreme circumstances. (5), (6) and (7) No directions have been served under secuon 74c of the Nauonal Health Act.
