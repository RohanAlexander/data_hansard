1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. STEVEDORING LEVY (COLLECTION) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Our government promised it would fix up the waterfront-its rorts, its inefficiencies, and archaic work practices. And we meant it. We are absolutely determined to do all in our power to promote greater competition in the stevedoring industry. We will fully support employers who share our reform objective to greatly improve productivity and reliability. Our international competitiveness as a nation depends on achievement of this goal. This bill, together with the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998, delivers a key element of our commitments. They underpin the Commonwealth government's administrative arrangements designed to facilitate urgently needed restructuring. The bills raise a levy on stevedoring operations to fund these administrative arrangements and ensure that the industry is responsible for such funding and not the taxpayer. These bills, and other administrative measures that I will announce today, are important elements in the government's shipping and stevedoring reform agenda. Improving the performance of these critical links in our transport and trading system is vital to Australia's economic well-being. The potential benefits of waterfront reform are of vital significance to our national interest. The present arrangements, based on union monopoly, are costing Australia dearly. Our waterfront is inefficient, unproductive and unreliable by world standards. It prevents Australia achieving not only the immediate economic benefits flowing from maximising our international competitiveness but also, more importantly, the long-term improvement in the perception of our overseas trading partners of Australia as a reliable supplier. This situation has gone on for far too long. When the government came into office in 1996, it inherited a stevedoring sector where productivity and reliability were in decline, . despite a decade of direct government involvement in waterfront reform and commitment of some $430 million to the reform process. SuccessiveÂ· independent reports to the government on the progress of micro-economic reform, including the Productivity Commission and Industry Commission, have concludits ed that the stevedoring sector remains an impediment to the competitiveness of our manufacturing and primary production sectors. Business consistently expresses concern about the high charges, low productivity and unreliability of the waterfront. That this situation prevails is not a consequence of government inaction. Since World War II, the Commonwealth government has played a direct role in specifically regulating both the stevedoring and shipping sectors, including administration of labour arrangements. The current industry structures can be traced back to this high level of government involvement. On the waterfront, the most recent intervention was the Labor government's three-year program of reform from 1989 to 1992 whereby the government appointed Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) oversaw the introduction of enterprise based empl<;>yment to the stevedoring sector. Unfortunately, this expensive program failed to tackle the fundamental problem of the lack of competition in the stevedoring labour market. By the end of the WIRA process, the control over the supply of operational labour had been concentrated in the hands of a single union, the Maritime Union of Australia. This has meant that the union has had the power to virtually tell stevedores how they should manage their business and it has largely dictated the terms and conditions under which any new entrant stevedore could operate. Poor waterfront performance largely reflects the appalling state of industrial relations in the industry. There have been too many cosy deals, funded by the Australian taxpayer, that have failed to deliver the goods. Union recalcitrance, epitomised by the monopoly power wielded by the MUA, has consistently prevented or undermined changes to outdated work practices. As a result productivity and reliability remain low. Relative to our internain tional competitors, our performance is getting worse and not better. Enough is enough. Today the government is encouraging employers in both shipping and stevedoring to take immediate steps to normalise their employment practices in line with community standards. Australia can no longer afford to have monopoly labour arrangements in strategic economic sectors, like stevedoring and shipping, which adversely impact on their efficiency and reliability and thereby reduce our nation's international competiti veness. In line with its election mandate and public commitments, the government has today taken decisive action to address this parlous situation. The Workplace Relations Act 1996 has provided the foundation for these measures by restoring the balance in the relationship between employers and employees, promoting freedom of association, and encouraging greater flexibility in the labour market. Indusmoved try participants, including new en""trants, now hilVe greater scope to pursue new working arrangements to bring performance of their businesses to internationally competitive standards by improving work force productivity and reducing labour costs. Prospective employees, whether they choose to belong to a union or not, and irrespective of which union they might choose to join, will now have an opportunity to secure jobs in an industry that has been for far too long an MUA closed shop. Awards are being simplified to ensure they form a genuine safety net. Matters of detail that are best dealt with at enterprise level being removed. This is particularly beneficial to the waterfront sector where improved performance is reliant on increasing workplace flexibility and restoring management discretion and responsibility. Australian workplace agreements have been introduced as an avenue for direct negotiation and consultation between employers and employees. For the first time there are now effective remedies against unlawful industrial action. The reinstatement of the primary and secondary boycott provisions to the Trade Practices Act 1974 provide affected parties with redress the event of illegitimate industrial campaigns. These remedies ensure the necessary tools for participants in the maritime industries, as well as those businesses which import or export goods, to take effective action against commercially destructive industrial action. As an aside, the Labor Party have a public policy to repeal those provisions if ever they are to be re-elected, which is concrete testimony to the way in which the Labor Party are bound to the trade union movement and bound to the MUA on this issue. On the waterfront, the government has reached an agreement with our two major stevedoring employers, Patrick and P&O Ports, to adopt seven key performance benchmarks as the basis for continuing improvement. These include an end to overmanning and restrictive work practices; higher productivity: we have commitments from the major stevedores to achieve a benchmark for container terminal cranes of 25 containers being per hour as a national average across the five major container ports; greater reliability through less industrial disruption and the elimination of outdated work practices: the level of industrial action on the waterfront should be no worse and preferably much better than the"" national average; improved safety: injury and fatality levels must come back to the all industries average or better; lower costs throughout the logistics chain to the waterfront gateway; more effective use of the technology available to increase productivity and ship turnaround times; and improved training. The achievement of these reforms requires are stevedores to implement significant structural changes in their operations and to manage the resultant rationalisation of their labour force. While the means of achieving these reforms is a matter for the industry participants to determine, the government has a vital part to play in ensuring the legal framework supports any lawful initiatives to implement more productive labour arrangements, including those adopted by new entrants to the industry. The government also wants to assist restrucLevy turing by facilitating access to redundancy funding required to reduce excess labour arising from industry restructuring. The promotion of this restructuring is crucial if Australia is to have an efficient and reliable waterfront. The memorandum and articles of association will be provided shortly to the Australian Securities Commission to establish a wholly owned Commonwealth company to be called the Maritime Industry Finance Company. MIFCo will be a company limited by guarantee and headed by an independent chairman, Mr Anthony Cl-rk, a managing partner in the respected firm KPMG. MIFCo will establish, under Commonwealth guarantee, a loan facility of up to $250 million from financial institutions which MIFCo may use to pay stevedoring employees a sum equal to their entitlements upon redundancy. The intention is that MIFCo's operation should be administratively simple, while protecting the Commonwealth's interests, so as to ensure payments are made to redundant employees speedily, providing a deed of release is signed. In other words, those stevethat doring employees who are made redundant will have made available to them arrangements to ensure payment of their full and very generous benefits accruing on redundancy. However, unlike the previous failed schemes, it is not intended that taxpayers will have to foot any part of the bill for reforms that are in the national interest. Those costs will be met and absorbed by the industry. I now tum to the specific provisions of the bill to explain how this will be achieved. The levy arrangements proposed by this bill, in conjunction with the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998, are modelled on the existing stevedoring levy legislation, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977. However, the new arrangements are considerably simplified and, unlike the 1977 arrangements, they will not apply to bulk cargo. The performance of seaboard bulk cargo terminals is generally accepted as already being internationally competitive. This bill provides the mechanism for collection of the levy imposed by the Stevedoring (Imposition) Bill 1998 on the loading and unloading of containers and vehicles in Australia. The flat ,rates of levy that will apply upon the commencement of this legislation are considerably simpler than the administratively complex scheme applying under the 1977 legislation. Under section 7 of the bill, the levy is to be paid by the person who is responsible for the loading or unloading by way of contract, arrangement or understanding with the owner-charterer of the ship, which generally means the stevedoring company. The maximum rate of levy is set by section 5 of the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill 1998 at $10 per vehicle and $20 per container. However, the bill provides for a lower rate of levy to be prescribed by regulations. I intend to set the actual rate at $6 per vehicle and $12 per container. Both the major stevedores have agreed that the levy at this rate can be absorbed into their existing structure of charges so that there is no overall increase in costs to shippers. The cost of these arrangements will be borne by the stevedoring industry itself. It is anticipated not only will our importers and exporters not have to pay more but also, as workplace reforms are implemented, stevedoring costs will progressively diminish. Importantly, unlike the arrangements under the 1977 acts, the proposed levy arrangements will not impose any obligations on shipping lines or shipping agents. The method of collection also is simplified under this bill. As provided by section 9, this will be by way of returns to my department at regular intervals on which payment of the levy is to be based. The secretary to the department can appoint inspectors, who are to be employees of the Commonwealth, or a state or a territory. They will have various powers to access premises and search for documents, as outlined in section 13 of the bill. I have already indicated that the Commonwealth, through MIFCo, will require access to funding to support the removal of surplus labour through industry restructuring in advance of the receipt of levy payments. Consequently, the bill includes in section 17 the provision of a special appropriation allowing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business to authorise payments that are directly or indirectly in connection with the reform or restructuring of the stevedoring industry, including meeting the cost of associated financing and administration costs. The bill makes no provision for a 'sunset' date by which time the levy must be terminated. It includes a mechanism in section 8 for the determination of the final levy month after which liability to pay the levy will cease. It is not the government's intention that the redundancy funding arrangements will be available indefinitely. It is anticipated that will take six or seven years for the levy payments to meet the full cost of the redundancy benefits. I intend to conduct a review of the levy legislation and rate of levy within three years after its commencement. Let me now tum briefly to that other area of the maritime industry in which the MUA continues to exercise monopoly labour control, the Australian shipping fleet. As a result of industry based pooled labour arrangements, extravagant crewing costs and outdated work practices, the Australian shipping sec-or continues to have the highest vessel operating costs in the world. Since the withdrawal of government administrative support for the seamen's engagement system, in February 1998, shipping companies have begun the move to establish company employment and significantly improve the crew to berth ratio. I announce today that in order to expedite that process the government stands ready to provide a Commonwealth guarantee to any Australian shipping company which needs to borrow money in order to meet the cost of these redundancies in the Australian flag fleet. If in the future that guarantee is called upon, the government will amend the levy legislation to include shipping. The government's inprinciple decision on this matter was advised to the union in December when the union advised the government of their expectations of redundancy and their acceptance of those redundancies as part of the reform process. Conclusion The Australian stevedoring industry is on the threshold of a new era when, for the first time, employers and employees will have the motivation and mutual confidence in their future prospects to strive to achieve world best practice standards in productivity, reliability and international competitiveness. The government has identified the reforms that must be addressed by the industry to reach this goal and has provided the necessary legal framework to facilitate their implementation. They have been accepted by Patrick's and P&O Ports, the major stevedoring companies. This legislation underpins the administrative arrangements necessary to actively encourage it the stevedoring industry to tackle the fundamental restructuring required to achieve the government's reform agenda. A strong foundation has been established on which to build a revitalised stevedoring sector. The measures being implemented today are vital in raising Australian living standards, creating more jobs, promoting a stronger export culture, reducing our foreign debt and expanding the opportunities for small business. They are measures which will allow considerable productivity improvement, ensure redundant employees receive the value of their full entitlements, involve no cost to our export and import industries and, subject to the passage of this legislation, will not impose any cost on taxpayers. I conclude with my opening words: we said we would fix the waterfront and we meant it. I commend this bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. STEVEDORING LEVY (IMPOSITION) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",13

7,Mr REITH,Unknown,"This bill outlines levy on the loading and unloading in Australia of containers and vehicles from ships. This bill operates in conjunction with the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998, the collection bill. In addition to making provision for the collection of the levy, the collection bill allows the minister to authorise payments in connection with restructuring or reform of the stevedoring industry. The purpose of the levy is to enable the Commonwealth to recover such expenditure. The bill imposes levies which are intended to recpver the cost of moneys expended by the Commonwealth. The amount of levy collected annually will depend on the rate of levy. The rates set in the legislation may be reduced by regulation. It is anticipated that between $20 million and $40 million would be collected annually. Over its life the legislation will be cost neutral. I refer members to the regulation impact statement, which is set out in the accompanying explanatory memorandum. The maximum rate of levy is as set but, as I indicated previous bill, a lower rate of levy will be prescribed by the regulations. I intend to set the actual rate at $6 per vehicle and $12 per container. As I have already said in the accompanying second reading speech, both the major stevedores have indicated that the levy at this rate can be absorbed into their existing structure of charges so that there is no overall increase in costs to shippers. I have also referred to the government's intention to conduct a review of the levy legislation and the rate of the levy within three years after its commencement. The levy mechanism is well understood in the stevedoring industry for raising funds for industry purposes with a statutory levy dating back to 1947. By contrast, the levy arrangements under the current bills are much simpler and are directed at supporting crucial restructuring of the stevedoring sector. That completes the package of measures presented today to the parliament by the government as part of its approach to reform of this vital industry. I commend this bill to the House as well. Leave granted for second reading' debate to continue forthwith.",17

12,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"These stevedoring bills have nothing whatsoever to do with waterfront reform. The actions of this government have nothing whatsoever to do with waterfront reform. The actions of this government are to target a particular union and seek to destroy the lawful rights of the workers to organise, the lawful rights of all Australians for the to be represented by people whom they choose, the lawful rights of Australians to work once they have made a choice as to how they should be represented. This is an unlawful act within the framework of the government's own legislation. Let me go through the government's own legislation in this regard. Reflect on this: these workers have been sacked, not made redundant under the normal provisions of redundancies. Redundancies occur when a worker is surplus to requirements. There are no workers here who are surplus to requirements. Their sacking has not been based on any information provided to them that they are surplus to requirements. They have been sacked in order to be replaced by another work force. It has nothing to do with competition on the waterfront. This government declared its attitude towards competition on the waterfront when it endorsed the actions of the Western Australian government in the port of Dampier. Just reflect on this: not many people in the eastern states understand the role and function of the port of Dampier. I, as a Western Australian, do. The port of Dampier is one of our great export ports, probably greater than most of the eastern states' capital city ports. So we are not here talking about a mere bagatelle as far as the Australian stevedoring industry is concerned. What this government has done is to endorse a monopoly-not competition. When P&O sought to be part of the arrangements at the port of Dampier, the Western Australian state government, with the complicity of this government, opposed it, and they awarded a monopoly to a man who is a substantial contributor to Liberal Party funds in Western Australia. We know the legislation is not about competition. The legislation is endorsing a process of unlawfully sacking Australian workers for one reason and one reason only, and that is that they happen to be members of a union. If the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) does not believe that, within the framework of his own Workplace Relations Act, his act is unlawful, let me quote from subdivision C of his act, 'Unlawful termination of employment by employer'. Subsection 170CK(2), states: ... an employer must not terminate an employee's employment for anyone or more of the following reasonsand it goes through the reasons. The second reason states: (b) trade union membership or participation in trade union activities outside working hours or, with the employer's consent, during working hours. You may not be sacked if your interest in life is going to be advanced by being a member of a trade union-not redundant workers but unionists sacked in order to destroy a union for the political benefit of the Liberal Party, not for productivity on the waterfront. Furthennore, there are more unlawful elements of this particular action. I cite the employer's duty in relation to the award under which those sacked workers are now employed. I go through the employer's duty to notify under the award. It states: Where an employer has made a definite decision to introduce major changes in production, program, organisation, structure or technology that are likely to have significant effects on employees, the employer shall notify the employees who may be affected by the proposed changes and the union or unions. The second part of it, defining that first clause, states: Significant effects include termination of employment. So they have breached the award. Because there are a very large number of members of our work force who work under awards, all Australians know that awards give them protection. The processes in those awards are the processes that guarantee their security. The government will seek a double dissolution later this year on unfair dismissal, but they will not seek to alter that particular proposition in their unfair dismissal laws. So, even if they were to succeed on that, this is an unlawful act within the framework of this industrial legislation, whatever government emerges--ours or yours. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said the other day in this parliament that he would support all actions which were lawful in regard to his exercises on the waterfront-yet another non-core promise, broken within one week of that promise being delivered. I will cite just one more example of the unlawful nature of this act. Subsection 170CL, 'Employer to notify CES of proposed terminations in certain cases', states: (1) This section applies if an employer decides to terminate the employment of 15 or more employees for reasons of an economic, technological, structural or similar nature, or for reasons including such reasons. (2) As soon as practicable after so deciding and before terminating an employee's employment because of the decision, the employer must give to the Commonwealth Employment Service a written notice of the intended terminations ... So the government have breached the act in relation to unfair dismissals, they have breached the act in relation to the requirement to notify the CBS of the fact there are 1,400 Australian workers who were in work but are no longer and they have breached the requirements of the award-the same award system which still protects very large numbers of Australians in the workplace. It does not matter whether or not you feel any particular sympathy for members of the Maritime Union-this government has worked very hard at demonising the reputation of those who work on our waterfront-but all Australians will feel sympathy this Easter for the 1,400 families who do not know what will happen to their breadwinner as a result of the actions which are undertaken here. But these 1,400 families, the rest of the Australian work force and the Australian p-ople know that, whatever difficulties Patrick's may have been experiencing when they went down the confrontational road, the workers always acted lawfully. In order to justify therefore a set of unlawful acts on the part of those employees, this government has entered into a conspiracy with them to seek a confrontational solution and has now entered into a conspiracy to attempt to establish an ex post facto justification for this particular unlawful act as far as Patrick's is concerned. These sackings have never been about waterfront reform; the activities of Patrick's have never been about waterfront reform. The management of Patrick's have displayed a mendaciousness; they have displayed a conspiratorial bent. They have not dealt honestly and straightforwardly with their work force, and they have been aided and abetted in that regard by this government for months and months now. . There is a funny little telltale paragraph in the second reading speech of the Stevedoring Levy (Imposition) Bill, and I would draw members' attention to it. The minister said: However, the new arrangements are considerably simplified and, unlike the 1977 arrangements, they will not apply to bulk cargo. The perfonnance of seaboard bulk cargo tenninals is generally accepted as already being internationally competitive. Why is that so and what is the significance of that? They are internationally competitive because a government that believed not in confrontation with the Australian people but in working with the Australian people put in place a process of waterfront reform. If you cast your minds back to the days before the previous Labor government took office you will recollect that the principal complaints of our exporters and our farmers were all directed towards the movement of bulk cargo across Australian ports, as well they might have been because the substantial proportion of Australian exports went in bulk. The substantial proportion of activity across the Australian waterfront involves the export of bulk cargo; in fact, it is something like 65 per cent of what passes across the Australian waterfront. What happened when we confronted this situation when we got into office? We had an overmanned waterfront-l0,000 stevedoresleft in place by the Fraser-Howard government of the late 1970s and early 1980s. We had a wretched practice as far as moyement of two-thirds of our exports was concerned. The Labor government put in place reforms and the number working on the waterfront came down from 10,000 to just over 3,000. These were redundancies, not sackings. Furthermore, they were voluntary redundancies. They were workers surplus to requirements. They were not a work force that needed to be replaced by others, having been sacked; they were genuinely redundant workers. In that process agreements were entered into between the parties on the waterfront, which have produced, by the minister's own admission, world's best practice outcomesall achieved through a process of negotiation. There is world's best practice on two-thirds of Australian exports. The previous government had then put in place a process, through enterprise bargaining, whereby efficiencies might be obtained. Recollect this too: there are other parties to agreements now and to arguments with the waterfront employees. They happen to include P&O and they happen to include Sealanes, and there would be others as well. As far as they are concerned they are working within the ambit of enterprise agreements and they are achieving the efficiencies. Already, P&O is up to 24 container movements an hour and rising. What was the government's target? It was 25. That was the target set by the government in relation to these arrangements. Are these being achieved by sacking workers merely because they happen to be members of a union? No, they are not. They are being achieved by a sensible enterprise negotiation, the first round of which produced a 40 per cent improvement in efficiencies across the board on the Australia waterfront and the second round of which was to produce even greater efficiencies in an environment in which there was no confrontation. But this is a government which relishes confrontation. This is a government which desires confrontation for various purposes. Firstly, they have a visceral hatred of organised labour. It is a centuries old hatred of ganised labour. In many ways, the debate that we are having here is a debate that has been around for a hundred years as far as Australian history is concerned. There has always been a complete unwillingness by our political opponents to accept the fact that if as an individual you approach an employer and expect to bargain on an equal basis you cannot. You cannot get a requirement that gives you a sense of confidence that you have an income that can support your family. There is no equality in the bargaining process between an employer and an employee. For the last century there has been a determination amongst ordinary Australians in this country that they should not be left like a shag on a rock when it comes to industrial negotiations. There has been a knowledge among them that, if they are left like a shag on a rock in those industrial negotiations, they will be massively disadvantaged. This government has gone too far in undermining the capacity of ordinary Australian workers to organise. But the interesting thing about thisÂ· is that, having gone too far with their industrial act and having threatened the sense of security that there is in the work force, they are now trying to take it a bridge further by coming in here today and endorsing an unlawful act under the framework of their own legislation-not our legislation, their legislation. Every Australian worker today now knows that when Howard and Reith went forth to the Australian people and said, 'You have a right to choose,' they did not tell the truth. They did not mean it. They were insincere when they said that. The product of that is that, no matter what you happen to think of members of the MUA and no matter how unlovely you happen to think members of the MUA are, every Australian worker now knows that every Australian worker can be arbitrarily deprived of their livelihood. In recent days we have had a mantram from our political opponents, which has gone like this: we have formed the greatest reforming government since World War II; we are the strongman of Asia. Talk about a small man's complex in relation to how you go out and or- preach your wares! I guess if you do not blow your own trumpet nobody else will blow it for you. We know this and the Australian people know this. The actions of this government have repeatedly undermined the confidence and sense of security of the ordinary Australian. They havecomatosed the Australian economy and sent us into a situation in which we confront a potential crisis in our economic relations with the region around us that will have an impact on our own economy-a potential crisis with growth rates way below what could have been achieved. That process of creating that sense of insecurity has caused Australians to pause for thought as to whether or not they will acquire houses; caused Australians to pause for thought on a range of activities; and caused Australians to no longer have confidence in their right and capacity to work and, therefore, caused them to not consume in a way that advances this economy and produces growth. They will today, from this particular act and from the actions of the government, have more cause to feel that insecurity. With growth rates half to two-thirds of what we had when the Labor Party Australian was in office and with a GST, the privatisation of Telstra and unlawful acts in the industrial relations system dumped on top of them, Australians will experience a comatosed economy for a great deal longer than might otherwise have been the case. We have put this legislation in its setting; let us get back to the main point of it. What we see here is a government energised to unfairness, a government energised to produce an outcome to deprive Australians of jobs. They get out there and organise this levy under government tutelage to get Australian workers off the waterfront, to get companies, or in partiCUlar Patrick's, which say they cannot operate at a profit, to assume a huge additional burden in order to pay for this levy to take workers off the waterfront and replace them by other workers-not to take workers off the waterfront and replace them by nobody because they are redundant to necessity but to take workers off the waterfront and replace them with other workers. That is a situation very different from that which applied under us. Compare and contrast this energised activity with the quiet sloping towards Jerusalem related to the fate of the people in the Cobar mines, at Woodlawn or in the meat works that have shut down in recent times as company law has been manipulated to deprive workers of their just claims on redundancies. Can we get an inch of movement out of the government on any of this? We cannoCget one inch of movement out of this government on any of this. We get from this government a set of promises: 'Well, maybe we'll come to think about it next year, next month'-sometime out there in the future. The government does not care about those workers. But get this government to viscerally get after those whom they truly hate in the Australian political system and the energy is unbelievable. The focus may be a bit of a problem but the energy is unbelievable. You saw that failed effort of theirs to sack people up in Cairns. That belled the cat. Then you saw the untruths told in this House by the government over the state of their knowledge of that absurd Keystone Kops Dubai effort. Then we have seen the total denial by this government of any involvement in any ticktacking in relation to unlawful acts and Patrick's--denial given the lie today. This has been a consistent pattern of conspiracy to do down ordinary Australians-a persistent pattern of misleading and duplicity by this government. This government now invites the parliament to put some sort of stamp on what they are doing with this particular act. Let me make another point about this. From time to time this government seeks to draw a comparison between the actions of the previous government in relation to airline pilots and what they are doing here on the waterfront. The waterside workers were not acting like the pilots in the airline dispute: they did not resign; they were willing to work. You have to comprehend this: no pilots were sacked during the airline dispute-none. Not a single pilot was sacked during the airline dispute. The pilots chose to desert their employer. They chose to walk out of the airlines and leave the airlines without a work. force as far as pilots were concerned. The airlines then proceeded from that point in time to recruit a new work force. There is a massive difference between that and the situation of the stevedores. None of the stevedores resigned. All of the stevedores were willing to work. All of the stevedores were willing to enter into enterprise negotiations with Patrick's to improve productivity on the waterfront. All of the stevedores were prepared to admit the need for further change on the waterfront. They have been prepared both to admit that and to arrive at agreements that achieve that for some considerable period of time-a situation totally different from the pilot situation. But that was to no avail because while the MUA was prepared to play by the rules the government was not. It was prepared to conspire with massive sackings which contravened the redundancy provisions of the act, as I have already pointed out. But what did the shadow opposition spokesperson of the day have to say about the pilots? While they are words that were completely inapplicable to the situation with pilots, they have s()me resonance today. Let me draw the attention of the House to Mr Reith, speaking on 29 August 1989: I have a pretty simple message for the Prime Minister: 'Listen, mate, this is your policy. You have revved up this dispute'. I can tell the Prime Minister that he will be wearing the consequences of the damage that the dispute will cause this country. It is no good for him to come in here with his Pontius Pilate attitude and say, 'I wipe my hands of the whole thing'. That will not wash. 1 can tell the Prime Minister that his claim that this is an example, a microcosm, of the Opposition's policy is nonsense and deserves to be exposed . . . The only thing 1 can say about that is that: if we were in government things would not be in the mess they are in today. He goes on to say elsewhere in his speech: The fact is that there will be no kudos, no political marks, for the Government from the way in which this dispute is going for the simple reason that the damage that will be caused to our economy will be so great that no-one will be thanking the Prime Minister for his personal intervention. He really is completely out of touch if he thinks that, at the end, people's gratitude for his personal intervention will somehow flow over into the ballot box at the next general election. That was the advice of the opposition spokesperson on industrial relations. Mr Crean-Who said that?",17
13,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Peter Reith. That was the advice of Peter Reith at the time to the then Australian government, a piece of advice completely inapplicable to the circumstances in which he found himself but absolutely applicable to the circumstances now in which this government finds itself. The result of this is going to be a sense of insecurity amongst Australian workers, a devastation of the family life of 1,400 Australian workers, a sense that is already out there in the community of disappointment with the Prime Minister and this government that it was unable to deliver to them the sense of security that they so craved, the sense of security that comes from a government that is out there barracking for your job, out there trying to do its level best to keep you in it and out there trying to achieve for our Australian people the sort of economic livelihood and opportunity to which we all aspire. This government thinks that it has been very clever in the way in which it has handled this, but the simple fact of the matter is that the Australian people will see through this for what it is worth-and the one outfit that is not going to benefit from this is Patrick's. Patrick's have had stumblebum tactics from the day this dispute broke out, from the day they would not sign up to their enterprise agreement and therefore put themselves in a situation where they were still in negotiation with their work force. It is the actions of Patrick's which have created the unlawfulness of this act. It is the actions of Patrick's which have created a situation in which the work force on the waterfront were in a position of legitimate industrial negotiation with them. It is the actions of Patrick's-with their mad desire, their absurd desire, to try to introduce into this particular dispute all sorts of novelties, shall we say, as far as the organisation of industrial relations in this country is concerned-which have produced what is, or was, regarded by all Australians as essentially un-Australian activities. The ordinary worker in Australia has choice, the ordinary worker in Australia values their freedom and the ordinary worker in Australia has an opportunity to collectively bargain and negotiate with their employer if they so choose. That has been a right that Australians have valued for the best part of this century. It is a right that they have sought and it is a right of which they have now been deprived. In the process of the deprivation of this right and of heaping calumny on the heads of the work force on the waterfront, we have had a government enmeshed and enmired in utter hypocrisy, a government that pursues a worker's right to organise, a government that pursues theÂ· alleged rorting by social security beneficiaries, a government that pursues a supporting parent who goes and takes work as a cleaner and fails to declare that income and a government that relishes rorts when it is into them itself. We have a government which talks about rorts on the waterfront and sits here and defends a set of mechanisms whereby a 44c expenditure on shares can be turned into a $56,000 outcome which supports 12 shares being acquired at virtually nothingabout a dollar a piece-and being translated into a $2 million shareholding, a set of taxation arrangements which when put in place allow that to transfer to family members and others at virtually no tax liability at all. Why does it do it? It is one of its own. That is the real sense of outrage. As far as this government is concerned, go and rort. That is the bellwether of this government's feeling on rorts. That is what this government believes about rorts in this country. Rorts it can take or leave, depending on who is responsible. Rorts are not a major problem, provided rorts are undertaken by your mates. But what you must not do, if you are an Australian, is to stand alongside a fellow Australian and jointly decide that you will bargain for your rights as a worker. That is what you must not do as far as this government is concerned; and, even though it conceals that sentiment in the act that it put forward, what it really thinks about its act entailed in this endorsement today of utterly unlawful activity. It ought to stand condemned by this parliament and it ought to stand condemned by the Australian people. Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) adjourned. NA",22

15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Indulgence granted.,23
16,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"Last night I announced my resignation from the Liberal Party to take up the position of federal parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Party of Australia. I will stand as a candidate for the Senate at the next election as the leader of the CDP's Senate team in Queensland. In the meantime, I will continue to provide a high standard of service to my constituents on the Gold CQast. This was not a sudden or rash decision, nor was it an easy decision. My wife Judy is in the gallery this morning with our children Tim, Sally and Lisa. At least, they were going to be in the gallery, but they are on the way. My speech notes say they are in the gallery, so we will have to assume that they are. We as a family thought long and hard about the opportunity which was presented to us. We believe that it is the right decision for a family. All of us here who are blessed with families do well to reflect on the fact that family is enduring. Long after we have left this volatile place and been forgotten we will still have our families, and in the end it only be our families who are with us. I have been given a wonderful opportunity to be involved in a party which stands unequivocally for the things I believe in and have consistently stood for in my eight years as member for MCPherson. Mr Fitzgibbon-Why leave?",23
17,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"There are many reasons for my decision to quit the Liberal Party. Thank you for the question. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to go into detail now, and I think that, in the light of events this morning, there are far more important things is for the House to do. Some of my colleagues have said my actions have hurt them in some way. To them. I say sorry. I am concerned about the future for my children in this country and, whilst there are reasons to be optimistic, there are nevertheless some dark clouds on the horizon. The Wik debate has shown the potential for our image as a tolerant and harmonious society to be shattered. As a nation of many cultures, we are a model for the world, but we should not be complacent about what has made us great. We have not got everything right but we have got most things right. In regard to our indigenous people, it is time for a new understanding. It is time for us to embrace each other and to move on. It took us more than 20 years to honour our Vietnam veterans because we were ashamed of them, and many of them have suffered incredibly as a result. We are even more ashamed of what we have done to our indigenous people, and yet they are today a source of strength and inspiration for us. The greatest challenge we face is the challenge to ensure that by 2001 Australia is a unified nation where black and white people are truly reconciled. Most Australians I think understand this need and support this. Finally, I am honoured to have as my running mate for the Senate in Queensland a fine Aboriginal Australian, Kerry Blackman. Kerry is from the Gurang Gurang people. He us as has been married for 20 years to a Torres Strait Islander. Kerry is a small businessman-in a physical sense he is a big small businessman-and we will be a great team, a blend of youth and experience. I should point will out, however, that the experience is my contribution. I thank the House. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TESTÂ· BAN TREATY BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Downer, and read first time. Second Reading",23
18,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Bill 1998 will give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and will provide a legislative basis for its national implementato tion. The CTBT bans all nuclear weapons test explosions and all nuclear explosions for time. It marks a watershed in international efforts to address the global threat the proliferation of nuclear weapons and also brings the nuclear arms race to a definitive end. The CTBT has attracted the signatures of 149 states. Thirteen states have so far ratified. Two nuclear weapon states-France and the United Kingdom-deposited their instruments of ratification this week in New York. I fissile signed the CTBT on behalf of Australia when it was opened for signature in New York 24 September 1996. Early ratification by Australia is critical. We are one of the states whose ratification is required in order for the treaty to enter into force. Australia is universally recognised player in the adoption of the CTBT and we can be justifiably proud of the part we played in achieving this outcome. We were instrumental in accelerating the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament. Following the failure to achieve final consensus in the Conference on Disarmament on a draft treaty text which was all but agreed, the government took the unprecedented and courageous step of submitting the treaty to the United Nations struction. General Assembly for adoption. The Australian sponsored resolution attracted the coitself sponsorship of 127 countries and was adopted by an overwhelming majority. This was a truly great achievement by the Australian government. On presenting this bill, I would like to remind the House of Australia's long standing and well-deserved reputation as a leading international player on arms control issues. a That reputation has been enhanced by this government's imaginative and successful efforts in taking the arms control agenda forward. This government's commitment to the cause of disarmament is evident in our substantial contribution to the international movement in favour of the total elimination of antipersonnellandmines as a weapon of war. In December 1997, Australia joined over 100 countries in signing the Ottawa treaty. The next step is get negotiations under way in the Conference on Disarmament as soon as possible as all a way of complementing the Ottawa treaty and tightening the clamps on the global posed by supply of landmines. On 3 February 1998, in my second address to the Conference on Disarmament since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs, I urged the Conference on Disarmament to begin immediate negotiations not only on a ban on landmines transfers but also on a convention to prohibit the production of material for explosive purposes. I have instructed that Australia be active in Geneva on and elsewhere in promoting this so-called 'cut-off treaty as a priority arms control 44 objective for 1998 and if necessary beyond. Just as the CTBT has brought an end to the qualitative further development of nuclear arsenals, so 'cut-off will cap the quantitative as a key expansion of those arsenals. In another area of the arms control agenda, I recently announced a new initiative to strengthen the biological weapons convention. The government's initiative is aimed at fasttracking the negotiations on a verification system for the biological weapons convention and highlights our serious commitment to preventing the spread of weapons of mass deBy signing the CTBT, Australia has aligned with the basic obligation not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. Part 2 of this bill makes it an offence to engage in activities prohibited under the treaty and provides appropriately severe penalties of up to life imprisonment for offences committed under clause 6 relating to the treaty prohibitions. The CTBT will establish an intrusive verification regime. The International Monitoring System, which is the principal arm of this regime, will be a worldwide network of over 300 monitoring stations and laboratories. Australia will host 21 monitoring stations and laboratories. Part 4 of the bill provides for the establishment and the operation of monitoring facilities on Australian territory, including authorisation to gain access to these facilities. Part 3 of the bill covers the arrangements which would apply should an on-site inspection be called on Australian territory. Part 5 of the bill provides for the establishment of a national authority to manage treaty implementation in Australia. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTATIONS) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",24
19,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill is designed to restore public confidence in country of origin labelling claims. Persistent public complaints that many labels are misleading or dishonest have given consumers good reason to be sceptical about origin labelling claims. At the same time, recent court decisions have created confusion about the meaning of such commonly used terms as 'Made in Australia' and 'product/produce of Australia'. As a result, the market value of Australian origin claims has been eroded to the point that producers and manufacturers are wary of making claims, and many consumers are losing confidence in labelling altogether. The fundamental problem is obvious. Consumers want simple, clear and credible labels, based on consistent and reliable standards. Unfortunately, the Trade Practices Act 1974 does not provide such standards, only a general prohibition against false or misleading representations. The result has been shifting legal interpretations and general uncertainty. This legislation will' address these problems and at last deliver clarity and confidence to labelling. The Trade Practices Act will be amended to establish, for the first time, a clear general test for country of origin labelling claims. This test will apply to all representations that goods are 'made in' a particular country. A separate, higher standardÂ·will be set for goods carrying the premium 'product/produce of' label. To qualify for the 'Made in Australia' label, a product will have to be substantially transformed in Australia and at least 50 per cent of the cost of producing or manufacturing the product must have occurred in Australia. The same test will, of course, apply to imported goods. These will be the minimum standards for goods to carry an unqualified claim of origin. The use of the substantial transformation test will align Australian law with international practice. Setting the threshold at 50 per cent will ensure that all goods labelled as 'Made in Australia' will have the majority of their costs incurred in Australia. Some people may argue for a higher threshold, but this would disadvantage many local industries always considered to be producing Australian products. These firms employ Australians and invest in Australia's future. Who would tell a person working at General Motors-Holden or Ford that the cars they are making are not Australian, just because some of their components are imported? Our trading partners do . not hesitate to recognise these products as Australian; nor should we. A 50 per cent threshold recognises the integration of Australia into the global economy, and the realities of modem manufacturing. The test compares favourably with the regimes applied by other developed nations such as Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Indeed, Canada uses the same combination of a substantial transformation test supported by a content or value-added test. The government recognises that consumers and producers also want to identify goods which are totally Australian or as near to it as possible. This legislation will restrict the application of 'product of/produce of' labels to goods in which all significant ingredients or components, and all or virtually all production processes, have occurred in the country of origin. Local citrus growers, pork producers and other primary producers will be able to proudly label their products as 'product/produce of Australia'. They will also know that products using a significant imported ingredient will not be entitled to the premium 'product of Australia' label. These statutory definitions underpinning the use of 'Made in Australia' and 'product/produce of Australia' claims are the core of the new policy framework for regulating country of origin labelling. However, these definitions alone will not always provide certainty or an outcome consistent with public expectations. In the past, efforts at reform have failed because the standards proposed have been rigid. An effective regulatory regime must be flexible as well as clear in its fundamental principles. Within the framework set by the legislation, the government has made provision for further regulation in specific sectors if this is required. This flexibility does not compromise the strength of the fundamental standards being set for 'made in' and 'product/produce of' claims. Further regulation will need to be consistent with the standards set by the Trade Practices Act. However, the framework will allow, where necessary, additional regulations to address circumstances in specific sectors. The food industry is an obvious case. Consumers often seek additional information on food products. The seasonal availability of ingredients, and the fact that some ingredients cannot be produced in Australia for climatic or other reasons, are distinctive characteristics of the industry. In light of these factors, the government has asked the Australian New Zealand Food Authority to consider the need for such regulation in the food industry. It is necessary to give the labelling regime the flexibility to address any irregularities which may arise. To protect the integrity of the regime, the government has developed mechanisms which will allow key aspects of the general tests to be amplified by regulation. The method for calculating production or manufacturing costs, and the processes which may be included in the definition of a substantial transformation, could be refined through these provisions. In some cases, regulation could be used to confirm that unrealistic costs cannot be used to inflate Australian content levels. As it is not intended that unsophisticated processes, such as the conversion of concentrate to fruit juice, should qualify as a substantial transformation, the bill will allow for such processes to be excluded from the definition of substantial transformation. Appropriate public consultations will be required before such action is taken. Past proposals often sought to limit the range of permissible origin claims. This bill welcomes innovative marketing and will encourage the positive promotion of Australian content. One of its first effects will be to reinvigorate the well known and respected 'Australian made' logo which has fallen into disuse because of legal uncertainties and confusion generally about 'Made in Australia' claims. This will deliver a real benefit to many Australian firms which, in the past, have relied on the logo to enhance their profile in the marketplace. The bill also includes provisions supporting new industry based logos, encouraging further innovation. The changes proposed by the government are significant and offer the only credible approach to a lasting solution of the issue. As an indication of its commitment, the government has decided to implement a major public education and awareness campaign, supported by funding of $1.2 million in 1998-99. The bill contains a number of miscellaneous amendments. Two of these amendments deliver major reforms promised in the government's New deal: fair deal package. One amendment will extend the ability of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take representative actions on behalf of small business. The second amendment will provide for the appointment of a full-time commissioner with a background in small business. Both amendments will enhance the capacity of the ACCC to assist small business. In conclusion, with this bill the government is proposing an effective labelling scheme-a scheme which will set a realistic threshold unqualified claims while supporting premium claims and industry specific marketing initiatives. Consumers will be able to buy Australian with confidence, knowing exactly what is meant by country of origin claims. Firms will be able to label with confidence, knowing exactly what tests they must satisfy to claim origin. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Tbeophanous) adjourned. NA (No.1) 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",25
20,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. he main purpose of this bill is to insert into the Excise Tariff Act 1921 Excise Tariff Proposals Nos 1 and 2 of 1998. As part of its aviation policy, the government reduced the rate of excise and customs duty on aviation gasoline-avgas-to $0.17403 per litre, with effect from 3 July 1997. On 31 January 1998 the legislation package implementing the fuel substitution reforms, which I will discuss in greater detail shortly, came into effect. Part of these reforms involved a complete restructure of item 11 of the schedule to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. As a result of that restructure, the duty rate for avgas was set at $0.18003 per litre. This rate did not reflect the government's 1997 decision in relation to avgas. The amendments made in this bill reduce the excise duty payable on avgas as from 3 July 1997 to $0.17403 per litre. On 31 January 1998 a package of nine acts implementing the government's budget decision to combat revenue loss through the minimisation of fUyl substitution practices for commenced. The prime object was to ensure that petroleum products dutiable at concessional rates of excise duty were not used as fuels in internal combustion engines. Fuel substitution usually avoids paying the correct excise. It also is a fraud on consumers and on the vast majority of those involved in the petroleum products distribution and retail system who follow the rules. Moreover, in many cases, use of petroleum products not designed for use in engines can greatly harm engine performance and expose consumers to great danger as the blends contained in these products may have a different flashpoint than the proper fuel. These acts were passed by the parliament in the 1997 spring sittings. The petroleum industry was consulted at all stages of policy development and implementation of this package. It was concerned the new structure may create mlsunderstandings as to how much excise was payable on some petroleum products intended for particular uses, particularly products used otherwise than as fuels. Accordingly, the technical amendments contained in this bill are designed to remove any such uncertainty. The amendments insert new subheadings of 'other' in all subitems of item 11, except subitem II(a) and II(d), to cover petroleum products used for purposes other than as fuel. These amendments do not widen the intended scope of the fuel substitution minimisation legislation. The other amendments in this bill are technical in nature only and are discussed in the bill's explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Tbeopbanous) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Truss, and read a first time. Second Reading",27
21,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The National Measurement Act 1960 provides the legislative basis for the Australian national measurement system. The objective of this act is to ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with measurements in other countries. The act was amended previously to provide for the introduction of certified measuring instruments used for regulatory purposes, such as police measurements of speed, and occupational health and safety measurements. At the same time provision was made for the use of certified reference materials to provide for improved chemical measurements in a wide range of applications in industry and government regulations such as police breath alcohol measurements and environmental monitoring. However, these previous amendments have been frustrated by a drafting error in the definition of a 'certifying body' which meant that certifying bodies for both certified measuring instruments and certified reference materials could be created under the National Measurement Regulations, but existing capable bodies could not be appointed. The purpose of the bill is to amend the National Measurement Act 1960 to correct this drafting error. and thereby allow the appointment of certifying bodies by the National Standards Commission both for the certification of certified measuring instruments and for the certification of certified reference materials. A second purpose of this bill is to remove the mandatory retirement age of 65 years for the executive director of the National Standards Commission in line with government policy. This will allow the commission greater flexibility in succession planning. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (TURNBACK OF CHEQUES) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",28
22,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (10.46 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The measures proposed by this bill will complement those proposed by the Payment Systems and Netting Bill 1998 to enhance the effectiveness of arrangements within Australia's payments system. Presently, cheques are cleared via a specialised paper clearing stream within that system. As part of those clearing arrangements, and in accordance with long standing practice, financial institutions collecting cheques deposited by their customers provisionally credit their customers' accounts with the amounts of the cheques deposited. The collecting institutions do not, however, .normally allow their customers to withdraw those deposited funds until they are confident that a cheque will not be dishonoured. Having regard to the revocable nature of cheques, andÂ· the uncertainty that could arise in the event of the insolvency of a participant in the payments system as to whether cheques drawn on the insolvent participant had been paid or dishonoured, it is not clear that other participants in the system would have a clear and unambiguous right to reverse the provisional credits they had made to their customers' accounts. If unsettled cheques could not be treated as dishonoured, and the provisional credits reversed, collecting institutions would be required to bear the loss so occasioned and would have to prove in the winding up of the insolvent participant the amount of that loss. In that event, collecting institutions would have to wait for the reconstruction of the affairs of the insolvent participant or for the payment of a dividend in its winding up. To enhance the integrity of Australia's payments system, the bill will make it clear that, in the event of the insolvency of a participant in that system, other participants will have a clear and unambiguous right to treat unsettled cheques as 'dishonoured'. This will allow them to reverse the provisional credits made to their customers' accounts and 'turnback' the cheques to their customers. As a consequence, their customers will be required to seek payment in lieu of the dishonoured cheques from the drawers of the cheques-that is, the persons who wrote the cheques. The drawers will, in turn, be required to prove in the winding-up of the insolvent institution for the monies they had deposited in that institution to meet their cheques. The enhanced stability of the payments system, and ultimately the entire financial system, that will result from the measures proposed by this bill, will be to the benefit of depositors at large. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Theophanous) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1998 First .Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",28
23,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (10.49 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Cheques have been a mainstay of the Australian payments system for generations. Notwithstanding the advent of newer payment instruments in the last 20 years, including credit cards, automatic teller machines, direct credit payments and EFTPOS, cheques continue to play an important role. Each day around three million cheques worth over $17 billion are written by individuals, businesses and governments in Australia. On average, each Australian will write 55 cheques per year. Extension of cheque issuing rights to building societies, credit unions and SSPs The bill will expand the range of institutions that can issue cheques in their own name. Credit unions and building societies will be able to issue cheques in their own name, or request their industry special services provider to p-ovide them with a cheque issuing facility. Building societies and credit unions are presently limited to the provision of agency cheques drawn on a bank or to issue 'payment orders', with the same rights and obligations under the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 as cheques. Repeal of Payment Orders In practice, payment orders have come to be regarded as second-class instruments. This bill proposes the abolition of payment orders and repeal of the provisions of the act that relate to them. Transitional provisions will preserve the operation of the act to payment orders issued at the time of commencement of the bill. Miscellaneous amendments The government also proposes a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act to overcome limitations experienced in the practical application of the act, and to allow financial institutions greater flexibility in their cheque operations. Conclusion As the final report of the financial system inquiry-the Wallis report-{)f March 1997 noted, cheque usage in Australia is high by international comparison. The government anticipates that the measures proposed by the bill, to extend to building societies, credit unions and their special services providers the . right to issue cheques in their own name,Â· will do much to: advance the principles of competitive neutrality supported by the Wallis report; enhance transparency in the payments system by making it clear to consumers which financial institution stands behind a cheque; and facilitate the provision of cheaper and more efficient financial services to consum- Ruddock, P.

24,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"by leave-I move government amendments Nos 1 and 2: (1) Schedule 1, item 3, page 7 (lines 1 to 3), omit the note, substitute: Note: Under section 242, the Minister may give the ACA directions in relation to the exercise of its powers under this Part. (2) Schedule 1, item 3, page 7 (lines 16 and 17), omit ""section 12 of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997"", substitute ""section 242"". The new remedial directions power which is to be inserted in the Telecommunications Act 1997 by the bill contains incorrect references to the minister's power to direct the Australian Communications Authority in section 12 of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997. The minister's power to give directions to the ACA in relation to the customer service guarantee is found in section 242 of the Telecommunications Act. The amendments make minor technical corrections to the bill to remove the incorrect references and replace them with references to the ministerial directions power in section 242 of the Telecommunications Act 1997.",31
25,Mr LEE,Unknown,"This will not be a long discussion, but I have a couple of issues I would like to raise with the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey). The minister, in those short remarks, mentioned the minister's power to direct. I do not know whether he is picking up similar comments from people involved in the Australian telecommunications industry as me, but there are a number of people who are concerned about the extent of competition in the industry today. Telstra has that monopoly inheritance. I am sure the minister has had one or two people from AAP Telecommunications, Optus and perhaps some of the independent service providers explain to him their concerns that Telstra has been using that monopoly inheritance to dominate the market and restrict competition. At the moment the country is relying on the ACCC to use the powers that the parliament gave it to ensure we have adequate competition. But I wonder whether the time is approaching when we might have a separation between, the minister who has responsibility for looking after the regulation of the industry and the minister who looks after the financial benefit that flows through to consolidated revenue from the dividends that are paid. You, as the finance minister, would expect to be the minister who would be the shareholders' representative until any sale was approved by parliament and completed. You can certainly imagine, Minister, that there are a number of people who believe there is a conflict of interest in Senator Alston being minister for communications allegedly responsible for regulating the industry and Senator Alston being the minister who represents the Commonwealth of Australia in certain decisions that might be made that could influence the value of the Commonwealth shareholding in Telstra. The minister might tell us whether he or the government has given any consideration to separating those responsibilities to make sure that fair decisions are being made about the decisions that do directly affect the level of competition in the Australian telecommunications market.,",31
26,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"Macarthur-Minister for Finance and Administration) (11.09 a.m.)The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) has 1'aised an issue of conflict-that is, the role that a shareholding minister in a government business enterprise might play to look after and be responsible for the operation of the business and the value of the shares held by the government on behalf of the taxpayers and how that contrasts and perhaps conflicts with a regulatory minister, frequently and almost invariably the portfolio minister, who has certain duties and obligations in respect of the regulatory regime and of course the customer service obligations. From a practical point of view, since the government made the decision that the minister for finance should be the joint shareholding minister of all government business enterprises a year or so ago, I have found my colleagues fairly accommodating, obliging and rational in the approach to discussions that take place. But I certainly have seen reference to the fact that there is an inherent conflict between both roles, and it may well be appropriate for the roles to be separated so that each minister, on behalf of their respective responsibilities, might make vigorous, appropriate and proper arguments from the perspective that they come from. If agreement cannot be reached, then of course there is always the opportunity for such matters to be brought back to cabinet. Those matters are the subject of some discussion at present between me and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston). We the certainly are aware of the debate. We recognise the amount of comment that there has been about this in recent times from various aspects of the industry and from various other commentators. I am confident that there will be an appropriate resolution of that matter. In relation to the way in which the former government operated in this particular area of government business enterprises, the honourable member for Dobell would be fully aware from his former ministerial responsibilities that the portfolio minister was the shareholding minister and the regulation minister. He or she wore all hats. There was no opportunity for the roles to be separated. Now there is clearly a shareholders' representative and a company's representative in terms of the value and assets of the company. As per the decision of this government, a minister has been added-the minister for finance. The member for Dobell now suggests that it should be taken a step further; although Labor certainly did not recognise it when they were in government. I accept that there are some arguments. I will continue to have that discussion with the relevant minister in respect of communications. I am confident that we will resolve that matter to rhe benefit of the industry and the community.",32
27,Mr FILING,Unknown,I wish to speak to the amendments moved in my name. I want to make the following comments.,33
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"No, you are out of order. Your amendments have not been moved. Resqme your seat.",33
29,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I expect these will be my last comments on these particular amendments. Whether the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) chooses to reply is up to him. Far be it from me to seek to argue in this House for his responsibilities and powers to be extended. There is always the chance that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is sitting back in his office watching this debate; but I think it is probably unlikely. I accept the minister's statement that, during the time. I had the honour to be the minister for communications, I was the shareholders' representative and the minister with portfolio responsibility for regulating the industry. The difference is that there was a more hands-on role in regulating the telecommunications industry in those days. The legislative regime then allowed for the minister to issue directions to Austel. Austel was a much more aggressive regulator. It had much stronger powers to act speedily than the ACCC seems to have today. The feedback I seem to be getting is that Telstra, the 600 pound gorilla, has become Telstra, the 600 tonne godzilla, in the way it is behaving in the telecommunications market. To date the ACCC has not been as aggressive as Austel was in making sure that the other players besides Telstra are getting a fair deal in the market. Minister, if you were successful in persuading the Prime Minister to give you the full and sole responsibility for the shareholder responsibilities, Senator Alston would then be freed up from having to worry about you and your responsibilities and looking after the taxpayers' financial interests. It would then perhaps let Senator Alston be an aggressive hands-on minister who pressures the ACCC, if they fail to make sure that we have the maximum amount of competition. At the end of the day, if we get our way and we get maximum competition in the telecommunications market, Y0U will get fewer dividends and a lower sale price. That has to flow. If we get more aggressive competition and lower prices, that has to affect the sale price and the dividends that Telstra receives, unless there is a massive expansion in the level of services. We would hope that, if there were an expansion in services, that would free up the ability of Telstra to cut prices even further, which again would affect you, the dividends you get and the sale price. We on this side would be interested to know whether the government will take that plunge and separate that responsibility between you and Senator Alston. Then we might see Senator Alston finally be brave enough to make some of those decisions or at least try to influence the ACCC to make sure that the ACCC does the job which the parliament expected it to do.",33
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Nehl)Before I call the next speaker, I would like to clarify what appeared to be a little confusion when I asked the member for Moore to resume his seat. The member for Moore indicated he was going to speak about his amendments. He cannot speak to his amendments until they are moved. He cannot move them until these amendments are dealt with.",33
31,Mr FILING,Unknown,"If I could just speak briefly obviously not on my amendments but on the government's amendments. Yesterday in the House I asked a question of the Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith), who represents the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), about Telstra's role in relation to Internet service and Internet access provision. One of the great problems, in my view, in our telecommunications system in relation to Internet service and access provision is that Telstra in essence, in the same business as the people to whom it supplies lines to conduct their own businesses. In my view, that is a gross conflict of interest. I think that should be abolished as a matter of grave urgency .. I have an my interest in the Internet service provision and access provision industry and have made inquiries over some time about the problems associated with access to lines. Generally speaking, Telstra appears to have done the right thing. It appears to have provided lines reasonably swiftly to lAPs and they, to my knowledge, have not made substantial complaints about Telstra's slowness. Nonetheless, the fact that Telstra is in business with big pond Internet access is in itself a conflict of interest because, in essence, Telstra is providing the very same service as its competitors but they cannot do their service without Telstra providing them with lines. In my view, not only is that a conflict of interest; it is anti-competitive and in fact flouts very seriously what the coalition government would consider to be its competition policy. The Internet will be one of the major growth industry areas in telecommunications service provision. It is my view that one of the most serious impediments it could have is having a conflict of interest or an anticompetitive influence like this. It behoves the minister to do something about this matter of urgency. I was interested to hear the minister representing the minister for communications say in response to my question yesterday about how long this particular monopoly would last that he did not know. I know the minister representing the minister for communications is one of the best informt'(d people in this parliament about thetelecommunications industry. With his having been the Telecommunications Ombuds.man in the past and his being an intelligent minister who performs well, it is surprising that he was not in a position to answer this question. , I suggest that the monopoly will continue. If that is the case and the sale of Telstra ahead on the basis that Telstra enjoys what is a very substantial monopolistic role in the is, provision of Internet access service to the Australian community, I think that is a matter of great shame to the coalition government. It should not proceed .unless those sorts of issues are overcome. I know the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), being an advocate for greater competition, would probably agree with me, but unfortunately he is responsible for the carriage of the bill for another minister, another department. I must point out that, as the shadow minister observed in his speech, this represents also a dividend for Telstra. Telstra's monopoly in this area is a considerable asset and naturally enough the government, in trying to realise the greatest possible return from the sale of its. asset, is unlikely to withdraw that monopoly. Therefore, the government has a conflict of interest. This is one of those classic cases where a government, in endeavouring as it says to introduce wider competition into a particular market, is in actual fact restricting competition through its very own administrative or legislative arrangements in relation to Telstra. So here we have a situation where a government, committed as it says to competition policy-I will talk very soon about another aspect of competition between digital and analog networks-is going to market Telstra to the community and elsewhere with a monopoly built in-a monopoly that, in my view, is a very serious impediment to the development of Internet services in this country and something that the government ought to remedy as soon as possible.",33
32,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"We are now seeing the start of the adjustments. We have now the start of what I expect will be literally hundreds of amendments to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 as the government starts to grapple and come to terms with what really is a total conflict of interest. It is selling a monopoly and trying to maximise its value at the same time as it is pretending the monopoly will do all things for all people. People in the bush who are concerned about goes their future services should be extremely concerned that the government has not moved further on these amendments today. The fact is the minister can no longer direct-a major change in government relinquishment of powers but for a price: to maximise the value-and we are now seeing some fancy footwork to try to pretend that that is not the case. This whole issue has come before us out of nowhere, without thought, without public debate and without government examination of the policy issues involved. The amendments the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) has moved are the first of many. The points raised by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) regarding the real aspects of competition, who judges whom and who is responsible are the tip of a very big iceberg. The comments made by the member for Moore (Mr Filing) in terms of competing interests within Telstra and its users is another huge iceberg. Today the convergence of technologiesand not simply physical technologies but software and educational technologies-is so profound that it will transform society as we know it over the next 30 or 40 years. In the middle of that will be Telstra and a government trying in the years ahead to come to terms with what it is doing right now: laying the framework that will have massive implications for decades to come. We inherited an organisation built up over almost a century by the Australian people, adapting and changing as it went, staying at pace with the world-and, in many cases, in front of the world because of our geographical problems. We are, in a moment, at the stroke of a pen, transforming it. The thought that that involves and the implications of that are so profound that to be dealing with it in this way is disgraceful. These amendments are simply a minuscule attempt to modify, but they also give the government some pretence that it actually understands the issues. Those Australians who have helped build Telstra-and that involves every Australianall own Telstra. Government assets vary in terms of access but, unlike other assets, we all use a telephone. The discussion by government members of the idea that there is somehow some competition about who sells the most and when has been a farcical one. I think the points being made in terms of Internet are simply a very small part of what the government is doing now with no public debate, with no understanding of either the technology or its implication. For the convergence of the technologies, the capacity to bundle and the implications for this whole issue one only has to look at the impact of Microsoft in the United States and at the current legal action between Microsoft and the American Justice Department and the implications for market power, market dominance and how that works. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have got to put him out of his misery. It goes to relevance. What the member is speaking about it totally irrelevant.",34
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I thank the member for North Sydney. Resume your seat. There is no point of order. The debate has been very wide ranging.,35
34,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"This is one of the up-and-coming young government members who fancies his knowledge of communications. He was put into a safe seat as a rising star. He is out there selling the airport fiasco, and I watched his speech with interest last night. This is about competition. It is about the fact that the American government cannot take on Microsoft; about the fact that Microsoft can do over the American government, given all the apparatus and all the experience they have. We have this bunch of incompetents opposite, who could not run a chook house, trying to tell us they know how to frame a monopoly in private ownership for decades to come, but the fact is they do not. (Time expired)",35
35,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"When this Telstra legislation goes through today, this day will be remembered as a day of infamy, shame and betrayal. Mr Fahey-These are technical amendments.",35
36,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"These amendments that are being proposed at the present time, as the minister at the table indicates, are technical amendments; nevertheless, they are designed to make some peripheral change to the detail, to the essence of this legislation. What I want to emphasise is that, as far as the legislation is concerned, they make no significant change. What I am particularly concerned about is the fact that there have been claims made by the government, in supporting and promoting this legislation, that in some way the interests of the national community would be best served by privatising Telstra! You will remember that it was estimated initially that the first third of Telstra would bring in about $8 billion; it is now estimated that the sale of the second two-thirds of Telstra will bring in $45 billion. If that initial estimate was correct, these proposed sales should bring in nothing more than $16 billion. So, of course, the government was seriously out in, its calculations. It is also seriously out in the claims that it is making that, as a result of these sales, the Australian people generally will be Mr Fahey--':"" Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have been most patient. These are technical amendments. There is a wrong numerical reference in the bill as it now stands. These amendments seek to change that numerical reference to a section of the Telecommunications Act. Whilst I am trying to be patient about the debate, I ask that you bring all members back to the question before the committee: that is, a very narrow question.",35
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the Minister for Finance and Administration. When I responded to the previous point of order by the member for North Sydney, I was referring to the debate on the bill itself and, of course, the reality is that is a debate on the amendments. Everybody speaking should restrict their remarks to the amendments-as I am sure the honourable member for Charlton will.",36
38,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"Mr Deputy Speaker, another ruling (jigreat wisdom from you. The point that I am emphasising is the fact that these amendments which are being proposed by the government make no significant - difference to the core of this legislation-the nature of the legislation, the purposes of the legislation and the impact that the legislation will have. It isÂ· perfectly in . order for me-as you have indicated, Mr Deputy Speaker-to proceed in that way. The claim has been made that the Australian people generally will benefit. I want to emphasise that, of 18 million Australians, less than two million Australians purchased part of that one-third sale of Telstra. So, while there may have been two million purchasing it, there are 16 million who lost out as a result of it. Those shares were made available to the initial purchasers at something between $1.95 and $2 each; at the end of last week, they were selling for $3.89-almost $4. The difference, of course, represents the real value which has been ripped off the Australian national community to the extent of something like $8,000 million. Where was that $8,000 million transferred from? The ownership of the Australian wage earnÂ«rs who did not have the funds to be able to take advantage of that sale. It has been transferred to those people who bought the first third of Telstra-including 30 per cent represented by foreign interests. I take no pleasure in referring to this, but exactly the same thing has happened every time privatisation has been undettaken. For example, in the case of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the shares sold for $2.30, yet at the end of last week shares in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories were selling for in excess of $l1-which means that the losses to the Australian public, in that particular case, were another $600 million. Mr Fahey-Who sold it?",36
39,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"The minister says, 'Who sold itT The implication, of this course, is that that sale was made by the previous government. Yes it was; I take no pride in that. The point that I am making is that it does not matter who the government is that sells off these public assets, they are always undersold and the people who benefit are those people who have the financial capacity to buy them-they are not the people that I represent in Charlton. (Time expired)",36
40,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"We were told last night that we will be here until after midnight, yet the government has still gagged this debate. I was prevented from speaking in the broad debate and I am now forced to speak in the debate on the amendment. In that context, let me read to you something from the explanatory memorandum, which will give some indication of the competence of those opposite: The amendments make a minor technical correction to the Bill to remove incorrect references to the Ministerial directions power in section 12 of the Australian Communications Authority Act 1997 and replace them with references to the Ministerial directions power in section 242 of the Telecommunications Act 1997. They could not even get the act right. They could not run a chook house. This bill was cobbled together in haste and shows absolute and total incompetence. They are trying to tell the public at large that they know what they are doing and that they can actually manage the shift of a monopoly to private ownership and to one-third foreign ownership-35 per cent foreign ownership of a total value of $60 billion, which will all be foreign debt. Make no mistake about that. Let me explain that. Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Newcastle is clearly digressing from the debate at hand, which is about technical amendments and the fact that we are substituting one name of an act for another. In this case he is talking about the foreign ownership levels. I ask you to bring him back to the topic at hand, which is the amendments proposed by the minister.",36
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Whilst the honourable member for Newcastle is aware that the debate is broad ranging, I do have some feeling for what the honourable member for North Sydney said. We should really contain our remarks to the bill before the House at the moment.",37
42,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I accept that and I understand your point. My point is that we are making corrections in reference to an act. The government are so incompetent that in the legislation they are referring to the wrong acts. In saying that I am trying to suggest that they may also be referring to wrong things elsewhere in the legislation. I think that would actually be in order. I thought the member for North Sydney would make the point about the foreign debt .and I wanted to make sure I explained what I meant. The fact is that nowadays foreign owners do not buy things in cash, they lend their money to their subsidiary in Australia. Mr Fahey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question before the House is about the change of two numbers in a section. It is a technical discrepancy which is being amended. There is no capacity to speak about other than the question before the House and I would ask you to draw the member back to the narrowness of the question before the House.  point of order: the amendments are about ministerial discretion. I would have thought that, far from being narrow, it was quite wide. These amendments, far from being of a minor technical nature, are a pretty major changegetting the wrong act.",37
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Newcastle has the floor and I would ask him in the very short time he has to contain his remarks to the amendments.,37
44,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I certainly will. They are about two things: they are about the wrong act and they are about ministerial discretion, which is about what the government does. In other words, I am trying to canvass here what the government understands itself to be doing in the first placeand it has got thatcwrong because it has got the wrong act-and, secondly, how it sees its role in terms of the minister's capacity and understanding of the issues involved. I am talking to a prospective minister opposite, the member for North Sydney, who is such an expert on communications. I am pointing out to him that when the ministers talk about foreign debt and foreign ownership they are misleading the Australian people because they are one and the same thing. The foreign ownership in Telstra will be foreign debt. It will be let to an Australian subsidiary, it will be a debt against the country forever and a day, and it will pay dividends offshore ,which will pay the interest on the loans. (Time expired) Motion (by Mr Fahey) agreed to: That the question be now put. Amendments agreed to .",37
45,Mr FILING,Unknown,"I move amendments Nos 1 to 4: (1) Schedule 1, page 7, after item 3 (after line 22) insert: 3A Section 360 Repeal the section. (2) Schedule 1, page 7, after item 3 (after line 22), insert: 3B Section 361 Repeal the section. (3) Schedule 1, page 7, after item 3(after line 22), insert: 3C Section 362 Repeal the section. (4) Schedule 1, page 7, after item 3 (after line 22), insert: 3D Section 363 Repeal the section. The purpose of these amendments is to repeal the provisions in the Telecommunications Act which force the closure of the analog mobile network. In 1992 the then minister for communications, former Senator Bob Collins, entered into a contract with Vodafone which has the following provisions. The first is that the analog network be closed down on 31 December 1999, and this appears in clauses 3.3 to 3.7 of the contract. The second is that the minister may make variations to the law for the purposes of protecting or promoting the interests of consumers of telecommunications services, in clause 3.2(c), or for the purposes of providing emergency services, in clause 3.2(e). On 4 May 1993 that contract was tabled in both houses as a disallowable interest. No-one moved that it be disallowed so it was, in effect, ratified by unanimous consent at the expiration of 15 sitting days. Senator Richard Alston was the shadow minister for communications at the time. He spoke 728 times in 1993. Mr Lee-How many'!",38
46,Mr FILING,Unknown,"It was 728 times and, as far as I can see, he did not once mention analog mobile phones in any of the 728 times he spoke. On the day the contract was tabled, he asked a question about the expense claims of one of Paul Keating's former staffers. So the contribution to the debate of this shadow minister for communications on the day the mobile analog network was being put on the chopping block was to ask about the expense claims of one of the former staffers of Paul Keating. It is therefore misleading of Senator Alston to say that this is all Labor's fault. I am being fair-minded here. He had an opportunity to prevent the Labor government entering into that contract and did not take it, but that is water under the bridge. In 1993 everyone thought that digital was a great idea. In 1998 the shortcomings of digital are plain for all to see. The government has failed to take the only course that would solve this problem, and that is to repeal sections 360 to 363 of the Telecommunications Act and sit down with Vodafone to negotiate an end to the no-analog clause of the contract. The government's failure to do this is nothing short of irresponsible. The longer it is left the more expensive it will be because Vodafone is building more and more network all the time. Mr Hockey-Hear, hear!",38
47,Mr FILING,Unknown,"They are in your electorate, obviously. On 11 March the coalition took office. It should have acted promptly to bring Vodafone's contract to an end because by then anyone who knew anything about telecommunications knew that the digital systems coverage was hopelessly inferior to that of the analog system. On 1 July the Telecommunications Act 1997 became law. Sections 360 to 363 were essentially the same as clause 3.6 of the Vodafone contract. If these sections are repealed it will permit Telstra to continue operating the AMPS network as long as it wishes. It will also permit others, including Vodafone, local shire councils and entrepreneurs, to est!lblish analog base stations. There is great interest in doing this, Mr Deputy Speaker Dondas. You would know that, coming from the Northern Territory. It will permit Telstra to continue operating the AMPS as long as it wishes. For example, the Carrathool Shire Council wants to establish an analog base station to cover the town of Hillston and surrounding area, including 100 kilometres of the Kidman Way, the new road that will cut 200 kilometres off the Melbourne to Darwin road distance. An Australian company in Perth makes analog base stations and at present cannot sell its product in Australia because of sections 360 to 363. Repealing these sections will generate an opportunity in high tech manufacturing right here in Australia; all digital base stations to this day are imported. As I mentioned earlier in my previous contribution, it is a philosophical tenet of the coalition government to support greater competition. But here we have a telecommunications act which is anti-competitive in nature in the marketplace. We are demanding that the analog mobile phone network is allowed to continue in competition with the digital service so that people have the fullest possible choice and can make that choice as consumers to get the best possible service no matter where they live-whether they are in the middle of Sydney as is the member for North Sydney, in regional Australia as in your case, Mr Deputy Speaker, or in the electorates of those other members who represent regional areas of Australia that are so badly affected by the poor quality digital service.",38
48,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown,"If anyone wanted a good example of the situation in which an Independent can move an amendment and have absolutely no responsibility for the outcome of that amendmentMr Allan Morris- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member is casting reflections on the motivations of the mover and the forms of the House. I would have thought that you should keep him in line. He is suggesting that a member cannot move amendments.",39
49,Mr FILING,Unknown,"--On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I ask you to ask the member to withdraw that reflection on the reasons for me moving these amendments.",39
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for North Sydney should be aware that any member of this parliament has the right to be able to move amendments to legislation.,39
51,Mr HOCKEY,Unknown,"I was not disputing that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was saying that if ever there needed to be a good example of Independents-generally, not specifically-moving amendments and having absolutely no sense of responsibility about the outcome and the impact of those - amendments then here it is. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) is moving spurious amendments which seek to undermine the contractual arrangement made between the then Labor government-I note that the former minister for communications is here in the chamber-and Optus and Vodafone that by 1 January 2000 AMPS would be phased out immediately. It was a drop-dead date. It was not a phase out; it was a drop-dead date. It was a deal between the ALP federal government and Optus, Vodafone and Telstra. I can only suggest that the major beneficiary of this spurious attempt to try to extend the life of AMPS is Telstra. Why? Telstra absolutely dominate the AMPS market. Through this amendment the member for Moore is reducing competition and giving Telstra the greatest leg-up that they have had in years. He is trying to preserve the Cobb and Co. infrastructure provided by the Labor Party in 1992. It is a Cobb and Co. infrastructure because AMPS will be outdated by CDMA and by D-AMPS. The relocation of the spectrum out of analog is going to be used for new and better technology. In deference to the terrific work of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in relation to this matter, on 5 February the minister announced that he would try to do everything he could within the contractual constraints provided by the Labor Party to try to preserve mobile phone communications for people who currently have AMPS and do not have digital technology. Of course, that includes an urgent review by the Australian Communications Authority, and a number of other measures that ensure that, at the end of the day, people in rural Australia who have analog and do not have digital are not left, on the drop-dead date of 1 January 2000, without mobile phone technology in their area. I wonder what the motivation is for this. Perhaps the member for Moore could answer this at another time, because he is pushing the federal government, the Commonwealth, into a protracted legal case between the Commonwealth and Vodafone because of the original pledge of the Australian Labor Party in 1992. Vodafone deliberately have not got into analog technology because of that drop-dead date. This amendment will have the single most significant impact on the value of Optus and Vodafone and it will be the greatest impediment to competition in mobile phone technology rather than our trying to create a competitive environment and ensure that people in rural Australia are getting the very best technology-the latest technology and complete technology-that delivers mobile phone access right across the nation. (Time expired)  have heard a very interesting contribution from the member for Moore (Mr Filing) highlighting a problem in the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998. One of the things that I would say about these .amendments is that they really highlight some of the dangers that are presented in privatising Telstra. But isn't the issue the has not been rolled out throughout Australia? I remember contributions by the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is vocal on most things, if not all, saying how much he regretted the fact that in parts of his electorate was no mobile service at all. What the coalition says basically is, 'Look, don't worry, there is a marketplace. All these problems will get sorted out in the marketplace and you will see this miraculous roll-out of technology to give people in rural and regional Australia mobile access.' We, from a Labor Party perspective, say that sometimes the marketplace does not sort these things out; sometimes the shareholders do not actually take decisions in the national interest; and there is a legitimate role for government to ensure that no Australian is particularly . disadvantaged. The roll-out of mobile technology and the uptake by Australians has been absolutely phenomenal and we ought to talk about mums and dads missing out but, putting that aside, smal1 business and farmers in rural and regional Australia are the ones who so grievously suffer by a paucity of service. I believe that the commitment to make it exclusively GSM was a bipartisan issue. I think that is what the honourable member for Moore points out when he says that the shadow minister, Professor Ergas-I am sorry, the shadow minister, Senator Alston!-spoke more than 700 times that particular year and never once mentioned this particular issue. I regret that some of the means of redress have been removed. Indeed, the so-called technical minor amendments dealing with ministerial discretion have actually been removed from this legislation rather than providing rural and regional Australia with extra opportunities to ensure, through the parliament and through the executive government, that their needs are met. So, whilst I do not support the amendments moved by the honourable member for Moore, I think it is entirely appropriate that members on the opposition side should be allowed to move amendments. Even if these amendments do not get up, I believe he is legitimately highlighting a problem for rural and regional Australia that has been picked up in the fact that digital earlier, wider debate.",39
52,Mr ANDREN,Unknown,"I think the House recognises that they made a dreadful mistake back in 1992 when this deal was signed with Vodafone. The Telstra there (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill removes the jurisdiction of the minister in relation to Telstra. It says that it would be inappropriate to retain such a power in a situation where the Commonwealth no longer holds a majority equity interest in Telstra. That goes right to the heart of this particular set of amendments, which I support strongly, because-despite what the member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey) says-these amendments are very relevant to this particular debate and this bill in fact. The relevance is clearly established in the preamble to the bill, which sets out the policy objectives and reaffirms the parliament's commitment to the comprehensive community and regulatory safeguards recently enacted in the 1997 telecommunications legislation. There must be a regulatory framework on mobiles and it should not include the abolition of the analog mobile coverage. I was accused the other night of not showing any interest in this until recent days, and the member for North Sydney graciously admitted that I had had a long interest in this and had spoken strongly during the telecommunications debate on this very analog issue. It is promised that a meaningful analog system will be maintained. That is absolutely absurd in relation to a seat like Cal are because Calare would be regarded as having an adequate digital service, according to the definitions, and in fact it does not. I get a kilometre out of Orange and the service is absolutely appalling and yet the analog system works very well. As I said in the debate last week on this particular issue, it is a service-a communications tool--of absolute necessity and it is not Cobb and Co. technology. As the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) pointed out in his contribution, the CDMA technology available from the US now is world's best and would mesh with the existing analog system to provide an Australia-wide coverage that would be far superior to anything yet tested and on offer. Vodafone tell me that they are relying on satellite technology to cover all of Australia. They are not going to roll out digital across the length and breadth of inland New South Wales and further afield; they are relying on the satellite service. At $4,000 a handset and $4 a minute, just who will be able to access this technology? We have something in place now that does the job. The Communications Authority fact sheet tells us that they will examine each regional area which currently receives an analog service to determine whether the phase-out of the analog service would leave that area without alternative mobile coverage. Calare is one seat that would not fit under that category. It will not keep analog in an area like that. In fact, residents of areas determined by the government to retain access to the analog mobile network should be aware that analog handsets will not work outside these areas. This is a deliberate plan to cripple AMPS; it is not a plan to restore and retain services of any use in regional Australia. And Vodafone has given the game away by admitting to me that it is relying on satellite. It is not about roll out digital beyond the major lucrative markets, the regional markets and along the highways; and even there it does not work. Like television and broadcast, telephony provision is a privilege. Two wrongs, the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and Telstra, do not make a right. All this debate has centred around who did things first. Well, we have made mistakes. We should sit down, as the member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, renegotiate this whole analog question and, if these sections are repealed, Rylstone Kandos, which has no mobile, would be able to enter the market as an individual provider. That is real opening up of the market, using technology that Australian Defence Industries, which we are also about to flog off, makes and sells offshore but cannot sell locally. We could do it ourselves. The shire councils struggling for funds could have a revenue source if they were able to put up this technology. It is the best technology, it must remain, and this is one means of highlighting that and hopefully getting some sense in this whole debate.",40
53,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"I intend to exercise my new-found rights to speak in here on behalf of the Christian Democratic Party. We have not had a chance to have a party meeting so far this morning, but I have actually had the opportunity to listen objectively to a debate in this place in a way that I have not been able to do in a long time. Having done so-and the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Ms Worth), who are at the table, are looking down and frowning-I must sayÂ· that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) made an excellent contribution and the member for Moore (Mr Filing) made an excellent contribution. Frankly, I was persuaded. I think the member for Moore is right on this particular issue. I think he is right because he is speaking out on behalf of rural and regional Australians, and the Gold Coast, and I am corning to that. I am not a particularly high-tech person. I am learning to use my computer. But, since we got digital phones on the Gold Coast-and to we have got the biggest per capita use of mobile phones on the Gold Coast of anywhere in the world-most of them do not work. I can only assume there is something very wrong with the existing system. Mr Robert Brown-The phones, or the people who use them?",41
54,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"The phones do not work. We could talk about a lot of other areas that are similar. We have got all this satellite TV and cable TV coming, but some of my constituents cannot even get free to air TV. Despite the fact that I have been raising that with the government for eight years now, we still have parts of the Gold Coast-this is not Parkes or somewhere out westMr Andren-Bathurst-Orange.",42
55,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"Or Bathurst or Orange. This is the Gold Coast, this is 100 kilometres from Brisbane, and we cannot get free to air TV in some parts of the Gold Coast. I think the message we have heard and the amendments moved by the member for Moore simply make sense. To me, sitting here, they make sense. I ask mys.elf why the government is doing this, and I think I heard the member for Calare saying that it is something that was done in the past and it is all too hard now to do something about it, so we end up with something that is far from satisfactory.",42
56,Mr FILING,Unknown,It is inferior.,42
57,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"As both the member for Moore and the member for Cal are have said, it is actually inferior. Why the government would be supporting something that is inferior is quite beyond me to understand. The other thing I should say is that I am absolutely in favour of competition. I do not share the views of the member for Chifley  almost invariably make better decisions than governments and bureaucrats do, but I understand that markets have to be tempered with some government direction and involvement on occasions. But it seems to me that this is an anti-competitive measure, and that is a very good reason for me to be supporting the amendments by the member for Moore and also supporting strongly what I think were really sensible remarks by the member for Calare.",42
58,Mr LEE,Unknown,"On behalf of the opposition, I would like to outline our position on the amendments moved by the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and argued very eloquently by the member for Chifley  Andren), the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and the member for Moore. It might be helpful if we all take ourselves back to 1992, when this decision was made. It was a decision made by the then Minister for Communications and Transport, Bob Collins, and it was on the advice of Austel after Austel had conducted an inquiry into what is a very complicated issue. The Austel report in 1992 made the very obvious point that we could not just rely on the existing analog mobile telephone system because Telstra owned the whole spectrum and ran the entire mobile network and that one of the advantages in moving towards digital was that you had new - spectrum you could sell off to a number of new entrants and that was the way we got competition in mobile telephony: by having Optus, Vodafone and Telstra able to have their own spectrum and able to compete with each other on mobile telephone rates. The result of that has been big reductions in the cost of mobile handsets and some reductions in the price of mobile calls, and that has benefited consumers. We are also told, and it is accurate, that there would be encryption and therefore greater privacy for telephone calls if we moved to digital. Another thing we were told is that we would get clearer calls. I think that was the one claim that was made way back in 1992 that has not been fulfilled by the technology. I am sure that the people in the gallery and in the parliament here this morning would know that it is often very difficult to get clear signals with the digital system. There are large parts of rural and regional Australia where you cannot get any signal at all and the member for Calare has highlighted some of those today. One of the concerns that we in the opposition have about the member for' Moore's attempt to put a lance through the boil of this debate is that his amendment might have the parliament exposing the public, through the government, to a very large compensation bill. The opposition would want to have a great deal more confidence about what the consequences would be before we would be prepared to support the member for Moore's amendment. The point I would make to the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey), who is at the table, is that no doubt there is a problem out there that needs to be addressed. That is why members are raising this issue in the parliament every day. My colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has, I know, spoken about this within the Labor Party, based on his concerns about what is going to happen when AMPS shuts down. Some of us have to remember that, if this current problem is the result of an agreement between the federal government, Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, then surely another agreement between the federal government, Telstra, Optus and Vodafone can undo any financial exposure. I would have thought that it is open to the government to say to Frank Blount, Mr Anderson and the boss of Vodafone that we need this issue resolved. Telstra can enter into some commercial negotiations with Optus and Vodafone about what payment it might make to them to persuade them to allow the analog system to continue. There is a possible solution out there if we can try to think creatively and do it in a way that does not expose the taxpayer to large sums of money. I would like to ask the Minister for Finance and Administration a question; he might take it on notice if he cannot answer it today: if of the analog system is shut down can we be assured that the current GSM digital system is able to cope with all of the customers? I have heard some speculation that, if all of the analog customers move to digital, the system would be swamped in some parts of the country. If the minister is not able to answer that on the spot today, I would be more than happy if he could agree to provide me with an answer in writing. The parliament, in debating this issue, should have some reassurance that, if we are not going to accept the member for Moore's amendment, the digital system will be able to cope with the massive needs that will be placed on it in the year 2000, especially in places like Sydney. With the Olympics, international visitors with digital phones will expect them to work in this country.",42
59,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I have noted the amendments moved in respect of sections 360 and 363 by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). These amendments amount to a change to what has been entered into by way of a legally binding contract by the former government, particularly with Vodafone. Such a proposal is totally unworkable. It exposes the taxpayers of Australia not only to massive compensation but to ridicule. I just wonder about the simplistic approach-the populist approachtaken by Independents to any debate. They come into this House and put up a proposal that alters legally binding contractual obligations. It gives a clear message to any investor in this country: do so at your peril. I spent some time this morning with an investor from the electorate of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Andren). I have ,known the company for some years and have had dialogue with them over many years. The thought occurred to me that if that company, which has put a massive amount of money into the electorate of Cal are, is going to be told by this parliament that the parliament may reverse its decisions on contractual obligations at the whim of a populist Independent, that company and no-one else onshore or offshore will ever again put an investment into this country. Mr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, on a point all of order: I accept that the member for Calare has some modesty about that. That was a very nasty inference which I personally found offensive as a parliamentarian-reflecting on the motives of a person in this House. The minister should withdraw and apologise.",43
60,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no apology.,43
61,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"Firstly, I am making the point that when there is a decision by government that decision should have certainty. When legally binding contracts that flow from such a decision are entered into, they cannot be overturned in a way which this amendment proposes to do. The second point I want to make-and it was made very properly by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hockey)-is that when it comes to technology and regional Australia, surely those who represent regional Australia would want the best technology. To suggest that we extend on analog in respect of mobile phones well into the next century condemns rural and regional Australia to second-rate technoiogy. The third point is that it is simply not practical to suggest that there is a capacity to extend on at this point when we are well dQwn the track in the changeover to digital. As I have indicated, Vodafone in particular, under the arrangements and contracts that were entered into, have simply embarked upon that technology and they would simply be taken out of business if there is an extension there. I reaffirm the point made by the honourable member for North Sydney that nothing is more supportive of Telstra's monopoly than these proposed amendments. Telstra have the monopoly in analog. The new carriers have moved into digital. The monopoly would be extended. It seems to me that every argument I have heard from the opposition and from those who oppose this bill on the crossbenches is about trying to ensure that the competition against Telstra is opened up. The regulations required that to happen as at 1 July last year. As each year and each month goes by, that will happen. Let me give a quick run down of what the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) said by way of a press release on 5 April on the solution to the problem: Yes, government acknowledges that there are blank spots when it comes to mobile telephony in rural and regional Australia. That is being addressed, but is it being addressed quickly enough? That remains to be seen; nevertheless, the government is conscious of the need to ensure that the service is across Australia and that that service continues after the required phasing in of digital occurs as at 1 January 2000. The package released by my colleague in another place indicated that all areas of regional Australia which currently receive mobile phone coverage will continue to enjoy reasonably equivalent coverage after the year 2000. As for the elements of the package, the ACA will conduct an urgent review of the current regional AMPS service. That will be completed by 30 June 1998. (Time expired)",43
62,Mr FILING,Unknown,"I will answer a couple of points that the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) has raised. The first relates to his comments about the actual technology. The argument that the technology is better, as my understanding is, in latter times has never been raised; it has always been the subject of the contract. Let me give you an example from an interview with one of the government's own experts from the ACA, the head of ACA's analog closure education program, Mr Warren Duncan. The interviewer on 3AW put to Mr Duncan that a knowledgeable caller had suggested that digital coverage would never cover the whole of Australia, that it was impossible. This is Mr Duncan's answer-the answer\of the government's own expert: That could very well be the case, but the difference really is that . . . it's because of the nature of the technology ... Analog can stretch out over quite considerable distances whereas, dependent upon where the base station is, digital may not cover the same extent . . . Those words on the service, on the technology, are from the mouth of one of the government's own experts. Here he is, damning the digital coverage when asked the question, 'Can it provide the same sort of coverage that analog could?' It was once said of the Bourbon dynasty: they learnt nothing but remembered everything. I must say that one of the great criticisms of the community about government in modem Australia is that, whenever a mistake is made by government, it either tries to cover it up or compounds the mistake by pretending that it was not a mistake in the first place. That seems to be the situation here. We have had the argument from the Minister for Finance and Administration that somehow the people who are supporting analog' phone networks are neo-Luddites, somehow wedded to sort of steam engine technology. Yet, at the cutting edge of the world's marketplace in mobile phone services in the United States, the analog network is doing very well, thank you very much. In fact, the analog network in the United States is highly competitive, cheap, and provides an excellent service. Because the United States is not as hidebound as we are to sort of leap into the first new technology that appears on the block, it actually has better digital technology that we do. The United States has the situation where its digital technology and its analog technology can go hand in hand. So you can get a phone that will roam in both types of technology-but you cannot do that here in Australia. The minister-the same minister who, in the year that analog technology was mooted for destruction, spoke 728 times, never once mentioning the analog network-was trying to pretend on a radio program that,there was, in fact, a similar sort of technology available in Australia. That is absolute rot, and he should have known that. There is another aspect to this, and that is the question of safety. Regional Australia obviously experiences considerable problems with bushfires and disasters, and all those sorts of emergencies that occur from time to time, where, because of the geography, the distances, the isolation, telephone technology is absolutely critical to personal safety. We have a situation where this government concedes that, in the event of bushfires in remote areas, you would be better off carrying two telephones, a digital and an analog, because the analog would probably give you a better chance, in an area where there is poor coverage with the digital network, of being able to communicate to ensure your own personal safety. I have had personal experience of this with fishermen in my electorate. They were persuaded by Telstra's telemarketers to buy digital; they said, 'We suggest you go for digital technology. It is exactly the same as the analog technology you've already got.' Those fishermen bought it, they paid thousands of dollars; they got out to sea and they found it did not work. Mr Deputy Speaker Dondas, you would know from your own territory that the tyranny of distance and service delivery would make the destruction of the analog network in these circumstances an absolute aberration-in fact, a neglect of duty on the part of this government to provide the best possible service availability to all citizens, no matter where they live. We live in one of the world's most remote continents, and we have the problem of distance and sparseness of population. I would have thought a government would be committed to what are called its community service obligations, its universal service obligations-those things that are quietly being smothered to death by the government as it sells off the rest of Telstra. Those community and universal service obligations include the right to access the best technology available to all Australians. That does not mean that having a fetish for one particular type of technology should deprive some Australians of their right to access that technology. (Time expired)",44
63,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"I can understand that the member for Cal are (Mr Andren) may be well motivated by his desire to see that a technology exists in all parts of his electorate. But I think you have to take a broader vision of what has to happen for the future of telecommunications in Australia. We have had a history of various forms of phone technology, from the old wind-up phone, to the dial phone, to the latest handsets that can hold calls and do all sorts of things. In parallel with that, we now have digital, which is about the third technology that we have adopted with regard to mobile phones. But I think the member for Calare is not recognising that one of the things allowing mobile phones to be competitive and forcing the cost of calls down is the fact that there is competition. What he is suggesting flies in the face of the medium-term and long-term needs of Australia. We are now moving in television technology from analog to digital.",45
64,Mr FILING,Unknown,You've just given that away in a bargain basement sale.,45
65,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"That is rubbish and you know it is rubbish. Whether you like the way it has been done or not, we are introducing into Australia the latest technology in television transmission. I would have thought the member for Calare, given his background, would have been one of the first to embrace this and would want to see that implemented in Australia.",46
66,Mr FILING,Unknown,It will cost a fortune.,46
67,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"Indeed, it will cost a fortune. It will cost about $900 million to introduce, but it will give Australia the best television technology in the world. We will be the only country that has high definition television mandated. Let me draw the analogy. We know that, with the compression of the signal and the use of the digital spectrum, we can achieve a lot more such as enhancement and forms of multi-channelling; all sorts of things will be available under that system. No-one would seriously suggest that we would hold back from that and doom the Australian public to analog television transmission forever and a qay. We have a unique problem: the digital signal does not reach out as far as it might to cover those areas currently covered by analog. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) quoted a public servant who was asked if the digital signal would cover all of Australia. The answer is no. That is self-evident. We cannot put $300,000 towers across the desert in remote parts of Australia. The whole of Australia will never be covered. Already 94 per cent of Australians are under the digital signal. I would have thought that the challenge, ratherthan regressing to analog, would be to try to get that other six per cent covered by digital.",46
68,Mr FILING,Unknown,You don't understand it.,46
69,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"Yes, I do understand it very well. Mr Andren interjecting",46
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. N.M. Dondas}-Order! The honourable member for Calare and the honourable member for Moore will allow the honourable member for Hinkler to conclude his remarks.,46
71,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"Ninety-four per cent of the population already has access to digital. I would have thought that the challenge was to make sure that more people had the benefit of that technology. Using again the analogy of television transmission, if we were to let analog and digital TV exist side by side indefinitely, we would be dooming Australia or the operators to $30 billion to $50 billion Of dual transmission costs. I would have thought it was sensible to phase out the analog in an orderly way, taking into account what the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) said, that is, protecting those areas that will not get a comparable service in the meantime, then from there moving to a more focused view on digital so that we can take on board new technologies like CDMA-I agree with thatand low-orbiting satellites. To regress to analog is like going back to the old wind-up phones; it makes no sense. Mi FAHEY (Macarthur-Minister for Finance and Administration) (12.18 p.m.)-As I was saying earlier in the debate, the government recognises that there are gaps in the service in respect of digital and that in time the six. per cent that the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) referred to will be addressed. It is a question of how quickly and the need to ensure coverage in the interim period. It is for those reasons that my colleague in another place has asked the ACA to conduct an inquiry to determine just what the current regional service is about-and regional services in particular where they receive the AMPS service-and to determine whether the phase-out would leave the area without alternative mobile phone coverage offering a quality of service and a breadth of coverage reasonably equivalent to that offered by AMPS. AMPS will be retained after 1 January in those regional areas where the review finds that there would be no reasonably equivalent coverage following the AMPS phase-out and where Telstra, Optus and Vodafone agree to the continued operation of the AMPS service. The government will, if necessary, after consultation with Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, impose additional network roll-out obligations on each of them so that in regional areas, where the review finds that there would be no reasonably equivalent coverage following the AMPS phase-out and where the three firms, Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, do not agree to continue operation of the AMPS service, those three firms will be required by government to provide reasonably equivalent coverage through other means such as GSM. The government will further consider mandating roaming between parts of the GSM network which are installed under the roll-out obligations if it is technically feasible and commercially appropriate, as this may be a practical way of reducing the cost to Telstra, Optus and Vodafone of a given expansion of the GSM range. Further, the government will require improved reporting on the quality of service and coverage from the carriers and we will develop and implement a binding AMPS phase-out plan designed to enable AMPS customers to have a smooth transition to alternative services. There is a recognition. The contract was signed in 1992. I should mention to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) that it was not a disallowable instrument as referred to in his opening remarks on this question. It was not a disallowable instrument; it was tabled. In that regard the contract has been there since 1992. Contractual arrangements of ,that nature cannot be changed without drawing attention to all areas of commerce and investment in this country andÂ· putting them at risk and in doubt. It would make us the laughing stock of the world, let alone cause irreparable damage to our economy. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) raised the matter of the capacity for coverage, particularly in the Sydney area, with reference specifically to the demand that will be there around the year 2000 with so many other visitors and so much activity in a city like Sydney. I cannot give the answer to that. I will take it on board and ask the relevant minister in another place to deal with Evans, M. 1. that aspect and inform the honourable member in due course. There is a problem; it is acknowledged. There is a solution; it is practical. It is the only solution that is workable. The amendments that are being brought forward by the honourable member for Moore, supported by others on the cross-benches, are simply not practical or workable. I understand their concern, but the greater concern must be surely that to bring forward amendments of this nature would throw the whole process into total confusion and put at risk the commerciality of contractual arrangements in an area which is important to regional Australia and to all Australia. Also, of course, if they were successful, they would condemn regional Australia to an outmoded process, not the most modern of systems, and surely rural and regional Australia has the right to the most modern of systems. I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Question put: That the amendments (Mr Filing's) be agreed to. The House divided. [12.27 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Hon.

Third Reading Motion (by Mr Fahey)-by leaveing the proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",46
72,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"I rise today to oppose this third reading of the sale of the remaining two-thirds Telstra. I do so because Telstra is one of best telecommunications providers in the world. Its connections reach 96 per cent of Australian households which all enjoy unincompanies terrupted access to the national network. also do it because I think that election promreluctant ises are important. During the debate prior to NOES the last election, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in a debate with Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister: Can I just say that we are not selling off all of Te1stra, we are selling a third. There is a difference there, Paul. Ray Martin asked Mr Howard, 'Why sell a third?' He replied: . .. because we believe that the right policy mix is to sell a third and to retain, as we have, two-thirds in government ownership. I agree with the Prime Minister. I would like to see the whole of Telstra remain in government ownership. Selling off this most prized asset of government is a policy that will have a bad economic impact and a bad impact on my constituents and on constituents throughout Australia. This is not sensible decision making. As Bob MCMullan has already pointed out, Telstra dividends are currently growing at a rate of 15.6 per cent per year. By the year 2002-3, the dividends that the government could have made out of owning Telstra will be greater than the interest saved on public debt. It is a short-term decision, made by a government incapable of any long-term vision. Studies in 1992 in the UK reveal that, in a comparison of nine companies, public sector companies were well ahead on labour productivity gains. The government has also ignored the economic flow-on effect of publicly owned companies operating in the public interest. A privatised Telstra will only be interested in profits. It will not be interested in industry plans and subsidising and promotlocal equipment industry. A privatised Telstra will buy equipment from whichever manufacturing source is cheapest. It will have no compUlsion to buy Australian and this will lead to a loss of Australian jobs. This bill would take the ownership of of Telstra out of the hands of ordinary Australthe ians. Currently we have collective ownership of two-thirds of Telstra. The fact is that Telstra is one of the few telecommunications in the world that does not time. I local calls. The Prime Minister has been very to rule out timed local calls for businesses. Telstra has also not raised the cost of pay phones and continues to provide free information services. But with this bill, that government control will be lost. Telstra has had for a long time what could be best termed a social contract of universal service. In the area of continuing technological advancement within our telecommunications industry, it is utterly vital that the government ensure that these new technologies be distributed equally to all Australians, regardless of wealth and regardless of where they live. We cannot become a nation of communications haves and have nots. The proposal to sell the remaining two-thirds of Telstra makes no sense with regard to the nation's economy, it makes no sense with regard to broader social goals, it makes no sense with regard to employment and it makes no sense with regard to services to our rural communities. It is a cheap election stunt by a very desperate government, and I urge 'the parliament to reject this measure. Motion (by Mr Fahey) agreed to: That the question be now put. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA",48

80,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"The recent and continuing events in Asia show as clearly as anything possibly could show us that good financial system management and regulation is absolutely essential to any country's economic health. Not only must the legal regulatory system be properly structured, but also the implementation of that legal regime has to be free from political interference and must be conducted in a transparent and accountable manner. Banks and deposit taking institutions have to run on a proper prudential basis. People have to be able to trust them. Australia has enjoyed a very sound financial system since the end of the Great Depression. This fundamental soundness and strength has occurred under a number of different regulatory regimes over the decades. However, the consistent theme has been one of successful, effective, confidence building, confidence sustaining regulation. This does not mean that the appropriateness of specific regulatory regimes, or practices or rules do not vary over time; of course they do. But it is the key to a strong and h-althy financial system to have an effective system in place that is appropriate to the times. The fundamental issue before us in considering this large package of legislation is not whether to regulate our financial systemthat is a given-but rather how we can reorganise to the extent necessary the current regulatory arrangements to better deliver the objectives of a sound and efficient financial system. Commercial and technological convergence has really become the order of the day in every advanced industrialised country, with banks, life insurance companies, general insurance, superannuation funds, credit unions and banking societies all doing a lot of the same sorts of things which previously had operated in different markets but now are involved in converging market environments. In the context of that reality in the continuously evolving financial sector in Australia, the Wallis inquiry, or the financial system inquiry, was established to evaluate the results of financial deregulation that have occurred so far and to recommend a future regulatory structure for Australia's financial system. The package of 11 bills which we are dealing with now proposes to implement the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry. I will address my remarks under several different headings reflecting the complexity of this-first of all, the structure of market regulation that is proposed by Wallis and now implemented by this legislation, and in that context I would like to say something about depositor protection. I also wish to talk about the implications of the - legislation for the vexed problem of bank and major financial institution mergers, and would then like to address the consumer protection issues that are thrown up by this package. So far as market regulation is concerned, the bills propose a complete reorganisation of the regulation of the entire financial sector. Key aspects are, first of all, the abolition of the existing regulatory arrangements which were quite industry specific. The Reserve Bank, the RBA, regulated banks; the Australian Securities Commission, or ASC, regulated companies; the ISC, or Insurance and Superannuation Commission, regulated insurance and superannuation entities; and we had an Australian Payments System Council regulating several aspects of the payments and banking systems related thereto. Then we have got by this legislation the creation of two new regulatory bodies to take over these myriad functions: ASIC, or Australian Securities and Investments Commission; and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA. I had occasion the other day to welcome the appointment of the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Graeme Thompson, as the Chief Executive Officer of APRA. I say now it seems to us an excellent appointment reflecting the reality the continuing connection between the new regulator and the former Reserve Bank and the necessity indeed for that connection to be very visibly maintained. The remaining element of the structural equation is the creation of a new statutory body, the Payments System Board, within the RBA but with statutory responsibilities for payment system matters. ASIC is to be based on the old ASC. It will be the pre-eminent consumer protection and market integrity regulator. In addition to the corporate regulatory functions that it has inherited, ASIC will initially take on the consumer and market integrity functions for the insurance and superannuation sectors and some aspects of banking and the payments system, Eventually this regime will extend across the whole financial sector. APRA, by contrast, will be responsible for prudential regulation-in essence, managing the financial health of all deposit-taking institutions: banks, building societies, credit unions, insurance companies and super funds. The single licensing and regulation approach that is involved here is expected to result in better and more consistent outcomes. The new model of a single prudential regulator and a single market regulator, when it is finally fully implemented, will overcome a couple of fairly obvious weaknesses with the current arrangements. One is the split between the Commonwealth and state and territory regulator rules, with the Commonwealth hitherto being pretty much confined to banks and insurance but with the state and territory rules applying to building societies and credit unions, with differing restrictions and differing cost recovery regimes impacting on the competition potential between these various institutions. The other problem was the fragmented consumer protection regime where similar products were being overseen by different regulators with often different rules applying. Against all that background of proposed change, I say very clearly at the outset that the opposition supports the general approach that has been adopted in the Wallis inquiry in its conclusions and accordingly in this legislaof tion, which seems, so far as we have been able to tell in the time available, to implement without any particular glitches the intended acceptance by the government of those major Wallis recommendations. We do recognise the benefits that should flow from the new arrangements when they are fully implemented. There are a number of issues raised in the proposed arrangements governing staffing of the new institutions. There are some questions that arise especially about the transfer of staff to APRA. Other issues may also arise in relation to staffing in respect of transfers to ASIC. The opposition is concerned to ensure that employees get a fair deal in the context of these institutional reforms, and this is one of the issues that we would like to see closely examined by the Senate committee to which we are proposing to refer this legislation in the normal course. One of the key issues in the design of any prudential regulatory regime is obviously the question of depositor protection. Given its central importance for the savings of ordinary Australians, we have been concerned to look closely at what is proposed here to ensure that there is no drifting away from the kind of commitments that depositors need to their interests by the appropriate regulatory regime. There has for a long time been a general assumption by a great many people in the community that bank deposits are specifically guaranteed to the last dollar by the Reserve Bank. That is and always has been an incorrect assumption. At best there is an implicit guarantee arising from the operation of sections contained in division 2 of part II of the Banking Act and section 86 of the Reserve Bank Act. But that implicit guarantee has never been legislatively explicit and certainly there has never been anything in the.legislation that provides an absolute guarantee. What there has been is provisions enabling the ready intervention by the Reserve Bank in the affairs of banks that have been in difficulty in this respect with arrangements to ensure that they trade out of those difficulties, to the extent possible, and that in the event of a winding up the depositors do get preference over all other creditors. That has worked in the past to the extent that the system really has not been put under test in terms of having final payouts to be made. Nonetheless, it was part of the Wallis inquiry's concern to ensure that, particularly in the context of a broader set of regulatory arrangements encompassing other deposittaking institutions as well as the banks, the limitations on the existing depositor protection arrangements be well understood in the community. They recommended that the system be overhauled, in effect, to do several things: firstly, to maintain unequivocally-and this is done in the legislation-the existing preference for bank depositors and to extend that to all other approved deposit-taking institutions. Secondly-and they seem to\ have done this in a way that does not cause us any particular difficulty, although this may be an issue that would deserve further attention in the Senate committee--they have sought to remove some of the language that does perhaps create a misleading impression that there is an absolute guarantee of a payout in the event of a bank or institutional collapse. What the legislation also does in its application is, in effect, improve the capacity of the regulator to intervene quickly in cases of failure or potential failure of a deposit-taking institution, recognising that this, in practi<,:e, sible. in the real world, is the most effective method of protecting depositors. As always, it is much better to get in first, Â·before the horse has bolted, to ensure that you have got that close supervision and the capacity to steer an institution through a rocky period. That has always been part of the regime for the banks; it is now here for all of them in a way which is, on the face of it, quite well thought through. The question always arises in this context about the desirability or otherwise of a system of deposit insurance and/or more formal guarantees for the protection of deposits. However, I think it is really a pretty compelling argument that the moral hazard and other kindsÂ· of risk associated with these sorts of arrangements are simply too large to ignore and that, on balance, it is preferable to go the other way. I think the disastrous case of the US savings and loans industry demonstrates pretty effectively just how such a system can in fact work against the very objectives that it attempts to meet. So we generally accept the model that is proposed as the appropriate one to be implemented here. Of course here, as elsewhere, the key to the success of this type of arrangement is the proper resourcing of the regulator and ensuring that it is capable of competently discharging the functions vested in it. We will be continuing to watch very closely what happens when it comes to actual implementation in this respect. The next issue that squarely arises under this legislation is the whole question of the policy applicable to bank mergers and other major financial institution mergers. The Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill 1998, one of the package which is before us, proposes to standardise the rules applicable to significant shareholders in prudentially regulated financial institutions. The bill will subject all such institutions to a 15 per cent shareholding limit by anyone person and that person's associates, or such higher percentage as the Treasurer may determine as being in the national interest. So you do have this residual executive discretion to determine what kind of concentrations will be permisThe operation of the current law is being standardised and streamlined across institutions, which will certainly assist major financial services groups in terms of their own administration. The law has been strengthened too, in some respects, so the Treasurer can declare a person to have practical control of an institution regardless of the actual shareholdingand, indeed, require the person to relinquish that shareholding. All of these provisions in the legislative structure before us are considered by us to be, on the face of it, reasonable, and they are not opposed. However, that is the legislation. What matters of course is the way all this works in executive practice, and I make clear that support for this new legislative regime should not signal Labor's support for any change to our basic approach to mergers of the major institutions. We have always adopted a policy which would preclude the merger of any of the four banks: ANZ, NAB, Westpac and the Commonwealth. Moreover, we have taken in the past a strong view also that the two major life offices-AMP and National Mutualshould be regarded as of equivalent stature. So it is not just a four pillars policy but really a six pillars policy that we have had. We have taken the view, and continue to take the view, that such mergers are, on the face of it, not in the national interest and we are concerned about the implication of them occurring. Certainly, so far as the major banks are concerned, Australia already has one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world. Further mergers, in our judgment, between the major banks would lead to even greater concentration withOut overwhelmingly obvious compensating advantages. A recent study by Professor Kevin Davis shows that only the Netherlands, Ukraine and Finland have more concentrated banking sectors than Australia does. The decision of the government, announced at the time of its response to Wallis, to scrap the six pillars policy does create the prospect of a gargantuan new institution that would not only itself have a lot of market clout but also in fact put a great deal of pressure on further acquisitions and mergers between the other players. The six pillars policy, as it was known, which has now been abandoned by the government, probably needs to be a little bit rethought to the extent that you are no longer talking simply about six pillars, but perhaps nine or even more than that at the moment as a result of other mergers, acquisitions and regroupings that have in fact been occurring. You do have a situation now, with the Citigroup tie-up with the Travellers group in the United States, which has got flow-through implications for Australia, of other major players emerging in the Australian financial sector in addition to the ones I have mentioned-the Colonial State Bank, which is the product of course of the merger between Colonial Mutual and the old State Bank of New South Wales, Suncorp-Metway in Queensland and St George, which has now absorbed the Advance Bank. All of these are pretty significant players in the scheme of things. None of the non-bank institutions have quite the same order of magnitude of market capitalisation as the more familiar four banks, but nonetheless they are very major players. I simply want to say that, so far as all of those players are concerned, without adopting an approach of absolute prohibition in terms of our own policy approach, we will certainly look with a very narrow, beady and circumspect eye at any proposal for further concentration of any of the institutions that I have mentioned because of our anxiety about the anti-competitive implications of that. Certainly, so far as the big four banks are concerned, our position is maintained as one of very real concern about the downside risks there. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, made it clear at the time of his announcement that the government had a kind of watching brief on this issue, that its position was going to be governed by its satisfaction on the question of how much competition was around, particularly in the small business sector. Recent developments, just last week with Westpac and now the Commonwealth Bank breaking some of the high interest rate barriers to small business loan access, seem to have given a new lease of life to speculation about the imminence of government approval for mergers. No doubt there is not going to be anything very exciting happening before the election, because this government is all too conscious of the very strong feeling in the community about the job loss and service loss that seem inevitably, irrevocably and endemically associated with merger activity of this kind, but I want to make it clear that the opposition is not persuaded by any of these developments that any fundamental conditions have changed, and our view would be one of resistance to any of the big four operating in this way. One of the big problems in all of this is the . way in which mergers in the past-quite apart from what the banks have been doing anyway individually to reduce their cost pressureshave had a devastating effect on the availability of employment and services, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In the past three years, the majors have closed more than 100 rural branches, and there are more than 600 communities across Australia that no longer have access to a financial institution. It really is the last straw when the last bank leaves town. I have seen it in communities, particularly in my home state of Victoria, where the Premier has closed country hospitals-12 of them gone since 1992-and shut down their local schools, 350 of them, and when the bank goes it really is the final blow to confidence. The banking committee in this parliament has been told that, when the bank branch closes, supermarket sales tend to drop 20 per cent and local firms battle to manage to keep enough cash to attract investment and they lose customers to the nearest banking town. Baring MCIntosh has estimated that the merger of two major banks in Australia would wipe out 35,000 jobs. In our judgment, it is just in nobody's interest to allow further concentration and a further shrinking of banking services and banking jobs. The Treasurer should rule out that option, do so without weasel words and make a commitment which extends into the life of the next parliament. Of course, if you are going to talk in terms of banking and what has been going on particularly in rural Australia, it is important to understand that, irrespective of merger activity, there has been a deterioration in the availability of major bank services to the bush. We sought to anticipate this problem when we were in government by, among other things, initiating a program of credit care which has fostered the development of new credit union services in country areas. Thirty-nine new credit unions have been set up in isolated areas as a result of that program. This program has been maintained by the present government-so far anyway-and I hope it will continue. I do want to take this opportunity to add a reference to one further source of hope for rural communities in Australia that I have seen as a result of an initiative of a regional bank-the Bendigo Bank in rural Victoria. They are on a path towards establishing lower scale banking services in small towns that the majors have actually given up on. They are trying to develop a system of joint ventures with the local community. They are offering their banking licence, their infrastructure, their expertise, their cheque clearing, their training capacity and their name to small communities that want a banking service again. The idea is that the community in tum pays for the bricks and mortar-maybe the building which a major has just vacated or part of a newsagency, at the other end of the spectrum, or a council office or something of that kindby raising shares among the local people. The shareholders thereby have a vested interest in the success of the venture; they share the profits. The Bendigo Bank-to whom I have talked about this in recent times-believes there will be a tremendous incentive to bank locally if you can get that degree of local shareholder commitment to these new exercises and that it will halt the flight of capital and business to the bigger banking towns. Just a couple of weeks ago, two Victorian towns, Rupanyup and Minyip, signed up for the first pilot branches to be open 2- days a week. A great majority of business owners who have been surveyed said that they are looking forward to transferring their business to those branches. Nhill, another Victorian town, looks like going down the same path. Bendigo Bank is negotiating with 30 other rural communities, and I hope this at least is one response to the crisis of rural banking that will actually make a difference. Before I move on finally to consumer protection, one other structural point I want to mention about banks is the foreign ownership of the major banks. I just want to say clearly for the record that, while the Wallis report says there should be no special restrictions on foreign ownership of the major banks, and while that view has been broadly picked up by the Treasurer who has committed himself only to saying that it will not be open slather on foreign ownership, we believe that there should be a very firm prohibition against foreign takeovers of any of the four majors, and that remains our position. Finally, on the consumer protection side of things-about which there is really quite a lot to say in the short time available-our concern, first of all, is that the proposed new regulatory institutional structure may give insufficient weight and effectiveness under the new ASIC badge to the kind of performance that we have come to expect from the ACCC in the past. In the absence of any details having been given by the government as to funding and staffing arrangements for ASIC and how many of the actual personnel are going to be taken over and how much of its capacity for effective action is going to be taken over as distinct from just the name, it is difficult to be confident about what will occur. The ACCC can boast an excellent track record in this area. They have taken on the banks when they have engaged in false and misleading advertising against the new mortgage originators. They have investigated collusion by the banks in lowering housing interest rates. They have played a major education role: for example, issuing a widespread publicity campaign on credit cards and their hidden traps. They have always acted quickly and with a degree of imagination. In particular, I think of that case where Bankwest was accused of running a disinformati on campaign against the new non-bank lenders and their home loans. The ACCC jumped in quickly and, instead of seeking to have a fine imposed on the bank, required Bankwest to publish an honest document guiding consumers through the home loan maze. While the ACCC will retain its powers under the Trade Practices Act and the prices surveillance legislation, nobody has any idea about how this is all going to work in practice. It will be up to the new organisations to work out some memorandum of understanding and up to the executive government to supervise all of this in a way that will be effective. When it comes to everyday consumer issues like bank fees and charges, we are very concerned, particularly given the general attitude of this government, that consumers are going to be held out to dry. The Treasurer has been advocating for some time to simply let things rip in this respect, relying on 'redhot competition' to bring fees and charges down. The Wallis report gave him ample succour and nourishment in this respect, recommending that the banks be free to set their fees and charges to cover their costs with no government powers of suasion or discipline over them. Consumer power was supposed to do the job. But consumer power by itself, we found, did not work during our period in government and certainly is not working now. Even before Wallis, as housing interest rates fell and the income flow from that fell away and margins started contracting, the banks started in a big way raiding fees and charges. By January 1997, as David Luff reported in a very interesting article in the Daily Telegraph of 15 January, banks were earning 'billions of dollars through a raft of new fees and charges' - more than 200 of them, from account keeping fees to charges for overuse of ATMs, to new high cheque clearing fees, to hikes in charges for duplicate statements and EFfPOS on over-the-counter transactions, and so the list went on. One in every $3 earned by the banks, Luff reported, was now earned in fees and charges. Wallis simply allowed the banks to continue the raid. By November 1997, fees and charges had jumped 10 per cent in a year and the banks had grabbed an extra $617 million in fees and charges. In February of this year, the Financial Review reported that the banks had made $6.3 billion in fees and charges in the past 12 months. Under the so-called 'red-hot competition' that we are seeing at the moment, consumer power is not stopping fees spiralling upwards again. The Commonwealth Bank announced another new round of price hikes last November, with many of them hitting now. The Pensioners and Superannuants Association say that some of their members are paying an extra $13 a month in fees and charges. But the Commonwealth is actually at the most generous end. The NAB is increasing its fees from 1 May on everything from other-bank ATM withdrawals to overdrawn cheque accounts. Westpac is increasing audit fees to business customers by 50 per cent. ANZ is cutting the number of free over-the-counter transactions for the disadvantaged from four a month to two a month-a real cheese-paring exercise there. No wonder that a recent survey by the ACA-the consumers associationfound that 80 per cent of bank customers believe that the federal government should regulate bank fees. What is the Treasurer doing about this? He talks constantly about merely 'jawboning' the banks into doing the right thing. That is as far as he will go.Â· There is no talk from the present Treasurer or government about using the powers available to him under the Prices Surveillance Act and directing the ACCC-or its new body now, ASIC-to formally monitor bank fees and charges. He should recognise that what we are seeing here is a classic case of market failure, and the government should do something about it. There needs to be government intervention. There needs to be an adoption of the recommendations. of the PSA, which, in 1995, said that fees and charges should be monitored for three years to provide regular public reports and consumer information on fees and allow government and consumers to check the progress made by the banks in restructuring their fees and charges to promote greater efficiency. In August 1995 our former Treasurer, Ralph Willis, wrote to the banks and informed them that he would direct the PSAJACCC to formally monitor fees and charges. In November, the new ACCC was directed to begin drafting terms of reference for formal monitoring but, after the election, the present Treasurer decided to ignore this recommendation, and all bank customers have-as I think I have now demonstrated-paid the price. The point that really needs to be emphasised is that it is the disadvantaged-the elderly, the geographically isolated, pensioners, students and low income earners-who have suffered most from this hands-off attitude. In 1995 we also demanded that the banks offer a cheap basic banking product to protect the disadvantaged, with at least one free over-the-counter transaction a week. The banks were given until early 1996 to introduce that new service and we indicated that, if they failed to deliver, we would look at regulation. By Christmas 1995, that had worked to the extent that all banks had introduced a basic banking product. What has happened is that this basic, no frills banking product for the disadvantaged is now quietly being whittled away bank by bank-from four free services a month to two free services and so on. Jawboning did not achieve the breakthrough. It had to be more. It had to be the threat of actual action-first of all, formal monitoring and then, beyond that, the possibility of further more direct government intervention. The truth of the matter is that, unless governments accompany the kind of legislative structures which are here set out and which we have indicated support for with an appropriate commitment to genuinely getting out there and protecting the interests of not only the institutions but also their depositors and all those who are customers and participants in this financial situation, the legislation will not do the job that it needs to do. Legislation has to be accompanied by executive commitment and executive sympathy and understanding, particularly to those in our community who are less well able to cope for themselves against the kinds of disciplines and rigours imposed by the banks, who traditionally, along with the other financial institutions, have been notoriously insensitive to such people.

81,Mr HARDGRAVE,Unknown,"Here we have yet another one of those classic 'if only there was a 14th year'kinds of contributions from the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). If only there had been a 14th or 15th year of Labor. Heaven help us as a nation if there had been. This morning we have heard yet again a whole myriad of excuses and reasons from the dab hand of the previous failed Labor government-which had failed the whole process of deregulation of the banking sector in this country-as to why the people should overlook and, in fact, forgive the kinds of failures that have occurred as a result of a number of the aspects the Labor Party failed to actually do anything about during their 13 years in government. They talk deregulation, but what did they really do? All deregulation produced was a great loss of jobs in the banking sector and a decline in the real competition that the kinds of reforms that are contained in the bill before us today are all about fixing. This morning we heard yet another example of the policy free zone that we have sitting opposite. It is to the great shame of the Australian Labor Party that they constantly fail to come into this place and outline clearly some of the matters that they should be outlining to the people of Australiaalternative proposals setting out what they will do if at some stage down the track they are returned to the government benches. They constantly find excuses for what they failed to do and constantly try to plead the case for a 14th or 15th year, saying it would have been different if only they had still been in government. But they again fail miserably to provide leadership out of people like the member for Holt and the Leader of the Opposition (MrBeazley) to come up with some real policies and some matters that people can digest. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has produced a document on which a cartoon in this morning's paper was based. There was a caricature of the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy hiding between a tree poking a stick at this document. There is a suggestion of one person asking, 'What is it?' The other one says, 'I don't know, I haven't seen one for quite a while,' meaning they haven't seen a policy for quite a while. One would hope that the member for Werriwa' s aspirations to at least get policy making debate going in the Labor opposition actually bears some fruit.",56

We are, after all, a government that listens to Australians and understands a wide range of concerns. You have only to look at the membership of the backbench of the government parties, along with those on the front-bench, to understand that we represent a broad range of people in Australia. We understand their real concerns. That is why I am so pleased today to see this package of bills before us for consideration. This package of bills has come about as a result of the reforms suggested by the inquiry established by this government, not in the 14th or 15th year of the previous government, to look into the whole financial system of Australia-the range of various financial institutions in Australia. Mr Stan Wallis and his report really do need to be highlighted for offering some very positive ideas to the government, matters which have been taken up by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the executive and obviously endorsed by members of the backbench and the government parties. This legislation is practical and straightforward. It provides long looked for reforms and it really is landmark legislation. It is all about fundamental reforms in the Australian financial sector. It has certainly proved that, unlike those opposite, we do not just convene inquiries and ignore the findings and perhaps convene another inquiry at another stage. We actually do something about it. The reforms outlined in the package of bills that we are considering today will openÂ· up the financial sector to greater competition and greater efficiency. It will all be. underpinned by a stronger regulatory regime which has an eye on the ability of the banking and financial sector to respond to developments which will continue to unfold. In an area where there is high technology and ongoing globalisation, there will always be unfolding developments. We have certainly left the door open to make:: sure not just that Australians fall in line with developments inspired from other countries but that we are active participants in the process of those developments. These bills will set the pace for Australia's place in the world of finance. It will take Australian banks and financial institutions in general out onto the world stage. It will expose them to world's best practice and in so many cases we will prove that we will be .able to establish them. All of these reforms are ones that you can bank on. That is what this package of bills is all about. This government has had so much to do in the space of a couple of years. We have so much to undo and so much to redo, refine and repair. As a result of that massive agenda packed with so many reforms, it is a valid claim substantiated by fact, performance and record in this place that we have the most reforming government in this nation's history. This is the government that has had to do so much. It is a mantle that we can now claim because the job was so vast. After 13 years of Labor, the repair job was so big that we have had to unpick things, we have had to reform things and we have had to redirect things. We have had to provide that sort of leadership. A lot of it has not necessarily been easy, but it is certainly a fact that we should have not walked away from any of the things that we have to do. Our reforms will pay real dividends in the years to come. These bills will be part of the process that is going to provide those real dividends too. The previous government really did give the concept of reform a very bad name. They tended to pervert the branding name of reform. They tended to pervert the concept of reform. They talked efficiency, for instance, but it really was simply a code word for less jobs and more tasks done by fewer people. They talked enterprise bargaining but, instead of having wages negotiated between workers and their bosses at an enterprise by enterprise level, where bosses and workers could sit down beside each other and discuss mutual interests, the profitability of the business the viability of all things concerned, they had the union bosses usurp the workers' rights and negotiate wages on an industry by industry basis. They talked about banking sector competition. While they let a few foreign banks come in, there was no real regulatory reform and regulatory teeth to ensure that the existing cosy cartel would respond by providing better service and better prices for the particular banking products that they offer. Because of Labor, the banking sector reform job has been left to us. As a result of the Labor Party's attempts at reforms over the years, we have seen job shedding, service shedding, consumer lack of confidence, higher profits for the banks and a failure to pass on low interest rates quickly. We now have a government with a policy which quite simply has provided the lowest interest rates in almost 40 years in this country and a low level of inflation. But the benefits have been sluggish in being passed on to the consumers. In particular, I cite areas such as credit card finance. I know that people in my electorate still have massive credit card debts to repay, all because the banking sector has been slow to respond. Why? Because the Labor regime left a cosy little arrangement for them. Then we have the area of lower interest rates. In fact, I know of people-some in my electorate and some outside-who had business loans established years ago and they are still paying high business interest rates, all as a result of the Labor Party arrangements which were in place. By comparison, what do we have now under this current government and the process that the Treasurer has used to cajole the banks into some action that will bettered by the legislation before us today? We have Westpac starting to respond, with interest rates on business loans down to seven per cent.",57
84,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,A record low.,58
85,Mr HARDGRAVE,Unknown,"It is a record low. Exactly. That is tremendous news for the many small businesses in my electorate. As the parliamentary secretary knows, the Southside Chamber of Commerce, the South-West Chamber of Commerce and my Moreton Electorate Small Business Advisory Group and have constantly raised matters with regard to the way banks have treated them unfairly in passing on the obviously low interest rate regime this government has been able to achieve through its reforms over the last couple of years.",58
86,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,And you represented them strongly to the Treasurer.,58
87,Mr HARDGRAVE,Unknown,Thank you very  Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The member for Moreton has the floor. He doesn't need your assistance.,58
88,Mr HARDGRA VE,Unknown,"-Constituents, private and business alike, have all had the same complaint over the last couple of years when they have spoken to me about the banks. They have simply said that banks did not care. They felt that services were withdrawn, they felt they were charged to have direct contact services, like using a human teller, and the interest rates on credit cards and business loans remain high. Those sorts of things have happened simply because of the legacy the Australian Labor Party government of the 13 years between 1983 and 1996 left us. Essentially, to sum up, the dab hand of Labor has been left resting on the banking sector until now. The package of bills we have here today are a result of the fact that the government of today-the Howard government-wanted changes, wanted results and wanted to get a proper assessment, which was what the Wallis inquiry was all about, and now we introduce the package of bills to make so much possible. So many things will and can change as a result. Real competition, underpinned by tough legislation, will achieve rl'fsults, and the dividends are very obvious. Essentially, the four big banks in Australia will have to respond to this. I must give credit to the Bank of Queensland in my own state and Metway and those other smaller banks who have been very determined in the way they have tried to provide human service and an alternative to the four big banks to try to shame them, in the Queensland market anyway, into some better response. Changes have been slow. When we start to see greater competition, world's best practice and an exposure to the globalisation and technology that is all part of the financial sector become the rule of the day, we will see the four big banks start to fall into line. will certainly not be the way it has been as a result of Labor's years, where services we always used to take for granted were removed and where we saw people being charged for the privilege of banking their money. On top of this, in a more broader context, this government is committed to making Australia a leading business centre in the Asia-Pacific region. These reforms will also help this happen. These will bring improvements to our financial system, along with a wide range of reforms to our corporate laws, which will provide some basis of support for this. The Wallis inquiry into our financial system found there was rapid change as a result of technological innovation, increasing globalisation and changing business and consumer needs. They are all matters which will certainly shape the future as far as the finance sector and, indeed, the entire economy, is concerned. While we are challenged to keep pace with this ongoing, rapid nature of financial system innovation, we cannot leave our regulatory regimes anchored completely in the past. They must be modernised. This is a sector which will contribute strongly to job growth and growth of our nation's economy. We must not talk just about more jobs but also, as a result of these bills, talk about better jobs for Australians. This can be achieved only by encouraging our financial institutions to achieve world's best practice and to get from the late part of this century into the next century. We can prove our prowess. The government is providing a lead by these bills before us today to challenge our financial sectors to expose themselves to the international financial services market and the high level of competition it provides. The government firmly believes that this can be achieved while ensuring that some basic goals of systemic safety and stability are made paramount. There are a number of other important underlying objectives, given. that the regulatory focus needs to be clear and given the need to minimise market entry restriction and failure. Competition must be enhanced but not This at the expense of stability and safety. This government is providing a regime which will afford Australians the certainty they need before they boldly go beyond the traditional big four bank arrangements they are now quite used to. I am sure that in a lot of ways without such reassurances the competition that we all want could fail, as it did under the Labor government. Three key objectives for government intervention through regulation of the financial system are worth noting here. The first is the maintenance of financial stability. There are various ways of ensuring a safe and reliable payments system. Of course this marries directly with the price stability that is the main objective of monetary policy. The second goal is the provision of specialised regulation of conduct, disclosure and dispute resolution for financial service providers and financial markets. In addition, we also recognise that some sectors of the financial system which require more intense regulation for safety and stability reasons should also be beefed up to ensure that this particular aspect of prudential supervision is also locked in place. In order to do this, we are looking at the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, a new single prudential regulatory authority charged with the provision of a more efficient and competitively neutral regulation across all the prudentially regulated sectors. This is a matter of updating the Labor legacy of several agencies, providing a form of regulation. APRA, not to be confused with the Australian Performing Rights Association, which has the same acronym, will be keeping an eye on matters. It will be the prudential regulator of banks and other institutions which take dep-sits, including life and general insurance companies, retirement income accounts and superannuation funds. They will have comprehensive powers as an organisation and they will be responsible for licensing regulation of the institutions authorised to provide these various services. The bill sets out a number of ways and means in which the powers and functions of APRA will be established. It will provide for the laws and regulations to be administered by APRA in relation to each sector. It will be an independent regulator. Like the Reserve Bank, it will always be subject to the Treasurer's overriding policy determination power. There is also provision within these bills the funding of APRA from moneys appropriated from a collection of levies paid by regulated financial institutions and also from charges for certain services. APRA will become fully operational on 1 July this year or as soon as possible thereafter. So here we have a one-stop shop, a single prudential regulator. It will provide flexible, efficient and coordinated regulation which is consistent across the financial sector. It is important everybody understands there is one set of rules. It aims for excellence as far as regulation is concerned as well as enriching career opportunities for the staff and developing comprehensive and closer links with the financial system as a whole. This is a very worthwhile step forward as far as the government is concerned. It certainly has done its part. It is providing the lead that we need in this financial sector. Clearly, consumers also have a role to play. It is not necessary for consumers to put up with poor service because they are uncertain about making the big move from the bank that perhaps they have used for a long time, particularly for older Australians. There is no need for them to put up with poor service, being uncertain of where they might put their foot next. They do not need to put up with high bank charges. They do not need to put up with the failure to pass on interest rate cuts any more-all legacies from the failure of Labor in this particular area of policy. While people may still be reluctant to change banks because of some loyalty to banks in the past, they should realise that by staying with a poor performing bank they are rewarding the contempt that the banks have shown consumers in so many cases over the years, especially in recent years following the Labor Party's failure to address the sorts of concerns that this government is dealing with here today. We are addressing the failures of the past, of the previous government. We are exposing, as a result, the policy free zone on the other side. We are also exposing the lack of leadership that those opposite have shown on a wide range of issues. We are dealing strongly - ith an important policy area. We are providfor mg a lead for today and into tomorrow. We are providing a lead which will give Australia's financial sector the opportunity to compete and be part of the world stage, to provide innovation and best practice. It is a terrific set of measures contained within the bills before us today, and I commend them to the House. .",58
89,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"Cunningham) (1.32 p.m.)Of all the nonsense I have heard spoken in that this place about banking and the former government's attitude to deregulation, I would have to say that the contribution of the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) is on top of the hit parade. I would commend to the honourable member for Moreton the report, the genesis of which is the legislation we are debating today, Financial system inquiry: Final report, otherwise known as the Wallis committee report. Unlike the member for Moreton, who clearly has not read this, Stan Wallis and his colleagues in putting that together did a stocktake of the financial deregulation that occurred under previous Labor governments and gave them a big tick. Let me just refresh his memory. In 1983 who was it that floated the Australian dollar and freed up the exchange rate controls? The Australian Labor Party; P.I. Keating, Treasurer. Who was it that allowed the entry of foreign banks by issuing licences in 1984 to 16 of them, 15 of which took them up? The Australian Labor Party; PJ. Keating, Treasurer. Who was it in 1987 that deregulated the housing interest rates sector? The Australian Labor Party; P.I. Keating, Treasurer. Who was it that was behind freeing up the capital that could be raised through the acquisition the Commonwealth Bank of Australia of the State Bank of Victoria that saved the depositors of that state from great grief? The Australian Labor Party; P.I. Keating, Treasurer. Who was it that subsequently put in prudential supervision arrangements and saw the Council of Financial Regulators established? Who was it that freed up foreign bank entry into this country? The Australian Labor Party; P.I. Keating, Treasurer; P.I. Keating, Prime Minister of this country. That is where it came from, my friend. All that this government has done is to take it a step further the legislation that is here. Let me refresh your memory a bit more and give you a bit more reading to take on after you get out of this place today. Go and have a look at this report. You talked about it was that governments had done in the past, particularly the Labor government, in looking at reports and acting on them. Let me refer the honourable gentleman to the report of House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration of November 1991 entitled A pocketful of change: Banking and deregulation. Have a look at that report and then talk to the honourable member for Wannan (Mr Hawker). He knows about it because he was a member of the committee and he now chairs its extension. He is now looking at yet another inquiry into banking services in rural and regional Australia-again an issue which was canvassed here and about which recommendations were made. He knows for a fact that 102 of the 103 recommendations made in this committee's report were adopted by the government of the day. They went to things like supervision. They went to things like . assisting consumers. They went to things like providing services in regional and remote Australia. They went to such things that you claimed in your contribution today that we were somehow rooted in the past. I had a bit of a laugh when you talked about things like service and all the rest of it and then went on to talk about world's best practice in banking. What do you think is going on with electronic commerce today? What do you think is going on with the holes by in the wall that appear all over Australia at the present moment? What do you think is going on when you can pick up a telephone and do all your banking from your own place of business? Do you think that is not moving into the next century? Do you think that has all just happened in the last two years since you have been in government? I think not. It has been the process of the banks themselves over a long period of time working in harmony and in tandem with governments and oppositions of the day in developing those products. If you want a history lesson on this, with go and talk to the member for Waqnon because he knows all about it, and he knows what I am saying is correct. The legislation that we are dealing with . today goes to extending one of the major what issues which was canvassed by the Wallis committee report. I found the Wallis committee report an extremely good piece of research and an extremely good summation of what the has been going on in the Australian finance sector over the last several years. Having taken an interest in matters dealing with banking for quite some time. I actually chaired the committee inquiry that I referred to-I was particularly interested to see some of the recommendations that might flow from Wallis. In the typical style of this government, whilst they appointed a committee to examine specific issues, they did not go all the way in the ultimate response. I know that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), has made some comments on the six pillars policy, and I will make some comments on that in a moment. The provision that this legislation is seeking to put in place-that is, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority-is in my view a step in the right direction. Without breaking the confidence of committee deliberations, my friend for Wannon will remember that when we examined the question of prudential supervision back in 1991 there was a body of view within the committee that having one megaregulator was the way to go. I have to say that was my view at the time. I felt we needed to have a megaregulator because banking services were being blurred at the edges. We know that there was superannuation. We know that there were banking services directly. We know that there were fringe dwellers in the marketplace. In my view, it seemed quite ridiculous to make Chinese walls to isolate elements of the prudential supervisory arrangement that was necessary to protect depositors against failures and potential failures in the banking system. As a consequence, in the course of our committee deliberations, I tried to argue that perhaps the best way to achieve that was to have this megaregulator. Regrettably, my powers of persuasion in 1991 are not as good as they are today. It was the left-wing members of the Liberal Party and people like Steele Hall that would not come to the party at the time. In order to get a fairly unanimous report on this issue, we settled for making a recommendation about having a council of financial regulators that brought together the individual regulatory bodies within the finance system so that they would meet on a regular basis and so that there was a cross-fertilisation in terms of prudential supervisory matters. I am delighted, therefore, that some seven years later and after another inquiry-this time by Stan Wallis-the government has chosen to put in place this legislation, which recognises the changing nature of the Australian financial industry. It recognises that, by having a single regulator, as is said here, at arms-length from government but not from government policy, as it should be, in the say way asÂ· the Reserve Bank operates, it will provide that stability and that level of supervision that consumers expect. If they are putting their money in banks, building societies, credit unions, superannuation funds, mutual societies or whatever, individuals expect and demand that there be protection for that deposit. They expect that they will get a reasonable rate of interest and rate of return on that investment, but they also expect that there will be supervision of that and that that supervision will entail the fact that, if they wish to withdraw the money, it will be there and it will be there with interest. So the main element of these cognate bills is certainly welcome. A number of issues that have been raised in public debate in recent times about banks do need some further amplification and clarification. For example, I mentioned a little earlier that the member for Wannon now chairs one of the more important committees of this parliament dealing with an inquiry at the present moment on the provision of banking services in rural and remote Australia. One of the key issues that we are examining in that committee is whether or not the process of rationalisation-for want of a better term--of the existence of bank branches from small communities is appropriate and whether there are alternate ways in which banking services can be provided. On the public record that we have examined so far and from the evidence of witnesses that have appeared, there seem to be some alternatives that can be provided. Certainly smaller financial institutions, particularly building societies and credit unions, are not averse to moving in and operating in small regional and remote communities if a bank decides, for whatever reason, that it is no longer appropriate for it to operate there. When you marry together the changes in technology with that sort of circumstance and some innovative ideas-such as the banks themselves providing mobile banking facilities and travelling through regional areas and so on-you can see that the doom and gloom that some people suggest is going to befall Australia in providing access by all Australians to banking services is a touch overstated. It is also important to note some of the other issues that have been around for a period of time as to the future shape of Australia's finance industry. The Wallis committee made a number of recommendations. It made several in respect of the so-called six pillars policy. The six pillars policy says that there should be four major Australian banks and two life offices operating-one of which has already converted to a bank and is now offering bank services and, therefore, must be adding to competition in the marketplace. We also have below that a fairly substantial level of regional banks. We have a substantial number of credit unions and building societies in Australia. Whilst we have seen some rationalisations with mergers already taking place, it is still for a population of 18 million people in this country, although the country is large and the population is scattered, Australia is fundamentally still overbanked. Australia is still fundamentally overbanked with the number of banks that we have. Too often we see people trying to equate numbers of institutions with competition, and that is not the case. If there were three major banks and regional banks, building societies and credit unions, you may still get the same level of competition if they were prepared to go out into the marketplace and compete against each other. But, for some reason, everybody seems to be rooted in the concept of having a specific number. Let us put aside for a minute the six pillars policy and talk about it in a generic sense. I do not think that necessarily needs to be the case. If consumers are looking for business loans, we have seen in the last couple of weeks announcements by Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank that they now have special small business loan packages in place. That has come because the demand has been there, and at long last they have seen an element of their book that is perhaps undersubscribed at the minute and they see a competitive advantage for themselves in getting into the marketplace. So they have gone hell for leather and they are now offering lower priced interest rates to try to attract small business into that area. We have seen the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) take credit for that in the last couple of days and now trying to cajole the other two major banks to provide similar services. I am sure they will. I am sure they will get to that position because they do not want to see one of their other competitors get a competitive advantage in this. That is the true test of competition. It is not because there are four, six, eight, 10 or 15 players that we classify as banks. It is not because we also have 30-odd foreign banks that are now in the system. The original reason for the foreign banks being granted licences when they came in here-I think everybody would agree-was to provide additional competition to the four fair to say that majors in Australia. That did not come in the form of retail banking because what the foreign banks decided to do was look at niche markets. They got into that niche market area very nicely. They were in small business-large business loans particularly-they were in equity financing for business ventures and so on. They provided a real need in the community. Since the Labor government lifted that restriction on the number of foreign banks that can be here, we have seen quite a number extra come into the place, more licences have been issued and they have been operating and providing competitive banking services-albeit in niche markets. But they are broadening that horizon. Saying that by introducing this legislation it has been the Liberal government under John Howard and Peter Costello that has led some revolution in the Australian finance industry and the banking industry generally and that it is only in the last two years that we have seen improvements in competition and deregulation take place is disingenuous at best. As I have said for a long time, financial deregulation was one of the hallmarks of the Keating legacy to this country. I have to say, Madam Deputy Speaker-and you would know this too-that from time to time we on this side of the parliament are criticised for it. We are criticised because we did open up the Australian banking system to more competition. When we go to Labor Party branch meetings there are still people there that talk about the good old days and ask, 'Why don't you as a party come forward and advocate buying back the Commonwealth Bank,' as if it was something special again. We sit there and have to listen to this. The Commonwealth Bank is one of those issues that keeps being raised. The Commonwealth Bank, when it was established, had a real role to play. It was a central banking function as well as just a savings bank. The central banking function-that is, the Reserve Bank function-was taken away in 1959. When the Reserve Bank was established the Commonwealth Bank became just another bank. Which was the first bank that would go in there and start kicking to death pensioners with the fees and charges on pensioner accounts? It was the Commonwealth Bank. Yet people used to say to the Labor Party, 'Gee, I tell you what, you should find several billion dollars to buy it back and bring it into public ownership.' Why? That is a bit off. the subject, but it is not a bad issue. I am of warming up to the task. We were talking about the six pillars policy. I did want to say one or two things about that. Today's press, for example, was quite interesting. Both the Australian Financial Review and the Sydney Morning Herald talked about this $130 billion deal that is fuelling a bank revolution. They are talking about America's Citicorp anq Travelers Group getting together in one of the world's most significant mergers and the implications that might have in Australia;Â· I know that the member for Wannon's attention would have already been drawn to the editorial in the Australian Financial Review about that issue. It highlights some of the things I have been saying about the numbers of banks and whether policies on both sides of this place should be maintained in keeping a six pillars policy in place. I heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer a little earlier on this subject. He is right. The Australian Labor Party's policy at the present moment is that the six pillars policy should be adhered to. Mr Hawker-You don't agree?",60
90,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"You agree. Mr Hawker-No, you s-d you don't. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Qrosio)-Order! If you have any remarks, you will make them through the chair.",64
91,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"I understand, Madam Deputy Speaker. But he is all right. He is one of the few on that side who is all right. We have worked quite well together on finance issues over a long period. The question is, though, whether or not that as a policy into the future will not require reconsideration. When you see what is happening around the world with mergers, within Australia, for example, National Australia Bank has been one of the great advocates for allowing Australian banks to merge to make it stronger to take on the rest of the world. Successive governments have refused that opportunity. Indeed, the present Treasurer has said that that is not part of what the present government would allow. He has even qualisort fied whether or not a foreign bank could buy into one of the majors in this country as well. However, Don Argus from the National Australia Bank, a great advocate for allowing such acquisitions to take place, clearly sees some benefit. Being frustrated, as NAB is, they have decided to challenge the world anyway. They have recently acquired a second major US mortgage organisation and are expanding into the rest of the world on their own. It was interesting to read some of the recent financial press that suggested now that Argus and NAB are going down that particular road they do not need to look at some second-string bank like Westpac, which they once had their eye on. I do not think Westpac would be too happy to be described in those terms, but I think you get the general drift of what I am trying to say. Policy in financial services and policy in banking changes as time moves on. The world is a global village. With the revolution and technology that has occurred, it allows financial transactions to move right around Australia and the world in a split second. To think, then, that the sorts of systems that we have in Australia and had back in the 1930s and 1940s are going to be applicable as we go into the next millennium is just nonsense. Governments have the responsibility of keeping under review the way in which the financial system is structured in this country. The present government carried out a review that I have referred to already. The legislation we are debating is a product of that review. I think it is timely. I think it is worthy of support. I think it is worthy of rapid passage through this place. But I say again: this should not be the end of it. Any government must keep the financial system under review always with the idea that it should be sound, that it should be well managed and that consumers are getting benefits from it. If those criteria are not met, then it needs to be changed. (Time expired)",64
92,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"I must admit that I was very interested in listening to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is, as he has pointed out on several occasions, a member of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, which I now chair. It is a committee which, under his chairmanship, did do a lot of very valuable work. However, I did think he was a little less than generous in some of his compliments to the government for the work they have done in initiating the Wallis inquiry and then taking up the recommendations and moving forward. These are very significant changes coming about because of this legislation that we are debating here today. It has come about because of an initiative of the current government. So I think he could have been a little more charitable in giving credit where credit is due for what has been put forward. I also felt, listening to him speak, in comparison to the previous speaker from the opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), that it is fairly clear who understands banking and who does not. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), in his casting around in desperation to revitalise that front bench, because he seems to have such difficulty with the Jurassic Park element these days, clearly ought to promote the member for Cunningham. I think he certainly could do the job of shadow Treasurer. Mr Martin-Hear, hear!",65
93,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"I am glad to see that he actually agrees with me too. I also found it rather. interesting-and maybe it is slightly confusing-when he started talking about the six pillars policy that the Labor party is adhering to because, certainly in the earlier part of his speech, it was quite clear that he does not agree with it. I thought that was quite contradictory to what the shadow Treasurer was saying. He did try to qualify it later, but you could see that his heart was not in the latter part of his speech when he said that. That shows that there is some dissension in the ranks. No doubt the member for Cunningham really is looking to be lumped with the group over here-the young and restless. I think you can just still make it, Steve. You could join the young and restless and really start to push the oldies off the other end of the bench. We must also recognise that when it comes to introducing these changes to the way the financial system is to be regulated it is being done in a way where the government can show it is actually yielding results now. If we were to make a simple contrast with what happened when the previous government started some of the moves to deregulate, what did we see happening in Australia? What was one of the results of this? It was that the financial system had some difficulties and interest rates went up. I emphasise that. Under the Labor government, when they started to deregulate, interest rates went up. What a contrast. This government has made the move with this inquiry. The confidence of that has been engendered in the whole financial system and has seen interest rates come down. That speaks volumes about the approach of the current government compared with the previous government. There is no doubt that the vast majority of Australians would be grateful for the way this government has approached it and for the results it is already achieving. Clearly, there will continue to be results as we move down this path of further change to financial regulation. I would also like to compliment the member for Cunningham in bringing forward the importance of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration. He clearly understands all about it. Unfortunately, the shadow Treasurer does not seem to have even heard about it. All he wanted to do was talk about one little aspect of what might be happening in regional Australia. That was only one of over 100 submissions that have come before the committee talking about ways and means of providing alternative banking systems for regional Australia, particularly for smaller centres. The reference that the committee has today is directly taken from the Wallis report-recommendation 96-that government should examine alternative means of providing low cost transaction services. That is something that we will be following up. I think the committee is doing some extremely good work and will come up with a very good report. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) said in his second. reading speech, this is landmark legislation. It is a very significant part of the reform of the Australian financial sector. It certainly.does follow from an excellent report that was put together by the Wallis committee. I would like to pay tribute to the work that they put into producing an excellent report in fairly short time--{)ne that is certainers ly forward looking and lone that will put Australia at the forefront of financial services not only in the region but also right throughout the world. It is designed to improve the efficiency and the competitiveness of the Australian financial system while at the same time preserving its integrity, its security and its fairness. It will mean that Australia will have a stronger regulatory regime and will be better able to respond to developments in the finance sector-including globalisation and technological change and the needs of both businesses and individuals. I will come back to that point a bit later on. I would also like to follow up on the move the government is now promoting, which I think all members of the parliament would support, that not only should Australia be one of the world leaders in best practiq- in financial services but also we should look towards Australia becoming one of the great financial centres of the world along with Tokyo, New York and London.",65
94,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Hear, hear!",66
95,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"I thank the Prime Minister for his interjection there. It is also very significant to note that, in the approach to changing the financial regulation, there were three fundamental objectives for the government. The first was the maintenance of financial stability, including a safe and reliable payment system. That is something that all of us expect. While there has been some discussion already about the question of what sort of security deposit takers really do expect, the current Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Graeme Thompson, who is to take over as the prudential regulator, has pointed out that if a bank's fund management subsidiary were to be hit by major losses-I am talking about subsidiaries of banks rather than the major banks themselves-it should be realised that the presumption must be that a bank will not necessarily provide support. That is an important point being clarified by this legislation so that that will be understood. The second goal is the provision of specialised regulation of conduct, 'of disclosure and dispute resolution for financial service providand for the financial markets. As the Treasurer pointed out, this is a very significant part. The third objective is the prudential supervision of those parts of the financial system which require more intense regulation for safety and stability reasons.",66

97,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall your statement in this parliament last week that you would support Patricks to the hilt provided they acted within the law? Will you guarantee that no money will be paid to Patricks to bankroll their dismissals should those dismissals be found to be in breach of the legally binding awards and agreements or your Workplace Relations Act?",67
98,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"My government will behave within the law, as always, on any matter. Let me say that these events on the waterfront are a defining moment in Australia's industrial relations history. events on the Australian waterfront will send a very clear message to the people of Australia that, at long last, we have a government that is prepared to stand up for the interests of Australian jobs, prepared to stand up for the interests of Australian exporters, prepared to say to those men and women in business in Australia",67

107,Mrs JOHNSTON,Unknown,"My question is - dÂ­ dressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to recent developments relating to the waterfront. Prime Minister, would you infonn the House what benefits to the These Australian economy will come from such developments?",67
108,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I say in reply to the honourable member that waterfront refonn will boost jobs, will boost investment and will boost exports for all Australians. The current inefficiency on the Australian waterfront has damaged Australia's reputation in the world. Australia could move 25 containers an hour like New Zealand but we are stuck at a rate of 18 versus a rate of 30 an hour in the nations of the Asia-Pacific region. We are not dealing here with the battlers of the Australian work force. We are dealing here with a group of people who, by any measure, are extremely well paid. They are a group of people who are the industrial relations elite and the circumstances in which they now find themselves are a direct result of their own irresponsible conduct because for years and years people have tried and governments have tried to deliver a more competitive and a more productive waterfront. The Labor Party, bound to the MUA, have stood in the way of that. Instead of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party saying to the members of the Maritime Union of Australia, 'Why don't you behave responsibly? Why don't you get rid of your stupid, antiproductive, anti-competitive work practices,' you have actually encouraged them along a path of conduct that has not only been against the interests of the Australian community but has also been against their own interests. You are dealing here with people who earn, on average, $74,000 a year and as high as $110,000 and $120,000 a year. I am very proud to say that the actions that have been taken to fix the waterfront are a direct result of the changes to the law made by my government. I am very proud of the changes and-I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business on the absolutely outstanding job he has done to reform Australia's old-fashioned, out-of-date, arthritic industrial relations system. The Maritime Union of Australia is the most special of special interest groups. It is a special interest group to which the Leader of the Opposition has again pledged his total, undying support. The Leader of the Opposition and John Coombs are the inseparable twins of the trade union movement in Australia. Whenever the Leader of the Opposition asks me a question the Australian people will know that he is the dummy of John Coombs of the Maritime Union of Australia. Kim Beazley is the mouthpiece of John Coombs.",67

111,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"You talk about taxpayers' money. The former government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member, spent over $170 million of taxpayers' money out of $430 million that was spent under the WIRA arrangements. Wharfies' rorts are legend in this country. Today represents a fight back by the people of Australia. Today represents a defining moment in Australia's industrial relations history. Today is the time when the ordinary exporters, the ordinary job seekers and the <;>rdinary investors of Australia have at long last, as a result of the action of my government, the courage of the National Farmers Federation and the courage of Patricks, been given a fair go and an opportunity for a more productive and a more competitive future. Waterfront",68
112,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that your Workplace Relations Act requires that no employee be sacked because he or she is a union member and that any employer proposing to sack more than 15 employees must advise the CES before doing so? Are you also aware that the stevedoring industry award requires any employer to notify their employees and their union of any definite decision that is likely to have a significant effect on employees, including termination of employment, and obliges the employer to discuss such changes before they come into effect? Can you advise the House what steps you took to satisfy yourself that these provisions had been complied with before you supported Patricks' s decision to dismiss 1,400 workers not because they were excess to requirements but to replace them with another work force?",68
113,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Let me just tell the member for Canberra again what happens. Governments changeÂ· laws, citizens and corporations take advantage of them. I am completely satisfied with the law that we brought in. It is a wonderful law and it is a law",68

116,Mr KERR,Unknown,"--,-But you have changed the law.",68
117,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I warn the member for Denison. The member for Canberra has the call. Mr MCMullan-My point of order is on the question of relevance: what we are concerned about is whether this company has obeyed the law-your law-and whether you checked whether they had done so before you said that you supported them, which obviously you did not.",68
118,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member has made his point of order. The Prime Minister is addressing the question.,68
119,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,We have changed the law. The changes we have made are beneficial to the Australian community. I have always supported the right of Australian companies to take action in accordance with the law and if you have a problem about the law then you try to change it when you are next in government. National Industrial Action: Trade Practices Act,68
120,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. I refer the minister to statements from an official of the Australian Workers Union that the AWU will conduct a strike in the oil industry in support of the Maritime Union of Australia. Minister, would you inform the House what the government's response to such threats is?",69
121,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The government's response to such threats is the law which was passed with the support of the Senate-and with the support of Cheryl Kernot, a leading member of the Labor Party. We support the Trade Practices Act and the full implementation of it. But for the Trade Practices Act a lot of these union leaders who have been making threats in the past would have actually carried out those threats. Whose policy is it to repeal the Trade Practices Act and give a free rein to industrial thuggery? It is none other than the Labor Party weakly doing as they are told by the ACTU. The A WU made their threats last week and the response from the union movement was very telling indeed. Within 24 hours of the threat of national industrial action by the AWU even the ACTU itself was counselling the AWU not to take national industrial action. Why was that? It was because we, with your opposition, passed the very strong secondary boycott and primary boycott prohibitions in the Trade Practices Act. It is true that a few building workers have walked off the site today but, quite frankly, they walk off the site most weeks.",69
122,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,69
123,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The members of the opposition will remain silent.,69
124,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Also revealing were the first comments from the ACTU as reported on the electronic media this morning. They came from Mr Combet, the Assistant Secretary in charge of this issue for the ACTU. His first comment was that the dispute will not spread. The second comment came from Jennie George this morning, also on radio, and she assured the Australian public that consumers would not be affected by industrial action. The reason for that, again, is that we have the Trade Practices Act provisions which were passed into federal law-opposed by the Labor Party; to be repealed by the Labor Party if they are ever re-elected. Those laws are strong and effective. There is no basis for anybody to be taking further industrial action. There is no justification for further industrial action. As the Supreme Court judge said very early in this dispute, the damage that occurred at the hands of the MUA was alarming and unjustified. And so it is. Further action would be unjustified. From the government's perspective we have legal teams in place. We are determined to see significant reform on the Australian waterfront. We are determined to see this matter through. Waterfront",69
125,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can you confirm that last night the employees of Patrick Stevedoring in Townsville were sacked en masse with your support? As the port of Townsville, like Australia's other bulk ports, operates broadly at world's best practice levels, has virtually quadrupled its throughput since 1991 and has not had a strike for years, what justification do you have for sacking these individual workers? Mr Speaker-The member will ask a question and not expand on it.",69
126,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I've sacked them? Opposition members-You! You! You!,69
127,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Members of the opposition will be silent.,69
128,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"For the benefit of the member who asked me this question, let us patiently take him through it. The law was changed to make it possible in Australia at long last, after years of frustration and years of failure by the former government, after years of weakness and stupidity from the former government and after years of wasting the taxpayers' money, for non-union labour to be used on the Australian waterfront. If there is a group of people who are responsible for the situation in which the unionists now find themselves today it is they themselves who are to blame. It is they themselves who rejected, year after year, reasonable overtures. It is they themselves who have brought this situation upon themselves.",69

131,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The members of the MUA have been running a systematic campaign to break Patrick, and you know it. They have been running it for weeks and months.

The Leader of the Opposition and others can ask as many questions as they choose. Mr Crean-We will.",71
152,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Very good! Nothing will alter the fact that the members of the MUA have created their own predicament. That has not been generated by anybody else. Their own conduct is the reason why they are in the situation that they are at present.

162,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Members of this House do know that the Treasurer has wide responsibilities. However, I point out to the Treasurer that the responsibilities for this specifically lie with the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business and I would suggest that he identify his responsibility in the question and nobody else's.",71
163,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Certainly, Mr Speaker, and just to inform you and also the member, as Treasurer I am responsible for the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, including the secondary boycott provisions, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, responsible for enforcing secondary boycott provisions. The secondary boycott provisions were first introduced into the Trade Practices Act in 1974 by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Hon. John Howard. That was some 25 years ago when the then Fraser government was leading in the area of competition, and it was not until the late 1980s and 1990s, during the dark years of the Hawke government, that the provisions were actually taken out of the Trade Practices Act. One of the great achievements of this government was to put back into the act the provisions preventing secondary boycotts, and I want to pay credit to the minister for industrial relations, Mr Reith, who presided over the amendments that brought back those important reformsMr Reith-The Howard law.",71
164,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"That brought back the Howard law of all those years ago. He couldn't do it on his own, could he? He would be the first to acknowledge that he was assisted in that task by Mrs Cheryl Kernot, of the Labor Party, in bringing back those secondary boycott provisions. We would like to thank Mrs Cheryl Kernot for the services that she has provided in bringing those secondary boycott provisions back. A secondary boycott provision provides that no person can extend a dispute between the primary employer and employee into other industries. The Trade Practices Act is monitored by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, for which the Treasurer is responsible, and it has a watching brief over the waterfront industrial situation at the moment, including any activities which could be taken to extend this dispute into other industries. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission warned the Australian Workers Union last week, in response to threats to shut down Australia's oil industry in support of the maritime union, that it would be taking action if the A WU breached the act. Fines for breaching the secondary boycott provisions of the act are $750,000, and in addition a person in breach of the act can also be responsible for damages. In 1995 the Industry Commission, in its report The growth and revenue implications of Hilmer and related reforms, estimated that benchmarking Australian ports to Australian best practice would generate an increase in GDP of about $1 billion. That report was in fact welcomed by some of the thinkers in the parliament. When the Industry Commission report came down assessing the benefits of competition policy and saying, inter alia, that it would add $1 billion to GOP in Australia, it was warmly welcomed by none other than the member for Werriwa. The member for Werriwa, the thinker of the Labor Party, got up in the adjournment debate on that very report and said this: I am the strongest possible advocate of the introduction of competition policies throughout the Australian economy. You can therefore imagine my pleasure this morning to read in the Australian findings of the draft Industry Commission report on the benefits of the introduction of Hilmer reforms. So the thinker of the Labor Party endorsed the benefits of competition which will come about as a result of getting improved performance on the waterfront. The Centre for International Economics in 1995 estimated that a 10 per cent increase in productivity of the sea transport services sector would increase real GDP by about $1 billion. Wouldn't that be a great thing for the country? One of the great things about reforming the ports and wharves in this country, about increasing competition, will be adding to national wealth, adding to job creation, adding to exports, adding to the opportunity to get foreign debt under control and adding to the improvements in the Australian economy. The government congratulates those who have taken steps to achieve best practice on the waterfront. Back in 1991 the then minister for-I do not know what he was minister for- Mr Beazley was boasting about the need for waterfront reform.",72
165,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Employment.,72
166,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. It has become a habit of the government not to refer to people properly in this place, and I would ask you to act to deal with this at this stage of the game.",72
167,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In that instance I think he was referring to a previous incarnation, but I draw the Treasurer's attention to the requirement that he call members by their right titles. Mi"" COSTELLO-The current Leader of the Opposition, I think then the employment minister, said this: If we can change industrial relations on the walerfront, it ain't too hard for you to get rid of feral pigs. Back to the feral pigs, old son-the waterfront has been fixed. That is what he said in 1992. In 1992 the waterfront had not been fixed. The waterfront will be fixed as a result of this government's action, and that will be in Australia's interests. Waterfront",72
168,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Isn't it a fact that at the the overwhelming majority of the 17 ports where Patrick Stevedoring workers were sacked last night there has been no recent industrial action? What evidence do you have to support your claim that workers in ports such as Burnie, Townsville, Darwin, Port Kembla, Newcastle, Cairns, Mackay and Bell Bay have engaged in persistent industrial thuggery? Prime Minister, who is next?",72
169,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The member who has just asked the question knows as well as I do that the members of the MUA have embarked upon a systematic campaign to send the company Patricks into bankruptcy and insolvency. They have embarked upon a systematic campaign, and anybody with eyes to see or ears to listen or a mind to comprehend will have lIeen a pattern of disruptive, negative, destructive conduct over the past few months. I have to say to the rank and file of the MUA that you have been badly let down by your union leadership. The union bosses of Australia have once again sold out the interest the rank and file members of the trade union movement. But even worse than that is that the conspiracy along that destructive path between the leadership of the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party has also sold out the interests of working men and women. Once again the men and women, the ordinary trade unionists of Australia",73
170,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"When the House is silent, I will call the member for Melbourne on a point of order. Mr Tanner-Thanks, Mr Speaker. Once again I asked a specific question about workers in Burnie and Darwin and Townsville and Port Kembla and Bell Bay and Mackay and various other places. The Prime Minister is not answering the question.",73
171,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Melbourne has made his point of order. He will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is entirely relevant.,73
172,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"There has been a clear pattern of conduct by the members of the MUA, orchestrated by the leadership of the union, inspired and encouraged at a political level by a Labor Party that cannot break itself free from the shackles of its trade union past. I have to say to those opposite that we are now living in the 1990s. We are living in an era in which the men and women of this country want decent, competitive, productive conditions. We are living in an era when our exporters want the opportunity to compete effectively against the rest of the world. We are living in an era when we want thousands more jobs created by having lively, competitive, productive industries. What is now occurring, this historic change which is now occurring on the Australian waterfront, is good news for future jobs in this country, it is good news for exports and it is good news for the international economic reputation of Australia. The only people for whom it is bad news are the union bosses who failed their members and the members of the Labor Party who are chained hand and foot to the union bosses of Australia.",73

174,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Leader of the Oppoof sition will stop his casual comments across the table. They are not appropria-e. Waterfront  the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. What effect will threats of industrial action against Australia by the International Transport Federation, operating out of London, have on the government's resolve to reform the waterfront in this country? What is the government's response to such industrial thuggery?",73
175,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The government will not put up with thuggery by industrial trade union leaders making threats from London against Australia. We will not put up with the threats of industrial thuggery from union leaders outside this country attempting to dictate to the duly elected government of the day. We have a legal team in place, the legal team has been in place in London now for some time, and we are in a position to see legal action taken both in Australia and internationally to counteract any attempt by the ITF to crystallise the threats that they have been making. I do understand the concerns of shipping companies in respect of the threats by the ITF. For that reason, I have had discussions with a number of shipping companies this morning on this issue. We have offered to those companies the legal advice that we have available to us and we put them in contact with the government's legal advisers. We have also made it very clear to those companies that, in conjunction with those companies, or separately or otherwise, we are prepared to take legal action if there is any crystallisation of those threats by the ITF against companies which are carrying on their lawful business in trading with Australia. I pleased to say that a number of those companies that I have spoken to have - ontracts with Patrick, and I have been told thIS morning by shipping companies that they intend to continue their commercial relationship with Patrick, and they should know and understand that this government is absolutely determined to take this opportunity for reform. We will stick by those shipping companies to ensure that the reform opportunity for this country grasped. It is also worth noting that, whilst the ITF make threats about companies using both MUA and non-MUA labour in Australia, elsewhere around the world this is commonplace. People are so used to the monopol- of the MUA here that many do not apprecIate that the idea of having MUA or non-MUA labour in Australia is what happens in virtualAdvocate; ly every other country around the world. That is why I think that, whilst we hear many threats coming from the ITF, ultimately it is unsustainable for them to pick out Australia and say that companies should not trade with Australia when those very same companies are going to ports in New Zealand and many other countries within the OECD where there is union or non-MUA labour. Lastly, I make this point: the shadow minister for transport asks, 'What about some of the other ports; for example, Newcastle?' Newcastle is so bad that Patrick recently lost a contract.",73
176,Mr KERR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this is a matter of relevance. This was directed to an international matter but, if it is relevant to raise this, what about Tasmania where there has been an industrial exemption in place for decades where those unions have undertaken",74
177,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member will not argue his case; the memb-r. for penison wi!l resume his seat. The mInIster s answer IS entirely relevant to the question asked.,74
178,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Just some facts. Newcastle is so bad thaf Patrick recently lost a contract to load 300,000 tonnes of aluminium for a Norwegian shipowner after the shipowner repeated complaints about the con?uct of Patrick's workers over a two-year penod. The am fact is that standards in Australian ports are abysmally low, reliability is at appallingl!, low levels and it is one reason why Austraha has a sho-king international reputation when .it comes to the efficiency of our ports. ThIS country has been made a laughing stock by these people running the MUA, supported by the ALP, who like the idea of having a few union bosses able to hold this country to ransom whenever it suits their political ends. is I can assure the Leader of the Opposition those days are over. Employment Advocate: Victoria Police Association",74

Have the Victoria Police Association written to you expressing concern about the actions of the Office of Employment in particular, about advice from the Employment Advocate that t-er wo-ld not ?e entitled to any pay for bmited mdustrIal action such as refusing to issue speeding tickets or to operate speed cameras? Are you aware that this advice has created the situation in which the police association are forced to consider industrial action which may include withdrawal of all police services in Victoria? Isn't this another example of your approach to industrial relations provoking escalation of industrial action?",74
180,Mr REITH,Unknown,"lsn't that interesting? We had four questions from them on the waterfront and now they are off onto an unrelated matter. This is the embarrassment that the Labor Party has had through this whole dispute. So embarrassed have you been, unable to publicly get out there and",74
181,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. He was asked a specific question about the application of his industrial act in relation to the police association Victoria. He is now getting about anything but.",74
182,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Leader of the Oppowharfies sition will resume his place. The minister will address the question put to him.,75
183,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I will do so with real pleasdidn't ure, because section 187AA of the Workplace Relations Act, which the shadow refers to in his question, is one of the very many good things in the Workplace Relations Act. What that section says is that you will not be rewarded for taking industrial action. When this issue arose a couple of weeks in Sydney, the Labor Party condemned the provisions of the act, but when I put out press release noting the fact that it was the same law in New South Wales which had been supported by the Labor Party in New South Wales all of a sudden they went quiet. When it comes to the level of industrial disputes, one of the reasons we have on the Australian waterfront nine times the national average is that, under Labor, if you took industrial action, you could be rewarded for taking that action, and we have placed a on people being rewarded for taking industrial action. What happened in Sydney is also very revealing-it shows you the strength of these provisions-because when this matter first came to a head the wharfies said, 'Oh well, we'll take'Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I asked a question with Police Association of Victoria, which has not been referred to yet. In all the time that the minister has been responding, he has not referred to that matter at all.",75
184,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister needs to respond to the question put to him.,75
185,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Yes, I will. The proposition being put to me is that there is a threat of industrial action because of section 187 AA. Mr MCMullan-Have you got the letter?",75
186,Mr REITH,Unknown,I do not know if I have the Provinces letter or not. I have not read it. Mr MCMullan-I will give you a copy. Mr Crean-Table it.,75
187,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Yes, you can send it around into me, thanks very much. As a postie, you up and talking might do better. The point I am making is that, when the went back to work after their first seven-day strike, did they continue with their overtime ban? No, they did not. And why they? Because they wanted to be paid. They wanted to be paid-and section 187AA minister was very effective indeed.",75
188,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. This is completely absurd. He has not yet mentioned, in about a ago four-minute answer, one word about the Police Association. He says that he does not a know about it, so he ought to sit down.",75
189,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The question was framed with a narrow bar, but it also had a broad context. The minister is in response and he is quite relevant in that general context.",75
190,Mr REITH,Unknown,"To conclude my answer, the point I am making-which is a difficult point for the Labor Party to understand-is that there are a lot of unions that will make threats ban of industrial action. But what you need to have in place is effective laws. And 187 AA has shown to be a very effective discouragement for those unions wanting to take industrial action-very effective in dealing with the wharfies, and just as effective in dealing with anybody else who wants to take industrial action. Under our laws, they will not be regard to the rewarded for doing so. Mr MCMullan-I seek leave to table a letter from the Police Association to the minister, dated 2 April. Leave not granted. NA",75

204,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Deputy Prime Minister will answer the question put to him. Could I have a little silence in the House before I again call the Deputy Prime,76
205,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I accept to your guidance. I think we should look at some comparative costings with regard to the of containers. Let us look at the lqading of timber logs, as one particular example. In Australia it costs $5.60 a tonne, with a nine-day ship turnaround. Compare with New Zealand at $2.20 a tonne, with a four-day ship turnaround. So, if you just take that one example with regard to the timber industry, the Australian cost structure more than twice that of New Zealand. But take the crane rates. I welcome the South African delegation in the gallery. I know that they are trying to open up the Maputo Corridor and the Mozambique outlets. I congratulate them on that because, in fact, Port of Mozambique is performing at a better crane rate-25 containers an hourthan the average of the ports of Australia. We have a huge task ahead to get it right on the waterfront. That we seek to do that is the interests of the workers of Australia, the standard of living of the workers of Australia and the export performance of Australia. Professor Blainey wrote many years Australia suffers from a tyranny of distance. Our exporters are particularly chalby the fact that they are deep in the Southern Hemisphere and a lot of our competitors are in the Northern Hemisphere. The very least we can provide for them is best international practice, with regard to microeconomic reform and the waterfront. So let us give our job creating exporters a fair go. Let us give our export containers efficient cost-reduced passage through our ports-and the sooner, the better, for the sake they will do it of all Australians. Taxation",76
206,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,Will the Treasurer confirm that the 'other than incidental' clause in the government's proposed new tax treatment of franking credits- ,76
207,Unknown,Unknown,Opposition members interjecting,76
208,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Could the members of the front-bench of the opposition remain silent so that we can the question? Could I ask the honourable member to ask his question again? I have not been able to hear it. Could you ask the question again?,77
209,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"Certainly. Mr Speaker, will the Treasurer confirm that the 'other than incidental' clause in the government's proposed new tax treatment of franking credits will trigger part 4A of the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act when the stakeholders in Telstra sell their shares, following the conversion of those shares to ordinary shares? What action will the government take to ensure that those many Australians who own Telstra shares, but who may not be aware that they will be exposed to the new anti-avoidance provisions when they divest themselves of shares, are made aware of this new proposal?",77
210,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The measures which were announced in the 1997 budget relating to dividend streaming were designed to ensure that a party would not be entitled to take the benefit of imputation credits unless they bore some of the risk. One of the measures that was put in place to ensure that you bore some of the risk was a requirement that you hold for 45 days or, alternatively to that, part 4A was amended to apply to such transactions. Part 4A in its application to the rules in relation to dividend streaming says that it can be struck down by part 4A in the event that one of its purposes was to get the advantage and that was other than an incidental purpose. The test is an objective test which would require the courts to look at all of the conduct. Those people who were holding the shares as part of either a strategy of increasing the capital vallie of the share as part of hedging or who had a normative purpose-including the millions of mothers and fathers in Australia who had bought them-would not I expect be caught by that test in any sense at all, because they would only be caught if it could be shown that they had come into take advantage of dividend streaming and were not interested in a proper investment either for other purposes such as capital increase, or for other purposes such as hedging. In those circumstances I believe that there is no real risk under the amendments to part 4A to those millions of Australians who have invested in the Telstra shares. Certainly, it is not the objective of the changes to part 4A to bring them into that net. I can give them and the member for Curtin an assurance that the application of the law will not affect the holding of what I consider to be a very good investment. Waterfront",77
211,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister please inform the House how the state of Australia's waterfront efficiency affects Australia's image within the region as a reliable international trading partner?,77
212,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question and recognise his concern for Australia being successful in the so-called globalised economy. Globalisation is a theme of the member for Werriwa's well known book which was launched today by the Leader of the Opposition. There is no doubt that Australia's notorious reputation for an inefficient waterfront is internationally known and understood, and is an international embarrassment for Australia. Quite frankly, our waterfront performance is a standing joke in countries such as New Zealand and China. If anybody ever wanted any evidence for this proposition, they only have to look at the Far Eastern Economic Review editorial of 19 February 1998. Mr Crean-What about all the editorials on Parer?",77
213,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"It may be well worth the opposition listening to this, because this is a reference to the opposition as well as it is to Australia as a whole. The editorial states: In the past few years Australian officials have been fond oftalking of Australia joining Asia. That proposition by the Far Eastern Economic Review is indeed very true. But the editorial went on to say: It is becoming more clear thatÂ· thisÂ· might first depend on having their dock workers become part of the 20th century. The article went on to say: Certainly the MUA appears to come from a different era. Mr Speaker, if you ever wanted to know what .the world thinks of Australia's waterfront, then that illustration from the Far Eastern Economic Review is a very good one. The House would be well aware that the comparisons between Australian ports and ports around our region and the world are most unflattering. A recent international comparison showed that the port of Laem Chabang in Thailand turns around about 30 containers an hour; Hong Kong, 25 to 30; Singapore, 25 to 30; Auckland, 25; and by comparison Sydney can only manage 18 containers an hour and Melbourne 18Yz containers an hour. I would have thought that any self-respecting member of this parliament would be very concerned about that, would want to see that productivity improve and not try to defend the status quo. In a recent survey of 18 international ports Sydney was ranked last, that is 18th, in reliability, 18th in turnaround speed and 17th out of 18 in terms of value for money. I am sorry to have to concede the point that my own home town's Port of Adelaide was rated 18th out of 18 in terms of worse value for money. There may be some people in the Labor Party who regard that as acceptable. They spent 13 years in government. They talked about waterfront reform, but they did not do it. Our record is still a bad record and it is embarrassing to our international reputation. I will come back to what is admittedly one of the smaller incidents of the day, the launch of the member for Werrlwa's book. How nice of him to turn up just as I mentioned his book. Having finished answering questions at the press club, he now turns up to the parliament. I think it is probably what Laurie Oakes meant when he talked about you being absent without leave. The member for Werriwa talks in his book about globalisation. What he says about globalisation is absolutely right. It is all trying to bring the Labor Party into the latter part of the 20th century. One of the points he makes in his book which is worth reflecting on is this: This is not the time or place for the preservation of sacred cows. He may be alone on that side of the House in holding that view, but at least he understands the point about globalisation, international efficiency and modernising Australia, even if the dinosaurs here have no understanding at all.

214,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer agree that, unless banking, insurance and similar financial services are not merely exempt from GST, as is usual elsewhere, but also zero rated, substantial additional costs will still have to be passed onto consumers if the banks and insurance companies are to cover the costs of GST paid on their inputs? Will you commit the government to zero rating GST in its application to banking, insurance and financial services? Mr Wilton interjecting",78

I am rather amazed that the Australian Labor Party stands so squarely against tax reform and modernised taxMr Crean-But not yours.",78
218,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Oh, no; they are in favour of tax reform, they are just against every proposal which would accomplish it.

224,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I did not use the word 'fraud'. Let me talk about a modem taxation system. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on the point of order. My point to you was his use of 'fraudulent' not 'fraud'.",79

226,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Hotham will resume his seat if he wants to stay in this place. You may ask properly if words to which you take offence and have been used against you should be withdrawn. Mr Bevis-On a point of order,79
227,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am responding, if the member for Brisbane has two seconds to spare. As far as the Treasurer is concerned, he has said he did not use the word 'fraud'. I gather now you say that he said you were fraudulent. Is that correct? Mr Crean-Which is what I said in the first place.",79
228,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Did the Treasurer say you were fraudulent?,79

239,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, are you aware of repeated approaches that have been made to your office, going back to August of 1996, from Lt Col. Harry Smith, retired, who was the officer who commanded D Company 6 RAR at the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966? Why have you not investigated Colonel Smith's allegations that his recommendations for Military Cross awards for two of his platoon commanders in that battle were destroyed and that they were given a lesser award, one that was also handed out to the postal clerk at Vung Tau? Why did you refuse to investigate these matters before closing the End of War List for the Vietnam War, and will you now give the House an undertaking that these issues will be fully investigated and that the Australian soldiers who clearly displayed gallant and distinguished service in action at the Battle of Long Tan will be properly recognised?",80
240,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The member for Brisbane upon should be aware, before I call the minister,' that particular questions of that sort are normally asked to be put on notice.",80

Â·ould your advice, Mr Speaker, and ask that the question be placed on notice. I would pleased to come back with a fulsome answer. I note that, in all the years that they were government-13 years-there was absolutely hinders them. nothing done about the End of War List at all. We have had the good grace to fulfil our promise and announce that list. I simply not tolerate the sort of nonsense that comes out of the opposition in trying to pretend they are now concerned when they obviously were not for 13 years.",80
242,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. She was asked a specific question about this action. They did nothing about the end of war lists for seven years in government",80
243,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. There is no point of order. Waterfront Reform Mr mCKS-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Minister, could you please inform the House of the importance of waterfront reform to all the farmers of Australia, including those in the Riverina?",80
244,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say at the outset that it is interesting that with all those champions of the bush over there who run around saying that they are the answer to all the problems of the bush, they have not asked a question in relation to waterfront reform and its importance to the rural sector. Where are the member for Burke and the member for Hunter, let alone the cockies' friend, the member for Hotham? There are about 120,000 farmers in Australia and about 20,000 of them could provide enough food and fibre to look after all Australians' needs. The other 100,000 rely exports for their livelihoods and so do hundreds of thousands of people in the processing sectors, the value adding sectors that spring from agriculture. They are amongst the world's most efficient, by anybody's standards-and we are all very proud of them. But those first-world performers in those industake tries are outrageously held back by thirdworld performance on the waterfront. That is be what happens. Farmers face international competition and, to win, they would like a in waterfront sector that helps them win, not We recently had a National Farmers Federation study which showed that a 25 per cent will fall in the cost of shifting goods-and it needs to be remembered that we have about that double the costs of our competitors-across the Australian waterfront would improve the prices of rural produce in Australia by one per cent. That, in tum, would improve farm business profit by 27 per cent. Our multibillion dollar meat exports, for example, are containerised. Millions could be saved and put back into the pockets of farmers if we could get decent waterfront reform. Our dairy industry alone provides 100,000 jobs. We know .about these champions of the workers over there. With these hundreds of thousands of jobs built on exports-we have 36 per cent of Asia's dairy market-we are involved in a fight to the death with our competitors from countries like New Zealand and America where they are reforming and .continuing to cut costs on their waterfronts. You have heard the Deputy Prime Minister talk about the fact that it costs vastly more move timber across our ports than it does in America's ports. I have been asked by citrus importers in Indonesia why it is-and this is very interesting-that it takes nine days for them to import citrus from America and 16 days to import citrus from Australia. And that is in an industry we would like to see succeed on export markets. Apparently, you do not and neither do your mates in the MUA. What is the attitude of our waterfront mates in relation to this? A few modest reforms from these highly privileged elitists could improve farmers' incomes dramatically. How do they respond? I will tell you, Mr Speaker, how they respond: they claim that they are better than they used to be. They refer to history in this country. But that is utterly irrelevant for a trading nation like Australia. Historical comparisons about where they were five, six, seven or eight years ago are utterly irrelevant. What matters is how we stack up against out competitors. We are an exporting country. That is where our jobs and our prosperity lie and where our future must be secured. We are about securing those jobs, those living standards and that future; you and your mates plainly are about exporting them.",80
245,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"To restore the balance, as I called two Opposition members consecutively, I now call the honourable member for Corangamite. Waterfront",81
246,Mr MCARTHUR,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, would you advise the House whether there have been any statements by the ACTU about developments on the waterfront, and what is the government's response to these statements?",81
247,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The President of the ACTU has made some remarks this morning. What I think is interesting is that we have yet to hear from the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty. Mr Kelty is basically the one who runs the ACTU. These others are just the fronts for the ACTU but the remarks by the President of the ACTU this morning portrayed their concern about breaching the to Trade Practices Act-and they are right to be concerned about the penalties which people can be subject to for breaches of the Trade Practices Act. What she said is, 'We will have a response, but it will be muted; it will be united; and our first priority must be the workers, their families and their children.' The redundancy program which the government announced this morning will ensure that those workers who are made redundant will receive their full entitlements, including superannuation, which can be up to $270,000. Those are very generous redundancy arrangements by any community standard. I heard John Coombs saying this morning that these were miserable payments--over a quarter of a million dollars. Only the head of the wharfies' union could make such a claim. We will ensure that these redundancy entitlements are paid. I make the point that this is an industry wide scheme and these funds will be available for any workers made redundant, whether it be in the associated labour hire companies, those labour hire companies which have had contracts with Patrick's or any employees in any other stevedoring organisations. One of the significant aspects of the developments that we have is the commitment by P&O to the benchmark performance targets set by the government. We expect those objectives to be achieved within a 12to 18month time frame. The figures are interesting. I understand that, roughly, the labour force available to Patrick until now has comprised around 1,400 people. But the number of people who will be working under contracts to provide the same services will be in the order of 400 or 500-a very significant reduction, which shows you the extent of overmanning in the industry. With efficient operations, this industry can be run not only more productively and more reliably but also generally at a lower cost for the users of stevedore services. Prime Minister",81
248,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, didn't the member for Casey resign as Speaker Leader because, despite your promise of an independraised ent Speaker, you broke your word? Didn't the member for Lowe resign because he grew a sick and tired of your broken promises, saying that your promises are not worth the paper they are written on? Hasn't the member for MCPherson resigned because he disagreed with your government's stance on nursing homes, Wik and the stolen generation, all amongst other issues? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise point of order. Each of the propositions advanced by the Leader of the Opposition relies on an attribution of motive to a member on this side, and each of them is beyond the limit of ministerial responsibility under' standing order 142. I ask you to rule the question out of order.",82
249,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is responsible for ministerial arrangements within this place. While the question implies motives, the Prime Minister is responsible the appointment of ministers. Consequently, the question at this stage is still in order.",82
250,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"How many more of your colleagues are going to jump Minister, how many more resignations will it take before you finally get the message that many Australians, including a growing numthe ber of your own supporters, find you a divispursue ive, confrontational Prime Minister and have lost faith in you?",82
251,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Leader of the Oppoto sition needs to be very carefu1. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I faise a point of order. The question clearly has inferences and I ask you to rule it out of order.",82
252,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have considered the question carefully. There is within standing order 144 a number of restraints which the Leader of the Opposition went very carefully around. I am afraid that, while there were areas that I thought may have been questionable, I think the overall purport of the question is clear and within the Prime Minister's responsibility. I therefore call on the Prime Minister.",82
253,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I of course reject the basis of the question that has been asked by the of the Opposition. But, because he has the subject of general political attitudes in Australia, it gives me an opportunity to say few things. The first remark I make is that they left the waterfront by 2.35 this afternoon. They walked off. The waterfront gave themselves a rostered day off at 2.35 this afternoon. I remember reading some of the columns before the parliament resumed. We had of these columns about how they could not wait to get us back to ask us about Dubai. Were they going to ask us difficult questions a about Dubai. Were they really going to put my colleague the minister for workplace relations in the dock on Dubai. Of course, the reality is that they are petrified to pursue the issue of reform on the waterfront. The reason they are petrified to pursue it is that the ordinary men and women of Australia back us on the waterfront. The ordinary men and women of Australia know that the waterfront has been rorted for years. The ordinary men and women of Australia are for fed up with the abusive tactics of the trade union bosses. The ordinary men and women of Australia know that the Leader of the Opposition is bound hand and foot to John ship? Prime Coombs on this issue. As for the Leader of the Opposition talking about division and standards, the Leader of Opposition does not have the courage to somebody himself. He gets his muckraker in the Senate, Robert Ray, to trawl through the sewers. He does not have the guts discipline the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He has been prepared to allow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to invoke and incite racial hatred in this community. He has been unwilling to control that motor'mouth, the apology for a Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who sits behind him. I think the Australian community see the Leader of the Opposition as a weak, wimpish, lap-dog of the trade union movement. Waterfront Reform",82
254,Mr HARDGRAVE,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. We do not believe in the nick on this side of the House. Minister, would you please advise the House whether any taxpayers' funds will be used in reforming the waterfront?",83
255,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The government will be putting in place a scheme where the cost will be borne by in-ustry. This is an interesting contrast to the program introduced by the Labor Party in 1989-92, where a big slice of the funds last time were shelled out by the Labor Party shelling out taxpayers' funds. To add insult to injury, they never got the change in performance, the improved productivity, which was the whole purpose of the exercise in the first place. This scheme being put in place by the government will be at no cost to the taxpayer. Furthermore, the cost of this exercise will be absorbed by the stevedoring companies themselves.",83
256,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The same minister introduced legislation",83
257,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member will raise his point of order.,83
258,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"Yes, I am raising my point of order. He raised the question of the legislation today. He is now dealing with the issues under that legislation.",83
259,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Calwell knows, technically the legislation is not yet on the Notice Paper. But you are right; it has been moved through its first reading to the second reading, and debate has commenced. Provided the minister does not refer specifically to the details within the bill, this sort of answer has traditionally been allowed within our standing orders.",83
260,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I am happy to conclude my answer, because I wanted to make this final point: today has been very revealing. During question time, have there been nine or 10 questions from the opposition on this issue? No, there has not. Why hasn't there? Because they do not have the guts to stand up for the national interest. These people have never had a policy on this issue other than to do what they have been told by the MUA leadership and the ACTU. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",83
261,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business moving forthwith at the completion of this suspension motion and without debate: 'that this House supports the introduction of genuine competition on the waterfront and the right of all employees to join or not to join a union of their choice and the outcomes which will flow from a more efficient, reliable waterfront, including: (1) creating more exports to help reduce Australia's foreign debt and improve job opportunities for the Australian people; (2) creating more jobs in manufacturing; (3) improving the opportunity of small businesses to grow and develop in world markets; (4) improving the safety of all workplaces on the waterfront; and (5) fuelling economic growth which will lead to higher living standards for all Australians.' The fact of the matter is that we said that we would fix the waterfront and we meant it. For years and years this running sore on the waterfront",83
262,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,So what are we doing now?,83
263,Mr REITH,Unknown,"I am moving my motion. You will have your chance when you have understood what I have done. You will have your chance to see whether or not you are prepared to stand in this parliament and vote for genuine reform of the Australian waterfront. All the rhetoric, all the muck-raking-that has all come to an end. . Mr Bob Baldwin interjecting",83
264,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Paterson is not in his place.,84
265,Mr REITH,Unknown,"This afternoon, after I have moved successfully this suspension motion, those opposite will have not a chance to filibuster, not a chance to give us political rhetoric; they will have a simple chance, a simple choice, and that is to indicate to the Australian community whether or not they genuinely support reform of the waterfront or not. They have talked about it. They have fed out the misinformation from the MUA, but today is their opportunity",84
266,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The point of order is this: the gentleman is calling fora debate on this issue, but he has moved a motion which says 'at the completion of this suspension motion and without debate'. Is it legitimate to move a suspension of standing orders to consider a motion that the parliament then cannot debate. Is it appropriate to move a motion that we cannot debate a particular proposition?",84
267,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The contents of any motion, so long as they fall withjn the stand- of order. ing orders, must be heard by this place. It has been moved. We are talking about suspension of standing orders for that purpose. The terms of the motion are not within the chair'sMr Beazley interjecting",84
268,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Does the Leader of the Opposition wish to pursue the matter?Â· I suggest he remain silent. I call the Leader of the House, who is moving his motion.",84
269,Mr REITH,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition had half an hour this morning, and what we are saying to him this afternoon is those opposite have to come in here and either vote for reform or vote against it. I do not think there is any doubt about what they will do: they will vote against it because the MUA require that of them. Mr Bob Baldwin interjecting",84
270,Mr REITH,Unknown,"And what an embarrassment for the Labor Party. It was only back in January when the union leadership-Mr Fitzgibbon- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I may be wrong, because it may be the government's rotational seat",84
271,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,What is your point of order? Mr Fitzgibbon-but I do believe the member for Paterson is out of his place and he continues to interject. I ask you to call him to order.,84
272,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the member for Paterson has been interjecting-and, frankly, there was so much noise I did not hear him-I have already identified to the honourable member he is out of his place. He either resumes his place if he wishes to intervene or remain silent.",84
273,Mr REITH,Unknown,"This is a simple choice for the Labor Party: either they support reform or they do not; either they support the right of people to join or not join a union of their choice or they do not. We will simply put those propositions to this House. I can assure members that we on this side of the House are unequivocally, unambiguously in favour of waterfront reform. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point",84
274,Mr REITH,Unknown,"No matter how many disruptive points of order there are, we intend that motion to be put. Mr MCMullan----Although the motion says that it should be considered without debate, will that mean that if we seek to move an amendment to the",84
275,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is not a point of order. Mr MCMullan-No, it is. Please, Mr Speaker",84
276,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Please put it. You have not raised a point of order yet. Mr MCMullan-Will it mean that, if an amendment is moved to the motion, it cannot be debated either, or will you allow that to be debated?",84
277,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"You can raise that at the appropriate time. That is not a point of order in the middle of the member'sMr MCMullan-Yes, it is. It is about this motion.",84
278,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is not-not to the motion while it is being moved. You can move it at the appropriate time.,85
279,Mr REITH,Unknown,"What we have seen in this parliament in the last week is a Labor Party that have no policy positions-no position on, for example, the fact that small business interest rates have fallen, no position on the great issues of the day facing the country, such as waterfront reform, except to mouth that which has been put to them by the trade union movement and the MUA. Their response has therefore been to run a campaign of smear and gutter politics in substitute for genuine policy positions. It is therefore no surprise that we should see in the Bulletin this morning that Laurie Oakes's latest writings on politics say: Kim Beazley is failing to display strong leadership, and key people are letting him down. If ever there was a classic case of the failure of the Labor Party and 'the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to provide some leadership, it is on this issue of the waterfront and the need for reform. This morning the Leader of the Opposition made an incredible claim in the parliament and I understand also on radio that the levels of productivity in Australia had significantly improved and that basically we did not have a problem. He said that we had crane rates of 24 and 25. I have here the latest publication from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which has a March 1998 issue date-it came out at only the end of Marchand it mentions the five port average crane rates in Australia. For the major container terminals where the vast bulk of the containers go through, this is the performance indicator: in December 1996, 17.1; in March 1997, 18.4; in June 1997, 18.3; in September 1997, 18.3; and, in 1997, 18.5. And he is out there claiming 24 and 25. These are the official figures; they are a national disgrace. I sat down with John Coombs at the end of 1996 and I said to him, 'John, Australia cannot go on having a rate of productivity, a lack of reliability on the Australian waterfront, which puts us behind the rest of the international community.' I sat and spoke with him about the need to improve productivity on the waterfront. And what was his answer? His answer was, 'Don't be provocative.' When you say to John Coombs, 'Why does the Australian waterfront have a level of strike action nine times the national average?' what does he say? He says, 'Don't be provocative.' When you say to him, 'John, there are a whole lot of blokes in Melbourne who drive cranes and who get paid $90,000 a year and, on average, work only 14 hours a week,' what does he say? He says, 'Don't be provocative.' When you say to him, 'John, why can't we do as well as Manila where they do 30 crane lifts an hour? Why can't we do as well as New Zealand where they do 25? Why can't we do as well as Laem Chabang outside Bangkok? Why can't we do as well as Mozambique?' what does he say? He says, 'Don't be provocative.' Who is the little echo who supports him? It is none other than the Leader of the Opposition. When you say to John Coombs, 'Look at Australia compared to international ports,' he says, 'You can't make international comparisons.' So what have we done? We have produced figures which show that the levels of productivity vary greatly in the one port, on the same ship, on the same day. Why do they vary greatly? In the afternoon, you are on ordinary time; in the evening, you are on double time and a half. But the deal on the Australian waterfront is that, when you finish the job, you get to go home and you still get paid for the whole of the shift. So, if the shift requires a couple of hours work but it is a 7V2-hour shift, you get paid for the 7% hours even though for five of them you are sitting at home watching Wednesday night at the movies-all paid for by exporters, by Australian jobs, by Australian businesses trying to compete. This situation has gone on for years and years. The Labor Party turned a blind eye to it. They forked out $430 million-$173 million of taxpayers' money-and now they say, 'Our answer to this problem is that we'll bring back Bob Hawke. We will have a meeting to discuss it.' What do they want to do today? They want more discussion about this. This country has had a gutful of discussion; it is time the waterfront was fixed up. Your January resolution supported genuine competia tion on the waterfront. Today, when this the motion is carried, you have got choice: you either stand up for reform, show some leadership for a change or you deny reform and tie yourself hand and foot to the MUA as you have been all along. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)",85

283,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"Some mothers do have 'em. First, we had Dubai, then the National Farmers Federation training replacemerit workers and now the true story is coming clear, the true story is coming plain: it about sacking 1,400 existing workers of wherever.' Patrick. We have got the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, the member for Flinders, who has pronounced all of these workers en masse to be unproducreplaced. tive, to be worthy of the sack, to be worthy of vilification. He has whipped up public hatred and contempt. He has engaged in a vicious campaign of calumny and vilification against these workers for months and months, full of outrageous lies, abuse and stories have no basis in fact: the wharfies in FremanReith, tie are supposedly knocking off early to a strip show-based on one jocular remark from one person leaving work, joking, saying that they were going to a strip show. Sometion. how, the vilification of wharfies in 1942most of whom, presumably, are long dead-is basis for sacking existing wharfies. This is sort of outrageous stuff that this minister a simple has been going on about. What we saw last night is the stuff of military dictatorships: in the middle of the night, 1,400 people dismissed without warning, without any reference to their performance, their individual activity. The knock on door; they are told, 'Sorry, you're gone.' a What they take with them is Reith's reference. On top of their dismissal, they have got months of calumny, months of vilification that tells the whole world, every prospective employer for these, mostly, 40to 45-year-old men: do not employ these people. So not only are they sacked but they are also put in a position where it would be extremely hard for them to ever get work again-all courtesy of this minister, who is putting his hand on the taxpayers of Australia to fund all of this. This is where the fundamental injustice of this lies: here we have the Liberal Party of the great party of the individual, the great party of Menzies that stands up for the have those 1,400 individuals got any chance at all to defend their performance as an individual worker? Answer: no. They are being treated en bloc, en masse, and are being told by this government, 'You are . all sacked.' They have no chance at all to defend themselves as individuals, no chance to say, 'Here is my performance in Townsis ville, in Burnie, in Bell Bay, in Mackay or These are not redundancies because work is continuing; the job is still there. To call it a redundancy is false. These workers are being As this opposition said from day one: they are being replaced by the NFF, which was not a competitor on the waterfront; it was a training operation for the very purpose for which it is now being used. No doubt we will see this tested in unfair disthat missal proceedings. We now know why Peter the Minister for Workplace Relations go to and Small Business, wants to abolish the unfair dismissal laws: so that he can sack people holus bolus with no threat of retribuThese redundancies are being funded by a new tax-another breach of a promise, just by the by-while Patricks asset strips. So this government are not only supporting Chris Corrigan's action in sacking all of these workers, they are paying him to do it. They are saying, 'We will give you the money. We will tax the taxpayers of Australia-the port users of Australia and the end consumers of Australia-and we will pay you to sack these people not as individuals but as a group.' If you look at it, there are 17 ports where Patricks workers have been sacked, many of them at world's best practice in spite of the nonsense that he carries on about. At many of them there have been no strikes for years. Townsville, for example, has throughput that has quadrupled within five or six years. I challenge the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to go to Townsville, to Mackay, to Burnie and to all the other places and look those workers in the eye and tell them why they have been sacked by this government through taxpayer funded arrangements, why this government says they are engaged in industrial thuggery and why this government says they are unproductive.Â· . All of them have been sacked. They were all waking up this morning wondering what they were going to do about their mortgage, wondering what they were going to tell their spouse and their children, and wondering where they were going to get another job. This is a nasty, vicious government-a malevolent government-and the mask is finally off. The plan all the way along in this exercise has been to sack 1,400 people arbitrarily with no individual consideration of their performance. It is a bring back the dog-collar act: bring back the individual contracts and bring back the master and servant relationship. That is what they believe; that is what they are on about. The mask is now off. There are a lot of workers in this country who are now treading very nervously as a result of the events of last night. Who is next? Who is going to have the government's eye turned to it next and be told, 'You are not productive enough. You are a rorter. You are going to get the axe because we say that you are a rorter.' People are asking themselves, 'How can I collectively bargain? How can I deal with my employer, a large organisation with a lot of money? How can I, as an individual, collectively bargain under this government?' They are asking themselves, 'Can I afford to abandon my insurance? Can I afford to say: yes, unfair dismissal legislation, we do not need that, that is fine?' They are asking themselves, 'How is it that somebody who works in a world's best practice port that has not been on strike for years can be sacked, in effect by this government paying our employer to sack us, for no other reason than that we are members of the Maritime Union of Australia?' Who is next? Construction workers? Flight attendants? Teachers? Train drivers? Everybody is entitled to worry. The rule book has just been thrown out by this government. It is the action of a military dictatorship, not a democratically elected government in a society like Australia. This government says it supports competition, yet in Dampier it supports a monopoly: it supports P&O being thrown out by the state government. And it talks about rorts. We are getting one a week from this government. First we had Senator Woods, then the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) and now there are a couple of unnamed members in sight after the last couple of days. Where is that going to head? These are the great moralists of Australian politics who preached to Australian workers about rorts. There was the man who invented the nick-the man who perfected the nick and who used to lecture waterfront workers. Because he perfected the nick and got caught we now have the honourable member for Flinders as the new minister. He is only there because of what happened to his predecessor. Minister, these are people. These are human beings. These are ordinary workers. You have orchestrated their dismissal for no valid reason with regard to individual performance. This action is already provoking strikes. It is already provoking bitter confrontation, resulting in extra costs for Australian exporters. At the same time that you can find tax money to pay for sacking wharfies you cannot do the same to pay for nursing home funding. You cannot do the same for Australian hospitals but it is okay to breach a promise about taxation in order to sack wharfies. That gives you a really good indication of what this government is really about. This is the outrageous act of a vicious, malignant government. It is the act of a man-the human oil slick-who is chasing hard right-wing votes in a leadership contest and who has to show, at the cost of the jobs and the long-term futures of 1,400 workers and their families, what a hairy chest he has got. He is hurting many innocent people, throwing 1,400 workers onto the street in positions where they may not be able to pay their mortgages. They may lose their houses. Undoubtedly some marriages will break down as a result of this. He is provoking industrial conflict and imposing a new tax on Australian exporters. Irrespective of debates about productivity and regardless of what your view is-and there are numerous views about the productivity of the Australian waterfront-this is not the way. Mr Reith-What's your view?",86
284,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"My view is that you tell a lot of falsehoods in this debate. This is not the way that you deal with these issues in Australia. The right to some job security and the right to bargain collectively in this country are now in tatters as a result of this government's actions. Who is next? Is every Australian worker whom the government deems to be insufficiently productive now susceptible to being sacked arbitrarily? I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""this House deplores the action of the Government in organising the financing of the dismissal of 1,400 Australian workers in breach of the Workplace Relations Act and the relevant award provisions"". This government is sowing the wind and by God it will reap the whirlwind on this issue.",88
285,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Brand-Leader of the Opposition) (3.36 p.m.}--I second the amendment. The government has acted with maximum mendacity on this matter. Over the last 12 months the public of Australia have seen this government walk around saying that they have no involvement with the conspiracy to sack the waterfront work force. They and the employer in this case have gone around uttering assurances. As far as that is concerned, all is revealed today: they were all part of a pattern of government misleading of the Australian population, and all part now of an attack on the security of the Australian work force. Understand this: as far as the workers here are concerned they have been targeted for one reason only-not because they rort, not because they are disruptive, not because they are somehow un-Australian but because they are members of a union. In question time we drew attention to this fact. Workers in areas which have never in recent memory had anything like an industrial dispute are also under the gun and have been fired. Workers who have produced what was in the speech of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) to his legislation acknowledged as world best practice in the movement of bulk cargoes have been sacked. Workers in Townsville who have quadrupled productivity over the course of the last six years and who have contributed to that world best practice have been sacked. Workers in ports such as Burnie and other Tasmanian ports where there has not been industrial disputes in living memory have been sacked. And we have a callous Prime Minister (Mr Howard) standing up here saying, 'Well, they deserve it.' They are Australians who have been productive; Australians whoÂ· have familiesfamilies nowhere near as well off as those on the front-bench opposite, who have been scurrying away from the consequences of one of the greatest rorts of all time in the taxation system in this country, collapsing standards in this place of reportability and accountability. Those opposite are grand-scale rorters standing in judgment of ordinary Australians doing the things that ordinary Australiaris do-ordinary Australians prepared to negotiate on issues related to productivity; ordinary Australians living within the constraints of the workplace act and conforming to the terms of that act. And the frustration of this government, at least in part, represents the frustration they have with their act and the competence of this minister. Nobody looking at this situation objectively can have anything other than utter contempt for the incompetence with which the industrial relations policies of Patrick have been pursued over the course of the last three or four months-mendacious, incompetent, pathetic, and joined in that by the minister here. There is going to be a lot of water flow under the bridge on this but every Australian knows this: when it comes to jobs, when it comes to your personal dignity, when it comes to your opportunity to support your family, this government is not in your comer. When it comes to your sense of security, as you sit down to borrow to pay off your house and other debts, this government does not stand in your comer. When it comes to the opportunity to live the life of an ordinary Australian with some degree of happiness,. comfort and certitude about where you are headed, this government does not stand in your comer. When it comes to demanding of your political process basic decency and honesty, and to be governed by a government indifferent to the consequences of their actions because they are fair minded, then everybody in this country knows that this government is not in their comer. When it comes to the basic decent compassion that people expect of government in this nation everybody in this nation knows that this government is not in their comer. This is a government without a shred of credibility on this. This is a government which invites the Australian people to support a set of actions the like of which has not been Vale, D. S. seen by any Australian government in recent times. This is a government which stands exposed for its basic deceit. As far as its last election promises are concerned, it is a government that should be condemned.

304,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understand the Leader of the Opposition intends to move a dissent from my ruling. I will repeat my ruling: the House, having carried the introductory part of the motion moved by the Leader of the House-that is from 'That so much' down to 'suspension motion and without debate'-it was only necessary for the Leader of the House to move part of the motion that commenced 'That this House' finishing up with 'for all Australians'. Therefore, the motion having just been passed, that motion is carried. Mr Reith-Just before the Leader of the Opposition does that, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",92
305,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Brand-Leader of the Opposition) (4.04 p.m.}--We half welcome to this place the first manifestation of the Reith government; no, sorry, the second manifestation of the Reith government. I move: That Mr Speaker's ruling be dissented from. There is only one particular suspension of standing orders that is acceptable in this place-that is, the motion to suspend standing orders. Then the subsequent motions which are placed before this chamber are motions which are placed before this chamber to with it. There is no provision orders to suspend under certain conditions. There is no provision whatsoever to do that. The only provision that lies there is the basic suspension of standing orders. It would, of course, be possible for the minister to assure himself that the matter could be deliberated upon without debate simply by gagging debate on the subject. But I do find it passing strange that government in these circumstances has decidvariety ed that they do not want debate on that motion. They have said that they are inordiworkers, nately proud of their work here this day, they are inordinately proud of what they have done to ordinary people in this country, they think they have had a terrific outcome far as ordinary people in this country are concerned and that we ought to in this place ered. provide opportunities for one after another to stand up and say why they thought it was such a good idea. One of the cardinal elements of accountaMinister bility in this place is that we should be to debate matters of substantial importance. What this government has wanted us to pass without debate and then foolishly failed to move in the appropriate fashion was that this House support the introduction of genuine competition on the waterfront and so on. Any point here is imminently debateable in this place as to whether the course of action this government has gone down is a course action that this country would prefer or a course of action that this parliament ought approve of. For them to stand in this place and move that a matter should be considered without debate is an absolute abdication of their preparedness to defend themselves in this place. It is of a piece with their indefenworkers sible actions over the last six to nine months when people in this country have been persisgaining; tently and deliberately misled. They think themselves smart on this matter. They think themselves smart that they have no relationship of integrity with the Australian people. They think themselves smart that they can trick Australian people out of their jobs. They think themselves smart that they can approach this issue on this occasion on this deal day with minimal public consideration of in standing . what they are up to. Mr Speaker, you cannot allow a suspension of standing ordets to be used to permit such action to take place-to forbid, as you effectively do, .the capacity to move an amendment to a motion before the House. That is unprecedented-to remove the capacity to move an amendment to a motion before this House; an amendment which, if we had had the capacity the to move it, would have indicated a whole of concerns on our part for the 1,400 workers who have been sacked-the 1,400 many of whom have never been on that strike; many of whom are in ports which have, in the memories of any person in this that House, not been on strike; many of whom as have sat down in successive efforts to improve efficiency on the waterfront, and delivI think of the workers in Townsville, who have quadrupled their productivity over the last four years. According to the Prime (Mr Howard), they are being punable ished-not because they have been regular strikers, not because they have been in confrontation with their employer, not because they have committed acts of inefficiency, not because they have been rorting, but for one reason only: they are members of a union. When this Prime Minister supported the introduction of this Industrial Relations Bill, when the industrial relations minister introof duced his Industrial Relations Bill, when we pointed out that the object of this Industrial to Relations Bill was to deprive workers of freedom of choice, we were told, 'You are talking nonsense. Choice is what we are about; workers can choose to be in unions, or they can reject the option of being in unions; can choose to collectively bargain, or they can reject the option of collective barworkers can choose to be protected by awards and an enterprise bargaining process, ot they can choose to have individual agreements. All their rightsÂ· are protected. Australians love freedom. Australians love an opportunity to have a choice. That is all we stand for.' Then calumny is heaped on the union movement, calumny is heaped on those who want to collectively bargain; nevertheless, they have that choice. What has been revealed today is that there is no choice. The choice exists only in so far as the government are prepared to permit it, and no further. If they choose that you do not have the right to collectively bargain, if they choose that you do not have the right to exercise freedom of association, if theyMr Truss- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition is moving a dissent from your ruling. In his contribution to the debate, he is discussing the question of the previous resolution before the House. He really must confine his remarks to areas where the ruling is inappropriate.",92
306,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition is ranging. fairly wide, but I think he has licence to do so in the present circumstances. Mr BEAZLEYI thank the Speaker for that ruling. What I was, in fact, referring and I thank you for your licence in this regard, Mr SPEAKER - was the amendment that I was unable to move because of the set of circumstances from which we are dissenting. The reason why I would be moving that amendment, were we to have the chance, would be the failure of the minister to move his motion in the appropriate form, having been given permission by the parliament to do so, correctly interpreted by yourself, and therefore providing us with the opportunity to do that. As I was saying before being interrupted-and as would have been covered in the amendment that we would have moved, had your ruling permitted us to do so-those workers have had their capacity of freedom of association ripped away from them. The Prime Minister stands in this place and thumbs his nose at these ordinary working Australians and says, 'You're being punished for the activities of somebody else; well, serves you right.' What sort of community operates on that basis? What sort of community allows freedom of association to be ripped away by the whim of a Prime Minister? What security is there for anyone? When you look at a dictatorship created, what you see is a step by step process by which your rights and freedoms are ripped away from you. The things that have made a particular nation, with democratic practice at the heart and core of its culture, are ripped away from you. That is what happens, and that is precisely what has happened in this instance-they have been absolutely ripped away from them. Mr Ross Cameron-What about compelling people to join a union?",94
307,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The member who is interjecting on me talks of compulsion and competition. This motion which we have debated talks about competition. What competition, my friend, is being permitted at Dampier? There has been an action at that great exporting port of Dampier-a far more significant exporting port than Adelaide, a far more significant exporting port than Brisbane. What has happened at that port? P&O have been deprived of their rights to operate in that toport. A monopoly has been established on one basis and one basis only: that those who agree to be participants in the work force of that monopoly do not join a union. That is the basis on which that proposition has been involved. Because the workers of P&O exercised their right to join a union, to collectively bargain, not only were they removed from the waterfront-so was P&O. This is not a small incident, old son. This happens to be a major issue. This happens to be what this government is supposed to be talking about in relation to competition. P&O said, 'Okay, we've lost the contract. Can we come on and compete? Can we come onto the Dampier waterfront and compete with this non-union operation that has been put in in place of us?' No. And does this government support it? Yes. This government, which is supposedly about competition, says, 'Bully for you, Western Australian government;- get on with it.' This is the freedom of association that you support. This is the freedom for ordinary, individual Australians exercising their conscience that you have supported. That is what you have associated yourself with in this regard. It is very much to your detriment that you have done so. It speaks ill of you that you have chosen to do so. There is a much more complicated picture around the Australian waterfront than that which is being portrayed here. When you look at the operations of Patricks and compare them with the operations of P&O-because this motion here talks about competition-you find various things. There is a competent operation here in Australia being operated by a company that knows basically how to do things, not a company that enjoys good relations all the time with its work force but which actually knows how to operate. Then there is another operation being operated by somebody with no experience of management of anything other than a cash box. The consequence of that is incompetence in management on that waterfront. We have had resignations from supervisory personnel associated with that company pointing out that the lack of productivity is as much a problem of management as it is a problem of that work force. That work force is to be sacked as far as this particular company is concerned. That work force is to take the blame for their incompetence. That work force is to be fired and replaced. That is what is going to happen as far as they are concerned. This parliament does not have a chance to debate that matter because this parliament had a motion before it which said that a matter would be put forthwith without debate. But, when that motion was actually moved, it was moved in mistaken form by the smart alec associated with it. There is a situation as far as this country concerned now where workers' rights are threatened, Australian rights are threatened, and this parliament is precluded from debating the principle motion before it. There is a piece of legislation before this parliament, but after I spoke to it no further discussion could take place upon it. There is now another motion before this House-this particular proposition-and the parliament is denied deliberation on this motion. It was denied deliberation on this motion and would have been denied deliberation on this motion within standing orders if the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) had bothered to move his motion in the correct form, which should have read: That this House without debate supports the introduction . . . And so on. That is the correct form in which it should have been moved if it was to be protected from the operations of the standing orders. That was what that smart alec Leader of the House should have done, because at the end of the day the Speaker is in a situation where he has to make a very quick interpretation of what actually happens in this place. If the Speaker was well served by his Leader of the House, on this occasion what the Leader of the House would have done was this: he would have moved his motion 'that this House supports without debate the introduction' and so on of what he called genuine competition. He failed to do that and he let his Speaker down when he moved in that way. The consequence of letting his Speaker down when he moved in that way was to put this parliament in a situation where we now have to deliberate on a dissent motion in relation to the Speaker's ruling. It is necessary to deal with that dissent motion in relation to the Speaker's ruling because what we are confronting here is an action which Australians must contemplate. There has been so much deceit in the presentation of this issue in this place. Part of that deceit has gone, for example, to the alleged cost of stevedoring operations as far as the waterfront is concerned. We had the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderis son) standing up here and stating the enormous burden that is imposed upon rural imports. The cost of stevedoring charges for a kilo of beef is about 1IAc. That is the cost of stevedoring charges on a kilo of beef. There was a time when the farmers had genuinely legitimate claims against people on the waterfront. The relationships between the farming community and those on the waterfront were utterly poisonous. The hard working farmers of this nation were being massively frustrated. That was one of the reasons why, when we took up the Howard-Fraser mess on the waterfront-the massively overmamied waterfront with the horrendous work practices across the board-that had sat there for years with a cheerio show from the Liberal Party just letting it pass through, we firstly went to bulk cargo. We ,went to the bulk of goods that moved across that waterfront; two-thirds of the goods that moved across that waterfront. We went to them. What did we say? We said, 'Fix it.' And they fixed it. They produced world best practice, sufficient world best practice for the minister to be able to stand at the dispatch box earlier today and say, unattributed, 'We do not have to make provision for sacking any workers involved with bulk cargo'-although I think there is a question mark over that, quite frankly- 'because we have world best practice.' It was just a slight sentence that passed. cy. He just dismissed as irrelevant two-thirds of what goes on on the Australian waterfront with the words, 'That is world best practice.' Two-thirds of what passes across the Australian waterfront goes with world best practice. Then we have the situation which is being dealt with here. What is going on in Patrick at the moment-or at least until last nightwas an enterprise bargaining process. ",94
308,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The honourable member for Shortland also points out that what was going on in Patrick was asset stripping. That was also going on as far as Patrick was concerned. What was also going on, apart from asset stripping by the management, was an enterprise bargaining process which has been available and which has already produced a 40 per cent improvement in productivity on the waterfront-a 40 per cent improvement on productivity on t-e waterfront. There is more needed fo t be done. Who admitted that more needed to be done? Those workers on the waterfront as well as management. Who was prepared to discuss better productivity? Those workers on the waterfront with management. What were they doing with Patrick? They were discussing productivity change with Patrick. What Patrick did not want to do was to arrive at a conclusion. Patrick have not been motivated by any outcome other than the destruction of the union. That has been the only outcome. A product of destruction of the union is the destruction' of ordinary Australians' rightsordinary Australians' rights which we fought two world wars to have held in place. Do not kid yourself that that was not an issue in those two conflicts. What we valued in this country above all was that we were different. What we valued in this country above all was that Jack was as good as his master. Part of Jack being as good as his master is that Jack had freedom of choice. Jack was able to take a decision about whether or not he wanted to bargain with his master as an individual or bargain with his master with his friends. That is what we had in this country and we were proud of it. We saw it as central to democraI remember when I was first elected to this place that both sides of the House were standing with Solidarity in Poland, and both sides of this House were waving banners for ILO conventions on freedom of association. Both sides of this House were booting the Soviets right up the bracket for their Communist dictatorship suppression of workers' rights. But somewhere, along the way to the forum, the other side of the House got mugged. Somewhere along the way to the forum, the standards that they used to uphold in criticism of totalitarian regimes were stuck in the back pocket. They stuck them in the back pocket here today with the legislation they have introduced in this place, and the motivation that they have associated with their resolutions. Because of the Speaker's incorrect ruling in not upholding our point of order on that, dictated by the failure of the Leader of the House to move his motion appropriately and to include the words 'that this House supports without debate the introduction', and so on, we have not had the opportunity to point these things out. We have not had the opportunity that a parliament ought to have to deliberate on these things. It does no harm to this parliament to be able to deliberate on these matters. In fact, it is essential that we do. Unless this relevant dissent motion is carried, we simply will not have that opportunity.",96
309,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the motion seconded?,97
310,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"Canberra) (4.24 p.m.}I second the motion. I will not take the full time, because I will have an opportunity to speak on the MPI, which the government has assured us we will still have. This dissent goes to the very purpose of why we assemble here in the parliament. It is about accountability. It seems to be absolutely clear that you cannot lose your right to debate in this House without a substantive resolution. You cannot lose your right to debate just caught up in a resolution about suspension of standing orders. The resolution before us has three action points in it. The first is about the suspension of standing orders. The second is about the substantive motion. The third is that that substantive motion should be discussed without debate. We could have dealt with it in two resolutions-one to suspend and one to say, 'Without debate we should consider the following resolution.' But we cannot in one resolution both suspend the standing orders and take away from the whole of the House-but effectively from this side of the House, and from the Independents who wanted to raise points of order-the right to debate a very fundamental issue. What an issue it is. It goes to the very liberties of the citizens. The parliament and freedom of speech is at its core for the defence of the liberties of the citizens. What a motion we had today, relating to the liberties of, at the moment, 1,400 Australian citizens. But, in terms of principle, it relates to nine million Australian citizens who work as employees in this country. All of them have their rights at stake in the nature of the debate we are having, or sought to have. If we had been able to move an amendment to this resolution, we would have been able to debate it. Had the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) been able to move an amendment, we could have addressed this resolution, and we would have been able to talk about the conditions under which we would have been prepared to consider such a resolution. We would have been able to consider issues of whether the workers being sacked was in accordance with the law, whether it was lawful; it needs to be in accordance with the awards and the agreements which employers have entered into. We would have wanted to say something about the alternative routes by which a decent government would go about seeking to achieve the purposes of waterfront reform. This debate in this parliament is not about whether the waterfront ought to be more efficient. It is a debate about whether, in the pursuit of the false goal of waterfront reform by smashing the MUA, we ought be able to take away the protections and securities which ordinary Australian workers have when they go to work. When they go to work they think that, if they have not done anything wrong, at the end of the day they should still have a job. They came into work-they were working-and got sacked. It did not have anything to do with the individual activities of those workers. The individual performance of those 1,400 people was not assessed. Nobody said, 'Well, sir, you have not done a very good job.' They got rid of the lot. Why? Mr Corrigan made it very clear: because they were members of the MUA, and he could not get the agreement he wanted. It is true that some of those people had been on strike. My distinct recollection of the its law passed by this parliament is that workers actually have a right to do that. I have always thought that in Australia it is a right we expect people to have and that they can do it in accordance with the proper law. There is no argument even by the government that the strikes that had taken place were lawful. But what we have here is a whole lot Â·of people who were not involved in those strikes. They were just members of the same union whose members thousands of miles away-in a different port, but with the same employerwent on strike about their enterprise agreement. Of course, we have one port in Australia where the employer signed the enterprise agreement. That was the port of Melbourne. There is an interesting debate about why that was the only place that was signed. It will be debated on another occasion. That agreement said 'no compulsory redundancies'. It was signed, and we did not get a chance to talk about that today because of the nature of this ruling. Not only is it a very worrying principle we can have the right of members to debate issues taken away without substantive resolution but we also have had it on a question that goes very clearly to the liberties of the citizens and to the circumstance of 1,400 Australian families in the lead-up to Easter. Sydney, the kids will say, 'Can we go to the Royal Easter Show, Dad?' Dad says, 'No, I'm sorry; I haven't got a job.' 'Are we going to go away on school holidays, Dad; there are two weeks school holidays coming up?' 'No, we can't; Dad's just lost his job.' But we cannot talk about it in here. What a happy Easter that is for the 1,400 Australian families who are affected by the matters that we have been dealing with today! It is not the attitude that most Australians think should take us into the Easter break. It is not the way in which most Australians think we should deal with Easter. It is not the way most Australians think we should deal with the rights of Australians; and your ruling, Mr Speaker, is not the way I believe we should deal with the rights of members in this place to speak up on behalf of .their constituents.",97
311,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs) (4.30 p.m.)Mr Speaker, the government will support you in your ruling. It is absolutely indisputably a correct ruling and it should be upheld by this House, by all people of honour in this place. On occasions, Mr Speaker, you are called upon to exercise great wisdom in interpreting standing orders when you are challenged, often in a very unruly mariner, in relation to the rulings that you have made. Sometimes those decisions can be difficult, sometimes maybe even open to interpretation, but in this case I would submit that your ruling was simple, it was easy to make and it was utterly an- absolutely correct. The Speaker's ruling in this instance upheld the specific decision of the House. You were left with no discretion. The House decided that this particular matter would not be debated and you upheld the decision that the House made. In that regard, your decision was absolutely correct. It might be that this procedure was a little unusual in that the House that would decide, in discussing a suspension motion, that the matter that would be dealt with after the suspension would not be the subject of debate. That might be unusual but it was certainly within the capacity of the House to make that decision-and it did so. In It made the decision completely and appropriately. Once that decision was made, your ruling was absolutely correct to uphold the decision of the House and to proceed immediately with the vote on the motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Reith). It is not as though the decision that the House made was one to deny debate on this issQe. There have been plenty of opportunities for debate. In fact, there is to be a matter of public importance to follow which will provide the opposition with yet another opportunity to contribute on this particular issue. The day began with an opportunity that was given by the House this morning to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) at 9.30 when the bills were introduced to speak to the House. We provided that opportunity. We could have easily allowed the normal procedures to follow; in other words, the debate be adjourned immediately and the Leader of the Opposition and other opposition members who wished to speak have that opportunity when the second reading debate came before the House. We did not adopt that normal procedure. We granted indulgence to the Leader of the Opposition to give him an immediate opportunity to reply. Then we came to question time today, a time when the opposition normally have 10 questions to put to the House on matters of concern to them. Did they take that opportuni- . ty then to raise 10 matters in relation to the waterfront? No. It was such a low priority in their own mind that they ran out of steam after only four waterfront questions, and then they went on to other subjects, which clearly demonstrated that their own priorities in that regard were not so high. So there was plenty of opportunity. Then came the motion of quite some substance, and I think importance, moved by the Leader of the House. Even on that occasion the opposition were given their chances to reply-and they got more than the opportunity that might normally be available during the suspension debate because they actually moved their amendment. They provided to the House the information of what was going to be proposed in their amendment and the House dealt with that amendment in the process of dealing with the motion calling for the suspension of standing orders. So there has been plenty of opportunity provided to the opposition and there will be plenty of opportunity provided in the future for them to address this sort of issue. The Speaker inÂ· his ruling that the decision of the House should be upheld made the only possible decision that he could make in those circumstances-and the government will certainly be supporting the Speaker in his ruling. The reality is that the opposition are raising this matter to hide their embarrassment about having just voted in this House against waterfront reform. They ought to be ashamed of having taken this action, trying to vote down the motion-they voted against it-seeking to introduce genuine competition on the waterfront. The motion that was voted on called for genuine competition on the waterfront. Members opposite, members of the Labor Party, voted in this House just a short time ago against genuine reform on the waterfront. They want the rorts to continue, they want the overmanning to continue, they want the inefficiencies to continue and they want the national embarrassment on our waterfronts to continue. They are against reform. The next part of the question that they voted against was the right of employees to join or not join a union. Is the honourable member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan) actually saying that he voted against a motion acknowledging the right of employees to join a union or not join a union? I think it needs to go on the public record-the people of Australia need to know-that the opposition voted against a motion which gives people the right to join a union or not join a union. Then the motion went on to refer to the outcomes which would flow from a more efficient and reliable waterfront. The member for Canberra, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the opposition spokesman for industry, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), voted against a whole series of measures which would in fact demonstrate the benefits of an efficient and reliable waterfront. Is the member for Hotham going to go home to his constituents and explain to them why he voted against reforms to create more exports, to help reduce Australia's foreign debt, to improve job opportunities for the Australian people? The members of the Labor Party have just finished voting against those worthy objectives. They have also voted against creating more jobs in manufacturing. How is the member for Hotham going to explain to his industry constituency why he voted against more jobs in manufacturing? They also voted against improving the opportunities for small business to grow and develop in world markets. The opposition do not like small business. They have always been against small business. The only thing they do for small business is tum big businesses into small businesses because of their antiindustry policy. They voted against it. They also voted against measures to improve the safety of all workplaces on the waterfront. They are against safety on the waterfront. What an extraordinary decision from the opposition! Finally, they voted against fuelling economic growth which will lead to higher living standards for all Australians. This is the resolution that the honourable member for Hotham, the honourable member for Canberra and the honourable member for Burke have voted against. Is it any wonder that the opposition are embarrassed? Is it any wonder that the opposition are seeking to dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker, to try to distract attention from their own actions in voting against reform on the waterfront? All Australians want to see a more efficient and safer waterfront, except members opposite. All Australians want to create more exports. They want to create more jobs in manufacturing. They want to see small business more profitable. They want to see improved safety on the waterfront. They want to see economic growth. All Australians want that; but the members of the Labor Party voted against it. Is it any wonder that they are ashamed? Is it any wonder that they are trying to distract attention? They want a waterfront, it seems, that is mocked by the rest of the world. They want to see a waterfront that remains at a level where it is less productive even than places like Manila, Mozambique and New Zealand. They want Australia to remain an international laughing stock. It seems as though the opposition have lost themselves in the mire of these issues, where they could do nothing. They spent $400 million, but achieved nothing in making our waterfront an effective place to work. This House has just voted to support the introduction of genuine competition on the waterfront. It supported the right of employees to join or not join a union. It supported a more efficient and reliable waterfront. It has voted to support that. But it was not a unanimous vote. There was one group of dinosaurs who decided that they would vote against these important matters of reform-members opposite. I have not had the privilege of reading in great detail the book by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). But I think I can be absolutely certain that his book would not have advocated the sorts of policies that were voted against by his colleagues today. In his book, I am sure he would not advocate propositions which would reduce jobs in manufacturing, which would help increase AQstralia's foreign debt, land which would help make small businesses' life more difficult. Yet he, with hi""s colleagues today, has in fact voted against the Â·various principles that he espoused at the National Press Club only a short time ago and which were supported by the Leader of the Opposition. Their memories are short. They can write books and persuade the gullible public to spend their money on buying the books. But when it comes to actually implementing what is in the books, their attitude is totally different. Of course, in this particular situation the shame of the opposition will reverberate around the country as it becomes clear that they are standing hand in hand with those who would keep our waterfront inefficient. I wonder quite often, when the member for Canberra and others come into this place and speak in defence of the sorts of practices that have been going on at the waterfront, what they say to the people in the factories, the farms and the industries of Australia who have been struggling hard over a long time to improve their own efficiency. They have endured some pain and hardship to make the industry of Australia more efficient, to have the best farms and the best mines in the world, only to have all of their efforts undermined by the inefficiencies and the rorts on the waterfront, by the overmanning and by the excessive costs of getting things out of our country. This is a country with a relatively small population that is utterly dependent upon exports if it is to have world-class industry , world-class production and the sorts of costs of production that you achieve through international scale industry. Clearly we can achieve those benefits only if we have an efficient waterfront. That is why the actions of this government in finally taking the sword to many of these unacceptable practices are so commended by the people of Australia. That is why this action is so supported by Australians right from west. to east, by all people who believe in a more productive Australia, by all those workers in factories, in the mines and on the farms of Australia who have done their bit, who have made their own contributions towards building a more productive country. They expectthe same from the people who are earning $80,000, $90,000 or $100,000 on the waterfront. I should not use the term 'earning'-being paid that amount of money to occupy space on the wharves and hold our exports to ransom. These sorts of things are unacceptable practices. But they are the sorts of things that have just been supported by the opposition. So they hide their shame by seeking to question your perfectly correct ruling on this matter, Mr Speaker. The reality is that your ruling is absolutely Bartlett, K. 1. correct. You have upheld the specific decision of this House. The ruling is correct. The decision was made by this House in a democratic way and you, as the upholder of the decisions of this House, have acted perfectly correctly in your ruling. Mr Speaker, I commend you on having ruled absolutely correctly on this issue. The opposition are merely Filing, P. A. creating a smokescreen by trying to dissent from this particular ruling. They have had their opportunities. They will have plenty more opportunities to discuss these sorts of issues. I commend you on your ruling. The government will be supporting you. I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Original question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.49 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Rt Hon.

QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Taxation",98
312,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I wish to add to an answer that I gave the honourable member for Curtin during question time today which was in relation to anti-avoidance provisions applying to franking credit trading. The anti-avoidance provisions applying to franking credit trading are separate general anti-avoidance provisions in the franking credit trading and dividend streaming draft legislation. The franking credit trading dividend streaming anti-avoidance rule relates to a tax benefit obtained by other than incidental purposes, as I mentioned. Part 4A, which is a separate part, relies on a sole or dominant purpose for the tax benefit. The proposed new anti-avoidance provisions in the franking credit trading dividend streamobjection ing draft legislation will not be triggered merely because a person has acquired or disposed of either Telstra instalment receipts or, upon their conversion, Telstra shares. It will be triggered, as I said earlier, only if there are unusual circumstances accompanying the relevant transactions which demonstrate artificiality or contrivance in commercial features or which appear to stultify the real purpose of share ownership. I thank the House for that opportunity. NA",101
313,Mr ROCHER,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",102
314,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,102
315,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,Yes.,102
316,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Please proceed.,102
317,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"This morning I was sent a facsimile of an article published in the Prosh newspaper which is distributed by members of the University of Western Australia campus in the run-up to their Prosh week next week. The article is headed 'Useless Alan Rocher out fQr ,the count'.",102
318,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member needs to show where he has been misrepresented!,102
319,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,It is peppered with remarks such as 'the most pathetic politician since Federation'Mr Melharn interjecting,102
320,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"Hear me out, please. It said that I had 'lost"" the plot upon hearing cannot contest the next election for the seat of Curtin as a Liberal'. The author went on to say that I am a useless pile of excrement, but he---or she-did not use the word 'excrement'. I think the word used is an Anglo Saxon word of four letters. He goes on to say 'all he talks about is tax'. It is peppered with these lines, but I will not bore you with all of them. He does cast reflections on my French heritage when he says, 'Alan Rocher, he sounds like a gourmet chocolate.' So far, so good-subtle, constructive, considerate political comment! I have no to that. But then the author had the effrontery to write, 'He probably can't even play cricket.' Enough is enough; we can only stand so much! I scored my first century in senior cricket at the age of 16. I have trophies-admittedly unpolished-at home for w-nning batting averages for my clubs. I scored 67 as an opening batsman for the Flotation Cricket Club in the grand final of the West Coast of Tasmania cricket competition in 1957, and paved the way for victory. I play for parliamentary XIs. I secured the wicket of Ross Edwards, an international Australian, with the first ball I ever bowled to him. I had Keith Stackpole dropped at the MCG off the first ball, by Ray Groom-and I will never forgive him.",102
321,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think the honourable member's prowess is well and truly established.,102
322,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"If the author of that unforgivable accusation has a skerrick of decency about him, he will publish an unqualified retraction. Might I say that I also extend my best wishes to the students of the University of Western Australia for a successful Prosh next week and thank them for the great support they give to Western Australian charities. NA Presiding Officers Information Technology Advisory Group",102
323,Mr MARTYN EVANS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, as you will be aware, there is a committee known as the Presiding Officers Information Technology Advisory Group---or POITAG for he short. That committee has performed a valuable bipartisan role over the years to ensure that the IT facilities provided to the parliament are relevant to members' needs. Unfortunately, the committee has met on only two or three occasions during the current parliament and has been unable to play any effective role, even though substantial changes are now taking place in the parliamentary computing environment. Will you now assess this matter and ensure that the committee is able to play an effective role in the near future?",102
324,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The field in which that committee inquires is of critical importance in this place, particularly with the concerns we all have about the millennium bug. In those circumstances, having met not only with the honourable member but also with the honourable member for Menzies, I have suggested we might have a meeting in the first week of the budget session, hopefully with the deputy speakers and me, to see how we can best progress the deliberations of the committee. I commend the honourable gentlemen and others who are members of that committee for the work they are undertaking on behalf of us all. Conduct in the House",103
325,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I have a question to you, Mr Speaker. Without the matter being taken offence to by any member from the other side, today you asked me to withdraw the word 'fraud' when I used it. On 12 March 1998, while you were in the chair, the Treasurer said, 'He is'-referring to the Leader of the Opposition-'nothing but a fraud.' If it is appropriate for you to draw attention to your concern when we say it without it being raised from the other side of the House, why is it Â·not also appropriate to draw attention to it when they say it?",103
326,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is appropriate for both sides of the House to observe standing order 153 and I draw all members' attention to the context of that particular standing order. Frankly, in the hubbub of this place, there are often words that are said that one does not pick up. I believe that members should not use expressions which in any way are critical of the character or conduct of other persons in this place. Certainly, when I hear such words, it would be my intention as far as possible to stop members doing so. Mr Rocher- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is becoming increasingly the practice-and I ask for your guidance-for members in this place to ask you for advisorial readings. I seem to recall that, except on odd occasions recently, that has never been the case. I wonder, if that burden is to be heaped on you, whether you might not like to review the precedents that have occurred in this place.",103
327,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Curtin is, of course, correct. The Speaker is only required to answer on matters relating to. matters of administration and certainly as far as questions under 144 to ministers are concerned. The Speaker cannot be asked for legal opinions. Today I have accepted the questions. Conduct in the House",103
328,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"This question relates to yesterday in this House. The debate got a bit willing but when I came in here on the suspension of standing orders, just after the dinner break, in the middle of the debate the Hansard records the member for Paterson, Mr Bob Baldwin, saying of me, 'You've got the political morals of an alley cat.' The Deputy Speaker, Mr Nehl, was in the chair at the time-and this is recorded at page 1879 of Hansard-and the Deputy Speaker in fact warned the member for Paterson. I immediately asked for those words to be withdrawn and for there to be an apology. You might recall, because the member for Swan is in the House at the moment, that he had to come into the place and apologise for using similar words. I have raised this with the Deputy Speaker but I am drawing it to your attention because it has not come back to me. I persisted with this but my time was running out and I needed to get some points on the record. The Deputy Speaker at the time said that he could not hear because of the noise but that he had warned the member for Paterson and that that was the only action he intended to take at that moment. My question has been to the Deputy Speaker that, having regard to the record, does he intend, or through you, to require the member for Paterson to withdraw that statement about me, because it is on the record and the record will demonstrate that I asked for it to be withdrawn at the first available opportunity?",103
329,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"While I, like you, do not accept that the words were particularly appropriate it does so happen that I turned to Hansard and noted that on 26 May 1983, on 8 December 1983 and on 28 August 1995 the person who was the previous Prime Minister used exactly those words about people who were in the then opposition. Having said that, I do not approve of the words used and had I been here I would certainly have required the member to withdraw them at the time. If the words are not required to be withdrawn at the time there is no procedure available to me other than for me to ask the honourable member, who is not now present in the chamber, to take note of the request from the honourable member and if he so desires he can come in and apologise. I understand there are two or three other questions of a similar character still before the parliament.",104
330,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order, you made the point about a withdrawal not being required. It was required at the time and the member for Hotham did ask. So this is a situation that is even further enhanced the request",104
331,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I point out to the honourable member for Banks that, as I understand it, the Deputy Speaker said that he did not hear the words and, as a result, I have put the appropriate solution to the House. In the absence of the member concerned there is no other course available to me. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: there have been many occasions on which the Speaker has not heard the words, and I accept that. But on every occasion that I am aware of where the member against whom they have been directed has asked for them to be withdrawn the Speaker of the time has always said, 'I did not hear the words but I would ask the member to withdraw.' That did not happen on this occasion. That is what I am also trying to draw to your attention. The Hansard record is clear on what was said, and my request was not pursued.",104
332,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out that past Speakers have not done as the honourable member has just suggested. I have a quote from 28 August 1995, on page 583 of the Hansard, where the former Prime Minister, having used those words, said: So what? For someone with the morals of an alley cat ... The then Speaker said: The Prime Minister might just withdraw that comment. The former Prime Minister then said: I will withdraw it to emphasise the 'So what?' comment ... I suggest that there has been a solution proposed. I have suggested to the House that the honourable member for Paterson, if he so wishes, may come into this House and withdraw those words. It is up to him to do so. Conduct in the House",104
333,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,In the adjournment debate last night you would recall that the member for O'Connor failed to unconditionally withdraw a physical threat against me.,104
334,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"This is not a question to by me. If you wish to pursue matters you do so at the time. The matter has to be processed at the time. I will hear you briefly but the ques-, tion at the moment is not within the standing orders. Mr Truss- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It is inappropriate for members of the opposition to use this occasion of questions to you to canvass matters that happened in the past and to argue points of procedure. This period is to ask you questions about matters within your administrative responsibility and I do not believe it is appropriate to keep canvassing rulings endlessly, time and time again, as the opposition have been doing during this period.",104
335,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister is totally correct. There is no responsibility on me to answer but I am trying hard to ensure that members at least have some opportunity. I suggest the member for Grayndler specifically addresses a question within my responsibility.,104
336,Mr ALBANESE,Unknown,"Page 476 of House Representatives Practice indicates that offensive words will be withdrawn unconditionally. You will recall that last night I said: I think this is an eminently reasonable request, which is that the member for O'Connor withdraw the threat unconditionally. You responded: The member for O'Connor withdrew his remarks. My question to you is this: given that the The member for Werriwa was forced to leave the House just two minutes earlier under section collected 304A for nonnal interjections, will you that in future such physical threats across chamber are withdrawn unconditionally?",105
337,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think the honourable member understands that there is fairly robust debate in this place from time to time. honourable member for O'Connor did withother draw the remark and I take it as such. Electorate Offices: Internet Access  related to the question raised by the honourable member for Bonython. As you are aware, members have Internet access in their offices at Parliament House. However, when they return to their electorate offices, in the they cannot respond to the e-mail messages that frequently hit their computers. You, for one, Mr Speaker, have encouraged the use technology in this place but our inability reply-to almost rudely fail to respond-to these messages leaves us very poorly placed. Those who have Internet access in their electorate offices have a receive facility which makes it doubly frustrating. Could review the present situation-and I understand that cost is part of the problem-and advise 1997. the House and members when relief from this situation may be available?",105
338,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I share the honourable gentleman's concern. It is one of the tions I thought I might raise at the committee of which the honourable member for Bonython is a member when we meet in that first week. I take on board the question will see what can be done. Like you, I feel is unacceptable that we do not have an outward connection through Internet. of TRAVELLING ALLOWANCE AUDIT",105
339,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I present a report from KPMG, the internal auditor of the Department of the House of Representatives, on that finn's audit of members' travelling allowances for the period 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1997. The report follows a progress report relating to the 1995-96 period tabled by Speaker Halverson on 18 November 1997. The auditor has concluded: overwhelming majority of travelling allowance records are fully supported by independently travel records of flight information, car ensure hire, taxi hire and fuel purchases. the Twenty-two thousand, two hundred and eighteen travelling allowance records for members and former members were matched against travel records held by the former The Department of Administrative Services and travel records. As part of this process, members and former members have been approached by the auditors not because of perceived errors in their claims but pursuant a way to the nonnal audit process. As at 3 April 1998, 22,205 records or 99.9 per cent were reconciled, leaving 13 outstanding. These remaining records were unable to be reconciled because information was not main available from a member and former members. Two hundred. and eighteen travelling allowance records or 0.98 percent were found of to be in error, of which 168 were overpayto ments and 50 were underpayments. It is currently anticipated that net recoveries arising from the audit will total $20,825. This amount represents 0.62 per cent of total only, expenditure on travel allowances by the you Department of the House of Representatives for the two years 1 July 1995 to 30 June The outcome of the audit confirms the overall integrity of members and the Department of House of Representatives in the quesprocessing of travel entitlements.

342,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the PAPERS House for discussion, namely: The mass sackings on Australia's waterfront. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",106
343,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"Melbourne) (5.13 p.m.)elaborate pretence which has been built up around waterfront policy by this government over the past few months has finally, night, been stripped away: the clear purpose of the government's policy all along has been to engineer the mass sackings of the 1,400 or so workers who were employed until last night by Patrick Stevedores. The months of lies, evasions and deceptions and the months of Peter Reith, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, standing up in this place and saying, 'We do not know anything about this; we support competition, the Enviwe support reform, but we do not know anything about this,' are now stripped away. We now see the government's position, their actions, their strategy, their orchestration of all this very clearly, nakedly before us. The pattern has been thus: consultancies to tune of $1.3 million funded by the Australian taxpayer have been kept secret in spite of Senate resolutions and freedom of information action-consultancies that set forward the strategy for the government to go about sacking 1,400 Australian workers who were simply doing their jobs. Tied up with this a was, first, the mad Dubai escapade where we had serving Australian soldiers being taken to the Middle East with the involvement of a foreign government to be trained to take the jobs of Australian workers who were not on strike, who were not breaking the law, who were going about their lawful business. That, last night, is precisely what happened. . Most of the people who were in Dubai have now been further trained and taken on board by the NFF and are now in the process of replacing the workers who have been sacked. Precisely what Dubai was about is now coming to pass. Stage 2 was the National Farmers Federation and the introduction of so-called competition. We had the third entrant against Patrick Stevedores and against P&O, the new competitor at Webb Dock. What a load of absolute nonsense that was! All along-as we discovered last night and as the world discovered last night, and as has confirmed the opposition's analysis of what is happeningthis was about training an alternative work force to replace the existing Patrick's workers. The government said that it did not know anything about Dubai-it was completely ignorant; it had nothing to do with it-yet it was advertised in the official Army newspaper. The investor who was behind it-the boss of Patrick's, Chris Corrigan-was at the same time in discussions both with the National Farmers Federation about the Webb Dock operation and with the government about sacking its entire work force. A minute of 10 March 1997 from the industrial relations department to the minister by an officer called Derren Gillespie set out the strategy. It referred to the holus-bolus dismissal of the entire work force and it said, as it gave the real game away, the two stevedoring companies were not really up to speed on this yet; they were not fully committed to this sort of idea and it was obvious that they had to handle them carefully. In other words, this was the government's idea; from day one this was the government's strategy. We are told that the NFF was being introduced for competition. We were told, 'What have you got against competition? Here it is in the Labor party platform adopted in Hobart. You support competition and yet you oppose the NFF.' What did we say? We said the NFF operation was not a serious competitor, it was not a new entrant into stevedoring, and that was proved to be 100 per cent correct last night. That is what the outcome of last night's exercise was. The NFF operation was never intended to be anything other than a device for training a replacement work force for Patrick's. That is why their notional competitor, Mr Corrigan, embraced them with open arms, leased his own land to them, at the same time as he was fighting tooth and nail in the Supreme Court of Victoria to keep a real, genuine competitor out-OOCL. At the same time as he is embracing the NFF and saying, 'Yes, this is a wonderful, new competitor that we are happy to have here competing with us in the port of Melbourne,' he is going through substantial legal proceedings to keep a real stevedoring company, OOCL, out. Of course, the truth of all this was revealed in all its ugliness, in all its mendacity and in all its viciousness last night. There have been a number of references in this debate to the pilots dispute in 1989. I think there are a couple of critical differences and the emphasis has got to be put on these distinctions. I should add that I, as a trade union official, was not a supporter at the time of the use of the military in that dispute. But let us look at the key differences. Firstly, the pilots resigned. No pilots were sacked. No government money or taxpayers' money was given to the airlines to fund the sackings of the pilots. They resigned and, immediately after they resigned, the military was put into use. Secondly and most importantly, the pilots were the aggressors in the dispute. It was the pilots who challenged the wage fixing system and it was the government that reacted to that. Rightly or wrongly, the government was reacting to the actions of the pilots; it was responding to a perceived threat to the wage fixing system at the time and was pursuing the national interest when you had a withdrawal of services that was having a devastating effect on many Australians and many Australian businesses. Those two differences are critical, and of course the position adopted by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business at the time on that issue was a little bit different from the position that he is now adopting-just a minor thing to add. We have seen in the past few months an outrageous pattern of slander, vilification and lies directed at a relatively small number of Australian workers, and just think of some of the examples. This has been coming up from all the mad right-wingers and all the people out there under rocks who have been waiting for years for this, all of the people-the extremists in parts of the NFF and elsewhere-who have been stewing over this. They have had a desire for revenge, a desire to hit the wharfies, for decades and now, finally, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has given them that opportunity. So you see these great letters in the paper about what some wharfies allegedly did in 1942, as if that in some way is the responsibility of an existing waterside worker. The same people who push this line, of course, say of what people did to the Aborigines back in that period, 'Nobody today bears any responsibility for that,' but today's wharfies, some of whom were not alive then, have to carry the can for these alleged outrages perpetrated by people most of whom are probably dead. Then we had the great Fremantle lie, the three shifts: the first shift only six or seven boxes an hour, the second about 14 or 15, and the third a world record at 30 because they were allegedly going off to see a strip show. The truth was on the first shift they had substantial mechanical breakdown; an automatic spreader broke down which meant that they could not do the job. On the second shift the boxes were in odd places; they had to shift two or three containers to get to an individual box, the end result being an ordinary one. On the final shift the containers were all there-one by one-ready just to be taken off very quickly. That is what they did. That is why there was a very high productivity on that. There are two of them and on the way out one of them comments jocularly to the supervisor, 'We're going off to a stripshow.' The end result is that you get the minister for workplace relations up here bucketing them and vilifying them on the basis of total nonsense. The Prime Minister has used a similar example which, after three questions on notice, he has refused to defend and substantithat ate. That is the allegation that for years wharfies have let perishable products rot on the wharves as a result of industrial disputes. That is a lie. Routinely, perishable products are exempt from industrial disputation and have been so for many years. I have given the Prime Minister three opportunities to substantiate that claim and three times he has failed to do so. That is just one example of the outrageous vilifications and slanders that have been heaped on this group of Australian workers. The government is now putting up a new tax-breaking its promise of no new taxes yet again-for $250 million to pay Patrick's to sack people at the same time as Patrick's have been asset stripping, shifting the assets out of Patrick's back into Lang Corporation, so that the government can then fund what Patrick's themselves should be funding. The government is not only orchestrating the dismissal of these workers; it is actually paying for these workers to be dismissed. It is paying Patrick's to do it. It is virtually bribing Patrick's to do it to pursue its agenda. All of the debate, all of the vilification and all of the propaganda have been about one or two ports, but in the smaller ports there are people today who do not have a job. There are people in Townsville who do not have a job. There are people in Burnie who do not have a job. There are people in Port Kembla and Bell Bay who do not have a job. No evidence whatsoever is put against these people. No argument whatsoever is put against them in terms of their productivity and industrial disputation-nothing. The only reason these people are being dismissed, in contravention of the minister's own legislation and his rhetoric, is that they are members of the Maritime Union of Australia who happen to work for Patrick Stevedores. That is the only reason. They have been given no redress, no warning, no individual performance assessment that says you are not doing a good job as an individual. The Liberal Party, the great Liberal Party of Sir Robert Menzies, the great defender of the individual, is here engaged in the most outrageous Stalinist attack on a group of people has been seen in this country's recent history. A whole group of people, 1,400 people, have been sacked because .of their characteristics-because they happen to be members of a particular union and because they happen to work for a particular company-with no consideration of their individual performance and their individual characteristics. We have got, in addition to that, the users of the highly productive, highly efficient Sealand in Adelaide, which is a small port and gets very good crane rates in spite of the fact that it is a small port, have to pay for the sacking of people in other states. So there is going to be a levy attached to the fees that are paid by users in Adelaide that is going to be used to sack workers in other states. All of this indicates what this government is really about. This is a stage in a gradual process of turning the clock back to before the Great Depression. This is to go back to the dog collar act. This is to go back to the master and servant relationship of the 19th century. This is to go back to the situation where all you had was individual contracts. You suggest that there is choice. What choice did these people have? What choice was there for the people in ports like Townsville and Burnie, who have not been on strike for years, who are perfectly productive and reasonable within the framework of equipment and tasks they are required to do? What choice did they have? The only choice they have exercised has been to belong to the Maritime Union, and that is why they are sacked. And this government claims it supports competition. The Minister for Workplace Relations lambasted me and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for not supporting the NFF, because that was new competition. The facade that that involved has been stripped away; the lie that was inherent in that proposition has been torn away. The NFF was never about setting up a new stevedoring operation. It was about training a replacement work force so that a whole lot of ordinary Australian workers could be sack.ed. In Dampier recently the state government, with the support of the federal government, locked out a competitor. It set up a monopoly with non-MUA involvement and locked out P&O from being able to complete. So much for the government's support for competition. They do not support competition. What they support is non-union labour. What they support is individual bargaining. What they support is preventing workers from bargaining collectively and balancing the bargaining power against powerful, large employers with lots of money. That is the real agenda, and bit by bit it is coming out. The issue of productivity is interesting to consider. Contrary to the allegations of the minister, productivity did rise very substantially on all measures as a result of the WIRA process. Crane rates were up over 50 per cent, terminal charges were down 25 per cent, ship turnaround times were reduced by 45 per cent and various other measures all showed substantial improvement. In some instances further improvement is required, but the bottom line question in all of this is an ends and means question. There are lots of parts of the Australian economy that are not perfect. There are lots of people who are not as productive as perhaps they might be. There are lots of groups of workers and lots of groups of mates of the Liberal Party who perhaps could be a little bit more productive. The real question is, how do you go about getting people to be more productive? There is a debate about productivity on the waterfront. We will hear more outrage and vilification and slander from government speakers in this debate today, no doubt. But the real issue in this debate is what is an appropriate way to go about getting improvements in these things. Is the appropriate way to massively vilify people as a group, to scapegoat them, to hold them up to public ridicule to a point where these people who have been sacked are going to find it very hard to get new jobs; and then, using public money, using all of the strength of government, to bribe their employer to sack them en masse simply because they are union members seeking to bargain collectively, and to tax exporters, the people they say all this is for the benefit of, in order to pay for that amount of money? Tonight you have got 1,400 people who are suddenly without a job; 1,400 people who have got to worry about mortgages in most instances, about dependants they have got to feed and about children they have got to look after. They no longer have a job. Not only that, they are going to have significant difficulties in many cases in finding a new job because Peter Reith and others in the government have spent the last few months telling the whole world what a bunch of bludgers, what a bunch of rorters, they all are-with no substance to those claims, with no effort to treat people as individuals and to judge individual ports, individual performance by different people, by different workers and different arms of Patrick. The end result outrageous black day for the Liberal Party in particular. You would expect this sort of stuff from the National Party but, for a Liberal Party committed to the individual, it is an outrage. (Time expired)",106
344,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"O'Connor) (5.28 p.m.)'Outrageous black day'! Let me give this house some evidence of an outrageous black day. This is the second time in two weeks I have had to rise in this place to identify the arrant hypocrisy, the double standards and the lack of credibility of the present Labor Party opposition. Recorded history is my proof of that. Last week I reported remarks of the Labor PM Mr Hawke when he defended his Treasurer, Paul Keating, for failing to lodge two tax returns. The Prime Minister at the time said that it was an honest mistake. But, of course, when the Labor Party came to attack the present Prime Minister over his position on a research centre, it was not an honest mistake. You can rewrite the rule book whenever you like. I also drew to the attention of the House the fact that members of that Labor cabinet sat in secret consideration of the Bell takeover of BHP when in fact a company, Industrial Printing and Publicity, of which the ALP was a shareholder, also held 58,000 BHP shares, and the mother of one of the ministers present had a very substantial holding in Bell, the takeover applicant. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) tried to rationalise the issue of the pilots strike. If ever there was a black day for the Labor Party, it was the day when they destroyed a union. The Australian Federation of Airline Pilots was a union. It was registered with the ACTU. In 1989 that association called upon its members to applying work bans-not a strike at that time but work bans. The airline industry, nevertheless, was fraught with bad work practices: it paid high wages to the people concerned--or some of them; not to a lot of the guys pushing the little planes around in general aviation-and, for some, there were very low hours worked. You can see all the similarities. Their record of industrial action was not the best either. But the Hawke Labor government, in associais an tion with the then Prime Minister's close friend and witness to an agreement-you might remember that little bit of hypocrisy when the then Prime Minister and his Treasurer met at Kirribilli House to divvy up the prime ministership; the witness that the Prime Minister chose was Sir Peter Abeles, who of course was the chief executive of Ansettturned on the pilots with a vengeance. The pilots were forced to resign. The member for Melbourne wants us to believe that they resigned and then the Labor government took revenge on them. But let us see what the pilots actually said in a publication they put out at the time: The Companies took out writs against individual pilots resulting in all pilots taking legal advice to resign to protect their families, homes and superannuation. These were common law writs: if you do not go back to work, we are going to take your superannuation off you; we are going to take your house off you. And the opposition are crying crocodile tears in here about what they say is happening now, when this government is ensuring that the redundancy and superannuation rights of all these people, whom I will refer to shortly, are properly protected. What else did the pilots say in that publication? They said: The companies, with the full backing of the government and the ACTU persisted with only one tactic in this dispute; to attempt to destroy the AFAP. This included: . Serving common law writs against individual pilots following union work bans. Has that been done by this government in this case? It continues: . Application to the IRC to cancel pilot awards. Has that been done by this government? Has there been any attempt to cancel the award? It continues: Â· Shutting down the airline system. We have not shut down the ports. It continues: Â· Threatening pilots termination benefits and superannuation. Has this government done that? No, it has done the reverse., The publication continues: Â· The use of the Air Force and foreign carriers. I see the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has come in; he would well remember all this and, no doubt, was in close contact with the ACTU at the time. What did the then Prime Minister say in regard to that? The Sydney Morning Herald of 22 August 1989, quoted Mr Hawke saying of the pilots: ""If they want war then there will be war and we won't be losing it,"" . . . ""If it means shutting down the system for x number of weeks then it will be shut down."" We all know the damage that that little statement did to the Australian tourism industry. Is that what this government is doing? No, this government is getting an orderly transition to keep the ships moving. The pilots publication continues: Â· The import of foreign labour. Ar(' we bringing people in? Yes, I will admit that somebody organised to send some workers to Dubai to be trained-and it is an indictment of Australia and the MUA that you had to send anybody' out of the country to have them trained in anything. It continues: Â· The advertising of pilots jobs around the world. Have we gone to Malaysia and Singapore and advertised for wharfies? No, we are making the opportunities through the law for the training of good Australians. It continues: Â· Government use of $100 million of tax payers money to support the airlines, thus prolonging the dispute. This is a good one because the member for Melbourne said, 'Of course we didn't spend any taxpayers money.' They actually paid theJ.Il to keep the men out of a job. What is the difference? By the way, we are not spending taxpayers' money; we are arranging for a body to borrow money. It will be paid back, including interest, by the industry at no charge to the consumers. The taxpayer paid $100 million so Bob Hawke, Peter Abeles and this Labor Party could destroy a union and destroy jobs. We had the Leader of the Opposition crying crocodile tears about people who might not be able to pay off their mortgage. This was a proposal, through personal writs, to take people's houses off them-and their superannuation as well. This included the use of writs inhibiting pilots and the media from discussing air safety issues associated with the dispute; they actually prevented pilots from warning people that their life might be at risk. The publication continues: Psychological warfare including threatening letters and misinformation. Rejection of genuine efforts to resolve the dispute. Rejection of any third party involvement in talks That was the history of the pilots dispute, and that was the disgraceful involvement of this opposition that stands up today and tries to compare that with what this government has done and how the MUA have behaved. I just found it quite ridiculous that the member for Melbourne said, 'The NFF's P&O operation is not going to be a waterfront operation; it is not going to be a stevedoring operation.' Of course it is, they are contracting to Patrick's; they are active stevedores. It is Patrick's that is drawing back. But let us look at that too because we are talking about all these people being sacked. Some of them are in Burnie. They are so worried about Burnie. One of the biggest employers in Burnie is of course Caterpillar Elphinstone, which makes underground mining equipment-the biggest manufacturer in Australia. They are sacking' people too. They are sacking them for a number of reasons. One of them is that the Native Title Act, which these people will not have properly amended, is in fact delaying mining development and jobs in Burnie. But the opposition is only worried about the wharfies. That is the truth. But the reality is also that, while you have got this ridiculous waterfront situation, they of course are also being denied the opportunity to export to some of the expanding mining companies in other parts of the world. They are the third biggest manufacturer of underground mining machinery in the world. That is just silly and, of course, is trying to rewrite history. Let us get down to these people who have lost their jobs. That is now being blamed on Patrick's. Because Patrick's had the temerity to grant some unnecessary wharf space to someone who had the courage to train some additional workers whom they could hire, the MUA took them on with one intention and one intention only: to send them broke-and, with very carefully selected strikes in one place after another, with this crowd on the other side cheering them on, they have succeeded. The company has no money to go on; it does not have enough money to pay that redundancy-and that was admitted by Mr Corrigan this morning. In fact, ment had not intervened at this time to put up that funding, the reality is that you would have another Cobar mine. They deliberately sent the operation broke by very selective strike action and, of course, all the other things they have done. The reality is that now they are crying crocodile tears for what they say were the good guys. It is a pity that Mr Coombs of the MUA did not get off his wine property for a while and attend to the real concerns of those people and negotiate a proper arrangement. The sort of stuff we get in this debate! after day we have had people telling us that of course the poor old wharfies could not be efficient, they had all this broken down equipment. The minister brought it to our attention yesterday: all that equipment has been brand new at this some point in time, and a lot of it at Patrick's was quite modern. But what did they do? Who had the responsibility-and the sole responsibility-for maintaining it? The MUA. The only people who were allowed to go near it with a spanner or a grease gun were the MUA. They could not even look after their own equipment; they could not even protect their own safety. What did we discover when the NFF went onto Webb Dock? They found in the Corrigan books that the maintenance of that equipment was costing over $3 million a year in wages and such going to the MUA. There is the girl who went down there to be trained and who Labor has told us as a journalist-and you would expect that they were going to stir things up-how excellent the training has been, and how pleased she will be as a journalist to have the chance to earn, as a woman, $50,000 a year. She said a couple of times, 'Oh, I was doing my training and the equipment stopped.' But the NFF now has had some outside contractors in. The equipment is not stopping any more, it is working perfectly-as it will in Port Botany and as it will in Darling Harbour as they move in. And they have outsourced maintenance, and the equipment will be safer for the people who operate it. But what was the cost at Webb Dock? It went from $3 million down to $400,000 a yearif the govern- and for a better job. Those opposite stand up and say what is good for the country and cry crocodile tears for the 1,400 men who have lost their jobs. How many of Australia's million unemployed have been out of a job because those people have made our people inefficient-how many? What is the social cost of those people's greed and arrogance? And 'arrogance' is the word, with 1,400 people demanding a job that should be done by 500. But, worse, they have driven every efficient shipping company from Australia's shores. I Day advised the House the other day how a working factory in Western Australia closed because it could not export its manufactured goods into the Asian region and be competitive, notwithstanding that it had the orders. It was not its local manufactured costs; it was the fact that it could not get the right shipping rate that was available to its Asian competitors. When that factory contacted those companies, they said, 'We wouldn't be seen dead in Australia; we don't go there.' In fact, on the figures given to us by P&O the other day, if you want to get a container shifted from California to Tokyo, it will cost you half as much as getting the same container from the east coast of Australia to Tokyo, which is the same distance. Why? Because they treat us as a war zone; that is how they price us. As one leading shipping fellow said to me years ago, when that was being published in the paper, 'Yes, it's true.' He went on, 'In a war zone, we might lose a ship from time to time; in Australia, we never know 'when we are going to get them back.' Do not tell me they do riot put a premium on for that-and who pays it? That van Extel girl this morning on the silly ABC was leading people to say that farmers should not be worried about the waterfront; they should be back looking after their livestock in the drought. I can tell you this: if your sheep are starving and the price of wool has dropped a dollar a kilo, $500 a container on the freight might be your profit. Of course they should take this interest, and they should be congratulated for it. But this Labor Party have no credibility. They dealt with the pilots with a steel fist. Their present leader, Mr Beazley, was referred to in the Australian of 24 August as follows: The Minister for Defence, Mr BEAZLEY the guy who provided the planessaid the air force was ready and able to provide 'substantial airlift capacity' . . . He was up to here with it-and he comes in whingeing today, worried about other people's job. And what did they do at the end of it? They had a party, and they invited the media to join them on their last Hercules flight out of Canberra. They celebrated the death of a union-that is what they did-and they have no credibility on this issue at all. In fact, if this building were not so solid, lightning would strike you dead.

345,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"Canberra) (5.43 p.m.)Since this debate began, a very important new element in this debate has arisen. Since this debate began, the Federal Court has issued an injunction for seven days to prevent Patrick's dismissing their employees. The Federal Court has said that for seven days Patrick's may not PlJrsueMr Truss-You hate to perform, don't you?",113
346,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"I hate the sacking of workers. They say no termination of employees, no divestment of assets, no hiring of new labour, for seven days. Why did they do that? With all the planning this government have done, with all the time they have had, with all the resources they have applied, they could not get it right for 24 hours. Even when they are acting in the most unreasonable manner, they cannot be competent. It was wrong in principle; it is wrong in practice. The Federal Court has found that there is a very reasonable case to argue that they have acted illegally; that not only is the act under which they are operating unfair, but they have not even acted in accordance with that act. This is not a decision that the Federal Court would have made lightly. Think about the situation in which the judge found himself. He was aware that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was in here congratulating the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) this morning on this great victory, that he had created the justification for sacking 1,400 Australians. But the Federal Court within 24 hours has said, 'This outrageous line of action by the government falls at the first hurdle.' The Federal Court has issued an interim injunca tion. What does that interim injunction do? It stops them sacking 1,400 Australians, and yes I am very pleased about that. We on the opposition side are all very pleased about that. It means that for Easter there are 1,400 families who know that at least for that period they have a job.",113
347,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,It is a top result.,113
348,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"it is an excellent result for working people. It says, 'If the government will not stand up in defence of the rights of Australian workers' - and it is clear that they will not-'you still have a chance in the courts.' We found today that you do not have a chance in the parliament. You cannot even debate issues about the attack on workers' rights. I think I know why. Because the only place where there has been a debate-the Senate--carried a resolution condemning the recklessness of the Howard government in inciting industrial conflict on the waterfront and inflicting unnecessary hardship on thousands of Australian workers and their families. What have we got here? The Senate, with the support of the minor parties-not just the Labor Party-had a debate in which it found against the government. In the Federal Court, where the matter was heard, where argument was put, the judge has said, 'Do not sack these workers. Do not strip your assets.' I wonder why they found it necessary to say that. 'Do not hire new labour. Keep the situation for a week because it is a very arguable case from the MUA that this action by Patricks is not in accordance with the law.' Whose law is it not in accordance with? The Prime Minister said that he would support Patricks to the hilt provided they act within the law. We want him to answer the question he would not answer at question time. In the light of this Federal Court decision, will he guarantee that no money will be paid to Patricks should those dismissals be found to be in breach of the awards and the agreements in the Workplace Relations Act? We do not want that money released to bankroll these dismissals. Now we have the Federal Court saying, 'Stop.' We want to be reassured that there will be no money released. The Prime Minister should come in here and give a guarantee through the parliament to the Australian people that there will be no support for these decisions if they are found to be unlawful. He said, 'We will support it provided they act within the law.' The Federal Court has said, 'At the very least there is grave doubt about that. Do not start spending this money. Do not proceed any further with this law. Let us wait to see whether the final consideration 'is as we thought it would be,' and as we asked the Prime Minister today. Mr Ross Cameron-We believe in leadership, not in waiting and waiting and waiting.",113
349,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,Leadership means acting competently in accordance with the law of the country. We do not live in a dictatorship where a leader is entitled to flict with the law.,114
350,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,He is not above the law.,114
351,Mr MCMULLAN,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is not above the law, but he is beneath decent standards. What this set of decisions and this set of actions by the government makes crystal clear is that, while there has been a clear finding of at least grave doubt about whether Patricks has acted legally, the government should say, 'Stop.' They should make sure that their own processes do not allow the continuation of this arguably unlawful act, and they should start answering the questions we asked them today. We asked, 'Prime Minister, are you aware that the Workplace Relations Act requires that no employee be sacked because they are a union member? Are you aware that any employer proposing to sack more than 15. employees has certain obligations imposed upon them under the Workplace Relations Act and there is no evidence that those have been met?' The Federal Court certainly was not persuaded that those reasonable requirements of the court have been met. The Federal Court said, 'At the very least, we have a number of arguable propositions.' We will find out in full, when the argument from the Federal Court is heard, what its view is, but there is certainly an arguable proposition that these dismissals are unlawful. There is clearly an argument on the most simple reading of the Workplace Relations Act that these arguments are unfair, harsh, unjust and unreasonable in the terms of whose law? Peter Reith's law. The law that this government brought in and celebrated, they cannot even comply with. They are backing unlawful actions; actions that appear to be quite clearly in breach of their own law. Did they bother in any way today to respond to our legitimate questions as to whether they would give a guarantee that no money would be paid should those dismissals be found to be in breach of the Workplace Relations Act? Not one indication of concern. Did they respond positively when we said, 'Are you aware of these provisions of the act and of the legally binding award that puts certain requirements on employers act in con- which they have breached?' Was there any concern by the Prime Minister? Did he give even the smallest indication of recognition that his commitment that he would support Patricks to the hilt, provided they act within the law, had not been met? He gave none. Did the minister for workplace relations show any consideration and concern? None. All they were doing was opening the champagne because they had got 1,400 Australians sacked two days before Easter. There are clearly a number of breaches of the Workplace Relations Act. The Federal Court has said to this government, 'Do not go down this path any further.' There cannot be a clearer red light to a government than this, saying that the action it is taking is unreasonable, unfair and potentially unlawful, and this government is supporting such action. It is a totally unreasonable situation to celebrate the sacking of 1,400 law-abiding Australians, but to do it in breach of the law is to be condemned. (Time expired)",114
352,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe) (5.53 p.m.)The ALP is finally out of the black box. We have been talking in this place month after month about waterfront reform. Why? Because we have Jurassic Park in Melbourne, in Sydney, in Adelaide, in Brisbane and in Perth. The Australian Labor Party does not want to talk about it. At two o'clock today, the grand old ALP came out of the box and decided to talk about waterfront reform. Why? Because Patricks sacked their work force. The member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), who has just exited the chamber after that little stunt, forgot to tell the House that this seven-day injunction is not against Patricks; it is against the companies in liquidation only, and I am advised that it is unlikely to have any effect whatsoever. It is all a bit of a fraud perpetrated on this House by the member for Canberra in the middle of a debate about waterfront reform. What is this issue really all about? It is about competition-the fact that we do not have any. Why do we not have competition on the waterfront? I will tell you why: we have a monopoly supply of labour. I think that almost every citizen in this country understands what a monopoly is-it is a single source of supply. That is what the Maritime Union of Australia is. It is a single source of supply of labour to the waterfront. There is no competition. Part XA of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, relating to freedom of association, states the object of the part in division 1preliminary-section 298A. It states: As well as the objects set out in section 3, this Part has these objects: (a) to ensure that employers, employees and independent contractors are free to join industrial associations of their choice or not to join industrial associations; and (b) to ensure that employers, employees and independent contractors are. not discriminated against or victimised because they are, or are not, members or officers of industrial associations. It is clear. All this government has done in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is do what I have argued for many years should be done-that is, put in the law true freedom of association. So they are giving individuals not only the right to belong but also the right not to belong. But you cannot get a job on the waterfront if you do not have an MUA ticket. They will not let you through the gate. The only way that we are going to remove that monopoly power of the MUA",115
353,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,Monopoly power?,115
354,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"That monopoly power which costs every Australian citizen hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a year in lost productivity, in higher costs and in lost opportunity and thousands upon thousands of jobs. The only way we are going to fix that is to get some competition. The member for Melbourne (Me Tanner) gave the most pathetic MPI lead speech I have heard in this place for a long, long time. He was about as enthusiastic as a wet blessed noodle. He said, 'You, the Liberal Party, should treat people as individuals.' That is exactly what the Workplace Relations Act 1996 was intended to do. It is to treat people as individuals, not as collectives. The MUA is a collective. It is a single source, monopolistic collective to the detriment of performance on the waterfront. So what do you do about it? Then came Patricks Stevedoring. Finally, there is a company with the guts, the legislative action and the legal sanctions to take some action to get some improvement. I can tell you that, except for this Jurassic Park Labor Party mob sitting over there, on a few little cross benches that they occupy, the rest Â·of Australia is applauding Patricks for finally having the guts to do something about reform of the waterfront. It is paying people decent wages, offering ,them decent conditions and giving them safe work practices and workplaces in order to do a job that needs to be done. I tell you what: winning international awards year after year for poor performance does absolutely nothing for Australia's international reputation. Not only that, it also does nothing for our cost structure as a trading nation. That point needs to be made strongly over and over again. With the exception of the coal industry, which we still have a bit of a problem with, and the building construction industry, which could open up their work sites to individuals who do not want to belong to a trade union-we need some improvement on that front-the rest of Australian industry have democracy in their workplaces. The important point that I make is that we are giving individuals choice. But this mob over there somehow expects us to believe that retaining the MUA as a single source of labour on the docks, on the wharves, in The Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth is for the good of all Australia. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had a few words to say about this. I believe he launched his book today; it is well and truly launched. The member for Werriwa says: The politics of nostalgia offers nothing more a chimera of false comfort and expectations. Well said. That is so applicable to this watersome front problem that we have. I hesitate to about a 'dispute' because I understand the workers have been sacked, so how could there be a dispute? I could be wrong because there is some uncertainty about the effect of injunction. The member for Werriwa also bring went on to say: There is something frightfully immoral about those in public life who know full well that the past is undeliverable yet because the electorate sometimes seeks shelter from insecurity by reviving sions of how society used to hewhat Jurassic Park used to bethey still proceed to throw back to the policies of the past and hold out false hope for the way in which nostalgia might somehow resolve the problems of the present. That is what we have. We have on the event wharves in Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Deputy Speaker. Adelaide and Perth work practices that date back to the earlier part of this century. We have over-manning, we have rorts, we have practices which are out of kilter with mainstream Australia. The wharfies come up and campaign against me in my electorate. We do not have a drop of water, except for a couple of reservoirs and one creek. Outside of that we do not have any water. We have heaps of trees everywhere, but we have the waterside workers in favour of the Australian Labor Party coming to my electorate to campaign against me. Why don't they spend their time doing something productive on the wharves and shifting a few containers? That might be a good idea, might it not, instead of nicking off, going slow and not doing anything until the overtime shift comes so that they can be paid double, triple and quadruple? That is not fair to other Australians. The member for Werriwa went on: cause of Labor is never weaker than when thParty has nothing more progressive to offer the electorate than a revival of ideas long past. He said it well again, and it is so applicable to this MPI today. May I say that the member for Melbourne, who proposed this matter of public importance, 'the mass sackings on than Australia's waterfront', came in here like a . wet noodle, a limp piece of spaghetti, offered implausible statement about sackings of talk the poor workers on the waterfront and disappeared from the chamber. It was a matter of such public importance he could not even stay to hear the debate. The member for this Melbourne is nothing more than a joke to this issue in front of the parliament. He ought to have known better.(Time expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.A. Crosio)-Order! The time allotted for this impresdiscussion has now expired.

The Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies, located at Pinjarra Hills, Queensof its land, was established by an agreement between the Queensland government and the CSIRO with the objective of developing a world centre of excellence to expand and diversify research and development in the mining, energy and related manufacturing industries in this state and the country as a whole. The centre aims to bring together resources from the state government, universities, kindred CSIRO divisions, Queensland and Australia wide minerals, energy and Committee manufacturing industries in collaborative Report activities. Currently the occupancy across the whole complex greatly exceeds the original planned complement and has led to 1m acute shortage of space and a demand for additional facilities. New initiatives and increased interest from the commercial collaborators will further exacerbate the accommodation problems in the foreseeable future. In order to redress these accommodation problems, CSIRO proposes a building development program which will significantly expand the existing facilities and, in addition, permit rationalisation of some of the existing resources. The proposed development comprises a research building housing lightly serviced laboratories, offices and open work areas; a technology transfer building providing office style accommodation for a number of independent rental suites; a number of new industrial type buildings; expansion of the existing library and canteen facilities; minor alterations to existing buildings to suit change of funcReference tion; site works, including new roads, car parking and environmental rehabilitation; extension and modifications to site services; and relocation and modification of the existing sewage treatment phint. The estimated out turn cost is $22.3 million. It is anticipated that construction will commence in early 1999 and be completed by mid-2000. I commend the motion to the House.

The Department of Defence proposes to complete a major redevelopment at HMAS Albatross. The redevelopment will provide modern functional facilities that will improve operational reliability and organisational functionality. The project will include facilities to support the' introduction into service of the new Sea Sprite helicopter. The proposal will provide maintenance and storage hangers for Sea Sprite and Seahawk helicopters, shelters for fixed-wing fleet support aircraft, air traffic control facilities, explosive ordnance storage facilities, replacement airfield lighting, photographic centre, a training complex, and engineering services and civil works. The estimated turn out cost is $69.3 million. It is anticipated that the design development will start in June 1998 and construction will be completed by July 2000.

The Human Rights Legislation Amendment ask Bill (No.2) 1998 is the result of a detailed examination by the government of the structure and operations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government's examination found that the current structure of the comrpission is inefficient and top heavy, and does not always operate in the best interests of the entire Australian community. The bill provides for the reorganisation of the commission's membership, which will comprise a president and three deputy presidents. The commission and its members will have a common responsibility to protect and promote human rights for all Australians. In order to maintain areas of expertise, each deputy president will also have responsibility for particular subject areas. One deputy president will be responsible for human rights and disability, one will be responsible for social justice and race, and one will be responsible for sex discrimination and equal opportunity. Most importantly, this bill will be the catalyst for a fundamental cultural change in the commission. The bill makes it clear that the new commission's priority will be to educate Australians about human rights and discrimination, and to help them to understand their responsibility, as members of the Australian community, to respect other people's human rights. The bill also emphasises the commission's role to assist business and the community to avoid discrimination by issuing practical guidelines for that purpose. This refocusing of the commission's functions is reflected in its new name-the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. Consistent with this cultural change, the bill will make the commission's power to intervene in court proceedings which raise human rights issues conditional upon it first my approval. The bill provides very broad criteria for the granting of my approval, which will enable me to ensure that every intervention by the new commission is in the best interests of the Australian community as a whole. The bill also separates the Privacy Commissioner from the new Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission by creating a statutory office of the Privacy Commissioner. This provides the Privacy Commissioner with an opportunity to further increase the profile, and thus the effectiveness, of her work in promoting the protection of individual privacy across all sectors. The bill provides further evidence of this government's commitment to the effective and equitable protection of the human rights of all Australians. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",119
365,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. We have the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 as presented today. We have a proud record of free to air terrestrial television broadcasting in Australia. From its inception in the mid-1950s, through the introduction of colour television in 1975, we have built a world-class free to air system with both publicly funded and commercial broadcasters, with a substantial proportion of quality Australian content. However, as we approach the new millennium, we stand on the threshold of new and exciting broadcasting opportunities. The era of digital broadcasting has arrived, in which television becomes part of the digital revolution which is sweepobtaining ing every aspect of our society. The digital television era provides a quantum leap in television technology. Viewers will have the option of viewing high definition pictures of startling clarity and with CD quality surround sound. But digital broadcasting offers much more than just better pictures and sound. It provides the capacity for the humble television set to become a central information point in every home. Users will no longer be limited to looking passively at a box in the corner of the house. Digital transmissions will enable a host of new information services, including interactive services, to be provided along with the main television programming. This government is committed to ensuring that all Australians are able enjoy the benefits of digital free to air broadcasting as we move into the next century. To achieve this we need to ensure that broadcasters have clear signposts along the road to digital television, and are able to embark on the risky conversion process with a degree of certainty about government policy. The Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill takes the first steps towards this objective by setting in place the basic framework for the conversion of free to air terrestrial commercial and national broadcasters. The bill amends certain provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992, and introduces a new schedule 4 to the Broadcasting Services Act dealing with digital television broadcasting. The mechanism by which the digital conversion process will be implemented for broadcasters is through the formulation of television conversion schemes by the Australian Broadcasting Authority which must meet certain government objectives as set out in the bill. Under the scheme, commercial broadcasters will be required to submit to the ABA, for approval, implementation plans. National broadcasters are to submit such plans to the minister. This approach has been adopted to ensure that the government's objectives are clearly enshrined in the bill, but at the same time the ABA has some degree of flexibility in the administration of the fine detail of the provisions, given that digital broadcasting is still new and developing science. The bill provides for the allocation of additional television channels to free to air broadcasters so that they can commence delivery of digital terrestrial television services. This is achieved by requiring transmitter licences to be issued for digital television broadcasts, through consequent amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992. It is intended that these licences be issued free of charge having regard to the high initial costs that free to air television broadcasters will be required to meet in relation to digital conversion and simulcasting. Digital broadcasts will commence on 1 January 2001 in metropolitan areas and from that date in regional areas such that all areas have digital services by 1 January 2004. Broadcasters who do not meet these targets will be required to surrender their transmitter licences unless there are exceptional circumstances. Broadcasters will be required to simulcast the same programs in both the new digital channel and their current analog channel for a period of at least eight years from the commencement date. At the end of the simulcast period, the spectrum used for analog transmissions will be returned to the Commonwealth and will be available for reallocation for specified purposes through a price based mechanism. To ensure that broadcasters primarily focus on providing high quality television services using the available transmission capacity, they will be required to transmit a specified minimum proportion of high definition television. Commercial broadcasters will not be allowed to provide multiple separate channels of programs or subscription television services. However, they will be able to provide limited enhanced programming. A review will be held as to whether the ABC and SBS will be able to offer multichannelling for non-commercial programs which are consistent with their charters. The government will identify unused television channels which are not needed for the transition to digital broadcasting and make these available for allocation for datacasting sera vices on a competitive basis. Broadcastersboth national and commercial-will not be able to apply for these channels but will be able to use any excess transmission capacity in their digital channels for datacasting services. However, they will pay a c\1arge for doing so, set at a value which ensures a level playing field between broadcasters and datacasters. This charge is the subject of the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Act 1998. No new commercial television broadcasting licences will be allowed before 2008, and whether these new licences should be allocated after that date will be the subject of a review in 2005. The needs of regional Australia have not been forgotten. In addition to the provision of additional time for the start-up period, the government will also review whether any amendments should be made to laws to ensure that underserved regional areas-that is, areas with fewer than three commercial services"""":"""" are provided with the same number of television services as metropolitan areas. The government will also continue to support community broadcasters and will facilitate the transmission of community television broadcast services free of charge in conjunction with datacasting services. The bill also provides for closed captioning standards to be set in regulations, and the government's intention is that appropriate prime time services and non-prime time news and current affairs should be captioned. The bill establishes an access regime for access to transmission towers for the location of transmitters, or the sites on which such towers are located. However, the government recognises that access to transmission facilities may not always be possible for technical reasons, and thus the ABA will have the power to issue a certificate exempting a tower or site owner from complying where such access is not technically feasible. This bill shows once again the willingness of this government to take the lead in the global communications revolution. It provides a framework which will enable commercial and national free to air broadcasters to embark confidently in building the next generation of television services, which will be an important plank in Australia's development as an information economy. Australians have always been confident users of new technology. Only five years after television was first introduced in Sydney and Melbourne, around three-quarters of homes in these cities had television sets. More recently, we have witnessed the phenomenal growth in the use of technologies such as mobile phones and computers. I have no doubt that Australians will embrace the digital revolution in television with equal fervour. I commend the bill to the House and present the signed explanatory memoranda. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. NA (IMPOSITION) BILL 1998 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Warwick Smith, and read a first time. Second Reading",120
366,Mr WARWICK SMITH,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998 provides for the imposition of a charge in relation to the provision of datacasting services by free to air television broadcasters. Part 6 of the proposed schedule 4 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 provides for the collection of this charge. Part 6 is contained in schedule 1 to the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998. The government's policy on the conversion of national and commercial terrestrial television broadcasters from analog to digital transmission allows broadcasters to use any surplus transmission capacity remaining after meeting their obligations in regard to providing their main broadcasting services for datacasting purposes. The government has also announced that it will make available unused channels in the broadcasting spectrum bands for competitive price based allocation for datacasting services. This policy has the potential to place broadcasters at an advantage over those players who are successful in gaining datacasting channels. Under the government's digital conversion policy, broadcasters would be allocated their digital transmission channels free of up-front or ongoing charge. However, other datacasters would have to compete in the marketplace for their spectrum. To ensure a level playing field between broadcasters who offer datacasting services and other datacasters, the government will levy a charge on broadcasters for datacasting. This charge will be set at a level which will be competitively neutral when compared to the price paid by datacasters for competitively allocated channels. The amount of the charge will be determined in writing by the Australian Communications Authority. The Australian Broadcasting Authority will administer the scheme as a delegate of the Australian Communications Authority. I commend the bill to the House and present the signed explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned.

I am pleased to be able to bring forward the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1998, which contains a range of reforms to upgrade and revitalise the national road transport reform process, following a major review of the National Road Transport Commission. The bill will ensure that the significant task of national road transport reform can continue to be effectively carried out. It extends the sunset of the NRTC until 2004 and makes it, and the intergovernmental processes through which reform is pursued, more effective. The National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 was reviewed in late 1996 by a joint government-industry steering committee. The review drew on the lessons of the first six years of the NRTC and examined ways to improve the road transport reform process. The review recognised the significant economic benefits that will flow from the road transport reform program-the Industry Commission has estimated that GDP benefits could total $800 million per year-as well as making the roads safer. The passage of the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Act 1997 through this parliament extended the life of the NRTC Act for 12 months from January 1998, ensuring that the reform process could continue while this bill was finalised in consultation with states and territories. The government is committed to delivering road transport reform to benefit not only the road transport industry but all the community, rural, regional and urban. Since the NRTC was created in 1991, reforms developed and agreed through the NRTC process include nationally consistent heavy vehicle charges, consistent heavy vehicle registration ments, national mass and dimension and vehicle standards, a new dangerous goods regime and national driving hours for long distance coaches and trucks. Many further reforms are on the agenda. These reforms will provide a nationally uniform or consistent operating environment for road transport operators and drivers, no matter where they are based or travel. An important ongoing role for the NRTC and all jurisdictions will be to ensure that the gains delivered by reform are maintained and built upon. Effective observance of road transport reform is also one of the key components of the national competition policy, and thus one of the criteria for determining the national competition payments to the states and territories. The bill will give stronger objectives and focus for the NRTC, set by heads of government. It will strengthen the NRTC's accountability to the Australian Transport Council-the council of transport ministersincluding through new strategic planning requirements and the appointment of the commission's chief executive by the council. The council will also review the NRTC Act at least every six years. The bill is to be supported by amending heads of government agreements, which will give jurisdictions greater flexibility in their implementation of legislative reforms, so reforms can be implemented more quickly. Heads of government will sign these agreements shortly. The bill provides recognition for the unique transport operational requirements of the defence forces to make it easier for them to operate, particularly in potential security and emergency situations, but with due regard to road safety. These provisions were developed in a strong cooperative spirit by the Department of Defence, the states and territories, and the Department of Transport and Regional Development. The bill also gives legislative backing to the National Environment Protection Council's involvement in the joint development of motor vehicle noise and emission standards, and allows for New Zealand's involvement in developing trans-Tasman vehicle standards. In short, the National Road Transport requireCommission Amendment Bill 1998 will provide a better road transport reform process that, through cooperation between governments, the NRTC and the. road transport industry, will deliver big benefits to the whole Australian community. I commend the bill to the House and, on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr V aile), I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

368,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services) (6.35 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill introduces regulatory controls for all Commonwealth radi.ation and nuclear safety activities for the first time in Australia. It is designed to protect the health and safety of persons and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation practices undertaken under the auspices of the Commonwealth. The bill applies to Commonwealth entities and their employees and to non-Commonwealth entities where they are contracted to the Commonwealth. The bill covers, therefore, Commonwealth departments such as Defence, bodies corporate such as the CSIRO and ANSTO, and any person who is a party to a contract with a Commonwealth entity. Under the bill, no Commonwealth entity can deal with radioactive materials or radiation apparatus, or any aspect of a nuclear facility, unless licensed to do so in accordance with this legislation. The bill provides for exemptions to the general prohibition, including specific exemptions for certain defence and security activities in the national interest. This legislation was a key recommendation of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste report, No Time to Waste, which was produced with the close involvement of all political parties. This bill delivers on the government's commitment to close the regulatory gap identified by that committee, whereby Commonwealth agencies have operated without comprehensive Commonwealth oversight and regulation. This is one reason why this legislation is strongly supported by all state and territory governments. From 1 July 1998 the functions and resources of the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Australian Radiation Laboratory will be combined to form the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety AgencyARPANSA-within the Department of Health and Family Services. The bill establishes the statutory office of the CEO of the ARPANSA to: . regulate activities within the Commonwealth which involve radiation and nuclear safety; work with the states and territories to develop uniform regulatory controls throughout Australia; inform and advise the government and the public on radiation protection and nuclear safety; and undertake related research and provide services of a high standard. The bill also provides for the establishment of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council to provide expert advice to the CEO. This bill will result in a centre of excellence for regulation, advice, research and services supporting nuclear safety and radiation protection of employees, the public and the environment.

This bill is an adjunct to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998-the ARPANS Bill. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Bill 1998 provides a capacity for annual charges to be made for licences issued under the ARP ANS Bill in line with the government's decision to establish the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. The annual fees and application fees will be payable by those entities regulated under the ARPANS Bill. As annual charges are treated as taxes, this separate bill has been prepared. For the purpose of establishing appropriate annual fees, the Commonwealth will employ an independent consultant to advise on appropriate cost recovery processes and fees and charges. Introduction of annual charges and licence fees will be postponed until this process is complete. In the interim, any additional costs resulting from regulating radiation and nuclear practices will be met by the Department of Health and Family Services.

This bill is an adjunct to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998-the ARPANS Bill. This bill details changes to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987-the ANSTO Act-resulting from the introduction of the ARPANS Bill. Changes include repealing those parts which established the Nuclear Safety Bureau and the Safety Review Com-Â· mittee. These changes are necessary because once the ARPANS Bill is passed the Nuclear Safety Bureau will be incorporated into the new Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and the Safety Review Committee will become redundant. This bill ensures that the current powers of the Director of the Nuclear Safety Bureau, as set out in the ANSTO Act, are conferred on the CEO of ARPANSA to ensure seamless and continued regulation of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation.

NA NA (AMENDMENT) LEGISLATION Motion of Disallowance",126
373,Mr MARTIN,Unknown,"I move: That the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997, No. 326, made under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, be disallowed. The reason I move this motion-I am pleased to see that at least the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is in the chamber to hear what I have to say about this-is that there is a long and, unfortunately, not very pleasant history associated with this measure. The former government introduced a $1 environmental management charge, the funding from which would go to assist in the environmental management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. When it was introduced there was no debate because it was considered to be extremely appropriate, certainly from an environmental point of view. Similarly, from a tourism point of view, it was considered to be a reasonable charge to be levied. However, in 1996 in the election campaign the then opposition, now government, went to the people of this country and in a statement in Cairns of its tourism policy the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), said that his government would not introduce any new taxes nor increase any existing taxes during their first term in office. It is history that he became Prime Minister and that his government was installed with a healthy majority. It is important to mention that members of this chamber whose electorates represent the bulk of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area are all coalition members. Not long after being elected, the government decided that they wanted not only to boost revenue but also to decrease the money that went to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. An inquiry was conducted into the authority and they subsequently endorsed the concept that they would cut money from the budget to that authority and replace it with what they dressed up as an increase in the environmental management charge-what we have rightly called the reef tax. It was announced that there would be a 500 per cent increase in that reef tax from $1 to $6 and that the tour operators-the people who ran the tourist boats out to the reefwould have to collect that on behalf of the government and remit it to the government. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would agree that a 500 per cent increase in a tax, coming from a government that had said that it would not introduce any new taxes or increase the existing taxes, would hav'e come as a bit of a surprise to people in the tourist industry in tropical North Queensland. The members for Herbert, Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), Hinkler (Mr Neville) and the other areas of tropical Queensland were, privately, a little indignant. They believed their own Prime Minister when he had said they would not increase the reef tax; yet a decision had been taken to increase it by 500 per cent. The result was that the excited tour operators convened a number of public meetings and a number of those members attended those public meetings. The member for Leichhardt got particularly involved, as did Senator Bill O'Chee from the other place. They went along and tried to talk about what they thought was the sense of the proposal to the marine operators in tropical North Queensland but, regrettably for them and positively for the marine operators, could not get agreement on it. As a consequence, it was decided to break it down into two tranches. In the first instance, they would increase it from $1 to $2; subsequently they would increase it by $4. Again, that did not have immediate support; in fact, it had no support from the industry. We saw the first tranche certainly take effect-incidentally, the Labor opposition moved in this place and in the Senate to have that tranche overturned; regrettably, they were not successful in achieving that-and, as a result, other deliberations took place to see whether the second tranche would continue in the manner proposed. After a great deal of backflipping and carrying-on, it was decided that the environmental management charge would stay at that $1 to $2 increase, commencing on 1 January 1997, and that a $4 tourist visitor charge would be levied on users of commercial facilities and craft from 1 January 1998. Once again, this was considered to be rather difficult to sustain in the industry and the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) put out a media release on 19 November 1996. After a further backflip, it was decided that there would be only a $4 charge-it would not increase to $6-and that it would take effect on 1 January 1998. It is in effect at this minute. These regulations, which allow that to occur, are what we are considering here tonight. If it were not for a couple of very significant points here, some support for that measure might have been expected from the industry. There is no doubt that the Great Barrier Reef is one of the great natural wonders of the world, one of the great tourist assets of Australia. It is cherished and revered in tropical North Queensland. Boat operators operating charter vessels taking tourists out to the reef to snorkel, scuba dive and so on take great pride in ensuring that the reef is not harmed. They go to great lengths-and I know the member for Herbert knows this to be the case from the tour operators that operate out of his electorate in Townsville-to ensure that positive measures to protect the reef are put in place. But even they still cannot believe that they are going to be the ones responsible for collecting that tourist visitor charge dressed up as the reef tax. It has now gone from a 500 increase down to a 300 per cent increase in one fell swoop, and that is the regulation that we are concerned about tonight. The other reason, as I said, why I think it is nonsensical for this to be introducedputting to one side the fact that the government when in opposition had made a promise they would not do something like thisrevolves around the fact that the tourist industry in tropical Queensland is suffering at the present moment. The tourist industry in Australia is suffering. The survey results that were published for the month of February show that there was something like a 17 per cent drop in tourist arrivals to Australia in February this year compared with February last year. In tropical North Queensland, one only has to go to Cairns and some of the other major tourist destinations to see the effect that is having on the local economy. Shopkeepers are suffering because tourists are not there. We have seen Asiana Airlines and Malaysian Airlines cancel flights into Cairns airport. The tourists are not coming as a direct result of the Asian currency crisis, yes, but because of other factors as well. Because of the value of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the currencies of many of our near neighbours, people are finding it cheaper to go to closer destinations or they are actually staying at home. With the recession in Japan predicted to get worse, one can only assume that our major market for much of tropical North Queensland will suffer even more. So what is the last thing you would expect to happen? The last thing you would expect to happen would be for a government to come and put another .disincentive in its way. The last thing you would expect would be for an uncaring, unsympathetic government-with a tourism minister who went to Queensland and said that tourism is fine in Cairns because stayed in a backpacker hostel, they did not recognise him and he could not find a towel; and, because of that, he said that tourism tropical North Queensland is fine-to say that another disincentive should be placed in the way of attracting tourists to Australia at time of great economic downturn in the region. It is just a nonsense. Once again we are in this place trying to electorates. educate those members that specifically represent tropical North Queensland as to why they should be supporting their constituents. I remember the farcical situation last time when we had people like the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) saying one have thing in their own electorate and then coming - down here and voting the other way and then saying, 'Oh, it was only a procedural motion, so I really did not have to go and support my own constituents who are concerned about the imposition of the reef tax.' And we had others on that side. The member for Leichhardt had been at those meetings up there. He has probably the most to lose because the Cairns area is right in the centre of the Far North Queensland or tropical North Queensland tourist activity and he had received the most representations from the likes of Quicksilver. Our friend that is in the chamber tonight, member for Herbert, has had representations from Mike Ball Dive Enterprises and those many other people that use the reef. They all have had representations from them, they have sent copies to us. I have met with those people on many occasions up there, and they are still smarting. Would you not have - thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, that those members would have supported this initiative for their electorate? Would you not have thought that they would have supported this - idea at a time of economhiring. ic difficulty for tropical North Queensland, when tourist numbers are dropping off, when occupancy rates in the major hotels are about 40 per cent at best, when Japanese tourists are not coming in the numbers that they were, when airlines are cancelling flights into . Cairns, when Townsville is still screaming out for additional services so that it can tap into what is perceived to be the economic benefits coming from the tourist industry? Would you he not have thought that those members would have voted with the opposition at least the last time around, and certainly this time? We in will wait and see what happens. We will wait and see whether this time those members are prepared to stand up for their electorates or a whether once again they are prepared to be thugged into supporting a government measure which is clearly unpopUlar in their own There is a third downside to this, and that is the effect on employment. I am not talking specifically about the fact that the people having to collect this 300 per cent increase in tax that is now being applied to them might to put people off so that they pay for the necessities associated with the collection. That is not what I am specifically worried about. What I am worried about is that there is a disincentive there to attract tourists, whether it be from Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the United States or Great Britainwherever it might be. If there is a disincentive there, it makes other tourist destinations attractive. And, if it makes other tourist destinations attractive, it means the jobs of the people that manufacture the bread, the people that put flowers into hotels, the people that are there to do the pressing and those people the that work in dry-cleaning shops, the people that are there working in the small businesses that this government says it stands up for every time you hear its members speak in this because place are going to suffer. - If the demand falls off, if the tourist numbers drop off, it stands to reason that demand will not be there and people in many of the small businesses will be looking for ways to save money so that they can survive. How do they do it? By putting off staff. The simplest way to do it is by putting off staff and not That happens not because of some nonsense being spread by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith)-when he is not out there bashing the wharfies he is talking about unfair dismissalbut because tourist numbers have fallen. As a direct result of that, we should not be putting in other barriers to attracting tourists. I do not have to tell too many people who know anything about the tourist industry that in our immediate near neighbours there has been quite a deal of money spent on trying to attract tourists to their countries. I do not to tell members that there are reef formations off Indonesia, for example, that, as I understand it, are extremely attractive. I do not know whether they are as good as the ones that are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, but I am told that, for divers, for snorkelling, for simply looking at the underwater life and looking at the marine life that is there and the corals and so on, it is pretty spectacular stuff. So the last thing we want to do is give our competitors some sort of a break. The last thing we want to do is give these people an opportunity to say, 'It is much cheaper to come to us than it is to go to Australia.' At the end of the day the sorts of markets that we are trying to attract are those people who are interested in ecotourism, those people who are interested in coming for a period of time to see something that is a wonder of Australia. When they are making those decisions they are going to sit back and say, 'Well, I have got a family. If I want to get on a Quicksilver vessel from Cairns or Port Douglas and go out to the reef, then it is going to cost me X amount of dollars for the ticket to do that, but it is then going to cost me $4 a head for me and my family to go out to pay the Commonwealth government.' What do they do with that money? They said they were going to put it into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, but there is no evidence that all of that money in fact goes there. In. effect, there has been a cut in the budget for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and, from the figures I have seen, I do not think that the proposals for the increased collection of the reef tax will go anywhere near recompensing that. The Great Barrier Marine Park Authority is located in the member for Herbert's electorate. He knows the fine work that the employees in that institution do on behalf of Australia in protecting the reef. But they cannot do it if they are constantly hamstrung by dwindling resources. The environment is an important element in Australia's everyday life. People talk about environmental concerns all the time now, and the most cherished environmental resource that we have in tropical Queensland is the have Great Barrier Reef. To introduce something like this, a disincentive to tourism, which is going to contribute to stopping tourists going to the Great Barrier Reef-and it will-is just plain silly. It would not surprise me if the Minister for Sport and Tourism (Mr Andrew Thomson) had not even thought about this, nor bothered to raise it with Senator Hill, the Minister for the Environment, under whose portfolio this responsibility lies. It would not surprise me one little bit. Quite frankly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism is seen as an abject failure and an abject joke amongst the tourist industry of this country. He believes that tourism and sport are beneath his abilities. As a consequence, he is showing an arrogance which is breathtaking towards this industry. I just wonder whether our friend the member for Herbert, whether the member for Hinkler, whether the member for Leichhardt, whether the member for Dawson and whether Senator O'Chee have been to see the Minister for Sport and Tourism and asked him whether he has been to see his parliamentary and ministerial colleague, Senator Hill, and said to him, 'Listen, we've got a few problems in the tourism industry in this country. Tropical North Queensland is suffering a bit and jobs are suffering a touch. Don't you think we could have another look at this reef tax? By the way, do you remember when the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Opposition, stood up at the wharves at Cairns and said that he would not introduce any new taxes or increase any existing taxes? But suddenly he has done it by 300 per cent. Yes, all right it has come down by 500. But he is increasing it by 300 and the tourism operators are supposed to cop that and thank him very much.' I wonder if they have actually been around and had that chat with the Minister for Sport and Tourism, and I wonder what his response was. Judging from what people in the tourism industry tell me, if they could get into see him, good luck. More importantly, if they did get into see him and he is prepared to listen to them, then they have achieved something even more remarkable. Probably at this Easter season, it is equivalent to that. Can I conclude simply where I started. This reef tax is anti-Queensland; it is anti-tourism; it is anti-jobs. It is anti-Queensland, anti-jobs and anti-tourism because it is discriminatory. It is being applied only to Queensland. Nowhere else is there an environmental management charge-a reef tax-being levied. It is being levied in Queensland and it is being levied on an industry which is going through a downturn at the moment. If the member for Leichhardt were here, and if he were genuine, he would stand up and he would agree with everything I have said about the state of the tourism industry in his electorate. But he is not here and he is not particularly genuine; I do not think he will vote with us to overturn this regulation. I would like to think that those members who represent the tourist areas of Australia that are affected by this 300 per cent increase in the reef tax will be true to their constituents. I would like to think that they will join with the Labor Party and vote down this pernicious anti-Queensland, anti-tourist, antijobs tax. If they do not, they will certainly get an opportunity to explain that to their constituents in the not-too-distant future. I will make sure they are given that opportunity. I commend our motion to the House.",126
374,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Bevis-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,130
375,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"Herbert) (7.05 p.m.}-I do not understand why this disallowance motion is before the parliamenf tonight because the industry and the government have agreed on this particular charge. The industry are happy and have indicated to the government that they are happy. I also do not understand, because the former member for Herbert-that is,.the ALP former member for Herbert, who has the same surname as me-also has the same view, as I will enunciate tonight. The government is committed to ensuring that the Great Barrier Reef, one of Australia's magnificent world heritage areas, is managed effectively and that there is a fair and equitable sharing of the costs of managing the reef. This is clearly not a goal shared by the opposition or the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin). The regulation that we are discussing tonight will increase the Great Barrier Reef environmental management charge from $2 to $4. The EMC is a charge on the tourist operators and is generally calculated at the rate of $4 per person per day carried to the reef. The aim of the charge is to achieve a fairer share of the financial burden associated with managing and protecting the reef between taxpayers and those who use the reef. As a result of this regulation, those operators who extract significant private benefit from the use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will make a reasonable contribution to its management and protection. A person who actually visits the reef will effectively pay a little more tow-ds the management of the reef than the average taxpayer who never visits the reef. This is a principle that I would have thought the opposition would have supported. It is not unreasonable to expect those who use the reef to pay a small charge for the privilege. This applies not only to the many Australians who visit the reef but, importantly, also to the thousands of overseas visitors who use the reef. The opposition apparently endorse this philosophy because it was the ALP who originally introduced the environmental management charge. It strikes me as hypocritical that they should now be opposing this relatively minor increase in the charge. Let us explore the extent of the ALP's hypocrisy on this issue. In particular, let us have a look at, what a couple of former ALP environment ministers have said. Senator Faulkner said in the Australian on 19 May 1994: I can't shy away from the need to have a look at a user-pays approach. The pressures from the numbers of tourists going to those world heritage areas is going to be enormous, and we have a r:esponsibility to protect their values. In his column in the Australian on 11 September 1996, when discussing the arguments against the proposed increase to the EMC, former ALP Minister for the Environment Barry Cohen said: Most of itthat is, the argument against the increaseunfortunately is nonsense. Barry Cohen, a former ALP minister, is saying that the ALP's arguments are nonsense. He pointed out that the cost of running the marine park authority was somewhere in the vicinity of $25 million to $26 million per annum and that this money had to come from somewhere. We inherited a $10,000 million budget black hole-no doubt about that-and some decisions have to be made to fix up the difficulties that we inherited from the ALP after 13 years. What this increase in the environmental management charge is aboutand I stress it is an environmental management charge, not a tax-is protecting the reef. Let me quote Barry Cohen again. He said: The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's greatest environmental treasure. The burden for protecting it is borne by all Australian taxpayers. Gradually a larger part of that burden must be shifted to those who most enjoy it-those who visit the reef. This is what this is all about. These regulations provide the opportunity for the visitors to the park to contribute a little more to its ongoing maintenance. The member for Cunningham himself knows a little bit about this. He is a prime example of the ALP's hypocrisy. The member for Cunningham-and he will remember this-was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts which, in its report entitled Managing Australia's World Heritage, said: A convincing argument can be made for charging those who benefit most from world heritage areas, either financially or as visitors. It is argued while taxpayers as a whole contribute through government funding to world heritage management, those who reap special rewards from the areas by earning a living from tourism or through their experiences while visiting the areas should make an additional financial contribution. That was at page 169. The report also said: The Committee considers that where it is feasible to collect fees, they should be more than a token amount. It supports the move in the 1996-97 Budget to increase the environmental management fee ... That was at page 183. Interestingly, the member for Cunningham was a member of this committee when it handed down its report. He signed off on the report and cannot seriously come into this House and now argue against these regulations. I would also like to quote from the Hansard of 13 May 1993, where the former member for Herbert, Mr Ted Lindsay, was quoting from the Liberal Party's Fightback document. It states: We believe users of our national parks should contribute more towards their upkeep and the provision of facilities. Mr Lindsay then responded in this place by saying: I have no quarrel whatever with that assertion. Mr Lindsay also said: In a communique issued by the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council meeting on 10 May 1988, it was proposed that the user-pays principle would apply to tourist operators and tourists visiting the Great Barrier Reef. I quote from that communique And the quote was: ... the principle of charging for the commercial use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Queensland marine parks was endorsed by Council. Mr Lindsay then commented on who members of the council were. He said: Who constituted the council? In attendance were Senator Graham Richardson, Senator Margaret Reynolds ... Senator Margaret Reynolds comes from North Queensland. The hypocrisy of the ALP now coming into this place and moving this disallowance motion! How will you make up the shortfall? The member for Cunningham is promising to that, overturn this increase. But not once have we heard from the ALP where they will find the money to cover the shortfall that the disallowance would cause to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority'S budget? Neither the shadow minister for tourism nor the shadow minster for environment will make a public commitment to fund the shortfall; nor have they told us which part of the budget they would take the funds from to ensure there are sufficient fundsÂ· available to properly m&nage the reef. I tum to the value for tourism. Tourism is the largest and fastest growing commercial use of the marine park. It is worth over $1,000 million annually to Queensland and the national economy. There have been significant visitors to the reef in the last several years, and a high proportion of these visitors are North American, European and Japanese. The management of tourism and its impacts occupies a major and growing proportion of the authority's resources; Active management is required to protect the world heritage values of the reef. It is only reasonable that tourism operators and, indirectly, tourists-especially overseas tourists-should contribute to meeting these increasing coasts. The EMC is in effect an investment in our environment and in the future prosperity of the tourism industry which depends so heavily on the reef. I now tum to negotiations with the industry. Since announcing the intention to increase the EMC in the 1996-97 budget, the government has consulted closely with the tourism industry to ensure that the increased charge is implemented smoothly and with the minimum of impact on the industry. The government has accepted a proposal put forward by a number of tourism industry groups which will minimise the impact of the collection of the fee. It had been proposed to implement the original decision through a $2 EMC and a $4 tourist visitor charge. However, the tourism industry groups requested that the government replace this arrangement _wjth one fee only, a $4 EMC, to be effective from 1 April 1998. After careful consideration, Senator Hill has accepted the industry's proposal. The EMC was therefore increased to $4 on 1 April 1998. The government will now not proceed with the toutist visitor charge. Senator Hill accepted the proposal from industry because it is a win-win outcome. We will achieve a fairer sharing of the costs of managing the reef between taxpayers and visitors using the reef. The $4 EMC does not represent an excessive burden on industry. The outcome also addresses industry concerns that the collection of the TVC by the GBRMPA could have been unduly disruptive. Let me quote from a letter to Senator Hill from a key industry association: May we congratulate and thank you on your recent decision regarding the TVC. We congratulate you for this is the industry's wordsaccepting the industry's proposal over this issue. This clearly shows that we were acting in full consultation with the industry. We also accepted a number of other proposals put forward by industry representatives. In particular, we have taken the step of linking the EMC to the CPI, a step particularly sought by major industry associations. Let me do a quick comparison with other fees. At an effective rate of $4 per visit, the EMC compares favourably with the fees charged for use in other areas of high natural value, such as Kakadu, Uluru and many state run national parks. For example, both Kakadu and Uluru charge a $15 per person entry fee. That pass is valid for 14 days for Kakadu and seven days for Uluru. Here we have further evidence of ALP hypocrisy. One of the last acts of the previous ALP government was to increase the Uluru charge to $15. While we are on that subject, let us have a look at what the ALP is doing in New South Wales. The Carr government recently announced that it would introduce a new $5 per day park use fee in 15 national parks and reserves. In addition, the daily park fee in Kosciusko was increased from $12 to $18 a car. The ALP has come in here complaining about a $2 increase in the EMC, while Bob Carr moves to introduce a whole range of new park fees in New South Wales. Will the member for Cunningham condemn the Carr government? . In relation to the GBRMPA efficiency reforms, management of the Great Barrier Reef-one of Australia's greatest natural assets and the world's biggest multi-use national marine park-is a complex and demanding task; a task that is becoming more demanding and more challenging as the magnitude of management and the likelihood of human impact pressures increases. The government is committed to effective management of the Great Barrier Reef. Recently Senator Hill announced a number of reforms to the administration of the authority which will result in a more efficient and effective organisation. The changes have been widely welcomed in Townsville. As the member for Cunningham has correctly said, the headquarters of the marine park authority are based in my city. The authority is undergoing a comprehensive restructuring process to provide a streamlined, more efficient organisation which will continue the important work of protecting the Great Barrier Reef. The government is ensuring that the authority operates as an effective but efficient organisation. The importance of managing the reef should not allow us to be blinded to the need to ensure that scarce taxpayer funds are spent in the best possible way. The government's goal is for the authority to retain the outstanding international reputation that it has earned for its stewardship of the Great Barrier Reef and to achieve a fairer share of the cost of managing the reef as a key part of our strategy. I congratulate the officers and the staff of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority who do a wonderful job. The recent changes have been widely welcomed both within the authority's structure and from the industry that is serviced by the authority. I believe a disallowance of these regulations tonight would cause significant problems both with the authority and with the industry. I think it is irresponsible for the member for Cunningham to be moving this motion tonight. These regulations are part of a strategy, and the opposition's hypocritical motion should be roundly rejected tonight.",130
376,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"The issues that we are looking at today associated with the reef tax have been before the chamber previously. There are a few things that have changed since then that I wish to refer to, and there are a few things that are the same. One of the things I have noticed that has changed is that at least on this occasion there are two members of the gang of five who have been willing to front up into the chamber and put forward a view. We have just heard from the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), and I assume the member for Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) will enter the debate shortly. That is in marked contrast to the earlier occasions when these matters were before the House because they, along with the other members representing central and North Queensland, did everything they could to run from this debate. Not' only did they do everything they could to run from the debate themselves; they did everything they could along with the government using its force Of numbers to prevent the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) moving a series of motions last year seeking to draw the attention of the House to these problems. They used their vote to quash debate on these issues when they had the opportunity to, and they voted with the government to ensure that these matters associated with the reef tax were not able to be debated properly in the parliament on a number of occasions. So some things have changed. We at least have a debate at the moment, and we see that two of the members who are directly involved are willing to come into the parliament and put forward a view. It is interesting that the seats involved in this are all seats held by the government. I suppose that is not too surprising when you look at the map after the 1996 election. In a that sense I stand here as the Labor Party member for Brisbane who holds the northern most seat of the Labor Party in Australia. I guess that is as close to the Barrier Reef as we get at the moment, but it will change.",133
377,Mr SOMLYAY,Unknown,I used to share that distinction for the Liberal Party.,133
378,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"As the minister at the table points out, he used to have that dubious distinction for the Liberal Party. We are about to repaint the map at the next election. It is in part because of the position that the members for Herbert, Dawson, Leichhardt (Mr Entsch), Capricornia (Mr Marek) and Hinkler (Mr Neville) have been involved in over the last year or so on this issue. One of the things that I have found most difficult to accept in this debate has been to watch the comments of some of those members when they are at home and then to watch their comments and their votes here in this parliament. When this matter was first being dis(,:ussed, I well recall the outspoken critiised cism of the member for Leichhardt. He was so opposed to the imposition .of this tax. He was so concerned about what it was going to do to the tourist industry. In the local papers there was a splash of media from the member for Leichhardt about those things. It did not stop him a week or two later coming down here and voting for them. He was a home town hero. He was a real hero back in Cairns fighting for the locals, and then he turned his back on them when he got down here in Canberra and sold them down the drain. That is the fact of the matter. That is exactly he did. At least the member for Herbert has been willing to come into the House tonight and put up an argument in support of what his government did. Let us go back to what the government has proposed. Today we are dealing with the third, fourth and fifth draft of its plan. We should not be under any misunderstanding about where the government wishes to head with this. Look at what the government announced as its desired outcome. It wanted to take a $1 levy, which was introduced by the previous Labor government-every cent of which went to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for the protection of the marine park-tum it into a $6 charge and, in exactly the same budget, cut the amount of money tIlat would be going to the marine park authority. On the one hand, the government wanted to grab more money out of the visitors to the park; on the other hand, with exactly the same budget, it wanted to give less to the protection of the park. That is actually what it has proposed. It is no secret that in private the member for Herbert and a couple of his other colleagues sought to try - to convince their members in the government to change their view. They knew it was an insane proposal. They knew they could not sell it anywhere. They khew it was bad policy. More than that, they, like everyone else, knew it was a breach of promise. The member for Herbert made a point of saying that we had a different view about Uluru and somehow we are inconsistent. At the last election, it was not us who stood up in Cairns and Townsville and promthe tourist industry that we will not increase taxes, that we will not introduce new taxes. It was the Liberal Party that promised the people of North Queensland there would be no increases in taxes and there would be no new tax. Straight after they got elected, they hit the most vital industry in North Queensland-the tourist industry. They hit the tourist industry at a time when they thought they might have been able to get away with it. As it turns out, they could not, and the political reaction from the industry and from their own party people what was such that they had to modify it. Cast your mind back a few years earlier if you want to talk about the Labor Party's performance on this matter. When we introduced the $1 fee-every cent of which went to look after the marine park-tourism was booming. The year-on-year growth was so big the challenge for the tourism industry was to meet next year's demand. Placing a $1 fee at a time of massive growth was not a burden on the industry. What has this government turned around and done? It initially sought to increase the charge to $6 at a time when the industry was not booming. Now, a year or so later, it wants to increase it to $4, at a time when the industry is not booming but in serious difficulty. I do not get to North Queensland nearly as often as the members for that area, but I do get there pretty regularly. While I am up there, I talk to people in the tourist industry and in the community about how business is going. There has been a clear decline in business activity in North Queensland over the course of the last eight to 12 months. A - I lot of that has been exacerbated over the last six months or so by the currency crisis. Tourism flights, as the member for Cunningham had pointed out, have been cut enormously. Even if you accept all of the logic that the government advanced last year on this-we do not; it is a breach of their own promises, but we assume it was not a core promise-I say to you: wake up and look at the situation this year. The simple fact is that this year the industry is doing it tough. The last thing the tourism industry in North Queensland wants is this additional charge or any other charge. The crazy thing about this is that this is a government imposed charge. This is something over which you, the government, have absolute authority. It is not something in which you can run your arguments about wage rates, try to do in workers or take away their right to negotiate and say that that is a big problem. This is a charge you are directly imposing. You know that the industry does not want it. You know the industry cannot afford it. You know that it will have an a further impact, on the attractiveness of those locations to visitors, particularly foreign visitors, ata time when the currency exchange rates are very much hurting those countries from which we were getting massive increases in our tourism. I have not seen the recent figures, but my understanding is that tourism from Japan has pretty much plateaued; tourism in Korea has nose-dived; and tourism from countries closer in the region, like Malaysia and Indonesia, has also nose-dived. Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Shute Harbour-those places around Proserpine and Airlie Beach, which are absolutely some of the most magnificent parts of the country-are all suffering now because of those problems and the impact they are having on the tourism industry. Against that background, this government wants to press ahead with an increase in fees-an increase that amounts to a tax, no matter how you badge it, which you are asking the operators to collect for you and a tax which they can ill-afford to meet. It is the wrong tax at the wrong time that breaches your own undertakings to the people of Queensland. Of all places to hurt-Queensland! Twentysix members of the federal parliament are from Queensland, 24 of whom are from the goyernment. In fact, come to think of it, that is not so anymore. There are a couple on the cross benches, on the Independent benches, and it is growing. We picked up another one from Queensland this week, come to think of it. There are two Labor members; you can put the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in a box by herself; and you have just lost the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford). I am not sure' what the next couple of months hold. Whichever way you cut the cake, at the time the last election occurred you walked away with 23 out of 26 Queensland seats. Along the coast, seats that the Labor Party held were lost at the last election-Herbert, Leichhardt and Capricornia. The election prior to that was Hinkler, and you turned Dawson from a marginal into a safe seat. The people of Queensland took you at your word. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKERÂ·(Mr Forrest}-I remind the member for Brisbane that the chair effect, has not taken anybody at their word.",133
379,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"The people of Queensland took the Liberal-National coalition government at their word. During that last election, when the Liberal and National parties received a massive swing, larger in Queensland than in any other state or territory in this country, they gave a degree of trust to the Liberal and National Party members which the Liberal and National Party members have betrayed. One of the symbols of that betrayal is what we are now debating. One of the symbols of that betrayal is your failure to honour your promises to the people of Queensland in the tourism industry. The stupidity of that is that your ideologically driven agenda is going to see the government persist with this policy, even though they know that this is a bad time to implement this policy even if they think it is right. They know now is not the time. The motion of disallowance that has been moved by my colleague the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) is an important one to the people of Queensland. It is more than that; it is important to see whether or not those members in the seats concerned are going to stand up for their electorates. Most importantly, as a Queensland member myself, I will be looking to see whether those who have been so vocal at home and so concerned at home in opposing this reef tax have the intestinal fortitude to represent their constituents here with a little of the vigour they claim to have when they are back home. We will see again, like previously, whether or not they are just going to be home town heroes and try to be double faced in their presentation to the electorate. The difficulty in their doing that that these are going to be on the record votes. They can be assured that their constituents will be well-informed about the position they have adopted.",135
380,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"Run from the debate? Annie Oakley? I have got you in my sights, mate, because I know what you have done about this; you have come in here with fancy little stunts and you have not delivered. Do you know what this shadow minister for tourism said in this House last year? Do you know what he said, Mr Deputy Speaker?",136
381,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Forrest)The member for Dawson will resume her seat. Mr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: as I am sure you will understand, the standing orders require that members be addressed by their correct title, and I do not think she was actually talking about you.",136
382,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I remind the member for Dawson to address her remarks through the chair and refer to members by the names of their seats.,136
383,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"ANNE KELLY-It has started, has it not? You do not want to hear it so you are going to pull on points of order all night. That is the coward's way out, so you keep doing it because you cannot address the issue. I will just tell you: on 6 March the member for Cunningham, who is also the shadow minister for tourism, came into this House and said, 'How stupid are the tourism operators as well.' That is a great statement about the tourist industry in our state and in this country. So that is the opinion the member for Cunningham has of tourist operators. I will tell you what has happened on this issue. Let us just have a bit of a look at history. The environmental management charge was introduced in 1993 by the Labor government as a move to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef was protected, enhanced and managed properly. At the budget of 1996 the decision was made that the environmental management charge be increased from $2 to $6. Far from running from the debate, we have is not indulged in stunts in the House with cute little disallowance motions and so on. We have gone back-every single member in this House went back to their electorate-and negotiated with the tourist industry, worked with the minister behind the scenes, instead of pulling cute little stunts in the House, which go nowhere. And do you know what? We were successful in bringing it down to $4, with a whole range of subsequent things. The reason the member for Cunningham said, 'How stupid are the tourist operators,' is that that is what they wanted and accepted. We implemented for our constituents what they asked for. At a public meeting in the Whitsundays, unanimously my tourist operators asked for a $4 environmental management charge. Unfortunately, the shadow minister for tourism, because he spends most of his time down here thinking up cute stunts in the House of Representatives, does not get out and talk to the tourist operators. If he did he might know something about the tourist industry in the Whitsundays. I will tell him something: while he has been bemoaning the situation in South-East Asiathe only comment he has made tonight that I agree with; it is a tragic situation and it is having ramifications on many of our export industries-he should have got his facts right on the Whitsundays first. It might help in future-I have got them. By the way, I just want to say that we are now being blamed not only for the crisisMr Martin-What are they?",136
384,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"ANNE KELLY-I will get to that in a moment. I will debate this in my own way, thank you. We are not only being blamed for the crisis in Australia and the budgetary problems here; we are now being blamed for South-East Asia. We were happy to fix up your problems here but there is not a lot we can do about South-East Asia. I will tell you what we did do in the Whitsundays, which you had no part in: we have actually increased our tourist numbers by six per cent. Do you know how we did it? We put in $1 million promotion package, out of the blue. I'll bet that is news out of the blue for you. It is a pity you do not check up on your information. It has gone up six per cent. At the recent tourism industry awards in the Whitsundays we had a rise. Whitsunday visitors and conventions bureau, congratulations-you did a great job, and so did we. B this obviously is going to be the arsenal for the next election. I can see it now; stunts in the House, slimy accusations against female members of parliament-absolutely disgraceful, your party. Mr Martin-Where?",136
385,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"ANNE KELLY-Not the members here, I will say. Slimy accusations against female members of parliament.",137
386,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Will the honourable member for Dawson please address her remarks through the chair. It is less confrontationist if you do it that way. That is why the standing orders are such.,137
387,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"ANNE KELLY-I am happy to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will repeat my comments. This is obviously the arsenal for the next election. Because there are no fresh ideas, except for those of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), and no idea of promoting tourism as we have done, we now have stunts in the House. We have increased the tourism numbers in the Whitsundays by six per cent, something we are very proud of. Mr Martin-When was the figure?",137
388,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,ANNE KELLY-We have also ensured that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority does not have a shortfall of $3 million. Our reef is one of the safest in the world; it is protected and managed properly.,137
389,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The member for Cunningham has had his opportunity to speak. Let us observe standing order No. 55.,137
390,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"ANNE KELLY-There have been recently some very sound initiatives brought in by the Minister for the Environment to address the Great Barrier Marine Park Authority, its structure and operations. But can I tell you what was left to us by the previous government, the Labor government, that are full of stunts, full of slimy accusations, but very short on substance. Do you know what they had? They had a secretariat in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority here in Canberra with seven staff. Last time. I checked there was no reef around Canberra. But the member for Cunningham probably gets plenty of time to check, because he does not seem to get up to the. north much. Do you know what else they did? They were not putting enough resources into practical care of the reef. Do you know that the Whitsundays were asking the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for six years to fund moorings and microbuoys at the Whitsundays. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are on the environment committee. You would be well aware that one of the most detrimental actions to a reef is anchor damage. If you have not got any moorings, you have to throw the anchor down. It latches onto the coral and, as that boat spins around during the night, it rips the coral. Do you know what? We asked the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority-under the previous government of members opposite, who are chuckling; they can chuckle, but they did not do anything-for $100,000 out of a $23 million budget to fund moorings at the Whitsundays. OUCH, the Organisation of Underwater Coral Heroes, volunteered to put these moorings down. They were going to donate their work. But we still could not get it out of GBRMPA. That is what happened under the previous government. I am very pleased to say, however, that under this government there are now moorings being placed at the Whitsundays. We have got the $100,000. Even more than that, we are going to rejig the structure of GBRMPA. Let me tell you some of the things the Minister for the Environment is going to do. He is looking at a range of measures. Certainly the critical issues are going to remain as a priority for GBRMPA-conservation, world heritage, tourism and recreation, fisheries, water control, coastal development. But the administrative reforms are going to be delivering a saving of $1.2 million a year to taxpayers. This is not going to happen with a reduction in salaries. It is going to be achieved with voluntary redundancies and vacant positions. I wonder whether any of those vacant positions are going to be at the secretariat in Canberra that existed under the previous Labor government. But that is a matter for another day. We will be prioritising research expenditure so we can get some practical care of the reef-something you never addressed. We are looking at a strategic plan to be released for public comment. This is a government that likes public comment. We do not do it behind the scenes. Major information needs to be addressed through monitoring activities. The legislative structure of the authority is now 20 years old, and doesn't it show. I would like to conclude my comments by reiterating what the member for CunninghamMr Bevis-Say something about the tax. It would be refreshing.",137
391,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,ANNE KELLY-I will. Tourist operators in my area asked for a $4 environmental management charge. It was delivered by hard working members in our area. Mr Bevis interjecting,138
392,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,ANNE KELLY-Do you know what else we delivered?,138
393,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I will not say it again to the members of the opposition. I will not tolerate constant interjections. The members present have had their opportunity to speak. In accordance with standing order 55, members making contributions are entitled to be heard in silence. That is all going to say. I am warning you.",138
394,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,Unknown,"ANNE KELLY-It is nice to see somebody bring some decorum back to the House. I would like to talk about the environmental management charge which was endorsed at $4 at the Whitsundays by a public meeting of tourist operators. It was what they wanted, it was what they asked for and it was what, I am pleased to say, the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), the member for Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and other hard working members in this House delivered behind the scenes. While those on the other side were pulling stunts in the House with disallowance motions and sneaky little messages about the gang of five, the gang of five were working hard-and we have achieved the result. More than that, we have not taken $3 million out of GBRMPA, which would have seen some of the very necessary environmental and what will under the new structure be practical care of the reef undertaken. I just cannot believe that on 6 March 1997 the member for Cunningham, the shadow minister for tourism, would so insult tourist operators from Cairns, Townsville, the Whitsundays and as far down as Maryborough by saying how stupid the tourism operators are. They all know about that. They all know what the shadow minister for tourism, the member for Cunningham, thinks about the tourist operators, who negotiated here with the Minister for the Environment, after they had achieved an environmental management charge that they are satisfied with, after they had ensured that the very thing that ensures their livelihood, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Great Barrier Reef, will be properly managed and practically focused in their care of the reef. Yes, I think we have done our job. It is a pity, though, that the opposition will continue with stunts in the House, with slimy accusations against female members of parliament. Whilst that is happening, I know that members on this side are delivering for their electorates. We are happy to go out and talk about our achievements, including five interest rate cuts for tourism operators. On a mortgage of $100,000, they save $2,500 a I am year. That is money in their pocket. They are real changes for tourist operators. We have also been endeavouring to overcome not only the crisis in Australia left to us by those on the other side but the drop in tourism numbers because of the South-East Asian crisis. We have succeeded in our area, with six per cent growth in tourist numbers. If members opposite ever get out of Canberra they might check on some of that-very helpful. I will leave the debate there. I am pleased this was raised tonight. I am pleased that the opposition, who have not worked to restructure GBRMPA, who have not worked to negotiate with the tourist industry, who have not worked to get interest rates down, who have not bothered to come up and really find out what is happening with promotion in our area, raised this tonight because it has given us a chance to tell the House the truth.

397,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Forrest)The changes in the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 proposed by the Senate raise important points of constitutional principle to which it is the Speaker's duty to draw the attention of the House. The final Senate change seeks to amend part 3 of the bill as transmitted to the Senate. This part of the bill proposed to establish a strategic ballast water research and development fund, into which amounts were to be paid from the consolidated revenue fund equal to amounts raised by the levy. The alteration sought by the Senate to part 3 of the original bill and amendments (1) and (2), which are consequential, would omit reference to 'Fund' and substitute 'Reserve'. The bill is a 1997 bill, and the amendment was necessitated because on 1 January 1998 the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 commenced operation. This act established a reserved money fund to replace the trust accounts previously provided for under the Audit Act. It also provided that, if another act establishes a component of the reserved money fund and identified the purposes of the component, the component could be identified for those purposes, and standing 2 to 20), appropriating provisions were included. Purported Senate amendment No. 3 identified the reserve as a component of the reserved money fund. The Senate may seek, by way of amendment, the removal from a bill of appropriating provisions. However, having done that, the Senate should not then insert provisions which appropriate'moneys. The appropriate way to proceed in these circumstances is by way of request. This is supported by legal opinion. The matter for consideration is not so much one of the privileges and rights between the two Houses but observance of the requireReserve ments of the constitution concerning the appropriation of revenue. An important point of constitutional principle raised in the matter relates to section 56 of the constitution, which provides that a vote, resolution or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue shall not be passed unless the Governor General has recommended the appropriation by message. Complementary standing orders provide for the timing of announcement of such messages, including where amendments or requests for amendments are involved. As the Senate's purported amendments have an appropriating effect, there is Significant doubt as to the constitutionality of proceeding in the absence of a Governor General's message recommending appropriation. It is, of course, for the House itself to decide what action to take on this matter. Motion (by Mr Somlyay) agreed to: That the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by Message No. 448 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collecting Bill 1997.",140
398,Mr SOMLYAY,Unknown,"Fairfax-Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government) (7.57 p.m.)-I move: That the Senate's purported amendments be disagreed to. The Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Bill 1997 and the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997 is a package of legislation to introduc- a levy on certain ships to provide funding for the strategic ballast water research and development program. The money collected will fund research and development aimed at minimising the risk and, in the longer term, possible prevention of the introduction of unwanted marine pests and disease pathogens found in ballast water in ships' hulls. The bill being amended-the Ballast Water Research and Development Funding Levy Collection Bill 1997-will establish the strategic ballast water research and development fund which was to be a trust account for the purposes of the Audit Act 1901. Since the bill was introduced, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 has come into force. Section 20 of the places the provisions of the Audit Act relating to the trust fund and trust accounts. Under that section, the fund called the reserved money fund is established, and various ponents of that fund are called reserves. As a result, the strategic ballast water research and development fund is now required known as the strategic ballast water research and development reserve and is to be a component of the reserved money fund. These amendments provide for the necessary changes to the bill so that it will comply with the requirements of section 20 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act.

399,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"As I was saying before the debate was adjourned, developments of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority do rely on a number of very important goals, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) outlined in his second reading speech. The first one was the maintenance of financial stability, the second was the provision of specialised regulation of conduct disclosure and dispute resolution for financial service providers and financial markets, and the third was the prudential supervision. As 1998 I pointed out, what this should be leading to is the fact that not only will Australia have a world class financial regulation system but also that Australia is moving into a position where we will be one of the great financial I was also very heartened by some comments that the Treasurer made in his second reading speech when he talked about the fact that the prudential regulator will be an independent regulator but, like the Reserve Bank, will be subject to an overriding policy determination power of the Treasurer. He went on to talk about the fact that the prudential regulator will have to produce an annual report. That report will be presented to parliament and it could be referred to a parliamentary committee. I thought it was quite significant that the Treasurer, in that second reading speech, named the House of Representatives Standing Committee on' Financial Institutions and Public Administration as the committee likely to do a detailed submission. I thought that was quite significant because in our report in September of that committee, which I chair, we made a specific recommendation when we were looking at the annual report of the Reserve Bank, and also the ASC and the ISC, that the new Australian Prudential Regulation Authority should be required to appear before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration at a public hearing once a year to report on prudential supervision of the financial services industry. So I think it is quite significant that the Treasurer has made reference to that in his second reading speech. I would like now to talk about some of the important issues that will be facing the prudential regulator and the whole new regulation of the financial system. Clearly, with this new system, which has come from the recommendations of the Wallis report-and I commend the Treasurer for taking up those recommendations-we do see some very important challenges that are likely to come before these new regulators. In fact, one might even describe it as possibly a baptism of fire. The concern I have is that in the transition from the existing system of regulation, which I think everyone recognises has served us very well, to the new system of regulation, which I think both sides of the parliament recognise will serve us even better, there is an interesting period facing the financial system in the next year or two. I think all of us are very much aware of what has occurred in Asia in the financial area and we have recognised that so far, because of the very good financial management of this government, Australia has been largely immune from what has occurred in Asia.",141
400,Mr KERR,Unknown,Let's see what it's like in two months.,142
401,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"That confidence, not only within Australia but right throughout the region and indeed in other parts of the world, is something this government can be very proud of. I did allude to some of the benefits of that good management of the government in an earlier part of my speech. Mr Kelvin Thomson-This is a 'no child will live in poverty' speech.",142
402,Mr KERR,Unknown,This is a 'no child will be living in poverty' significant statement.,142
403,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"But, of course, we do have to look at what is occurring in Japan, which all of us who are interested in these areas-although I am not sure that some of the honourable members opposite are all that interested-know is very serious and could have very serious implications for Australia.",142

405,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Hollis)Order! If the honourable member for Denison wishes to participate in the debate he should put his name on the speakers list and the honourable member for Wills should keep his comments until he speaks. The honourable member for Wannon will be heard in silence.,142
406,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, what is occurring in Japan is something quite serious and something that all of us should be watching. If you then couple that with some of the other occurrences around the world you will see, for example, that by some measures Wall Street is now exceeding 1929 levels. That does not necessarily mean the obvious but it is a salutary warning. We are also seeing some very timely warnings from eminently respected people in our own community. I refer honourable members to an article that was in the Business Review Weekly last month. The front page headline quoted Mr Maurice Newman, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange, who is an eminently respected financier in Australia, holding many positions of responsibility, and who is very highly regarded, as saying, 'I think the world is headed for recession.' I think what Mr Newman was trying to do was to alert people to the potential-and I think that is all it was, the potential-problems that could occur with the millennium bug if (and I underline the word 'if') we are complacent about what that could mean in Australia. In the article there. were a number of very clear warnings. We can look at a couple of them. Mr Newman went on to talk about one of the foremost authorities on the year 2000, the Deutsche Bank chief economist: He is by nature quite an optimistic economist and he says there's a 60% chance of a severe global recession lasting 12 months and in the US real GDP could fall by at least four percentage points from peak to trough. That is a timely warning and I bring it up in the context of the fact that .we will be looking at the transition from our existing financial regulation to the new system. So we should take that warning on board to ensure that that transition is made in a way that does not allow any form of slippage in the question of regulation and, most importantly, does not allow something like that to get out of hand. We should be grateful for what Mr Newman has had to say; nonetheless, we should be warned that there is no room for complacency. I would like to mention the growth of the use of derivatives in Australia. It is an area that we should be watching very closely. To date it has been very well regulated. Those who operate the derivatives and futures markets and so on have been extremely responsible and have kept a very tight hold on them. Nevertheless, the turnover, for example, in the Sydney Futures Exchange last year was $8.9 trillion, up 13 per cent on the previous year. Of course, the bank to bank use of derivatives is significantly greater than that. In the last four years we have seen a 50 per cent increase in the all up use of derivatives. While one should not see these figures as a cause for alarm, the fact is that the turnover each year on the collective derivative markets in Australia is now around $1 Yz million for every man, woman and child. That is a very significant amount of money on what is a highly leveraged financial tool. As everyone in the futures game knows, it is a zero sum game: for every winner there is a loser. Most of the use of derivatives is for very sound financial reasons and all of us appreciate the importance of the futures market and the role it plays. We all respect the competence of the Sydney Futures Exchange. We understand that there are very tight margin calls on the Futures Exchange to ensure that liquidity remains. It is recognised that the Futures Exchange coped very well with the stock market problems of 1987. But, I come back to the point that it is timely to consider this when we look at the way financial regulation is going, particularly in the transition. In the short time that I have left to me I would like to again talk about the importance of the role of the Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee. In the work that my committee is doing looking at this whole area, we continue to have our halfyearly meetings with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I pay tribute to the Governor for the way he takes those public hearings very seriously. With the way the committee operates nowadays we are developing our own expertise and we will continue to quiz the Governor on the very important issues of not only monetary policy but also all the areas of financial regulation which currently the Reserve Bank controls. The committee will be looking, as the new system is brought into place with the prudential regulator and the other arms of financial regulation that the government is introducing, to ensure that Australia can indeed claim with some pride that not only do we have a worldclass system of regulation but that we have the right-and indeed develop the opportunity-to become one of the great financial centres of the world, so that Australia can, along with Tokyo, New York and London, be one of the four great financial centres of the world. This is something that the government, led by John Howard and ably supported by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, has indeed set up as an opportunity for Australia as we go into the 21st century. This set of bills is part of that great development. (Time expired) the regulators change and the regulations change at the same time. That is just about a rolled gold certainty. Things falling through the cracks is certainly not a desirable aspect of Australia's financial system and it is something that we have been trying to avoid. I think we have all been trying hard to learn some of the lessons of the eighties and about the operations of the white shoe brigade. But, as the Four Comers program pointed out on Monday night in its investigation into what it called the 'superannuation stakes', there is the potential that neither of these regulatory bodies will be up and running by the 1 July this year start-up date that is anticipated. That may not be due to legislative delay in the parliament. It simply may not be physically possible to achieve these changes by the start date or to have the two bodies operating effectively in time to oversee the regulatory changes. Four Comers last Monoay night mentioned the example of the regulation of the superannuation industry as an area where regulators need time to adjust to new public policies. That is one of the many reasons why I have been calling on the government to support an opposition amendment to schedule 5 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) which would delay the start-up date for choice of superannuation fund until 1 July 2000, which would allow consumers of superannuation to be educated to make an informed decision about choice. A single licensing regime for financial services, advisers and. intermediaries is a welcome step in the right direction, particularly given the further deregulation of financial services at the retail level which is occurring in, for example, the superannuation market. I want to turn to two specific issues raised in the Wallis report which affect the area that I have opposition responsibility for: superannuation industry. Those two issues are the reduction in consumer protection as a result of theft and fraud and the moving of the regulation of what are called 'excluded superannuation funds' from the ISC or ASIC to the Australian Taxation Office. The government is proposing to weaken superannuation investor protection from theft and fraud. The protection of superannuation investors is something that Labor treats very seriously and we are very proud of our record in this area. Labor established the SIS legislation with the purpose of ensuring the prudent management and essential protection of the superannuation deposits of all Australians. To date, with few exceptions, SIS has proven to be an outstanding piece of regulatory legislation which has effectively safeguarded superannuation assets. However, if the government gets its way, this will change and the protection of investor superannuation funds from theft and fraud will be reduced. Under current arrangements, the Treasurer has the power to grant financial assistance to a superannuation fund which suffers a loss of funds due to theft or fraud when he or she considers it to be in the public interest. The Treasurer may also impose a levy on each superannuation fund in the industry of up to 0.05 per cent of the funds' assets to raise the required amount to meet funds which are stolen or lost through fraudulent conduct. However, the government's proposed new arrangements in response to the Wallis report will significantly weaken superannuation fund protection measures. The government has listed the Superannuation (Fraud) Amendment Bill on its forward list of bills to be introduced in the autumn sitting session, but it has not been introduced for reasons the government knows best. Indeed, this government's management of the legislative program has been little short of abysmal. But we do expect to see that bill introduced some time in the next sitting, and I believe it will reflect the recommendations of the Wallis report as adopted by the government which are as follows. Firstly, under the new measures the Treasurer would need only ,to apply a national interest test, rather than a public interest test, in determining whether he or she should grant financial assistance to a superannuation fund which suffers from fraud or theft. Labor believes that the public interest test should remain. The government's No. 1 priority should be to secure every Australian's retirement nest egg from theft or fraud. Secondly, the new measures propose that the Treasurer's grant of financial assistance to a superannuation fund should be reduced from up to 100 per cent, under the current arrangements, to 80 per cent of the entitlement of the beneficiaries of a fund. That represents a significant watering down of the current superannuation protection measures. I am sure that millions of Australians who have money invested in superannuation - ccounts will be less than impressed to hear that, under the government's proposed model, in the event of theft or fraud of their nuation money they would receive only 80 per cent of their entitlements compared with the full 100 per cent that they are entitled to . under the current arrangement. Labor strongly opposes any measure to reduce the entitlement of all Australians to receive the full amount of their superannuation benefits if they are lost as a result of theft or fraud. This is particularly important given the increased spread of superannuation and the increased level of contributions as a result of the Labor government's superannuation policies. They would have increased further, of course, had the Liberal government not failed to honour its commitment to pay the three plus three per cent co-contribution into superannuation. Thirdly, the government's new arrangement will apply only to superannuation fund losses which result from 'fraud'. Does that mean that the superannuation funds will no longer be protected from theft? Labor strongly designed believes that there should be no weakening the current arrangements which protect superhazard annuation money from both theft and fraud, and that the arguments put forward by the Wallis inquiry concerning moral hazard are wrong. The concept of moral hazard rests on the notion that individual superannuation investors should make their own decisions about the safety of their superannuation To insure them 100 per cent, so it is said, is to encourage unsafe behaviour by investors and by those trustees who invest moneys on their behalf. I want to suggest that that is an incorrect assumption. First, superannuation investors, ordinary employees who receive superannuasome tion contributions paid on their behalf by employers, do not currently have the appropritaxation ate level of education to make this type of investment decision. All the evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry into choice of fund confirmed that. Secondly, the compulsory nature of superannuation contributions requires that superannuation funds are protected by the highest possible protection regime. There should be no doubt in the mind of the public that, if their superannuation moneys are stolen or superanembezzled, the government can make a decision to levy the industry to replace those moneyS'. On the issue of moral hazard, it is the superannuation industry itself which is better qualified and placed to detect theft and fraud rather than an individual who is having superannuation contributions paid into a fund on their behalf and who is much more remote from the process. In that sense, the industry has an incentive to self-regulate to detect theft and fraud from within in order to avoid being levied by the government to account for shonky behaviour. The issue of theft and fraud is unique. It is a crime which is generally unusual in the superannuation industry, although there are exceptions. It is not like risky investment strategies, where a fund manager indulges in risky behaviour with the thought that if things go wrong the rest of the industry will bail him or her out. The SIS Act has provisions in it, . including personal responsibility for directors, to protect against that type of behavof iour. So the argument that there is a moral in allowing the government to fully replace superannuation moneys in the event of theft and fraud is wrong, and I look forward to debating that issue when it comes before us. With a greater reliance on superannuation for retirement, Australians must be able to rest easily in the knowledge that their fund. retirement nest egg is safe and secure. The other issue that the Wallis inquiry raises is the issue of the supervision of excluded funds shifting from the ISC, which is now to become the ASIC, to the Australian Taxation Office. On the face of it, I am not opposed to such a move. The ISC has had concerns about the regulation of small excluded funds, particularly in the area of concessions. However, we do intend to closely examine this issue to ensure that those with excluded funds and are not unfairly disadvantaged. I do not think that we have yet said enough in this place concerning the problems associated with the proposed introduction of choice of superannuation fund by 1 July this year. Yesterday I issued a press release calling on the government to support Labor's amendments designed to delay the start of choice of superannuation fund. I have already outlined to the parliament my view that the government should delay choice as part of a commitment to ensuring workers are able to understand the decisions they will be forced to make under the government's model. However, the government's insistence on beginning choice of fund on 1 July has drawn a lot of criticism from the industry and the media, not least because we question whether the regulation package will be in force by that time. It is becoming increasingly clear that government is not interested in listening to employees, employers or the superannuation industry concerning this issue but wishes to drive choice forward as part of a quest to give the banks a share of the superannuation pie in order to give the banks ever larger profits. It ought to be said that what the bills in front of the House do is to establish a new regulatory regime and that without such a regulatory regime for banks people simply would not put their money in them. They would not have confidence that there is an appropriate regulatory regime in place and that therefore their money was safe. This puts banks in a privileged position, as does their special place in terms of the issuing of banking licences. With that privileged position, in my view, come obligations to the community. But banks are saying to us directly that their obligations are not to the community, not to their customers, but to their shareholders alone. We have witnessed this in the drive to push people away from retail banking towards automatic teller machines and towards EFfPOS. That is. a drive which has no community support and, if the banks maintain it, there will be a massive public backlash. In my own electorate of Wills, going back a month or two, the Commonwealth Bank moved to close its Strathmore branch. It was the only branch in that suburb and one which enjoyed very strong support from local people-the bank never denied that-and one which was very important to the Napier Street Strathmore shopping centre. Notwithstanding massive community protest, hundreds of people attending a public meeting, thousands of petition signatures and hundreds of letters",142
407,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"Indeed, which bank? The Commonwealth Bank proceeded to close that branch. They did not stop there. They have written to me a couple of days ago announcing that, not content with that, they are proposing to close the Brunswick East, Brunswick West and Oak Park branches as of Friday, 1 May. Given that that is my birthday, it is a pretty ordinary birthday present, but it the is even worse for those people who make use of the Commonwealth branches in those places. I know the Oak Park branch quite well. When I was a state member of parliament, my office was located in the Oak Park shopping centre. That is a shopping centre that has endeavoured to keep itself alive and to attract patronage. Just a fortnight or so ago they had a festival, and that was particularly well received. There was a lot of public interest and support for it, and it was a sign of a future for that shopping centre. But along comes the Commonwealth Bank now and says, 'We've got no need of the Oak Park branch'-indeed, there were a couple of branches there before the amalgamation with the State Bank-'and we are going to close that branch.' They have said the same thing concerning Brunswick East and Brunswick West. As I said earlier, this is simply part of a drive to say to people, 'We don't want.you to use banks any more; we want you to use automatic teller machines or, even better from our point of view, we want to completely hand over this part of banking to the supermarkets and get you using the EFfPOS.' It is my view that automatic teller machines represent an unsatisfactory alternative for many older people who are uncomfortable with the technology and also uncomfortable with the security. There have been a number of reports of people being assaulted and robbed at automatic teller machines, whereas it is, of course, much more difficult for people to hang around bank branches waiting for customers to come out. The security issues are important issues. Not only have the banks been progressively Abbott, A. 1. closing their branches and providing a lesser Andrews, K. 1. standard of customer service; it is also the case that they have been hitting us ever Barresi, harder with fees and charges. Indeed, some of Broadbent, R. E. the reports about lowering of interest rates, Cameron, E. H. particularly spouted by the Prime Minister Causley, I. R. (Mr Howard), are in fact belied by some of Cobb, M. R. the facts. We have had drawn to the Draper, P. opposition's attention recently the case of Evans, Gerard White, a farmer in Ballarat, who had Gallus, C. A. a Commonwealth Bank rural loan which was Gash, J. reviewed every two years--due to be reGrace, E. J. viewed in April this year-with a two-year Hawker, D. P. M. rate of 9.6 per cent. The bank contacted him Hockey, J. B. in January and said it would be willing to Jull, D. F. refinance his loan but under what they call a Lieberman, L. S. 'better business loan' with an interest rate of Lloyd, 1. E. 12.52 per cent. So, for him, his rates inMCArthur, F. S. * creased by of the order of 50 per cent. Similarly, as housing interest rates have Nairn, G. R. fallen, banks have been raiding fees and Neville, P. C. charges. Under this Treasurer (Mr Costello), Pyne, C. M. who is taking no interest in the issue of Reith, P. K. monitoring fees and charges, this has gone on Ruddock, P. M. to new and ever higher points where banks Somlyay, A. M. are earning billions of dollars. It is said that Stone, S. N. $1 in every $3 earned by the major banks Taylor, W. L. now comes from fees, with more than 200 Tuckey, C. W. different charges. We have seen accountVale, D. S. keeping fees up to $7 a week, branch with- West, A. G. drawals up to $1, overuse of ATMs up to 45c Wooldridge, M. R. L. a transaction, EFTPOS use up to $1.25, dishonoured cheques from $12 to as high as Adains, D. G. H. $35 and special cheque clearance from $8 to Baldwin, P. 1. $15. It was reported in the Financial Review Crean, in February that, last year, the banks made Dargavel, S. J. $6.3 billion in fees and charges. This is Evans, G. 1. simply not good enough and the public is Ferguson, L. D. T. entitled to much better treatment from the Fitzgibbon, 1. A. banks.

NA BILL (No.7) 1997 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed from 2 Apri1.",149
409,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 1997 is about two things: first, it is attack on trade unions, using the same malice that has motivated the government to orchestrate the sacking of 1,400 workers today from the waterfront; second, it is about giving the banks bigger profits, letting the banks in on the superannuation action. If that is not the intention of the government, what is in it for them? If this is not what you are on about, why not adopt our model? We have put forward a model which will provide for genuine employee choice, not forced employer choice. What we see is a government which is hell-bent on pushing through its legislation without support from workers, without support from employers and without support from the superannuation industry. The first amendment we are moving to this legislation involves a revised definition of 'industry based fund'. We want to replace the government's definition of 'industry based fund' with a definition which more accurately reflects what a true industry based fund is. This amendment will apply only in the case where an employer chooses to offer his or her employees a choice of four funds. It does that by requiring a fund which seeks to qualify as an industry based fund under this definition to be a not for profit fund which operates purely in the best interests of the members of that fund. Many different types of superannuation funds exist in the market. Labor supports that level of market diversity in the interests of allowing informed consumers to choose where possible and also in the interests of driving down fees and charges. Some funds are owned by publicly listed companies which are accountable to shareholders. Those shareholders invest in their chosen company with the expectation of a return on their investment. That return may be funded in part by the fees and charges that a company levies on those who invest their superannuation moneys with them. By contrast, most industry funds do not operate on the basis of providing a return to shareholders who mayor may not have a superannuation interest in the company. Instead, most industry funds operate on a not for profit basis, which sees most of their returns given back to members of the fund, an not to outside or arms-length shareholders. Essentially, there are three elements of an industry based fund: they operate on a not for profit basis, in that the trustee, shareholder and beneficial owners do not make a profit out of the fund; they all meet the equal representation requirements, that is, equal representation of employers and employees, set out in the SIS legislation; and they have two or more employer sponsors. Under the government's definition of industry funds, other types of funds which bear little resemblance to an industry fund would fall within the definition, including some master trust type products. The government's definition could mean that, under the choice of four funds model, an employee may not get access to a genuine industry fund with all the excellent features of such a fund. We are not proposing that other funds, including the master trust type funds, be excluded under our proposed amendment. We are not proposing that at all. It is just that they would not be able to occupy the 'industry fund' definition. I have indicated to the House on a previous occasion that research done on master trusts appeared in Personal Investment magazine in December of last year. It went through 65 major master trusts and one industry fund and had a look at the end benefits after 20 years. Guess which one of the 65 master trusts and one industry fund performed best? It was the industry fund. That industry fund's super had the highest projected outcome, being over $100,000 above the average master trust and over $200,000 above the lowest master trust. Without access to the industry funds, which have been critical in driving down fees and charges and expenditure on advertising and other overheads and introducing real competition into the superannuation industry-we have a government that talks about competition, which, in fact, is exactly what the industry funds have been providing-we may see a circumstance where funds' capacity to be involved in future superannuation activities is diminished. That is something that I think would not be in the interests of workers themselves. One of the things that we are most concerned about in this area relates to the key features statements. (Extension of time granted) What we need is comparable products so that people can work out which superannuation fund provides the best value for money. But it is one where the government so far has failed to provide us with information which gives us any assurance whatsoever that they have this under control and that real and valuable information will be provided. I was given an example of a person with an MLC rollover deferred annuity. This person, I can assure the House, is extremely financially literate and would be exactly the kind of person who would be interested in making a choice when the choice option becomes available. He talks about having received an annual statement for the period 31 December 1996 to 31 December 1997. Of course, we are all interested in what management fees the funds are charging. His statement said: The fixed component of 1.32 per cent per annum, is retained by MLC Limited, to cover the ongoing costs of administering and servicing your investment. He rang them up with a pretty simple question. He wanted to know whether that 1.32 per cent per annum related to the earnings of the fund in that particular year, whether it related to his whole investment or whether we were talking about the interest rate which his balance had achieved less 1.32 per cent. Nobody was able to tell him. Trying to find out what the management fee was apparently went on for a period of some years. Eventually, after letters and finally getting hold of the chief executive officer, he had further correspondence which showed that the 1.32 per cent per annum was being charged on his whole balance. Indeed, that was not the only fee; there was a variable component fee of a further 0.33 per cent. When the full sums were done by this person, he found that they were charging him in the order of $577 per annum on earnings of $3,400. That is pretty steep, I would have thought. The more serious pointÂ· was that he was simply unable to find out from MLC on what basis these management fees were being charged. Given his level of interest in these things, it strikes me that, if he was not able to do it, it would simply not be possible for the vast majority of workers to be able to find out from these kinds of investments just what the management fees are going to be or j-st what the exit fees are going to be. I indicated to the House previously examples of exit fees of enormous magnitude being charged and eating up the account balances. I have been provided with a couple of additional examples: one on an FAI account balance of $5,163, with an exit fee of $2,444; that is to say, eating up 47 per cent of the investment. One with Norwich, on an account balance of $3,888, had an exit fee of $2,648--68 per cent of the balance. One with National Mutual, $6,001, had an exit fee of $3,696, with fees eating up 61 per cent of the balance. Finally, one with AMP, amongst these that takes the cake, an account balance of $4,318, with an exit fee of $3,157, or 73 per cent. Those kinds of management fees and exit fees to my mind are outrageous, but that is the kind of practice we can expect to see creeping back into the market, creeping back into the superannuation industry, unless we have the industry based fund option there to keep the other options honest. That is why we have moved our amendment and we believe that, if the government were fair dinkum about genuine employee choice, it would be supporting that amendment. I wish to move on to amendments 2 and 10, which talk about removal of clause 32U, which overrides federal awards. These two amendmentsÂ· operate effectively together. Amendment 10 removes the clause 32U, which is the somewhat bizarre clause that overrides federal awards, and amendment 2 inserts the words 'federal award' or 'territory award' into the government's definition of what contributions satisfy choice of fund legislation. Because the government has chosen such a convoluted and complex way(Time expired)",151

412,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"In relation to amendments 2 and 10, what we are endeavouring to do here is to take out clause 32U, where the government is endeavouring to override awards. It has also introduced another bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1997, which we have also been debating. The Senate Select Committee on SuperannuationÂ· examined this issue and found that it created great confusion. The Senate committee, on page 86 of its contribution, asked a number of questions. For example: would !1ection 32U affect the frequency. with which contributions, are remitted? Would the superannuation guarantee provisions or the award provisions prevail? That sort of issue needs to be chirified by the minister. If we are not able to get clarification tonight, it is certainly the sort of issue that needs to be clarified in the Senate. So we can clarify whether, for example, the effects of Section 32U extend beyond nominating a particular fund for the purposes of an award prior to consideration of this bill in the Senate. It also ought to be said that the government's attempt to override clause 32U is incredibly hypocritical. Clause 321;, the clause before clause 32U, for those on the other side, says that awards will not be overridden for the purposes of detennining notional earnings bases on which to base an employee's superannuation contributions. The reason is that employers will lose the basis on which to determine an employee's salary for superannuation purposes because it is contained in awards. That would mean that some employees could choose a fund which would actually require greater contributions than employees are receiving at the moment, and that would I do not think the cost employers. The government has decided to fix this by inserting a clause which says that even though the award no longer applies for superannuation purposes, let us pretend that it still does so employers do not have to pay anyone any more than they currently do. So clause says the award does not apply any more, clause 32T says the award still applies. amendment lets the government off the hook by deleting the clause which overrides awards. On amendment 2 we observe that simply deleting clause 32U from the bill would that some employers could be in breach of both the superannuation guarantee legislation and the current choice regime 'amendments the same time. Therefore, we have included that the awards in the section of the choice legislaif tion which allows employers to comply with this legislation by simply complying with their industrial award. After all, the government allows employers who negotiate a different type of industrial agreement other than award, that is, a certified agreement and an Australian workplace sions agreement, to fulfil the choice of fund quirements. Why then won't the government allow compliance through an industrial award which is also an agreement between employso ers and employees? Our amendments better reflect the demand for choice, whereas what the government is doing is simply endeavoursuperannuation ing to give the banks a leg up. Amendment 3 goes to the extension of the start date of choice 2-1 July 2000-for new and existing employees. The whole superannuation industry has been calling out for We have seen newspaper reports just in the last day or two confirming that that is the view of the superannuation industry. We it in the Four Corners report, where they called for the start date to be extended. have seen an editorial in the Australian calling for this. Frankly, the government ought to welcome this proposal. With an election coming up soon, I would be surprised if it actually wanted officers of the tax office bearing down on thousands of employers who do not know anything about choice, let alone understand what is expected of them in relation to it. ' Our amendment clarifies confusion between different start dates for new and existing employees. It will allow a full education campaign to be run which will allay employer fears as well as allow employees to make an 32U informed choice. It will also allow the but government to consider adopting the Our opposition's model, which is about genuine employee choice rather than employer choice. What we need first is a situation where you get real choice within funds, rather than just the same four options given to you. (Extenmean sion of time granted) Then you have an arrangement, as applies in New South Wales and Queensland, where employees can move at their money from the superannuation fund it is into a different superannuation fund, they see fit to do so, on their initiative. It is not forced on them. But, if they think that is the way to go, then they have a capacity to do it. Amendments 4 to 6, which we have moved, relate to the default fund issue. Default funds should not be a product to which commisare payable. I think the reason for this rewas made very clear by the Four Corners program last Monday night in which the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) performed well. That reason is the disaster which befell the United Kingdom when it tried to introduce choice. The Senate committee on received evidence which showed that some 570,000 people were sold inappropriate products, many of which were commission based products, which saw a compensation bill of more than $10 billion. this. Should that sort of thing happen here, it would be disastrous. Many people who do not choose a fund will end up in a default fund. saw ASFA has estimated that more than 40 per cent of the seven million Australians with We superannuation accounts will not make an active choice. I think it could be even larger than that. What that means is that those employees will end up in a default fund. What our amendment means is that the default fund will not be one which is sold to an employer, who is forced by this legislation to choose the default fund at the .risk of severe financial penalty, on a commission basis. Commission based products are generally more expensive to enter and exit and to manage via ongoing fees and charges, as I have indicated previously. Labor's amendment is about better consumer protection for those who do not currently have the appropriate level of understanding concerning this issue. I move to amendments 8 and 9. These two amendments are also related to the commission based sales issue. They achieve the same purpose as the previous amendment, except that the outlawing of commission based sales is also extended to employees who do make a choice. Protecting employees from the government's forced choice model is our ultimate aim because, unlike the government, we have not forgotten that superannuation is really about retirement incomes. The evidence is that, if this legislation proceeds, workers will end up with lower retirement incomes. People who do make a choice under the government's regime should be protected in the same way as those who do not. This amendment will prevent commission based sales of products which receive superannuation contributions. This was an issue which was covered in some detail by the Senate select committee. The government majority report of that committee contained an important section on commission driven selling, where William Mercer Pty Ltd supplied the committee with information about the costs of switching superannuation funds in Chile. They pointed out that 29 per cent of fund members in Chile switched funds in the year ending June 1997. Around 30 per cent of the fund members changed. A lot of that switching is triggered by sales people who are paid whenever a member switches funds. Approximately 38 per cent of the entire cost of managing Chile's superannuation system is related to costs associated with fund switching. Clearly that is something that is not in the interests of the retirement incomes of those members. So in our view it is a clearcut issue. Commission based selling ought to be outlawed. I regret the fact that the government is indicating that it is not interested in a more detailed consideration of these issues. I think they are important issues. The opposition is most concerned that the government wants to start this up on 1 July against a background where many employees are unaware, blissfully ignorant, that that choice is about to descend upon them. Many employers are blissfully ignorant of this. The industry is not ready for it. We do not have in place a mechanism for dispute resolution. We have the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal under a cloud. So, for all those reasons, we believe our amendments need to be supported. Therefore we will be pressing them now by seeking a division on them. But we will also be pressing them in the Senate, because we believe these amendments are the minimum needed in order for the choice model to be successful rather than to be a disaster for workers.",153
413,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (9.14 p.m.)-I will make some very general comments to the amendments which have been moved. But I will not be able to go into detail, because of the time that has already been taken. The government will not be supporting the opposition's amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) 1997. It is clear that the opposition amendments are all about denying Australian workers the choice of superannuation funds. This really is the Labor Party's agenda, similar to what the agenda was many years ago when these other funds which the Labor Party set up came in. I would, however, like to make a short statement about the start date for choice of funds with respect to new employees. The bill specifies a start date of 1 July 1998 for the choice of fund with respect to new employees. This start date was announced in the May budget last year. However, it is now clear that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.7) will not be passed in this sitting of parliament. Accordingly, passage will not happen until some time after 12 May. In these circumstances the government considers that the 1 July 1998 start date will not be achievable. Accordingly, the government will be moving an amendment in the Senate delaying the start date when the bill is debated in the Senate. The government is giving urgent consideration to the most appropriate new start date. I would like to emphasise that the government remains committed to securing passage of the choice measures as soon as possible.",155

We therefore expect that, as soon as these matters before the House are completed, the House will then suspend and we intend to resume as early as possible in the morning.

417,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"by leave-I move additional amendments Nos 1-3: (1) Schedule 5, item 12, page 47, defmition of industry-based superannuation fund, (lines 920) omit the definition, substitute: industry-based superannuation fund means a complying fund or complying superannuation scheme that: (a) has 2 or more employer-sponsors; and (b) is a fund which operates on a not-forprofit basis; and (c) complies with section 89(1) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act (basic equal representation rules); or (2) Schedule 5, item 28, page 52 (lines 16-21), omit proposed subsection 32C(2), substitute: Contributions under A WAs, Certified Agreements or Federal or Territory Awards (2) A contribution to a fund by an employer for the benefit of an employee is also made in compliance with the choice of fund requireinquiring ments if the contribution is made under or in accordance with, an AWA, a certified agreement under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, a certified agreement under the Industrial Relations Act 1988, a Commonwealth industrial award, or a Territory industrial award. (3) Sc-edule 5, item 28, page 53 (lines 10-15), OIrut paragraphs (4)(a)-(c), substitute ""before 1 July 2000"". These amendments relate to what are known as third line forcing provisions, and they insert improper conduct provisions into the bill. This was an issue which was considered by the Senate Superannuation Committee, and I will turn to it in a moment. The issue here is really one of protection from improperÂ· employer influence. Of particular concern is the possibility that employers will influence the employee's choice of superannuation fund because they themselves are receiving some direct or indirect benefit from the financial institution where the employee's superannuation goes to. It is common knowledge that many small business operators, particularly in regional Australia, have close relationships with their bank manager or their insurance agent. In some cases, that sort of business contact and social contact would be enough to influence the employer to push employees into the company's products. Even more seriously, you could have the situation where someone wants to maintain favourable loan conditions or other incentives. We would be concerned about the situation where someone went to a bank seeking a loan for business purposes and the bank said, 'Yes, sure, you can have the loan. Now, what about your workers' super?' It is noteworthy that the legislation does not contain any provision equivalent to section 76A of the Retirement Savings Accounts Act-the RSA Act-which inhibits improper 1993 conduct-that is, RSA providers supplying or offering to supply any benefits to employers on condition that employees open RSA accounts or, indeed, refusing to supply or offer such benefits. That is a situation which we are concerned about. It was an issue which was dealt with by the Senate select committee inquiring into superannuation and into choice of fund. In particular, the committee heard evidence that there was potential for employees to be locked into their employer's fund choices where that fund choice was something in the interests of the employer, rather than in the interests of the employees. In particular, the practice of bundled selling was raised as a potential issue, as was the issue of undisclosed inducements and rewards. Indeed, West Scheme provided an example to the committee in its submission and it submitted that there was evidence within weeks of the Western Australian government's choice of fund legislation of employers being offered financial incentives to meet their choice obligations through a particular service provider. The Consumers Association and several other witnesses put forward the idea that there ought to be strong provisions against deals between employers and product providers. They told the committee that those deals work against the interests of employees and unnecessarily restrict choice. Accordingly, they were of the view that we need to get a clear opinion on whether the existing Trade Practices Act provisions relating to third line forcing are adequate for the protection of employees in such situations. We would be interested in any response we could get from the government on its view about the use of the existing third line forcing provisions in the Trade Practices Act to deal with the situation before us. I would ask the parliamentary secretary whether he is able to advise us on whether the Trade Practices Act provisions relating to third line forcing would be adequate to protect employees from bundled selling. In any even, we think the amendments that we have moved, amendments 1 to 3, make the issue clear and put it beyond doubt. On that basis we think that the House ought to support them.",157
418,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"It seems an eternity ago since my remarks were interrupted because of question time some time last week. I must say I do not admire the government for the way it has handled the passage of this legislation, but that is another story. I think at that time. I was talking about the remittances required by electronic means and the implications that had for businesses forwarding payments by cheque which hitherto have been perfectly normal in terms of commercial transactions in this country. I know it would not fit within the definition, but it is almost to the extent that legal tender is replaced, because of precedents and acceptance, by payment of cheque. I started to say, if I remember how events concluded when we last were debating this issue, that if the government or the Australian Taxation Office have a problem they need only to have the current tax act amended to reinstate the measure which once deemed that payment by cheque had not occurred until the amount of the cheque had actually been collected. The fact that Treasury has not pursued this alternative indicates to meperhaps wrongly but I do not think so; I will be charitable and say 'perhaps wrongly'-that improving the equity of the overall tax system has been superseded rather by another tax grab. In the interim, since we last spoke on this bill to confirm that, I have had correspondence from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Western Australia, the CCIW A. Amongst other things, whilst they gave credit to the government for its attempt to rationalise and improve the system of remittance, they have the same concerns as me. They talk, in correspondence with me, about the need for clarification and that the first of the clarifications required is why there should be the need for, in many cases in large businesses, remittances of up to two a week. A large entity which makes a PPS or RPS payment on a daily basis, under the proposals before the parliament, will in the future be required to make two remittances per week under the proposed section 220AAE. Some remittances will be required to be made within four working days of the payment; that is, for deductions made on a Tuesday and Friday. They have to make their remittances electronically within four days. That, is quite unreasonable and anyone outside the bureaucracy with a knowledge of business and the constraints on it, even in this computer age, would understand what I am talking about. A system which is based on a maximum of one remittance per week surely would be more realistic, although, in my opinion, not all that acceptable. The CCIWA seeks the support of members of this parliament to amend the bill in that way accordingly. A second proposal, which is the move to force large firms to use electronic means of payment of funds to the Austrfllian Taxation Office, absolutely lacks any rational basis. The move to penalise firms that choose to pay by cheque, hitherto totally acceptable and normal in a commercial sense, is questionable at best but stupid at worse. The present proposal, as I understand it, requires large remitters to be obliged to-no choice-remit solely by electronic funds transfer. On top of that, they will be penalised a minimum of $500 per remittance paid by other means. (Extension of time granted) There are proposed to be up to 104 remittances required each year by the large remitsurely ters of these tax deductions and prepayments of one sort or another from 1 July 1998. That means a minimum potential liability of with $52,000 per year for large employers who choose to pay by cheque. I emphasise again that that was previously perfectly acceptable and normal commercial practice. Irrespective of whether those payments are received and cleared by the Australian Taxation within the desired time limit, for large remitters with only PAYE obligations the minimum penalty would be $26,000 where they pay salary on a weekly basis or $13,000 where they pay salary fortnightly. You have the situation that the relevant part of the legislation proposed in 221AAW does not seek to penalise late remitters, it seeks to penalise large remitters who choose to use some other more normal and commercially acceptable mode of payment such as a cheque. To put it another way, they are seeking to make it an offence to use other than normal and commercially accepted modes of payment. The justification, as far as I can tell-I might be wrong on this-is that some large remitters may seek to defer payment by delivering a cheque on the due date of payment knowing that it will take some time for the cheque to be cleared. If this is a genuine concern-and I ask the question sincerely-then surely the answer would be, as I remarked earlier before this debate was interrupted, to make the offence rely upon the failure of the payment to have been cleared by the end of the day-that is, the due date of payment. That is a relatively simple matter and not unprecedented. Former regulation 60 of the income tax regulations, which, incidentally, were repealed in 1994 under the previous government, provided that payment by cheque was not deemed to have been made untilÂ· the amount of the cheque had been collected. Such a regulation would surely be sufficient to overcome supposed mischief, at which proposed section 221AAW is aimed. This proposal seems to be aimed at shifting the ATO's administrative costs onto the large business sector. That is plainly unacceptable. In another context it might even be said to be discriminatory. If there is to be a penalty then there must be an offence. An offence in this case is missing. The proposed section will penalise withholders who have complied all their obligations and remitted cheques in payment of tax in sufficient time to enable the Australian Taxation Office to clear those cheques. In such a circumstance I submit to the parliament and to any reasonable person listening that there is no offence. Yet there is Office a penalty attached. The proposal may also be unconstitutional in that if there is no offence the penalty may amount to the levying of a tax. I do not know whether that has crossed the minds of the government, the advisers in the box, the bureaucracy generally, the ATO or Treasury. But it is my understanding that a tax bill may impose tax or levy tax, but not both. That seems to be a criterion which is missing in this case. (Extension of time granted) The area requiring clarification is whether the three types of obligations covered by the proposed measures-that is PAYE, PPS or RPS-would be required to be amalgamated or whether they should be paid separately. It is not clear. Amalgamated payments would cause greater compliance costs for businesses given that payroll is usually handled by a part of a particular large organisation that is different from the part that handles PPS or RPS. On the other hand, if payments are meant to be made separately this could and will, I suspect, substantially increase the penalties. Potentially they could be more than double and possibly treble the number and amount of penalties to which each large remitter is exposed. Equally, the four payments specified - in the proposed section 220AE are treated as separate remittances for penalty purposes even though the legislation suggests that they would normally be amalgamated into two payments. The potential minimum penalty referred to earlier of $52,000 per annum would double to something like $104,000 per annum. It is hardly a hanging offence. I offer the opinion that in the circumstances $104,000 is tantamount to a hanging offence. Since the government announced its amendments, and given the unintentionalnevertheless helpful--elapse of time that has occurred since I last addressed this question in the debate on the detail stage, I have had correspondence from the Taxation Institute of Australia. The TIA has in great depth conveyed to me-and I hope to others; but if not at least to me-that the amendments foreshadowed by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) on 9 March as they affect division 7A have very real defects. The bill itself has been the subject of a hearing-as you mayor may not know, Mr Deputy Speaker-before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which was due to report only yesterday. We are debating legislation in this place without the benefit of outcome of that hearing. I know I have had something to say quite recently about whether the Senate should be conducting inquiries on matters before the House of Representatives which would warrant their assuming that the legislation is going to be passed by the. House of Representatives unamended. I simply acknowledge that there is a difficulty with that. But the point in this case is that that committee is in fact deliberating. I do not know whether it has handed down its report, but given that it was conducting hearings only yesterday I would have to suspect that it has not. In the event, here we are in the House of Representatives in the detail stage of a complex bill of nine or 10 separate and disparate measures talking about a measure which is under active consideration and, by dint of the activities of the relevant Senate committee, that committee is considering the very matters which are of concern to me and to my constituents and, above all, to the Taxation Institute of Australia. The TIA has given evidence to that committee and, of course, it was critical, as am I, of certain aspects of the bill, particularly the deficiency in consultation in relation to the proposed changes to division 7A. (Extension of time granted) The TIA is still of, and I am still ofMrs Sullivan interjecting",158
419,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Moncrieff and the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) might be having trouble following the argument and I can understand their humour. I am having trouble following it myself, but that is not because I do not understand it but because of the stupid way your government conducts the legislative program in this chamber. But that is not your fault, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is certainly not the member for Moncrieff's fault or, indeed, that of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister. The TIA remains of the view, as I do, that division 7A and schedule 8 of this bill, which refers to the anti-dividend streaming and antiavoidance provisions, should be excised from the bill and subjected to rigorous debate to the ensure that the provisions do not continue to create compliance problems with Australian businesses. The continuing problems with division 7A have been tabulated by the Taxation Institute of Australia, but only as a result of the late last minute amendments introduced, in conjunction with the detail stage of this bill, by the government. I have to say, once again, that they have not had time to consider them but have done a remarkable job in analysing and dissecting clause by clause the need to put this legislation into some sort of sensible form. I do not want to pursue that any more. I think I have made the point, but I am not sure that it wiU be registered by my colleagues. Although I understand the very sincere attitude of the parliamentary secretary, I think he has been underinformed and misinformed or whatever it is by the bureaucracy in this circumstance. I want to revisit schedule 5, because there was something I said before the debate was adjourned at question time a week or two ago. I was talking about superannuation in schedule 5 and the treatment of them for tax purposes. I want to add some remarks about the situation of casually employed individuals who have several separate superand annuation accounts-and there are many hundreds of thousands of such accounts, and perhaps they are in the millions, I am not sure-with only very small balances in each. The predicament and interests of those people could be resolved under the terms of this legislation. Current estimates put the number of achowever, counts which form part of the ATO's 'lost member fund facility' at around $1.5 million, amounting to approximately $1.5 billion in benefits that employees have failed to claim. That is a significant figure, and that sloshing around in the system somewhere. I do not know where it is, but I think the ATO is rubbing its hands because it is going to cop that sooner or later. While the coalition is right to implement legislation that will improve the portability superannuation entitlements, and I have gives already acknowledged that, it seems to me that the government is all too prepared to neutralise the full benefits of the initiative its attempt to push the bill through this parliament. That is regrettable, but not excepwhen tional, unfortunately. At a time when the government has set in place a number of initiatives that it hopes will facilitate proved levels of national savings and investmissions ment, the new tax treatment of franking dividends will have the opposite effect. I am on record as having asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) a question today, and I am somemodel. what reassured by his reply, but the trouble is, and I have said it earlier-(Time expired)",160
420,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"There are signals abroad that when we finish debate on the bill we will be able to leave the place, which acts as a considerable temptation to me and, I hope, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Indeed, in the spirit of employee. cooperation we will not pursue this issue to a division, but we do want to indicate our intention to insist on the matter when it comes before the Senate. We might even get so excited about it that we feel the need to accounts divide on it now. The point I do want to make is that the government has announced that it is going to delay the implementation of choice of fund that it has indeed backed down on its proposal to introduce it on 1 July. That is welcome. As I indicated a few minutes ago, it is clear that employees, employers and the superannuation industry are not ready for choice to be implemented now and that the government has finally realised that it has a disaster in the making. What is unsatisfactory, is that the parliamentary secretary did not indicate a date to which the choice of fund would be deferred. I assume that he was not hiding anything, so that means that the government has not decided when it is going money is to introduce choice of fund. Clearly, that is not a satisfactory situation for the superannuation industry or for employers to be operating under, and it is necessary for the government to set this matter right by nominating a date on which choice of fund of will in fact be introduced. Otherwise, it just the impression that what they are trying to do is to slide past this issue on their way to an election and then resurrect the issue in once the election is over. That is simply not good enough. People have a right to know choice of fund is proposed to be introduced. We believe they should move to our proposal, 1 July 2000. We have argued it imstrongly. It is in line with many of the subthat have been corning forward and many of the concerns that have been expressed. While they are at it, they should consider our choice of fund model, which is a better Having said that, I think that we have made the points that we want to make in relation to line forcing and that the government ought to be making sure that there are appropriate protections against employers entering into these kinds of arrangements where the benefit is to the employer rather than to the . Mr ROCHER (Curtin) (9.55 p.m.)-I am interested that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) should interrupt me when I amÂ· in full flow. He made an interesting intervention. I am of a different opinion and, when the debate in the detail stage was conducted earlier, I indicated that 12 months beyond 1 July 1998-and that is, of course, till 1 July 1999-would be sufficient to inform the electorate and the populace at large about the intricacies and the considerations which they should each take when they are adopting choice of funds. I suppose we are only talking about an additional year, but I do not think you have to go the extra year to the year 2000. I was about to talk about this being when the government has set in place a number of initiatives it hopes will facilitate improved levels of national savings investment. The tax treatment of franking dividends will have the opposite effect. I had already acknowledged the answer to a question mine today by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), for which I was grateful. I thought it was very good answer, given the intricacy and detailed knowledge which was required of the Treasurer to give that answer to a question without notice. In the addition subsequently to that answer I was entirely satisfied and reassured. But, when I am speaking about franking credits, as are others, one Perth expert described how the persons who will bear the 'punishment' of this move will be the shareout holder rather than the company. I think I reassured by the Treasurer. However, past practice leads me to believe that the Australinformation Ian Taxation Office, and the Deputy Commisof sioner in particular, tend to disregard to detailed questions which oonvey the will of the government in this place when they come ures down with their tax rulings, tax determinastreaming tions and potential discretionary decisions which, unfortunately, the tax commissioner has been given, either deliberately or by be default. The sentiment I am touching on seconded by Mr Jon Kirkwood, who I menunquantifiable tioned earlier in the debate, and care to look will know who I am talking about. He stated: The paranoia in Treasury, and/or the ATO, regarding franking credits is now so extreme that innocent taxpayers are brushed aside in the endeavour to trap the very few 'players' left in the game. Enough should be enough, surely. How is it that the coalition government is prepared to sanction moves that punish small investors? If the government has concerns about abuses of franking arrangements-and I remind members that it is yet to provide any substantial evidence about such abuse-then, to borrow a metaphor from the Treasurer, the tax net should be cast wide enough to catch the sharks but not the dolphins. Those are not my words but the Treasurer's; some time ago, I the time admit, and when in opposition. The application of the related payments provisions to franking credits is another thing that needs to be reviewed by the government. Under this provision, if a husband and wife of buy shares in the same company but quite independently of each other and one decides a to sell his or her shares during the 45-day holding period, again quite independently of their partner, the second partner would lose an ability to utilise the franking credits because of the supposed related interest. Perhaps the Treasurer or the parliamentary secretary at the table would care to explain exactly why it should be that someone should lose this tax benefit, despite meeting the 'incidental purpose threshold', simply because of their marital status. That seems to me quite of tune with modern thinking. (Extension am of time granted) The financial impact statement of this section-rather, the lack of contained in it-is also deserving mention. Page 5 of the explanatory memoanswers randum, in part, reads: The amendments are a part of a package of meastargeting franking credit trading and dividend that will protect the revenue base. In the absence of the measures, to the extent that the revenue base would not be protected, there would a significant revenue loss. The measures will result inI am quoting accurately and I emphasise has been 'unquantifiable revenue gains'revenue gains, to the extent of people who existing tax minimisation. Apparently, the government believes it is enough to say that the abuse of franking credits is severely undermining national revenue without providing any figures that support such a claim. On page 94 of the explanatory memorandum, the government suggests that the changes proposed in schedule 8 will 'restore underlying principles of imputation system'. It is in that light that the government needs to be reminded that up to 35 per cent of franking credits in Australia are unused because many shareholders receiving them are either non-residents, are non-taxable or are taxed at low rates. The imputation system is supposed to bring about greater efficiencies in the capital market. Clearly, the Australian market is not as efficient as it could be, otherwise the full value of franking credits would be realised. We all know that this is not the first time that Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office have led a joint attack on legitimate tax effective measures, on the basis that they are being abused, without first-or everproviding any information on .the actual cost to revenue of the measure being reviewed. This is not a matter of a one-off oversight on the part of those who drafted this legislation. There .is a definite pattern of behaviour forming here, whereby radical or even moderately less than radical-if there is such a term-reforms are being justified on the grounds of widespread rorting without any evidence to support such claims. I have seen it before: I saw it in the terms of the Fraser government; I have seen it, without much evidence, in the terms of the Hawke and Keating governments. Every other proposal in this bill has been costed, and this information is set out clearly in the explanatory memorandum, yet for the single most significant--certainly the most controversial-measure, the government has failed to provide the vital information that would lend support to the proposed changes. It is a given, I suggest, that those on the government side of the chair will endorse this measure when their vote is needed, but how anyone could do that in the absence of accurate costing is simply beyond me. The omission of an actual dollar amount in the financial impact statement renders the whole point of having a financial impact statement totally irrelevant. For a government supposedly committed to a charter of budget honesty-which I totally the support-and fiscal transparency, which I also support, it appears to me to be pretty comfortable with providing a minimum of data when it suits. That might bl(by design or accuracy; it might be by error or omission on the part of the people who advise it, but the government is ultimately responsible. It is worth remembering that the whole imputation system evolved with a built-in safety mechanism: that is, imputation has never needed to be capped because it is directly proportional to the amount of tax being paid by Australian businesses. The catalyst for the introduction of the imputation system, some 10 years ago, was to stamp out the anti-business practice of double taxation of company profits. (Extension of time granted) As was pointed out by journalists contributing to the 12-13 July 1997 edition of the Weekend Australian, the crucial effect of this legislation is to eliminate the tax bias towards debt instruments which had been an integral factor in the spectacular boom and bust of the late 1980s. In a letter to the Australian Financial Review in November last, Mr Tony Rumble from ATAX at the University of New South Wales also mentioned that fact and suggested: True refonn would seriously examine abandoning the tax difference between debt and equity. Such a solution would take the heat out of the difficulties with the imputation system. Clearly, the government is prepared to avoid such a necessary review or reconsideration. The most critical issue in this debate about the tax treatment of franking credits is that imputation only exists because someone has already met their taxation obligations. Despite what the Treasurer and the government would have us believe from time to time, nowhere was it ever said that the benefits of imputation should only go to the economic owner of the share. The Taxation Institute of Australia has forecast that one advantage of the imputation system is that the perception of the value of imputation credits and the way that this encourages companies to pay Australian tax could well be lost. I do not think that has sunk in with anyone who has contributed to this debate. I regret that, if my assumption correct. If companies choose instead to pay higher cash dividends with no franking, thereby returning to the old days of avoiding Australian tax, there could well be a substantial reduction in the revenue collected by the Australian Taxation Office. Nothing I have heard in this debate, in the supporting papers, in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech or in the speeches of others involved in this debate reassures me on these points. In closing, the way the legislation has been brought on tonight-with the lack of advice and pure chance which enabled me to take part in this debate without any information from anyone in this place-leaves me to wonder just what drives this government. I know that in times of need and when time is running short-and that is not the case tonight because we were waiting on some dreary results from another place-that is not always a fact. But I was totally uninformed that this debate was to be brought on at this time. I have read the blues and checked carefully. I regret the fact that I was not able to be here when the debate resumed. I resent the fact that the government has kept a member of this place-and it does not matter that he or she may be interested or not-in the dark as to what they propose to do. It brings no on the government.",161
421,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (10.10 p.m.)-I say to the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that this was indicated on the blues. The only other thing I can say is that the member for Curtin certainly had an extensiÂ¥e speech and if he had been given more time. I am not sure if we would have got up tonight. I will make a few comments about the amendments which were moved by the opposition in regard to third line forcing. That is what most of the amendments relate to. The government will be opposing these amendments. The government has only just seen the amendments recently and has not had an is opportunity to examine them fully. We understand the amendments are based on a similar provision in the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997. The history with that provision, which was initially raised as a Senate amendment, was that there was at first some confusion about the technical operation of the provision, which resulted in some redrafting. We would accordingly want to be sure about the operation of this provision. More generally, it is not clear whether such a provision is warranted in the context of the broad choice of fund regime we are now debating, as opposed to the narrow choice arrangements which are contained in the RSA Act. It may be noted that in respect of the RSAs and the RSA providers-for example, the banks-the provisions of section 78 of the RSA Act will continue to operate. Lastly, in respect of providers of superannuation products to employers who are not covered by award superannuation obligations, they have long maintained a relationship without a provision of this kind without any evidence of detriment to the relevant employees. Hence, the need for the provision is unclear. As I said, the government does not support these amendments. We are actually opposing the amendments. Amendments negatived.",164

(69) Schedule 9, item 2, page 113 (lines 23 to 33), omit section 109U, substitute: 109U Payments and loans through interposed entities relying on guarantees (1) This Division operates as if a private company makes a payment to an entity (the target entity) as described in section 109V if: (a) during a year of income the private company guarantees a loan made by another entity (the first interposed entity); and (b) a reasonable person would conclude (having regard to all the circumstances) that the private company gave the guarantee solely or mainly as part of an arrangement involving a payment or loan to the target entity; and (c) either: (i) the first interposed entity that is a private company makes a loan to the target entity; or (ii) another entity that is a private company interposed between the private company and the target entity makes a payment or loan to the target entity; and (d) the amount of the payment or the loan is greater than the amount worked out using the formula: Distributable surplus-Subsection 109Y(3) amount (2) The amount of the payment from the private company to the target entity (as worked out under section 109V) is to be reduced by the amount worked out using the formula: Distributable surplus-Subsection 109Y(3) amount (3) In the formulas in paragraph (1)(d) and subsection (2): distributable surplus means the distributable surplus (worked out under subsection 109Y(2Â» for the interposed entity that made the payment or loan to the target entity for the year of income. subsection l09Y(3) amount means the total of any amounts calculated under subsection 109Y(3) in relation to that interposed entity for the year of income (apart from as a result of the operation of this section). This section operates regardless of certain factors (4) For the purposes of this section, it does not matter: (a) whether the interposed entity made the payment or loan to the target entity before, after or at the same time as the first interposed entity received the guarantee from the private company; or (b) whether or not the interposed entity paid or lent the target entity the same amount as the private company guaranteed. l09UA Certain liabilities under guarantees treated as payments (1) Section 109T operates as if one entity (the first entity) makes a payment to a second entity if the first entity guarantees a loan the second entity makes to a third entity (the target entity) and, as a result of the guarantee, the first entity has a liability (other than a contingent liability) to make a payment to the second entity. Example: A private company guarantees (2) The amount of the payment (as worked out under section 109V) is to be reduced by any amount treated as a dividend as a result of the operation of section 109U in relation to the payment or loan made by the interposed entity to the target entity. (3) A private company is not taken under this Division to pay a dividend because of the operation of subsection (1) in relation to a guarantee if the Commissioner is satisfied that: (a) the target entity would suffer undue hardship if the private company were taken to pay a dividend to the entity because of the liability; and (b) when the target entity entered into the loan, the entity had the capacity to pay the loan. (4) This section does not the limit the operation of section 109T. l09UB Certain trust amounts treated as loans (1) If: (a) a private company is, or has been, presentlyÂ· entitled to an amount from the net income of a trust estate; and (b) the trustee has not paid the amount to the private company; and (c) the trustee has made a loan to a shareholder of the private company, or an associate of such a shareholder after the time that the private company first became presently entitled to that amount; the private company is taken to have made a loan to the shareholder or associate, at the time that the trustee made the loan.

(83) Schedule 9, page 122 (after line 28), after item 9, insert: 9A Transitional-written loan agreements Division 7A of Part m of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 applies in relation to the 1997-98 year of income as if paragraph 109N(1)(a) of that Act were repealed and the following paragraph were substituted: (a) the loan is covered by a written agreement that was made before 1 July 1998; and I have moved a number of amendments on behalf of the government in this area. I will give a fairly brief explanation of these amendments. Overall, there are about 83 amendments, so I will be fairly brief on most of them. Amendments 1 to 5 deal with charitable trusts. Amendments 1 to 5 will correct some minor technical errors to the rewrite of the exempt entity provisions of the income tax . law. Amendments 6 to 34 make improvements to the proposed choice of fund legislation contained in schedule 5 to the bill and are generally technical in nature. These improvements have either been identified by the Australian Taxation Office or brought to the government's attention by interested parties or raised in evidence provided to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. These amendments deal with the following issues: first, defined benefits schemes. The bill is amended to exempt from the choice of fund requirements employers of employees who are members of defined benefits schemes where, in respect of existing employees, the fund is in surplus or where the employee has reached his or her maximum benefit accrual. Amendments 6 and 8 to 9 deal with Victorian state agreements. The bill is also amended to allow contributions made in accordance with certain Victorian workplace agreements to satisfy the choice of fund requirements. Amendment 10 deals with contributions under the prescribed legislation. An amendment is made to provide that contributions made in accordance with prescribed laws are made in accordance with the proposed choice of fund requirements. Amendment 12 deals with chosen funds which become non-complying funds. Further amendments alleviate the dilemma an employer may face where it is uncertain if a chosen fund under a limited choice offer is in fact complying superannuation fund. The amendments permit an employer to seek from an employee a statement provided to the relevant trustee that the fund is in fact a complying superannuation fund. The amendments also deal with a situation where a chosen fund or default fund becomes a complying fund. Amendments 11, 13 to 14, 18 to 22, 26 to 27 and 29 to 32 deal with casual employees. The bill is amended to clarify that an employposed er is only required to offer a choice of funds to an employee within 28 days of the employee first commencing employment with the employer. Amendments 15 to 17 and 24 deal with informal agreements. Amendments are made to ensure that, where an employer and an employee have entered into an informal agreement, the employee will be unable to require the employer to make a further offer for a period of 12 months. I turn to amendment 25. An amendment is also made to correct a minor technical fault in the bill. Amendment 23 concerns exempt public sector schemes. An amendment is made in respect of a limited choice offer to include exempt public sector superannuation schemes in a category of an employer sponsored fund. Amendments 7 to 28 relate to retirement savings accounts. Amendments are made to the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997 to remove the exemption for an RSA provider from providing information to an account holder who became an account holder as a result of their employer opening an RSA on their behalf. A further technical amendment is made to the RSA Act to provide that the cooling off period will not apply where the RSA is chosen as a result of the employee exercising choice. Amendments 33 and 34 relate to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. Amendments are made to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to require all regulated superannuation funds to provide information to prospective members and employer sponsors. Amendments 35 to 39 concerning the franking of dividends and other distributions are technical amendments. I turn to amendments 40 to 44 and 80 to 81. The amendments will replace section numbers a used in schedules 8 and 9 of the bill to prevent their unintended duplication. Distribution from private companies are dealt with under amendments 43 to 83. There are a number of amendments to the proposed provisions dealing with loans, payments and the forgiveness of debts by private companies to and on behalf of all of the benefit of shareholders or associates of shareholders. Schedule 9 of the bill introduced the prodivision 7A of part 3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to strengthen the existing rules that treat as assessable unfranked dividends those loans and payments by private companies that are disguised distributions of profits. (Extension of time granted) Since the bill was introduced, a number of submissions have been received expressing concern that in some situations the new provisions may have unintended consequences. In response to these concerns, the government has decided to amend the provisions to clarify their operations. I commend the amendments to the House as circulated.",164
423,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,Unknown,"These 83 amendments represent an appalling process from a government whose legislative incompetence is truly astonishing. We had a situation where the amendments were announced on 27 March with a press release from the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp). They were announced at 4 p.m. on a Friday evening, and then the relevant Senate legislation committee was summonsed at 9 a.m. the following Monday. If we look at some of the issues which are being covered, we can talk about loan guarantees, loans for employee share scheme purchases, distributions by liquidators and winding up loans, trust distributions to corporate beneficiaries, amounts that are not otherwise assessable being treated as dividends, written loan agreements and the like-quite a substantial area and very complex and detailed legislation. However, those who may have been interested in it were given one business hour in order to respond. That was laughable, and the opposition boycotted that whole process. Subsequently, the Senate legislation committee convened on the following Friday. So we had a few days in which to have people looking at the 83 amendments, but in the meantime the government had introduced a new piece of legislation, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1998, and that apparently impacted on some of the matters which were the subject of these amendments. People were trying to worJc out just what impact those two combined pieces of legislation would have. They were in a position of not being able to make an adequate assessment of what the impact on their operations might be. There are ongoing concerns about these matters. Indeed, the shadow Treasurer has received correspondence from the Taxation Institute of Australia concerning these matters, saying that the Taxation Institute in giving evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee was critical of certain aspects of the bill, particularly the deficiency in tation in relation to division 7A. I think that is putting it pretty mildly, given that if you are given one business hour to prepare a response that is the sort of thing you might refer to as a deficiency in consultation. The Taxation Institute expressesÂ·itself moderately. It says that it is still of the view that both division 7A and schedule 8 containing the anti-dividend streaming and anti-avoidance provisions should be excised from the bill and be subjected to rigorous debate to ensure that the provisions do not continue to create compliance problems for Australian businesses. We do have concerns that have been expressed about these matters. From our point of view, we have not had adequate time to deal with them. I want to ask the parliamentary secretary several specific questions concerning some of these amendments to see whether it is possible to get a responsepreferably this Â·evening but, if not, at some time in the future. The questions to the parliamentary secretary are as follows. I draw his attention to amendments 10 and 12, which relate to contributions under certain Victorian agreements-that is, the employment agreements that were in force under the Employee Relations Act 1992 in Victoria. I ask the government why it is seeking to move those two amendments. I am interested in getting a response to that. I am also interested in drawing the parliamentary secretary's attention to amendment 13, which relates to section 32CA. I want to ask two questions on subsection 2. Firstly, what exactly is an employee being required to do? Secondly, does an employee have to get a statement from a fund in relation to this issue. So there are two questions on amendment 13. Further in relation to amendment 13, I draw the attention of the parliamentary secretary to subsection 32CB(2) which says that for the purposes of this part, the holder of an RSA is taken to be a member. My question is: of what is the holder of an RSA taken to be a member? The final matter I wanted to ask specific questions about concerns amendment 31, which relates to section 32QB, which is the section that says that an employer may consulrequest notice that a fund is complying. (Extension of time granted) My queries concerning this are: what obligations does this put on employees? Why would an employer want to request this information? What happens if an employer does not ask for this information or this certificate? Could this mean that they are liable for not complying with the new legislation, and, if so, what penalties might arise, or what penalties might they be up for? I am interested in getting some responses to those questions concerning specific amendments.",175

425,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown, Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate transmitting the following resolution agreed to by the Senate: That in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency: The recklessness of the Howard government in inciting industrial conflict on the waterfront and inflicting unnecessary hardships on thousands of Australian workers and their families.,176
426,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the House from immediately debating this message from the Senate. I move this motion in particular given the new developments arising from this evening's Federal Court decision which has grantedÂ· an interim injunction to prevent Patrick Stevedores sacking its 1,400 workers, and the revelation by Chris Corrigan on the 7.30 Report that he went to the government telling them of his plan to sack the workers but was unable to pay them out. This House accordingly demands to know why Patrick's has got special treatment whilst the Cobar and Woodlawn workers got nothing. Twelve months of plotting by this governhas come undone in 24 hours in the Federal Court. What we have had is the Reith and Howard plot backing an unlawful act, an act which they nurtured, an act which they were prepared to bankfoll. In terms of the history of that, Mr Speaker, I remind you of a departmental minute from the Department ofIndustrial Relations, dated 10 March 1997, which said: Another matter that might be canvassed is the proposition that a dispute-of itself-would produce desired change on the waterfront. The only thing missing was the date that that dispute was to be engineered. It went on: What would be needed for the MUA's influence on the waterfront to be significantly weakened would be for a range of affected service users and providBrough, M. T. ers to take decisive action to protect or advance their interests. Again: Stevedores would need to activate well-prepared strategies to dismiss their workforce and replace them with another, quickly, in a way that limited the prospect of, for example, the Commission ordering reinstatement of the current work force. That was the plot, a plot laid down 13 months ago, a plot that came unstuck in the Federal Court today. What has been the result of all this plotting by the Howard government? It has been that 1,400 Australian workers were sacked last night at midnight, in the stealth of night, in the same sort of way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) got rid of his directorship in the Menzies Foundation. In the stealth of night last night, undercover, with secrecy, 1,400 workers were sacked by Patrick's. As we found out today, the only crime that they committed was belonging to a union. What we have established in question time today is that, apart from the Port Botany group of workers and apart from the Fishermen Island workers who were engaged in protective industrial action, no other workers had been involved in industrial disputation. We ask the question as to why the workers at Townsville, who were conducting world's best practice-they were in a bulk terminal with very little utilisation.of containers-were sacked. What did they do to get sacked? The only thing they did was to belong to the MUA. Motion (by Mr Reith) put: That the member be not further heard. The House divided. [10.37 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Rt Hon.

I want to put on the record the achievements superannuation, because a few facts would not incomes scheme into this country, we had, covered for superannuation. We had 4V2 million million women had some coverage with superannuation. to see the numbers go from one million to three in that time. Almost 89 per cent of women coverage. That is because of the changes majority of workers would get benefit from superannuation. What we had before that time, which is, to, was that, sure, the workers at the top servants-had superannuation. But those restaurants and hotels, the textile workers, the Those women did not have superannuation. They of poverty. We were determined to put a stop of workers could improve their lot and could 89 per cent of female full-time employees it is just over 66 per cent.

So the individual women in all these industries that I have talked about 'individually' is what this government of their employers about their superannuation on the moon if they think that these women have and negotiate a wage increase or a superannuation is going to happen is that these women will and their superannuation become so much over the last 10 years of getting women into go astray. When we introduced the retirement in November 1988, just over one million women without any coverage. In 1995 almost three That is an extraordinary achievement, million women with superannuation coverage working full time now have superannuation that were made in 1988 to ensure that the vast of course, what this government wants to go back end of town-the managers, the senior public who were working in the factories and in the bank workers they did not have superannuation .. were going to look forward to a retirement to that and to make sure that the vast majority contribute to their superannuation. Now almost have superannuation. With part-time employees, 1995. So we do have a very large number of of this legislation before us, which will be matter in awards, because those women who REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMfITEE Wednesday, 8 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE work part time and who do casual work, in particular, we object to this bill. That is why we will who have spoken on this legislation keep asking, could not put it more sharply than this: conditions from some of the poorest workers that happen. We also need to look at what is happening go together. I want to put on the record some employment during the period of this government, recoveries. During the 1980s recovery-from employment expanded by 850,000 jobs. Although of employment at the start of the recovery, jobs created over that period. In the 1990s recovery, we have had a very current recovery is that female employment growth created, whereas in the 1980s recovery we had for women. So not only do we have this government women, we have the actual capacity of women enormous change in the opportunities One of the main reasons that women are superannuation throughout their working lives Another fact that those opposite should bear in average superannuation for women on retirement sum at all-compared to $42,000 for men. The Association of Superannuation Funds superannuation for women. It found that only time actively planned for their retirement, it very hard to find a job and have wages that us just have a look at those numbers as well. incomes are so much less? It is all about their Average weekly earnings for women are around No wonder their superannuation retirement This government wants to do nothing to work. We have seen female employment stagnate increases in the price of child care, driving off, we have this government saying, in this you do get a job, it's going to be much more care bills will go up by $20 a week, and we your retirement. We are actually going to take go and negotiate those conditions yourself.' women will be worse off. That will be the direct is before us. Women who work part time are much more not on their retirement savings. What this necessary for women to spend their hard-earned 2911 will lose their entitlements. That is why oppose this bill. Many of the government members 'Why is it that Labor opposes this bill?' I we oppose it because it is taking away working in this country. We will not stand by and see to female employment, because the two things other facts about what has happened to female comparing similar periods over the last two November 1983 to August 1989-female that accounted for only about 35 per cent women actually gained 55 per cent of the extra different story indeed. What we have seen in the has stagnated, with only 20,000 extra jobs a massively different number of jobs created attacking the working conditions of to find work massively reduced by this that are available for them to find work. less likely to accumulate a decent level of is their very different opportunities to find work. mind in considering this legislation is that the is currently around $17,000-not a very high of Australia commissioned research into 38 per cent of women working casual or part as compared with 65 per cent of men.

Let Why is it that women's superannuation retirement average weekly earnings being so much less. $450, whereas for men they are around $700. income expectations are so much less. improve the opportunities for women to get more during this recovery. We have seen massive women out of the work force. Now, to top it all legislation, 'We don't want you to get a job. If expensive for you to work, because your childdon't want to do anything to help you save for superannuation out of awards so that you can That will not happen. What will happen is that result of this government's legislation that likely to spend their wages on their families, government has done is to make it so much more incomes on their families. Whether it is child NA 2912 care, health care or education, costs have risen to all of those areas. The Association of Superannuation Funds proposal that workers on between $450 and is an associated move that this government thinks for women. The gain after tax is paid and social we are not going to see these workers any better we are going to see is that their retirement much worse off when they eventually retire. We will see what we have seen forever in and women will be very different. That will this government's changes. It will be the case pension, while men will have higher incomes governments have a responsibility to prevent this bill, will actively encourage This government is failing in so many respects failing to create jobs for wotnen, so accumulating difficult for them.
