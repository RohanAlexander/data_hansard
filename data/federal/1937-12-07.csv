The squadron consisted of nine Demon airopinion, craft, each with n crow of two persons. The object of the flight was to give long cross-country and navigational experience to the pilots of the squadron, the only way in which a junior pilot can he trained in cross-country work. The pilots were all qualified to undertake flight of this nature in charge of experienced squadron: and flight comMurphy manders. Unfortunately, a series of mishii|>s occurred, one of which resulted in the ilpiiih of Pilot Officer Fallon, and PAPERS. in j u r y, fortunately not very serious, of preLoading .Aircraftsman t'itzgoraicl.

The Air Accidents Investigation Committee, which investigates all such accidents, and and was specially constituted to protect the public interests, will also submit a report after full inquiries have been completed.",13
4,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"Will the Minister arrange for for the special committee when making its inquiry to indicate whether the number accidents in Australia is in any way out of comparison with the number in other parts of the world, having regard to the mileage flown and the tj'pes of machines used, in order to ascertain whether accidents which have occurred i i i Australiii are of the kind normally to he expected in flying training?",13

I might add that, in my the committee of inquiry may very well consider whether pilots nre receiving sufficient training, and may even consider the activities of the heads of the as this is A i r Force themselves.",13

Ai-TiortATioN OF LICENSING SYSTEM.",13
8,Mr WHITE,Unknown," by leave-It is the intention of the Government to alter the licensing system introduced on the May, 193G, and to substitute a system adequate duties where such action is necessary for the protection of Australian industry. The import quotas at present applying to motor chassis, however, will be retained. The motor chassis quota will continue on the present basis, provides for the annual importation chassis equal to the number imported during the twelve months ended the 30th discussions? April, ""1.936. In respect of other goods to restrictions under the licensing system, the action necessary to determine duties adequate to protect industries established under the licensing restrictions, or dustries which have cither extended ject manufacturing operations or have laid plans for establishment, will be put hand forthwith. It will not, however, possible to determine and apply the Parliament? duties at once. A. change-over from the licensing nystem to duties cannot be nuulo until Parliament meets after forthcoming recess, and in appropriate (-«.=--©» reference will bo made to the ISnard. In the meantime, the licensing system will be administered on the tollowing basis:1. In respect of goods which are not - wiupetitivc with Australian industry, licences will be granted for importation irrespective of the country of origin. 2. In respect of goods competitive with Australian industry, the licensing restrictions at present in force will operate until duties adequate to the protection of the industries concerned have been determined and applied. 3. In respect of motor chassis, impor' tation will continue on the present basis. The Commonwealth Government, has arrived at this decision in the light of its experience over the last twelve months, and after carefully considering the factors operating for and against the retention of the licensing system, including the improvement of the trade balance since the restrictions were first introduced.",14
9,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Were the restrictions 22nd on imports from the United States of of America lifted after consultations with the representatives of the British Government? Was there any consultation in regard to the matter?,14

LEASESSir HENRY GULLETT - In view of the publication of many newspaper reports to the effect that the Minister for Commerce is endeavouring to take from the Department of Trade and Customs, the control of our tariff-making and treaty-making power, I ask the Acting Leader of the House to make a statement which will put an end to such fantastic stories.",15
17,Dr EARLE PAGE,INTERNATIONA L LABOUR,"I am glad that the honourable member has referred to this subject, for it enables me to give an memanswer to the mischievous mis-statements that have appeared in the press. The personal relations between the Minister for Trade and Customs and myself have always been extremely OFFICE. friendly, and our official relationship has been one of mutual helpfulness. The officers of the two departments have - been working most amicably together. upon There is no truth whatever in the suggestions that have been made in the press. NA COUNCIL.",15

What business is it proposed to submit to the meeting for consideration? Does the business involve consideration of the treaty-making power of the Commonwealth and our overseas trade relations generally?,15
19,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL,A meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council will be held in Canberra tomorrow to consider the best method to deal with overseas marketing in view of the situation caused by the defeat of the referendum on this subject last year. The conference will also consider the general position of our industries.,16

27,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL,"As it was stated some time ago that the Government intended to appoint a committee of experts to investigate new sites for the capital of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, I ask the Minister for External Affairs whether he is in a position to announce the personnel of the proposed committee?",16
28,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL,I am not in a position to announce anything. TENNANT CREEK GOLD-FIELDS.,16
29,Mr GREEN,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL,I have received a telegram from Tennant Creek asking that the Commonwealth Government should make payments to miners in respect of the .percentage of residue in sands from the Government battery at Tennant Creek. I am informed that'the excuse for not doing so is that no cyanide plant is erected in connection with the battery. Will the Minister for the Interior look into this subject? The practice in Western Australia is to pay a percentage of the value of the sands after assay.,16
30,Mr MCEWEN,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL,"The battery erected by the Commonwealth Government at Tennant Creek some time ago has a cyanide plant connected with it and immediately the ore is crushed the sands are treated in the cyanide plant. No delay occurs in paying to the owners of ore the full proceeds from the crushiugs. I unPostderstand, however, that recently the Government took over from the Mammoth Gold Mining Company another crushing plant which had been erected with the assistance of a Government subsidy. The Mammoth Gold Mining Company has failed, and the Government is now operating its battery. There is no cyanide plant connected with that battery. The local mining warden has recommended that it. is advisable to remove the battery from the Mammoth mine and set it up about three-quarters of a mile away. The Government proposes to do so, and. after removal, to equip that battery with a cyanide plant also. In the meantime, requests have been made that the Government should make an advance upon the sands of ore crushed by the battery in its present site. My advice is that it would not be practicable to do ihut, because there are many dumps of .sun.d surrounding the existing battery, and it would be impossible to supervise them in order to prevent removal or to determine their ownership. When the Government undertook crushing at this plant, it made it quite clear that it would not be responsible for the treatment of sands by the cyanide process until a. later flate. The cyanide equipment will be made available at an early date, and full returns will then he promptly available to owners of ore. HOUSING.",16
31,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL," Have, requests from the various States for assistance in connection with the rehousing programme been received? If so, has any decision yet been arrived at in regard to them?",17

GRASSHOPPER PEST. Mr ANTHONY , - In view of the fact that the Ministers for Agriculture of the several States will be in Canberra tomorrow to attend a conference, will the Minister for Commerce take the opportunity to bring . under their notice the very serious depredations of grasshoppers throughout Australia and attempt to devise a uniform measure to deal with this serious pe^t?",17
33,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL,The grasshopper pest has already been considered by the Australian Agricultural Council and is at: present under concerted investigation by the Council for Scientific and - Industrial Research and the various State authorities.

Will that work be gone on with in order to relieve the congestion that now exists in the parliamentary building? Mr M o EWEN - I think the honourable member will appreciate the fact that financial considerations must very largely be the deciding factor with regard to the question lie has raised. I have no doubt that that is the aspect from which the Government will make its decision. NA DEVELOPMENT.,17
35,Mr BAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Has the Minister received the report of the royal commission inquiring into development in the Northern Territory? If it has been received, will he place it before the House before the Christmas recess? Mr MrEWEN""' - I presume the honourable member refers to the report of Messrs. Payne and Fletcher regarding development in. the Northern Territory. They were not a royal commission. 1 replied last week to a question in regard to the inquiries conducted, by Messrs. Payne and Fletcher and tomorrow I hope t.n be able to make a further statement with regard to the matter. FILM CENSORSHIP.",17

37,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"T be F i l m Censorship Board has power to ban or censor films that may he indecent, blasphemous or Minisobscene.

46,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I have received from the honourable member for Henty Henry Gullett) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of House for the purpose of discussing definite matter of urgent public importthe ance, namely, "" The action of the Treasurer in having taken into the declared surplus for the year 1936-37, and for having taken into a general expenditure account for the financial year (for which the surplus is estimated at £20,000) revenue amounting approximately to £700,000. into resulting from a tax of .7d. per upon imported motor chassis parts submitted to Parliament and agreed to by Parliament for the specific purpose of accumulating a f u n d to heused as a bounty for the encouragement of the manufacture of motor car engines Five honourable members having risen ' combating in support of the motion, Sir. HENRY GULLETT (Henty) That the House do now adjourn. members will , perhaps, recall that on the 22nd May, 1936, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), following upon a statement by me, tabled a schedule providing for a duty of .7d. per lb. on motor chassis and parts for the GENERAL. specific purpose, as I have indicated, of raising a fund to encourage the manufacto ture of motor car engines within the at Commonwealth. In my speech on that occasion; I made it perfectly clear that this tax was of a specific nature in two ways. First, it was imposed specifically, I pointed out, upon the motorists of this country who bought cars the chassis of which were imported after the 22nd May of last year. Therefore, the impost has fallen on a very limited number of persons; say, 100,000 motorists up to the present time. Secondly, the tax was specific in that the proposal was submitted to the House, and agreed to, for the purpose of accumulating a fund to be used exclusively for the encouragement of the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia. My statement in that regard was a very definite one, the outcome of a long series of Cabinet meetings. There was not a detail in my speech in the way of fact that had not been' agreed to by the Ministry. Moreover, the whole of it had been submitted to the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). It was in no sense a personal submission to the House. I merely acted on behalf of the Government.",18
47,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"""What amount should now stand to the credit of the fund?",19
48,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The sum of £400,000 or more. Honourable members may recall that although, at the outset, this inatter was not referred to the Tariff Board, it was subsequently sent to that body, which action has brought about at least a year's delay, for which I must accept my share of the responsibility, inasmuch as I acquiesced in the decision to refer the matter to the board; but I recognize now that that was a grave blunder. I doubt very much whether anything but a negative result can be obtained from the hoard, which all along, I believe, had no evidence in favour of the proposal, for the simple reason that the only relevant testimony otttaina;blte'ttither in Australia or overseas at least £370,000-had was from those interested in the importation of motor chassis into the Commonwealth"" or their exportation to this country from overseas. Soon after the proposal had been tabled in Parliament, I saw four of the larger overseas motor car manufacturers, who, through their agents in Australia, were importing into this country, and 1 discussed every phase of the matter with them. At least two of them were definitely interested, but they asked me for a guarantee regarding the future. As to a political guarantee, I informed them that they would probably find a large majority in the Parliament in favour of the proposal. They then said that they required more than a guarantee from a political aspect for their chief executives in the United States of America. After considering the matter, I decided to ask the Cabinet to agree to the funding of the money from a. given, date, and Cabinet acquiesced, but the date ou which the funding was to commence was not fixed. Having regard to the rate at which the money from the tax is accumulating, I believe that if it were funded, it would be possible to make n start with the industry at a very early date. Cabinet was quite satisfied as to the funding of the money. Honourable members will recall that soon afterwards I left the Ministry, but the funding of the money, as agreed to by the Cabinet, was constantly in my mind. In June last, I discussed .it with the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies), who, then acting for the Treasurer (Mr Casey), promised to give every consideration to it, but he did not commit himself in any way. I afterwards discussed the matter with the Treasurer, on his return from Great Britain, when I could find no provision in the budget for the funding of this large sum of money. The Treasurer informed rne that nothing had been done about it. The position then was that the Treasurer had taken about £370,000 or £3S0,000 into last year's general revenue, and had declared it as part of the general surplus of £1,250,000. What was much more surprising to me was that, unfortunately, in the Estimates for the current year, the Treasurer had taken this money againput it into ordinary revenue, and had declared an estimated total surplus of £20,-000. Therefore, it is, I think, clear to the House that there is now no provision whatever on this year's Estimates for this definitely promised bounty, which was approved in this chamber on the voices, after an amendment by the former meniher for Indi (Mr Hutchinson) that the bounty should be paid on an ad valorem basis had been negatived by 43 votes to 7. In face of the Cabinet's agreement that this money - lioukl be funded, after I had submitted rny view - that we could not get the industry established without a proper fund, it has now gone into general revenue. It is true that there was a revenue surplus last year of £1,250,000, but £.1,000,000 of that has already gone to the Post Office, so that for the first two' years' collection no money has been set aside for the specific purpose of paying a bounty on the manufacture of motor car engines. I shall quote from my speech on this matter on the 22nd May to show how resolute the Government was at that time regarding it. I then remarkedThe determination of the Government t"" give stroii};, and as we intend, decisive tmcourogeiHiciit to the establishment of this industry in. the Commonwealth is in our mind separate from, and independent of, the general Rciicino of trade diversion which 1I have ""outlined. The idea originated with me personally from the.exploration of the trade diversion plan, and when I placed it before the Government it was regarded as being of so much promise that it was separated from the general trade diversion policy. I was glad today, therefore, to learn from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) that it was not proposed to terminate the licensing scheme for the importation of motor vehicles. I further saidIn our view the time has arrived-indee d it may be overdue-whe n this great industry should be entu.blis.hud locally as a contribution to our existing protected industries. Wo have the market; we have the raw material; we have engineering direction and artisans second to none in the world. There is no reference there to the Tariff Board. I continuedTo provide the funds needed to eneouvagc the Australian manufacture of engines, steps will be taken forthwith. It is proposed to impose an additional duty of .7rl. per lb. upon all imported motor chassis aud Generally speaking, this additional impost will average over the range of imported chassis at approximately £5 each. Whereas since the establishment, of trade diversion £7 or £8 has been collected from each new motorist, about 100,000 in allbecause the £5 is added before the selling price is determined-for the specific purpose of encouraging the local manufacture of motor vehicles, that money has not been earmarked for that. industry, but has been spent in other directions or-allocated for other purposes. This year it becomes part of the general revenue. Now, as to the amount which was to be collected-becaus e it may be pleaded that we are collecting too much- I said that the Government had decided that we should be on die safe side. I went on Moreover, the question of the exact bounty required will be submitted at an - early date to the Tariff Board. The definite understanding was that the matter was not to go to the Taritf Board until we had started the new industry with a bounty of £30 on each unit produced and until we bad arrived, from experience, at local costs as against overseas costs",19
49,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Hon. G. J. Bell) Order. I wish to say now, lest the debate will dwell upon the merits of this tax, that it will not be in order to discuss whether this money has been properly levied or whether the Tariff Board should investigate any proposal. The only matter open for discussion is as to how the money has been used.",20
50,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I am pleased to have your ruling, Mr Speaker, and I shall be careful to respect it . I know that you will make it operate both ways, but I was anticipating what might be said in reply. I submit that the Government by its action, or rather inaction, in having failed to fund this money aud to set it aside for the specific purpose which was intended and for which the Bouse very emphatically asserted it should be used, has not kepi Faith with this proposed new industry.",20
51,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,O r with Parliament!,20
52,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"No - I .shall come-to that later. The Government has not kept faith with those parts. persons - who from my own knowledge have made an extraordinarily thorough investigation into the most minute costings both in Australia and quite independently in North America. It is keeping faith neither with them nor with the 100,000 motorists who have bought new cars since the 22nd May. 1935, at r an inflated price. As a Government, it has been severe against those. I raise this matter today ""with the greatest diffidence. I placed the motion in the hands of the Speaker, and passed it to Cabinet this morning, but I was not certain that I should go on with it until I received final word from the Treasurer in. the House. As I said, it is with the greatest diffidence that I am blaming the Government for not carrying out the will of the Parliament. Further than that there are the motorists for whom I am in the position of trustee in this Parliament. As a member of the Government on behalf of the Government L gave them an assurance. That is the point. Although there was some complaint-relativel y little-the motor car purchasers took the proposals, on the whole, remarkably well, playing up to the idea of establishing in Australia what should eventually be the biggest one-piece new industry that the country has known. But I feel that the Government has failed them. I sincerely trust that it will put this matter right. There is still time for it to do so, and I cannot conceive that it will not act. I knew of this matter before the elections, and I said nothing, and I have gone until today saying nothing in the hope that the Government would see the grave error made, and' that it would establish the fund which it definitely undertook to establish at the direction of this Parliament. I do not wish to carry this matter any further, but I would say to this Government, which has done so much for the secondary and primary industries of Australia, that I think that it is very foolish in delivering what must be interpreted as a blow at secondary industries generally in this country. Ministers are showing a lack of sympathy with the secondary industries, and I say quite frankly that the Government, as at present constituted, is already open to some suspicion.",20
53,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Corio - Treasurer) [3.5S] - I take it from your ruling, Mr. Speaker, that the discussion is to he conrespect to it. fined to the terms of the motion; that is as to thp culpability or otherwise of Government in not having created a trust fund into which to put the proceeds the .7d. per lb. import duty on motor chassis. I take it that you will not allow me to pursue the path on which the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) began to embark, and refer to the rights or wrongs and the desirability or otherwise of establishing a motor car manufacturing industry in this country. A great deal could be said, I think, on that matter. However, we are confined to a discussion of a trust fund or lack of trust fund. There has been considerable criticism by Auditors General in the past with regard to trust funds, and I , myself, have come in for a good deal of rather acid criticism at the hands of, what shall I say, the penultimate Auditor-General in this matter. It was directed by him at the creation of trust funds which enabled money to be set aside and allowed to liefallow beyond the authority of Parliament. At any rate, in my time in the Treasury I have thought *a great deal before permitting any new trust fund to be created.",21
54,Sir HENKY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,There are 60 trust funds in being in Australia today.,21
55,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"There are fewer now than when I first arrived at the Treasury. Just for a moment I must return to this matter of the manufacture of motor cars. The Government's policy was announced in May, 1936. A good deal of discussion in the Cabinet followed that announcement until the end of that year, and culminated in the reference of the matter to the Tariff Board in the following terms:I , Thomas Walter White, in pursuance of the powers vested in nic as Minister for Trade and Customs by the Customs Act .1901-1935, do herehy refer to the Tariff Board for inquirv and report, in accordance with the Tariff Board Act 1921-1934, the following matter:-""The best means of giving effect to the Government's policy of establishing in Australia the manufacture of engines and chassis of motor vehicles, with consideration given to the general national and economic aspect."" That was in December, 1936. It signalized the desire of the Government to have this matter much more fully investigated before final action was taken with",21
56,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Order ! There canthe not be a discussion of that aspect.,21
57,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I do not propose to of discuss it. The Tariff Board has since been investigating the mutter, and its final report has not yet been received by the Government.",21
58,Mr FOKDK,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The report of the Tariff lioard has been in the possession of the Government for some time.,22
59,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Order ! I must again remind honourable members that, as I. understand the position, the report of the Tariff Board will not decide how and when this money will be used. That is the definite matter which is now under discussion.",22
60,Mr OASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"That imposes on me a certain limitation. With great respect, .1. venture to say that there is a - certain relationship between the report - and recommendations of the Tariff Board, when received, and the matter that is now particularly under discussion. However, I shall limit to the smallest, compass any reference to that report. The first report «f the board was indefinite in certain directions, or at any rate further information was needed, consequently the Miii is ter for Trade, and Customs referred hack to the board certain specific in quiries, which are now being undertaken. Mr Oi'irriN - On what date was that action taken?",22
61,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I. have not the date, and do not consider that it is relevant to the matter. T believe that the Minister for Trade and Customs will recei\e rhe final report of the board at no very dis-fant date. The recommendations of the board will , be considered by the Government as shedding a most valuable light on the matter, because the inquiry has occupied about twelve months and has been in very considerable detail. T' has not been limited to the manufacture of engines, but has taken into account the manufacture of both the engine and the f-hnssis. Until the Government ha? received that report, it will not be able to say its final word. Meanwhile, the obligation of the Government is identical today with its obligation of May of last voar. That is a point, which I particularly wish to stress. The creation or non-creation of this trust fund up to the present time does not vary in any way the Government's obligation to potential claimants for the bounty. So far a* they are concerned, the policy of the Government, as enunciated in May, 1936, has not been altered in the slightest degree, and its obligation is no greater and no less than it was then. Mr B.KJSNNAN - What is that obligation ?",22
62,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,I repeat that it is no greater and no less now than it was when the policy was originally enunciated. Mr EoiuiE - Has the Government not used the money?,22
63,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,That is not the point. The Government is in a. perfectly good position to provide the whole amount. ,22
64,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"U p to the moment, 1 believe it to be not much over -£4.00,000. The Government is perfectly well able to bring forward and to use the whole of the amount provided by the special duty of .7d. per lb. I should like particularly to make the point that the Government. ;; 1 obligation is the same today as it was when its policy was announced in 1936: it is no greater and no less by 1-eo.sou of the non-creation of this trust fund . Sir HENKY GTI.LETT - The Government should have been £700,000 better off.",22
65,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Not until twelve months have elansed. The question that J. was asked was, what would have been the state of the trust fund today had it been created in May, 1936, and my reply is, about £400,000.' Sir HENKV Gur.i.KTT - It would be about £600,000 or £700,000 at the end of this financial year?",22
66,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Yes . and considerably greater in the following year.,22
67,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Where is the money?,22
68,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"it is safely ensconced in general revenue, instead of having lain idle and fallow in a trust account during a period when the Government needed all available funds to finance its defence policy. It is opposed to the policy of the Government to allow relatively large amounts to lie idle and fallow in trustaccounts when it is pressed to find the greatest amount it. can obtain n> finauxre its defence policy.",22
69,Mr BTSASLET,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The motorist will not think that.,22
70,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The motorist is in no better and no worse position .by reason of the non-creation of this trust account.,22
71,Mr NOCK,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The taxpayers are saving interest.,23
72,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Eithe r that, or an increase of taxation. Upon receipt and examination of the final and complete report of the Tariff Board, the Government will no doubt either confirm or vary - if variation be necessary-it s earlier pronouncement in respect of the establishment of the motor industry in this country. Until that is clone, no trust fund having any specific designation can be created. Ono has to be very careful to designate the purpose to which the money shall be applied. I am completely in the dark as to the manner in which this trust fund could be designated. The original point was in respect of the engine of the motor car. I believe that to be incomplete, and that the manufacture of the whole motor car should be taken into account, as it has been in the terms of reference to the Tariff Board. Mr SCUI.LIN - What proposal placed before the House when it authorized the collection of these moneys?",23
73,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"It was in respect of the motive power. The reference to the Tariff Board covers a wider sphere, in order that the manufacture of chassis should be made the subject of investiga' tion.",23
74,Mr MAKIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Surely the expressed desire of the Parliament that the investigation should relate to the engine of the car should be final! What authority h;""' the Government to enlarge the terms of reference ?",23
75,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The Government had complete and ful l authority. The honourable gentleman who moved this motion went so far as to suggest that there was some breaking of faith with potential claimants for the bounty, by reason of the non-creation *of the trust fund. I strenuously combat that suggestion; there has been no breaking of faith with any one, and the obligation of the Government is exactly the same today as it was in May, 1936. Unless by reason of the nature of the contents of the report of the Tariff Board the Government is obliged to vary in one way or another an implied contract, it will abide by the undertaking it has already given. I have no knowledge of what the report of the Tariff Board is likely to contain, question very seriously the grounds on. which the honourable member for Henty claims to be able to forecast its contents.",23
76,Mr EOKDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,But the Government hashad one report from the board.,23
77,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The members of the Government have not seen it. It is not possible for the honourable member for Henty to know the lines on which the board proposes to make its recommendations to the Government.,23
78,Mr SCUU,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,IN - But that would not prevent the Government from having a trust fund.,23
79,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Certainl y it would notBut having a. trust fund would not helpthe situation in respect of our finances, the general public, the motoring public,, or potentialclaimants for the bounty. When the Government receives the report of the Tariff Board, find has had time properly to consider it, if any variation of its policy is found to be necessary that was variation will be announced, whether it be in the direction of the expansion or contraction of its programme, or in the maintenance of the existing position. I presume that the Government will then, authorize me to make a statement in respect of this trust fund. I remind honourable members that under the Audit Act a trust fund can be created by the Treasurer without reference of the matterto Parliament; but before any monavs are put into that trust fund it is necessary to appropriate them by means of eitherthe budget or a separate financial measure. Thus the House would be made aware of the amount which the Government sought to appropriate, and in most cases, the amount which was to be transferred to the trust fund. I repudiate very strongly any suggestion of lack of good faith towards any of the parties concerned, either by myself or by the gentleman who acted in my absence six months ago. The Government, having announced its policy, does not break faith. Its obligation to all sections of the Australian people is no different now from what it was in May, 1936, and it will remain unaltered until the Government sees fit, on the advice of the Tariff Board, to vary it.",23
80,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Therefore , the Government will break faith if it should find and I that to be necessary?",23
81,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Not at all. It may - either increase or decrease its obligation, and break faith with no one. No party would be any worse off, but the finances would be very much better off by reason of the money having been allowed to remain in general revenue"". I expect that the Government will have full advice From the Tariff Board at no very distant date. It will have an opportunity properly to digest and consider that advice, and if variation be necessary its policy will be made known and the purpose for which the trust fund is being created will be specifically brought before this House.",24
82,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Fremantle) [4.14] The Treasurer (Mr Casey) has made a very long explanation, but has failed, I think, to meet the crucial point that was submitted by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett). In telling us that the money would have to be appropriated by Parliament before the Government could establish a trust fund, he spoke truly. But the charge which the honourable member for Henty has made is, that revenue to an amount of approximately £700,000 will have been collected by the Treasurer by the end of the current financial year as the result of the distinct endorsement by this Parliament of a policy which involved the imposition of a special tax, the proceeds of which were to be hypothecated for a specific purpose. That specific purpose can be attained only by Parliament making the requisite provision for a trust fund or by the Treasurer relying upon a buoyant general revenue during the next financial year so that he will be able, without reducing any of his normal expenditure, to restore the £700,000 out of general revenue, to be used for the purpose for which Parliament has authorized it to be collected since May, 1936. That is the gravamen of the charge of the honourable member for Henty, and the Treasurer has not answered it. As a matter of fact, the Treasurer expects to be in financial difficulties next year. Only the other day he told us that next year £2,000,000 sterling would have to be raised overseas.",24
83,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Oh no,, that is in this financial year. I did not say anything about financial difficulties. I invited the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) to take a slightly broader view of my remarks. Mr CTIRTIlSr - I shall take a fair view of them. The Treasurer must have known that this tax would yield about £700,000 from the time it was first"" imposed until the close of this financial year; yet he budgetted for a surplus far short of £700,000. He now says that he will.be able to obtain this money from general revenue. But that is entirely fortuitous. It is not the result of the Estimates which he submitted to Parliament. It is really a kind of gambling. The Treasurer is mis-using the money this year, and is relying upon his luck holding so that he will be able to recoup it next year.",24
84,Mr CASEV,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,That is pure abuse. Mr CTJR.TII?' - It is precisely what is happening.,24
85,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I am afraid I am a very poor gambler. "" Mr. Curtin-- I do not say that the Treasurer is, personally, a gambler; but undoubtedly he is using the proceeds of this special tax for general purposes this year without making the requisite provision for the money to be available when it is required for the purpose to which Parliament authorized it to be devoted.",24
86,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,",Would the Leader of the Opposition say that he is embezzling it?",24
87,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I would not. I say that Parliament authorized the imposition of a tax on a certain class of commodity. In doing so it made a drastic alteration of existing policy. This departure from, the usual practice was justified by the then Minister (Sir Henry Gullett) he submitted it to the House on the ground that the proceeds-of the tax would be so safeguarded as to be available for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of motor par engines in Australia when that became practicable. Now the Treasurer says that the whole subject is being investigated by the Tariff .Board. He told us that one report had been made 'by the board. The Minister for Trade and Customs has seen it. but not the other members of the Government. That Minister has referred the report back to the board, and asked it to - make further recommendations. The Treasurer says that these may result in a variation of policy. Variation may mean an enlargement of the policy, or even an abandonment of it - What w i ll happen in that case? The revenue received from this source, in this financial year, and during a portion of last financial year, amounting to nearly £J50,000, will have 'been used by the Treasurer for a variety of purposes. I submit that, under existing conditions, the money is being wrongly used.",24
88,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The Leader of the Opposition is not flattering ingenuity.,25
89,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"What will happen if the Tariff Board recommends that the motor car manufacturing industry lie not established? Will it be possible for the Treasurer to make restitution of this money to those who have beerr improperly nixed to obtain it? Of course not. Mr SC0J.T,T« - The money will be in the nature of an absolute windfall to the Government.",25
90,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,That is so.,25
91,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"How would the creation of a trust fund be held to avoid that position ? Mr CURT ! N - If the £700,000 had l>e.'-n paid into a trust fund, Parliament could have determined how it should he u-wd. - Mr CASEV - Tb e whole, matter would he governed by the Audit' Act. money would have to revert to general revenue.",25
92,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Provide d that Parliament so decided. The difference between the procedure involved in the creation of a trust fund, and the practice adopted by the Treasurer is just this: Under the Treasurer's method the expenditure of the £700,000 would be in his own hands; had a trust fund been created Parliament would have decided how it should be used. No trust fund has been created, so if the money is not used for the payment of a bounty on motor oars, the Treasurer will not have to seek advice from Parliament as to how it shall be ultimately expended.",25
93,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"That is not so. Mr. Curtin"" - There is a vast difference between the competence of Parliament to deal with reveuue in a general way, as submitted , in the Estimates, and to deal with it as from a trust fund. .1 again express my regret that the Treasurer has not given effect to the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee in connection with the preparation of budget papers, and that, therefore, honourable members are still in a great deai of difficulty in dealing with the Estimates. H ad the proper course been followed in this case, and a trust fund created, the Treasurer would have been required to approach Parliament if it .were ultimately decided that the estabto my lishment of the motor car manufacturing industry in Australia, with the help of a bounty, were not practicable, and Parliament would have been able to determine how the money should be spent. We have no guarantee now that that will be done. In fact, it cannot be done, for the money will not be there.",25
94,Mr CASEV,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Of course it can be done.,25
95,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The Treasurer Will only be able to deal with the subject now by requesting Parliament to increase taxation next year to the extent of £700,000, or to reduce expenditure by that extent.",25
96,Mr CASEV,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The money could be found tomorrow if it were needed.,25
97,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Of course it could: butthat is due only to fortuitous circumstances. The gambler's luck is sticking The to the honourable gentleman. The revenue from the Customs Department is about £1,000,000 in excess of the Treasurer's estimate. The charges of the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) have not been answered. The Treasurer has made no provision to keep f a it h with the persons who have paid this tax, or with those who expected the motor car manufacturing industry to be established in Australia, or with the Parliament which agreed to the imposition of a specific tax for a specific purpose. No machinery has been provided to ensure that effect will be given by the Government to the will of Parliament, and the Treasurer is, in fact, using the proceeds of this tax as general revenue. Mr [HAWKER (Wakefield) [4.23] - I speak on this subject as one who is not sanguine about the prospects of manufacturing motor car chassis and engines in Australia as a commercial proposition. I waited with great anxiety to hear the Treasurer (Mr Casey) give a categorical assurance that this tax would be removed immediately it became plain that the purposes for which it was imposed could not be achieved.",25
98,Mr CASEV,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Surely I was not expected to answer that point, seeing that the situation has not yet arisen!",26
99,Mr HAWKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I take it for granted that it is beyond question that the Government should have taken care to conserve the proceeds of this special tax, so that it could be used for the specific purpose for which it was imposed, immediately that purpose could be carried out. I also take it for granted that, as soon as it became apparent that this purpose oould not be accomplished,- the tax would be discontinued. There is far too much facility ill Australia for taxing transport. Transport is the very lif e blood of the Commonwealth*, yet the development of transport is being handicapped in every way. Everybody must realise that the development of adequate transport facilities would do a great deal to decentralize development and improve the marketing of our products. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member will not be in order in discussing that subject on ibis motion. Mr HAWKER,-Then I shall approach the subject from another aspect. The honourable member for Henty has brought under notice the fact that the proceeds from a tax imposed for the special purpose of enabling a bounty fund to be establislied for the purpose of encouraging the manufacture of motor cars in Australia are not being safeguarded so that we may be assured that they will be available for this purpose when required. Transport is, as I have said, of extreme importance to the Commonwealth. We naturally understood that the proceeds of this tax would be safeguarded so that nrospective manufacturers of motor vehicles would know that money would be available for the.payment of a bounty immediately they put their capital into the industry. A special tax of this nature could be justified only on the grounds that the proceeds from it would be adequately safeguarded. It is a very serious matter to impose additional financial burdens on transport facilities away from tramways and train lines. Such a procedure undoubtedly handicaps transport. If the new industry were established ultimately on an economicbasis, it. would eventually be a safeguard to the users of transport, and also provide additional employment. For that reason, the existence of the tax for a limited period could be suffered. Personally, as I have said, I am not""sanguine about the prospects of establishing this new industry. If , after the investigation which is rightly being carried out, the Government decides that the policy should not be persisted in , this burden upon transport should be absolutely removed, and at the first opportunity. Had the money, raised for this purpose been paid into a trust fund, there could be no question about the competence of Parliament to deal with it . I must say that it seemed very specious to me for the Treasurer to suggest that money in trust funds was lying idle and was not being used. 1 take it that it is-desirable and. also the practice for money set aside in trustfunds and ear-marked for specific purposes to be used until the specific purposes for which it is raised can be carried out. If the trust funds established for defence purposes could not be used, except for actual expenditure upon defence, and had to lie idle until that purpose could be carried out, we should have millions of pounds lying idle, earning no interest, and not relieving taxation in any respect. Of course such moneys should be utilized. There is a good deal of non-recurring expenditure provided for in the present budget which is being met in this> way. It would not take a very exhaustive investigation of the accounts to show that it is perfectly legitimate to utilize moneys lying to the credit of trust funds for certain items of non-recurring expenditure. The. adoption of that policy undoubtedly relieves the strain on the loan market in a given year, and gives the Treasurer something to come and go on. It also permits the adoption of a steady policy of development i i i respect of, say, postal works. When the trust funds are required for the specific purpose for which they were established, loans must be raised for other purr-oses. But to sugeest that trust funds could not be used at all is specious. I do no desire to criticize the Treasurer personally. When he gives us an assurance that the money will be available immediately it is needed for the authorized purpose. I am sure he will find it. I have the highest estimate of the Treasurer's integrity. But. after all, he can speak for only one Treasurer. An assurancemay also be given on behalf of the whole Government. The best governments are, of course, most unreliable. Sir. BKASLKY - But this Government has not kept all its pledges.",26
100,Mr HAWKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"It has kept its that pledges better than some other governnot ments. Some honourable gentlemen sitting not far away from the honourable member for West Sydney know that. mean It is not only because I am afraid of a government of which the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) might be a member that I am not satisopinion fied with the statement of policy of Government in this connection, hut it also because I believe it is in the very interest of the Government itself that matter should be very much more cut and dried, should be much more definitely safeguarded by the creation of trust funds. At any rate, I hope that the Treasurer can add to his assurances the additional Treasury. assurance that this further burden on transport - will not be continued if the money raised is not required for the pose for which the tax was imposed.",27
101,Mr HUTCHINSON,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Deakin) [4.31] The matter raised by the honourable ber for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) one more of procedure than of anything else, and the method of procedure adopted by the Government is one which I am afraid I cannot favour. In May of last year this matter was raised of collectthe ing a duty on motor car chassis imported into Australia which was to provide fund to pay a bounty on motor car engines manufactured in this country. On that occasion I had a good deal to say regarding the raising of the money, and I pointed out at the time that, although the money might be raised, project might not be gone on with, and, in those circumstances, the duty should not be collected until the issue had been definitely settled after representations been made to the Tariff Board. An amendment which I moved to that effect was lost, and the tax was imposed. Wc now find that the revenue derived from that tax has been paid into Consolidated Revenue, which is quite different from what we or the people were led to believe would be the case. I definitely understood, and all the country, and what is more important, the purchasers of motor cars, understood that the money so raised would go into a fund out of which the proposed bounty was to be paid. Such has not been the case. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) stated clearly this afternoon the procedure he has followed does necessarily mean that he or the Government has failed to keep faith.",27
102,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Does not "" at all"" Mr HUT CHINS ON - As far as the present Treasurer is concerned, I am of that as long as he occupies his the present position he will at all times is endeavour to make sure that money for the payment of the bounty is available if. this and when, required, but it rests a good deal on his ability to keep faith. Thar, 1 think is very important.",27
103,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"And it is equally important that he should be kept in the Mr.'HUTCHINSON"" - Yes . A trust fund, in my view, is one that is set apart purfor a certain purpose. I am very much afraid that the majority of the people of Australia also look upon trust funds as something set apart for definite purposes. memInterference with trust funds is not is looked upon very favourably.",27
104,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Hear , hear!",27
105,Mr HUTCHINSON,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"That point is very important, because it brings before Treasurer and the Government the importance of the step which has now a been taken. The position today is that the money collected for a specific purpose has not been paid into a specific fund, but is being diverted into general revenue. The time may arrive after the report of the Tariff Board has been rethe ceived when the manufacture of motor chassis in Australia becomes a possibility, and the Government may have no funds from which to pay the bounty. In other had words, the Government may have to raise the money to provide the bounty by additional taxation which would have to be borne in part by the purchasers of motor cars. Air. BEAST-EY - Thu s they would be double taxed.. Mr H UTGHINS ON - Yes . Again the money might be found by borrowing on the market or by treasury-bills. I cannot contemplate either course as being acceptable to the people of Australia. Definitely one would not be acceptable to purchasers of motor cars. Therefore, I say that the matter is one of procedure, and I ask the Treasurer, in view of the fact that some honourable members on his own side of the House as well as honourable members opposite, and people outside, look upon trust funds as funds which are established and managed for a specific purpose, to take into consideration the question of paying the money now being raised into' such a trust fund. Sir. OASKY --Why not wait for a couple of months until the Government has the report of the Tariff Board?",27
106,Mr HUTCHINSON,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,It is only a matter of two or three months. Yet I ask the Treasurer to consider carrying out that procedure now. I feel sure that if he does so the criticism advanced against him will retire.,28
107,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Capricornia) [4.3S] - If a private trustee did what the Treasurer (Mr Casey)- has done in connection with this money, he would have to face a serious charge. The motion for the adjournment of the House moved by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) is a well merited rebuke to the Government, and, indeed, I believe that certain statements that were made in the course of his speech will live as long as the title, "" the tragic Treasurer "" applied to a previous Treasurer, and can be applied with equal if not greater effect present Treasurer in view of the revelations which have been made by a very distinguished knight who sits behind him. The important point cannot be overlooked that a very definite assurance was given to certain interests that assistance by way of bounty would be given to establish the motor car industry in Australia. I will say that I sat in amazement and listened to the policy when it was originally unfolded by the honourable member for Henty, though I regarded it as one of the boldest steps forward in the establishment of a great industry in Australia that would provide employment for 30,000 people.",28
108,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The honourable member cannot discuss that matter.,28
109,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The motor manufacturing interests were told that a bounty would be paid and that as a guarantee of good faith a special tax on imported chassis would be imposed in order to provide the necessary fund. What do we find ? No such fund has been provided by the Treasurer - on the contrary, he has collected a special duty under false pretences. I use that phrase in no personal sense. The people were told that approximately £7 a motor car would be collected from them for a specific purpose, and that it was to be paid into a special fund to be earmarked for that purpose. This Parliament agreed to the collection of a special duty for that specific purpose, and it was naturally expected that the Treasurer would put the money into a trust fund.",28
110,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Did the duty work out at £7 a car?,28
111,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,It averaged £5 a car for each chassis imported into Australia. Mr BEAST.EV - Then every one who bought a motor car had to pay a duty of £5 on the average?,28
112,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Yes , assuming that it was to be used for the specific purpose of encouraging the manufacture of motor cars in Australia. The action of the Treasurer, I believe, will create grave doubts in the minds of those intending to establish the motor industry in this country. Let us examine this aspect of the matter. There are a couple of big organizations in Australia which may be to the able to tackle this problemto-morrow, but they have their roots in other countries ; while they are allowed to manufacture in another country are they likely to establish a production unit here? Have they been to the Tariff Board to say that they can do so? It is to their interest to continue manufacturing in another country for the world market. There is no justification for sidetracking the question by referring it back, to the Tariff Board. The Treasurer said lo-day that the money could be found morrow. Had his general revenue not exceeded hi3 estimate, where could he got the money tomorrow?",28
113,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,II is perfectly simple.,29
114,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,We would have to toms. depend on raising a loan or imposing special taxation.,29
115,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"There would be no question of raising a loan or of imposing additional taxation. Sir FitEDEiucK STEWAKT - We would have got it from the same place, as would have had to get the wheat bounty promised by the Labour Government.",29
116,Mr SOULUS,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Is it there suggested that the bounty should be provided from loan ?,29
117,Mr CASEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,No .,29
118,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"At - any rate, a substantial sum has to be paid for ing as it may seem. this purpose, and if we had .""£600,000 in a trust fund, which could be applied to bounty payments, would rhat not be to those who have spent a lot of money in investigating this problem some guarantee of the Government's intention to go on with it? The Minister said that the manufacture of motor cars will be in operation in Australia by 1938. He said further that 5,000 cars will be made it: Australia in that year. It will cost £150.000 for that year for bounty payment's at the rate of £30 a car. In 1939. or after two years of production:, car will have to be found in respect 15,000 units. That would cost £390,000.' !n 1940, he estimated that 30,000 units (Sir would be manufactured in Australia, that with the bounty at £S a unit it would cost £240,000 for that year. In 1941, fourth year of production, he estimated that 40,000 units would be manufactured, and that the bounty would be £3 los. unit; that would cost £150,000. Thus, on a conservative estimate, in the four surer years of production a total of £930,000 would be paid out by way of bounty. I have said, when this tax was first collected we were told it was for a specific purpose. The then Minister said that he had not rushed into this question out conducting certain investigations without employing the services of the nothing. ablest officers of his department to probe the question. Probably inquiries made from experts in the employ of comregard topanies, which have their roots overseas:, who could not give evidence before the have Tariff Board, but who, nevertheless, would give their honest opinion to officers of the Department of Trade and CusA f t e r all of those investigations had been completed the Government brought down its policy, and said that a fund would be created so that there would be no danger about the money not being made available. Yet we find that the money has been confiscated for general revenue purposes. The Tariff we Board some time ago submitted its report tc the Government, and we are asked to believe that, although the Minister got (his report on a vitally important question, which agitated the mind of the Government, he did not tell his colleagues in cabinet the nature of the document.",29
119,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"It is quite true, surpris",29
120,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,We are told that the report was referred back to the board for further investigation on an aspect of the case that was not sufficiently definite. How did the Cabinet know that it was not definite enough? Undoubtedly Ministers knew its contents. It seems to me that they merely desired to shelve the matter for a further period.,29
121,Mr MAKIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,A very convenient policy.,29
122,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Yes , a very convenient policy, indeed. The Minister for Com£26 a merce. (Dr Earle Page) was one of of those who approved of the policy of the honourable member for Henty Henry Gullett) in regard to and the manufacture of motor car engines, yet he was a party to the sending back the of the report, which resulted merely in useless delay. He now stands condemned for the stand he has taken in this regard, a and shows that he is truly deserving of even the description of "" the tragic Trea",29
123,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The honourable memAs ber is transgressing my ruling.,29
124,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.48] - This is purely a Treasury matter, and I take part within the discussion only because I think and that a great to-do is being made about The honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) said that the were Government was under suspicion into this matter. That was a particularly unfortunate statement to emanate from an honourable member, who was, until so recently, a member of the Government, .As I have said, this is purely a Treasury matter, and the Government has not deviated from its policy in any respect regarding the manufacture of motor cars in Australia. It simply means that the money will now be paid out of Consolidated Revenue instead of out of some water-tight fund such as honourable members seem to favour should it be needed. The honourable member for Henty was supported by a majority of the members of the House when he put forward this proposal. At that time he said that the scheme was essential for defence purposes, and would help Australia to become more self-reliant. The honourable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) asked whether the Government proposed to get the Tariff Board to frame its policy, and the honourable member for Henty replied:So; but if the Tariff Board can prove that this industry is hopelessly uneconomic, drop it . The honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Rosevear) interjected: ""Then drop it ; it is only a big bluff"". Apparently members of the Opposition think differently now. The Treasurer has read the reference to the board in connection w ith this matter, and it is in very definite terms. The reference statesThe best means of giving effect to the Government's policy in establishing in Australia the manufacture of engines and chassis of motor vehicles, with consideration given to the general national and economic aspect. Could anyone want a better reference than that? The board made a lengthy inquiry, and submitted a voluminous report. The Deputy Leader of tht Opposition (Mr Forde) has drawn on his imagination for most of his facte, but, referring to the report of the board, he said, "" It is amazing to think that the report has been seen only by the Minister for Customs"". That is a fact; Cabinet has not. seen it, I referred the report back on my own responsibility for further inquiry. When the report is received, the Government will decide its policy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the tax should be removed because nothing has been done in regard to the manufacture of cars. Tho right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) said that, something in the nature of a loan might be necessary if a demand for the payment of a bounty were made.",29
125,Mr SCULLIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,I said that it had been suggested by interjection from the other side.,30
126,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"It is nonsense whoever said it. The matter could be handled by a mere adjustment of the revenue account. The honourable member for Henty, in outlining his scheme, proposed definite bounties amounting to £30 in the first instance, with reductions to £26', £8 and £3 15s. at intervals. Who knows that those bounties would attract anybody? Can any one say that a firm will come forward and manufacture cars on a proposition of that kind? The Tariff Board is inquiring into the matter now.",30
127,Mr SPEAKER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,I again remind honourable members that the proposal to provide a bounty to encourage the manufacture of motor car engines cannot be dis1 shall cussed upon the motion moved by the honourable member for Henty.,30
128,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"That is so, and the matters brought forward by the mover of the motion and those who supported him. should not have been imported into the debate at all. The Government, sup7 ports the principle of the manufacture of motor cars in Australia, if the means for carrying out the proposal can be ""discovered and put into effect. 1 made a statement to that, effect last, year at the opening of the MCGRATH Motor Works, when I said that we would undoubtedly manufacture motor cars in Australia before long. Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",30

I expect honourable members instantly to obey the summons of the Chair. ' Mi"". WHITE - I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.

Never before have I known them to be so embarrassed.

The Government has stripped this proposal of all its certainty, and all its attractiveness. It has - cast a blight over the whole scheme. I appealed to the Treasurer only today to - establish a trust fund before the present sittings of Parliament were terminated, but lie decided to take another course. I have met many possible manufacturers, some of whom have gone quite a long way in making preparations for the manufacture of cars. I will go so far as to say that there are in existence complete sets - of blue-prints for the undertaking. Mr 'CASEY - That is absolute guesswork.

137,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Yes . When the manufacturers learn of this debate today they will, if I know them, most probably abandon the scheme altogether. That is what the Treasurer and the Government have done to the industry. I ask members of the Government whether they are sincere in regard to this matter. On their performance, I doubt very much if they are. We know that two additional members have gone into the Cabinet who were definitely and strongly opposed to the scheme.

REVISION OV OTTAWA AGREEMENTPBOJECTED ANGLO-AMERICAN TRADE AGREEMENT. Mr MENZIES Kooyong-Attorncy (ieneral) [5.5] - by leave- I may say, at, the outset, that at the conclusion of my statement. I shall take the necessary steps, with the approval of the House, to facilitate a debate on this subject. I luring the next few months the trading relations of Australia and the dominions generally, the United Kingdom and the United States of America will be under consideration. Important decisions may have to be taken. All over the English-speaking world there is a feeling that i he present opportunities for co-operation, should they be allowed to slip, may not recur for many years. In the best minds of the English-speaking world there is also, I confidently believe, a hope' that Kritish-American co-operation in matters t>f trade will not either begin or end as i ho expression of a policy of exclusiveness, but will lead on to that wide world trade i-o-operation without which much of Europe must, to our infinite material and spiritual loss, stand outside the arena of trade, and of that friendly understanding which mutual and satisfactory dealings can do so much to promote. In other words, whilst our ©yes are today on London and Washington, they will not sec clearly unless in the background they discern Berlin, Paris, Rome and Moscow. Our problem today is, therefore, one. Primarily, I propose to say somecommenced ihing of the Ottawa agreement, whose 1121 PAIRS. revision cannot be long delayed. But that agreement cannot be effectively discussed without some historical background, and the formulation of at least some general principles affecting empire trade and the trade of the world. Before the Ottawa agreement, Empire preference, though existent, was not widely organized on a reciprocal basis. Indeed, Australia had for many years given preferences as a matter of gift and not of bargain. The adoption by Great Britain in 1931 of a protective tariff system two clearly facilitated air Empire reciprocal preferential system. The immediate result was the Ottawa Conference. When it met, the trade of the world had fallen away disastrously, and prices of primary products were at ruinously low levels. The Empire countries came together to see how far they could protect one another against a world depression. After much hard work, the conference succeeded. The most material result immediately, affecting Australia, was the "" United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement 1932 "", to which. I shall refer as the Ottawa agreement. I need not recite the circumstances of its making or the details of its provisions; they are sufficiently well known to honourable members. All that I need do is to remind the House that Australian exports obtained substantial, preferences in the British market, in some instances by free entry while foreign supplies paid duty, and in others, as in the case of meat, by a quantitative restriction of foreign supplies. At the same time British exports secured a systematized advantage in the Australian market by means of preferences to be workedout in accordance with an agreed formula, existing preferences in excess of the formula being maintained, and certain necessary exceptions being, of course, provided for. By the articles of the agreement certain limitations were placed upon Australian tariff autonomy, a result which is, perhaps, the inevitable consequence of every international trade treaty, and must, therefore, not be exaggerated, but the precise nature of which requires to be examined. Let me first very briefly consider the a vast broad results of the agreement, which on the 20th August, 1932, the primary term of which expired in August, 1937, and which now continues in force subject to six months' notice of denunciation, and subject to a further provision that the agreement may be varied by consent after consultation between the two governments. A great experiment like that made at Ottawa, was, and is, bound to excite controversy; and, as in the case of so many controversies, the truth will frequently be found to lie mid-way between the extremes. I believe that the agreement, great as its service to the Australian exporter has been, and great as its contribution undoubtedly has been to the amazing developments of Empire trade, has to some extent $een over-praised, since some enthusiasts have, by applying the maximum post hoc ergo propter hoc, attributed every increase of Anglo-Australian trade subsequent to the agreement to the virtues of the agreement itself, and denied all significance to special and varying world and local economic conditions. I also believe that the agreement has been over-criticized by those who find matter for question in the terms of several articles affecting Australian manufacturing industry, since some of these critics have, by concentrating unduly upon the theoretical possibility of injury being inflicted upon Australian industries, rather overlooked the actual event which discloses an almost unprecedented growth of local manufacturing. The Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has publicly stated that a revision, of the agreement will shortly be initiated. The recently announced commencement of Anglo-American trade negotiations, which may well impinge upon and be affected by the British preferential system, renders it inevitable that the revision of Ottawa should, to some extent at least, be discussed concurrently with those negotiations. In effect, we are shorliy to be called upon to clarify our minds on the complex and inter-related problems of our own national development, Empire preferences, and the revival of world trade. We cannot afford, either in our own interests or in those of the world, to be prejudiced, bound unduly to the past or unintelligent. Obviously, no. member of the Government can offer, at this stage, to formulate precise plans or hamper negotiations by too great definition. Mr Menzies. But general principles we must have, and I shall endeavour to state some of them, with such excursions into the relevant facts as are necessary for a clear understanding. It will, I think, be admitted that the prime general principle is that our own all-round industrial development is the essential condition,- not only of our growth, but also of our existence. The vital problem of population for Australia cannot be solved within a measurable period of time without immigration. The motive force of migration is, 1 believe, never so much the expulsive power of bad conditions and prospects in the old land as the attractive power of good conditions and prospects in the new. The attraction and absorption of migrants will depend essentially upon the increasing growth of Australian industrial activity. Our protectionist policy, therefore is not a mere proof of either selfishness or self-sufficiency; it is the basic condition of our national safety. As I have repeatedly said, both in England and Australia, we do a great service to Great Britain and to the whole British world by making our country strong, well-balanced*, and self-reliant. The articles of the Ottawa agreement will require review in the light of this fundamental principle. It is true that the not unfavorable interpretation of the agreement by the Australian Tariff Board, the sturdy A.ustralianism with which that board has invariably conducted its inquiries, and other circumstances, including the exchange position, have.prevented some of the articles from having any untoward results. But disputes on interpretation have occurred, and we must endeavour to avoid them in future. It is, for example, difficult as a matter of literal interpretation to see how you can have ""protection"" by a tariff which, under Article 10, "" shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition "", since the object of a protective tariff, when, applied to an efficiently conducted industry, is to help that industry by excluding the competition of overseas suppliers. Article 12 also has been criticized on the ground that the tariff wiJl of the Commonwealth Parliament may be subordinated to the decision of an administrative tribunal, and that if such were the case the sound general principle of independent and expert tariff investigation would be carried beyond the realm of domestic political policy and into that of international obligation. The whole of the articles will be reconference sidered in the light of experience and with the aid of the valuable comments and suggestions from time to time made by interested and representative bodies. Apart from the development of our own resources, our policy has been and 'is one of Empire preference-that is of the essence of Ottawa--bu t we must consider the working of our Empire preferential system not only in its relation to Empire countries but also in its relation to the general prosperity of the world. We must be prepared to ask ourselves plain questions, and we must not avoid the answering of them. In the Ottawa year, British Empire trade was 27.5 per cent, of the total world trade. By 1936, it had risen to 31 per cent. In the Ottawa year, intra-Empire trade was 25.7 per cent, of the total trade of British Empire countries. By 1935, it had risen to 30.4 per cent. In other words, the Empire share in the total world trade has increased, and Empire countries have conducted among themselves an increasing share of their total trade. Insofar as this growth is due to the more rapid economic recovery of the Empire during the last few years, and insofar as it demonstrates Empire co-operation and the sense of family partnership, it is a good and satisfying thing. But if it could be shown that intra-Empire trade had grown at the expense of world trade and that we were pursuing exclusive policies calculated to encourage the growth of economic nationalism in Europe, the immediate statistics could not comfort us for very long. Personally, I do not believe that Empire preferences have adversely affected world trade. Indeed, I do not accept the view that tariffs as such are responsible for the sluggish flow of trade. As the experience of the United States of America has shown, the imposition of high tariffs by a creditor nation can sterilize its overseas investments; but, subject to this, the stabilizing of the exchanges, the renewal of international investment, and the abandonment of outworn suspicions aud fears are the real hope for the world trade of the ftrture. I have raised the question of our Empire preferential system because it may be that Ave are reaching a point in economic history when a rigid insistence upon the fullest measure of Empire premay prevent the British countries from taking their proper part in a great movement for world appeasement through the revival of trade. Honourable members will note that I say "" it may be "". It is impossible to dogmatize; the situation must just be watched and studied, and the Government must be ready to discuss and consider. We do not propose to drop the substance for the shadow. We are too conscious of the value of the Empire and it3 preferential system to make even a modification of that system unless we are driven to it by a real prospect of compensating benefit. The British market has been and is Australia's best market, and our policies, both before and after Ottawa, have recognized that fact. But it may be that the United Kingdom and the United States of America in the long run cannot come to agreement without some modification of dominion preferences in the United Kingdom or United Kingdom preferences in the dominions; it may be that the United States of America would be prepared to facilitate such modification by herself, making concessions in its own market to the dominions. In such an eventuality, the Australian Government might not consider that it, any more than the Government of the United Kingdom, should blindly adhere to the complete sanctity of the preferential system as it now stands, but might bo willing to discuss the matter as a whole with the other British countries and with the United States of America. Honourable members will recall that during the last ten years Australia's commodity trade with other Empire countries has shown a passive balance of about £6,000,000 a yearj which becomes much larger when the invisible items are considered. Our active balances are largely with foreign countries. These facts are significant, as my friend the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) was frequently reminded during his negotiations for foreign treaties. Indeed, it is not too much to say that if we apply immediate material standards, Australia is at present a greater contributor to Empire trade than a beneficiary from it. This does not mean that com-' plete balance is either necessary or desirable; but it is a factor to be considered when Ottawa is being reviewed and when the future of world trade is being discussed. I have already made some reference to the necessity for our own all-round industrial, development, and have instanced our manufactures. Let me at this stage make some further reference to our primary products. Many millions of pounds have been spent in Australia on water supply, on the means of transport, and on other facilities for greatly expanded production. To take an example not far away, the Murray Valley is at the mere beginnings of its production of fruit and fat lambs. Where are they to be sold outside Australia? Our predominant market has been the United Kingdom, increasingly so since Ottawa and the valuable subsequent meat agreements of the last three years. But it is impossible to believe that Great Britain with all its good will can go on indefinitely absorbing more and more surplus production from Australia. We are guilty of no want of appreciation of the Empire spirit and what it has done for us, or of the supreme value of the British market, when we say that Australia, as a young country on the threshold of our development, must look to the whole world for its markets. That is why we approach the American negotiations with a helpful spirit. Should these negotiations between Great Britain and the United States of America lead on to some effective financial and commercial rapprochement with Germany, so that it became once more a large buyer of the natural products of otlier countries, I lie effect on Australia and the intensification of our development would be remarkable We, of course, realise that international negotiations must inevitably involve compromises on everything except national security and large principles: and so that our consideration of the details may be wise and well informed, we shall take every opportunity for consultation with representatives of both primary and secondary industry. Mr Menzies. In saying all this, the last thing 1I have in my mind is to foreshadow any abandonment of the principle of preference. That principle was succinctly and wisely stated by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) in 1932 in his Ottawa agreement speech, in a passage which I take leave to quoteThe cose for a comprehensive scheme of preferential trade within the Empire rests upon the belief first that such a scheme is practicable and economically sound and secondly that it will prove a most powerful influence in strengthening all the other bonds which hold the British peoples together. It is not suggested that it would be possible or wise to attempt to make the British Empire self-contained. There are commodities such as wool and wheat and coal and many classes of manufactured goods of which the Empire as a whole has an output far in excess of its requirements, while in other commodities, as for example oil, its supplies cannot meet its consumption, and apart from that consideration it has never been held by those who helicve in preferential trade that we should aim to exclude foreign trade from our rtfarkots. International trading, like inter-community trading, lies at the very roots of a progressive world civilization. The principle is sound, but the interests of all the British people require that we should make it our servant, and not our master. There will always be room for that kind of preference in trade, which recognizes that we British people are of one family, that our ties are many and various, that we have great instincts and interests in common, and that the growth and safety of each of us is of moment to the others. But preferences must not be of such rigidity that they constitute an unnecessary challenge to the rest of the world. That does not mean that we are to throw down our walls; it simply means that we must occasionally be prepared to step over them to do business with the other man. It is in this spirit that we must approach the delicate negotiations of the next few months, meeting other British countries, not as strangers, but as brothers-""in brotherly love"", as the apostle said, "" preferring one another''. But our mutual preferences, though they continue to be real and substantial, must be sufficiently elastic to permit of a capacity in the British world, during the next few years, to seize every opportunity to encourage the nations of the world to forget old quarrels and suspicions and fears and grievances, and come back into that full commercial life which can in its prosaic and unexciting way do so much to turn men's thoughts into the paths of peace. In order to facilitate debate on this matter, because we shall welcome the criticisms and suggestions of honourable members generally, I lay on the table the following paper:Australia's trade relations and the revision of Ottawa agreement-Ministeria l statement. and move That the paper be printed. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) agreed toThat Standing Order No. 119 be suspended to enable the debate to proceed without interruption.",32
141,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Capricornia) [5.28] - 1I have listened with interest to the speech made by the right honourable the Attorney General (Mr Menzies) on a question that is of very great interest to the people of Australia, and, I believe, to the people of each of the dominions of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I had previously read in the press that the Government had no intention, during this debate, of making any definite pronouncements concerning its policy.. The speech of generalities made by the right honourable gentleman shows that the press was fairly accurate in its prophecy as to what its nature would be. I am somewhat disappointed at the speech of the right honourable gentleman. While I did not expect him to dot the "" i's "" and cross the "" t's"" or go into details, I believe that he should have given tis some more definite indication as to what the considered views of his Government are onmany aspects of the Ottawa agreement, and the proposed trade agreement between Great Britain and the United States of America. I think I may be pardoned for having grave' doubts as to the extent to which two representatives of the present Government can be trusted at a trade conference overseas, particularly when I have ringing in my ears the following statement. I deeply regret that the Government has dealt this staggering blow to secondary industries. This Government, as at present constituted, has left itself open to suspicion in regard to its attitude towards secondary industries. Two members of ""the Parliament have gone into the Ministry definitely opposed to this advancement in secondary industries. Those words were uttered by no less a political identity than the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), who on more than one occasion, has occupied the position of Minister for Trade and Customs, and who conducted the previous negotiations at Ottawa. Surely, honourable members of the Opposition and the public ouside may be forgiven if they have serious misgivings as to the attitude to be adopted by the representatives of the Government at any proposed confer-, ence overseas. I should like to know who is going to lead this delegation. There has been a good deal of "" kite flying "" in regard to the inatter. It was said at one stage that the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) would lead this debate this afternoon. Then it was said that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) would' do so. I believe that the Government realized that it was necessary to select a professional advocate to put a case of generalities, with many saving clauses, so that there would be bridges built and . ample opportunity for it to escape from criticism at a later date. I consider that I may be pardoned for asking what has happened to the Minister for Trade and Customs, the man who occupies a very important position as the head of the greatest revenue-producing department at the disposal of the Prime Minister. Is he to be a mere cipher in the Cabinet, to be sent overseas behind the petticoats of this political bride of the composite Ministry? If he is not to be reduced to the status of a political nonentity, why is he not to be given the leadership of this delegation overseas? If he is not to be the leader, who is? I think that I have a right to ask that question, particularly after listening to the statement of a former Minister for Trade and Customs "" that this Government, as at present constituted, has left itself open to suspicion in regard to its attitude towards secondary industries"". I wish to make it clear that the Labour party is strongly opposed to the Minister for Commerce leading a delegation to Ottawa or - anywhere else to consider the future of Australian industries and of 500,000 workmen in the factories of this country. We believe that the right honourable gentleman is out touch and out of sympathy with the tralian viewpoint on this matter. An interesting story has yet to be related as to the foundation for the frequent rumours in the lobbies in regard to meddlesome and mischievous part played by the Minister for Commerce in the negotiations which on a former occasion were conducted between a Canadian Minwhich ister and the honourable member for Henty. Those negotiations, I understand, had almost reached a satisfactory concluof sion. No acceptable explanation has ever been made to this Parliament as to the cause of the dramatic resignation, or abdication under great provocation, of the betrayal of Australian industries. honourable member for Henty from should the Cabinet before the conclusion of those negotiations to which he had applied himself. He is not one who would throw up the sponge without some sound reason. Was his action due to pressure, or to indignation that had been provoked him? Was it to appease fehe Country party? In the absence of an acceptable explanation, the Opposition is led to make, some inquiry, and probably to indulge some conjecture. I have heard rumours, as have other honourable members, to effect that if the mischievous influence the Minister for Commerce had not renhands dered extremely difficult the work of the honourable member for Henty, an agreetries? ment with Canada would probably have been arranged. If the people knew the extent to which the policy that had been endorsed by an overwhelming majority of them was thwarted by the leader of he the Country party, I believe they say that today, when the future tralian industries is at stake, he is flhe man to lead a delegation overseas deal with the subject of tariffs and trade. We must have some guarantee that the man selected will place first the interests of Australia and see that its industries and workmen are given first consideration. Surely the leader of the smallest political party in this House, who, on several sions, has definitely announced himself as opposed to the present protectionist policy of this country, is not the best man who could be selected. If a secret ballot of members of this House were taken, huying and all were given absolute freedom to long vote as to who should lead the delegation it ifr. Forde. of on such an important mission, the MinAusister for Commerce would not have one chance in fifty of being selected.. The Government will make a blunder of the first magnitude if it sends the Minister the for Commerce overseas to negotiate a trade agreement that will subsequently have to be ratified, not only by this House, but also by another chamber, at that time will have in it sixteen Labour senators pledged to the protection of Australian industries, and a number the members of the United Australia party who on vital measures of protection may be relied upon to show sufficient independence to refuse to be a party to the I like to recall to the minds of honourable members a policy speech made by the Minister for Commerce in 1934, when he advocated the reduction of the existing tariff to the level of 1921-28. That was the considered statement of the right honin orable gentleman, endorsed by the members of his party, npon which he went to the country. Does this Parliament stand for the scaling down of the tariff to the m 1921-28 level? What effect would that have upon the secondary industries of this the country generally? Would honourable of members, by secret ballot, place in the of a man who advocates such views the future of Australian secondary indusNo doubt, when the honourable member for Henty said that two honourable members had gone into the Cabinet who were opposed to the great advancement of secondary production, one had in mind was the would honourable member for Barker (Mr. of AusArchie Cameron) who was selected not by the Minister for Commerce as his to right-hand man in the Department of Commerce, the department which, according to press propaganda, is endeavouring to gather up all the trade treaty negotiations and. conduct them apart from the Department of Trade and Customs. On the 4th November, 1931, the present occaAssistant Minister for Commerce made the following statement in the Parliament of South Australia:As a straight-out free trader, I believe in in the cheapest market. It docs not matter to mo - where the article is made, so as it serves the purpose for what I want Was that the honourable gentlemen's chief qualication for being drawn to the bosom of the Minister for Commerce, and for being made an Assistant Minister in such an important department? Was it the chief qualification for placing his name on the panel of nominees from the Country party for inclusion in this composite Ministry, side by side with you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, whose name, understand, also adorned that panel?  wore not admitted. It cannot be said that that was because of' your free trade tendencies, because the choice fell upon rhe man who said, "" As a straight-out free trader, I believe in buying in the cheapest market. It does not matter to me where the article is made, so long as it serves the purpose for what I want it."" Nor is the honourable gentleman concerned with the labour conditions under which those articles are manufactured. I ask in all seriousness, dealing with this matter apart from party political considerations, do those honourable gentlemen who administer the Department of Commerce represent the considered opinion of the elected representatives of the people in this House? I submit that they represent the views of a minority. We are told that the honourable member for Barker is to be the driving force in the Department of Commerce, that the Leader of the Country party is a tired man and has a good deal of work to do, and that his colleague is to take over the lion's share of it in that department. It is only reasonable to assume that probably room will be found for him in the delegation that is to proceed overseas, if it is to be I led by his leader.",36
142,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The honourable free trader. member for Barker is surely no 'longer a. free trader!,38
143,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I must be guided by his definite utterances. He has worn well, and looks many years younger than he really is. He made the statement in 1931, when he was considerably over ill years of age. That was his considered opinion after he had served for years the Leader of the Country party in Parliament of South Australia. I presume that his views have not varied from very definite pronouncement of them. The Department of Commerce, like a hen gathering in chickens, is trying to gather in all the proposed trade agreements with other countries. Is it any wonder that the honourable member for Henty says that this Government, as at present constituted, is laying itself open to suspicion in regard to its attitude towards our secondary industries? Have I not a right, in the circumstances, to ask the 1 Government to declare today who will be the leader of this delegation? There has been a lot of kite-flying on this subject. Statements have appeared in the press to the effect that the Department of Commerce is seeking to take control of our trade treaty-making power from the Trade and Customs Department. This reminds me that in 1934 the present Minister for Commerce laid it down as one of the conditions of his acceptance of office in the proposed composite ministry that he should be appointed Minister for Trade and Customs. That request had to be seriously considered, because the Country party held the balance of power. Surely there can be no other reason why the right honourable gentleman is able to obtain such favourable consideration of the views of his party! He said, in 1934, that the Country party desired a scaling down of the tariff to the 1921-28 level. Is there not reason to believe that the Government cannot be trusted to pursue a protectionist policy when it takes to its bosom a right honourable gentleman who advocates the scaling down of the tariff to that level, and also the honourable member for Barker who believes in buying in the cheapest possible market? give the honourable member for Barker credit for his courage. No one can doubt that he is a straight-out His candour is to be admired. But it must be remembered that his views are not those of the majority of the people of Australia. In all the circumstances, the Government should not, on any account, appoint the right honourable member for Cowper as leader of the overseas delegation, nor as should it permit the honourable member the for Barker to be a member of it. No doubt the press propaganda in connection that with this subject is the work of the publicity officer of the Department of Commerce, an able journalist who was for a number of years the private secretary of the Minister for Commerce. I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) to tell us definitely whether there is any truth in these press statements. It is not for me to say who should be sent overseas as members of this delegation-the Government must accept that responsibility - bu t the Labour party, as well as the country at large, is entitled to demand a definite assurance that this delegation will not be led by a gentleman who is an avowed free trader, whose great desire is to scale down the tariff to the 1921-28 level, and who roundly condemned the Ottawa agreement because Australia did not give away substantially more than was given away. It is my considered opinion that the Australian people were, without their cognisance or desire, committed, at Ottawa, to a trade agreement containing clauses which were nationally humiliating, and which meant nothing if they did not mean that the Australian manufacturers and the British manufacturers were to be given equal rights on the Australian market. Our comparatively small and circumscribed market could be more than 'supplied with numerous articles of commerce which could be economically and efficiently manufactured in - this country, yet, as the result of the Ottawa agreement, some of our industries are today being challenged and rendered vulnerable by such imports from Great Britain. There was once in this Parliament a gentleman for whom I had, and have, the greatest admiration, although he did not sit with the Labour party. I refer to the Right Honourable W. A. ""Watt, an exCommonwealth Treasurer, an ex-Premier of Victoria, and, for a period, Acting Prime Minister of Australia. He was a most outspoken man. We could rest assured that anything that he studied was given the very closest scrutiny. In that respect he could be likened to the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin). Mr Watt gave very close attention to the iniquitous provisions of the Ottawa agreement. In discussing article. 10 of the agreement he saidTlie existing atmosphere of doubt and anxiety arose from the existence of what is popularly known as the Ottawa agreement. Let us take the words of clause 10 of the ATr. Forde. Ottawa agreement. By it, the British producer is guaranteed full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative coat of economical and efficient production. To my mind, that guarantee constitutes most definitely a challenge to the protectionist system of Australia. The main objective of the protectionists was to give to the Australian manufacturer a definite advantage in his home 'market. If you .will read clause 1.2 of the Ottawa agreement, you will observe that ' No existing duty shall be increased on United Kingdom goods to an amount in excess of the recommendation of the tariff tribunal'. Does this not. give an enormous stretch of authority to the Tariff Board?",38
144,Mr GREGORY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,AA as he not speaking as T the chairman of directors of a company?,39
145,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"He was not. When he made those remarks he was addressing the annual meeting of the Australian Industries Protection League. He was certainly not addressing a meeting of the Free Trade Tariff Reform League, as the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) sometimes does. Honourable members on this side of the House had already made similar remarks about "".he Ottawa agreement in the course of debates in this chamber and we were told that we were political partisans and that our statements were actuated by a desire to indulge in political propaganda. Such intentions could not by any stretch of the imagination be attributed to Mr. Watt, who has never in his life been allied to the Labour party. We believe that Mr Watt was right when he said that the phraseology of article 12 of the agreement and the practice followed in giving effect to it, were equivalent to handing over thepowers of responsible Ministers to a body which did not represent the people of Australia in any constitutional sense whatsover. Apart from itemized schedules, certain principles were insinuated in the Ottawa agreement which violated Australia's fiscal freedom and threatened its industrial development. That kind of thing must not be allowed to recur. We desire a definite pronouncement by the Government on this point. The futility and frictional effect of articles 9 to 13 of the Ottawa agreement are being demonstrated almost daily before the Tariff Board. Only last Thursday in Melbourne another interminable argument occurred before the board over the meaning of article 10 of the agreement which stipulates that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as will give the producers of the Dnited Kingdom full opportunity to sell their goods in Australia on a competitive bas.s with Australian made goods. Surely the Australian manufacturers and the workmen in the factories of this country are entitled to supply the whole Australian market. That is a reasonable request and the Labour party asks that full effect be given to it.",39
146,Sir HENKY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,At any,40
147,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The honourable member for Henty made a very good speech this afternoon and I know that he will stick to it. I did not say "" at any price."" I ternal competition will look after prices in this country. A drop of 30 per cent, in the price of the goods manufactured by a number of major industries in Australia was effected after the Australian manufacturers were assured of the whole Australian market. I know that officers of the Trade and Customs Department can verify that statement. Australian manufacturers have, unfortunately, been forced to assume the defensive in order to safeguard their home market. They have been, as it were, "" put on the spot"". Some of them have been treated almost as criminals, as though they have done something outrageous in establishshould ing new industries in this country. have been subjected to the very closest Great Britain:cross-examination, and all their activities have been scrutinized with extreme vigilance. Overseas manufacturers have not been subjected to the same humiliation. Articles 9 to 13 must be eliminated from any future agreement entered into by the Government. Ministers should be able to give us an unequivocal assurance that in the forthcoming negotiations no commitments will be made except such as relate to specific facts and figures. Any new agree- ment should be devoid of general principles which are liable to diverse interpretations according to the views of interested parties. Such provisions undoubtedly impair the effectiveness of the Tariff Board and render difficult the development of Australian industries, for all parties to any negotiations to that end arc in the dark as to possible future developments. Ministers should also be able to declare with frankness the attitude they intend to adopt in the light of the now closely inter-related subject of the Anglo-American trade negotiations. The members of this Parliament, an overwhelming majority of whom stand for protection, should not tolerate the sacrificing or even the imperilling of Australia's industries. I .fear that if the Minister for Commerce were the leader of the delegation overseas, and if he had, as one of price? his colleagues, the Assistant Minister (Mr. Archie Cameron), our secondary industries would be in grave danger. It is obvious from the cables which appear n - .almost daily in our newspapers that pressure is being brought to bear upon Australia and the other dominions to make sacrifices in the course of the impending negotiations in order that Great Britain and the United States of America may protect their own trade and business interests. It is only reasonable, therefore, that we should ask the Government to give some assurance that our own trade and commerce will be safeguarded. At least, we should be told definitely the limit of any concessions the Government may be prepared to make. In my opinion, the following provisions be borne in mind and regarded as They the basis for any new agreement with (1) There should be an exchange of specified margins for preference to Australia in regard to its exports of foodstuffs, and to Great Britain in regard to its general exports to Australia. Neither country should expect the other to take goods that would displace domestic production. (2) Great Britain is necessarily a large - importer of food products. No more than one-quarter of Great Britain's total requirements are produced internally. In respect of necessary' imports of foodstuffs into Great Britain, Australia should seek preferential treatment. On the other hand, Australia is necessarily a larger importer of machinery goods and merchandise for industry, and many-luxury items not manufactured locally. (3) Australia should give a liberal' margin of preferences to Great Britain over foreign countries on this clear and simple basis. (4) A trade agreement satisfactory to both parties should be executed which will be free of all embarrassing and ambiguous articles such as characterized the agreement made at Ottawa in 1932, which has since engendered so much ill-will. Such provisions have caused innumerable disputes before the Tariff Board.",40
148,Sir HENKY GUXLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,But not ill-will*,41
149,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Frequen t complaints have been made within and without Australia about articles 9 to 13 of the Ottawa agreement, and it cannot be denied that they have caused great dissatisfaction. I u respect of the United States of America, I draw - attention to the reply given by the Minister for Trade and Customs to the honourable member for Henty on the 30th June, 1937, in which he stated that in twelve new industries additional .capital to the total of £3,032,000 had been invested in Australia, and that in 48 other industries Australian manufacturers have substantially gained as the result of the trade diversion policy. In that connection, will the Attorney-General give a definite assurance that ample protection against imports from the United States of America will still be maintained so that these industries may be protected, assuming that the statement made as to the capital-invested is correct? Even so, had there been no Ottawa, agreement and no trade diversion policy, as a result of the foundations laid by the Scullin Government thore would have been a substantial increase of capital into this country to establish branch factories of the countries concerned. With regard to America, concessions should be definitely confined to intermediate tariff protection ou specific items under the non-protective and revenue items of the customs tariff. I am sick of listening to a lot of platitudinous bunk talked by would be free traders about the necessity to remove tariff barriers to save the world. It is said that we should cut down the tariff and substantially increase the returns to the primary producers. That, it is claimed, is a panacea for all the economic ills of the primary producers of this country. These and other shibboleths are invented by a so-called Country partycum-tariff reform party-cum free trade party, which today dominates this Government, because it has the balance of power, although it represents a minority of the people of Australia and could not secure endorsement of its policy at the polls. Is the arch-priest of this policy, the Minister for Commerce, who said that we ought to scale down the tariff to the 1921-28 level, and who, I have no doubt, was assisted in the preparation of his speech by his henchman, the honourable member for Barker, an avowed free trader,, to become the leader of the delegation to arrange trade agreements and to decide on matters affecting the very livelihood of 500,000 workmen in Australian factories? The proposal is too absurd to be given a moment's consideration by this Government or by this House, were it not for the fact that we realise how completely under the domination of the Country party is this composite Ministry, which, we fear, may make a foolish decision that will have a damaging effect on Australian secondary industries. [Leave to continue given. \ I thank honourable members for their indulgence. The Prime Minister recently made reference to "" discussions which had been opened between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America with a.view to a conclusion of a trade agreement "". He proceeded to say that his Government would examine the question in consultation with alone other Empire countries. We have a right to a more definite and candid statement as to the attitude of the Government on this matter than we have had today. Probably it will come from the Ministei for Trade and Customs. We should be informed to what extent the Government will go and what arc its views in respect of those vulnerable industries which/ we were told, have been' developed in this country at the expense of the United States of America. Revision of the Ottawa agreement is obviously the basis of any Anglo-American pact, and the first step is evidently to be the whittling down of Empire preferences and trade reciprocity through a general downward revision of the tariffs of both Great Britain and the dominions.",41
150,Sir HENICY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,There is no evidence of that at all.,42
151,Mr FORDE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"We have evidence that the United States of America objects to the Ottawa formula on the ground that it has meant a reduction of America's export trade, particularly the export of primary products. The Secretary of State of the United States of America, Mr CordellHull, who has already signed sixteen trade agreements, is such an astute gentleman that his present anxiety to sign on the dotted line is a clear indication that he believes the proposed agreement will overcome the Ottawa obstacle. move will, undoubtedly, put the Prime .Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet on the horns of a dilemma, which makes the selection of the Minister who is to lead the proposed delegation a most important matter. Will the Government commit Australia to an Anglo-American pact that will prejudice the present preferences for Australian primary products on the British market? There is growing anxiety among the primary producers of Victoria and other States. We have the. outspoken utterances of certain Country party members in Victoria representing the canned and dried fruits districts. The Government has said that it is definitely committed to its trade diversion policy. Will not one of the stipulations of the proposed agreement be the abandonment of the suicidal trade diversion scheme, because one of the fundamentals of the reciprocal Cordell-Hull trade agreements is that, once a nation signs a trade agreement with the United States of America, it cannot give preference to any competitor of that country. Mr R. B. Bennett, the present Leader of the Opposition in Canada, who was Prime Minister of that dominion on the occasion of the signing of the Ottawa agreement, and to whom we listened with the greatest interest when he delivered an inspiring address to us some time ago, now specifically charges the Canadian Government, led by Mr Mackenzie King, with secretly agreeing to abolish Empire preference. If Canada has signed on the dotted line, obviously this Government must be in a position to satisfy this Parliament today as to what is to be its broad general attitude in relation to the proposed agreement, and whether Australia has to any extent been committed by promises already made.",42
152,Unknown,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Sitting suspended from 6.9 to 8 p.m.,42
153,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.0] - The Ottawa agreement, which has been under discussion today, has been before the House on many previous occasions. It has frequently come up for discussion during the last five years in the course of tariff debates; for trade is never static, and tariff changes have to be made from time to time, while the obligations imposed by This the treaty itself have necessitated periodi- , cal revision. To-day, however, the opportunity occurs, now that the agreement has run its course, to appraise its value to Australia, to survey its imperfections, and to endeavour to ascertain how best the agreement can be adjusted and improved. Any constructive suggestions put forward by honourable members in the course of this debate will receive every consideration. We know that many who were hostile to the agreement when it was first mooted have now modified their opinions. Representatives of primary and secondary industries will be afforded an opportunity to put forward their opinions regarding future amendments of the agreement. In considering the Ottawa agreement, we should endeavour to keep the matter ir. its proper historical perspective. This is not a new conception of trade or some creation of recent years; it is an edifice built upon the substantial foundation of preferential trade already skilfully laia by empire builders with foresight and vision, actuated by British sentiment and sound commercial sense. Preferential empire trade goes back to the navigation laws of 1660, which were continued in various forms until 1860, when the United Kingdom, under the influence of the Cobden school, embarked upon a policy of free trade. From 1879 onwards, the colonies endeavoured to revive preferential trade. Alfred Deakin introduced a measure embodying the principle in 1906, whilst at the Imperial Conference of 1907 he endeavoured, unavailingiy, to have the system made reciprocal. Though unsuccessful, his advocacy at the conference iijid elsewhere in England paved the way for reciprocal Empire trade when the Dnited Kingdom became protectionist at the onset of the depression.",42
154,Sir CHARLES MARR,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Do not forget Joseph Chamberlain.,43
155,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Yes , Chamberlain was 'he English protagonist of the idea, just as Deakin was the Australian protagonist. Despite the efforts of these men, however, there was little real reciprocity until the signing of the Ottawa agreement. For many years past, Australia had given preference to British goods, but this preference was not generally reciprocated. There are those who still believe that trade can be left entirely free and untrammelled, and we still hear the shibboleths about free and unrestricted trade, and the advantages of abandoning all forms of protection. This, however, postulates a condition of absolute freedom and equality among the nations. Otherwise, those nations with greater national or physical resources would win out in the trade race, while a young country like Australia would not have a chance of developing its industries. Australia, in order to preserve its standards of living, and to maintain its economic security, must, resort to some measure of tariff protection. Those who oppose that view need only consider the United Kingdom., which, after 80 years of free trade, was forced to become protectionist in order to safeguard its industries against the competition of other nations. Extremes in tariff thought are like the poles, interesting to explore, perhaps, but not temperate enough for our economy. Within such an empire economy as we have, where tariffs protect local industry, and give preference to Empire and then foreign goods, there is room for much mutual support. Tariffs, like an economic traffic control, can make trade one-way or two-way, can accelerate, or slow it down, or, if unwisely used, stop it altogether. Any one who has given the matter thought, must admit that when seven Empire agreements could be made simultaneously by the dominions and the United Kingdom, even though conflicting and competitive interests existed, it represented a notable achievement in cooperation. It was, in fact, unique, because, in the following year, a World Economic Conference was held which was able to achieve nothing. The Ottawa agreement, with all its imperfections, was an important forward step, and now that, it has been in operation for five years, honourable members will, I am sure, admit that it has been mutually beneficial. Certainly the agreement imposes obligations and demands concessions, but these are essential in order to achieve benefits for .each Empire country. Britain, gave free entry to Australian butter, wheat, cheese, eggs, condensed and preserved milk, honey, apples, .pears, oranges, grapes, grapefruit, canned fruits and dried fruits, and placed duties on those goods imported from foreign sources. Great Britain also undertook to impose a duty of 10 per cent, on foreign leather, tallow, canned meats, meat extracts, and essences, sausage casings, zinc lead, asbestos, barley, flour, macaroni, poultry, .casein, eucalyptus oil, and other minor items, while guarantees for the maintenance of preferential margins were given in respect of wine and sugar, eoncessions which have been of tremendous benefit to South Australia and Queensland respectively. With regard to meat, it was agreed that the United Kingdom could arrange the regulation of imports from all sources, but the dominions were given an expanding share of the market. The result, generally, has been that the United Kingdom provides a market for 90 per cent., and in some cases more, of our exports of butter, cheese, eggs, beef, mutton and lamb, pork, apples, pears, sugar, wine, pig lead and zinc concentrates, while it is also the largest buyerof our wool and wheat. There is scarcely a product which does not show a substantial gain, both in quality and in value, over the period preceding the signing of the Ottawa agreement. Taking the average exports for the can three years ended the 30th June, 1932. as a base, and comparing them with the quantities exported in 1935-36, we find the following gains in our exports to the United Kingdom:Commodity. Quantity. Ureasy wool lb. 15,400,000 Scoured wool lb. 4,300,000 Wheat bushels «,87«,000 Barley butter Cheese cwt. 50,875 Beef and veal tons 30,723 Mutton and lamb toilB 25,870 Pork Eggs 3ugar tons S8.000 Apples cwt. 301,000 Fears cwt. 120,357 Canned traits lb. 19,000,000 Wine gallons 1,088,000 f i g load tons 80,000 Zinc coucontrates Leather Representatives of the leather trade have passed numerous resolutions in appreciation of the Government's action in regard to the agreement, and have expressed their thanks that, during the depression years, the Government was able, in this way, to come to their rescue. To put the position in another way, the exports to the United Kingdom touched the low level of £40,000,000 in 1930-31, whereas in 1936-37 they increased to .£72,750,000 or about £22,500,000 more than the annual average during the most prosperous three years before 1929. The percentage of exports shipped to the United Kingdom rose, at the same time, from 36 per cent, in 1926-27, to nearly 50 per cent, in 1936-37. An important result of the Ottawa agreement was that it provided a stable market for export commodities which were shut out of many world markets during a period of low prices. We should remember that it was the United Kingdom that saved us during the depression. Meat export statistics show that mutton and lamb exports increased by 10£ per cent., and beef and veal exports by 33-J per cent., as compared with the figures for 1932. Quantities and prices both increased, while surpluses were cleared. These exports were worth - millions pounds to the Australian producers. Australia now stands third as a plier to the United Kingdom, absorbing as it does 7.23 per cent, of Australia's total imports. Canada takes 8.84 per cent., and the United States of America 11 per cent. No one would suggest that these improvements are entirely clue to the Ottawa agreement, but unGain in Percentage doubtedly it provided a tremendous Increase. stimulus. Australia also had certain obligations 61 to fulfil, and these, too, have been 154 261 mutually beneficial, because foreign goods bushels to us l,512,iOJ 24,820 270 - i&l were excluded to the benefit of .Britain. 107 It is in connection with these, obligations 07 50 and concessions that considerable criticism tons dozen 7,800 10,800,000 330 107i and misunderstanding has arisen.

The foreign tariff was tons (value) 08,000 £251,000 U5i 1.20 raised considerably, and this steered foreign export trade to other markets, leaving considerable room for the expansion of the British export trade to Australia. Margins of preference had to be maintained, and where no margins existed, a formula providing for 15 per cent., 17-Jper cent., or 20 per cent., according to the British rate of duty, was applied. To bring this into effect, about 400 foreign duties were increased. Honourable members will recall that this gave rise to much criticism, it being contended that British duties should have been reduced instead. I remind them, however, that it was the only way in which the agreement could be properly carried out. It must not be forgotten that many tariff items were free, British, and free, foreign. These adjustments of duty rates gave Australian industries greater protection against foreign competition, and these, industries have benefited accordingly. We must remember that a country can import only up to the level of its exports, less the amount which it must pay out under its fixed overseas liabilities, such as interest payments, &c. When tariffs are being adjusted, each item must be considered separately and scientifically. Tariff adjustments cannot be made in a haphazard and crude manner. The Government also undertook to withdraw the surcharges and proof hibitions that had been imposed by the Scullin Government. Certain supmembers of the Opposition said that this was a betrayal of secondary industries, forgetting that, when the Labour party was in office, the Prime Minister of the day had said that the heavy duties had been imposed merely as a temporary measure to adjust the trade balance. As soon as the trade balance was corrected, these abnormal duties had to be removed. That was-one of the obligations undertaken at Ottawa, and these surcharges and prohibitions were removed. Another undertaking given was that prohibitive duties would be reduced as soon as the finances of the Commonwealth permitted it. Definite reductions of primage were made, and the whole of the protective duties on the British items were cut in half-fro m 10 per cent, to 5 per cent. It is understandable that that promise should be given, because primage is a revenue duty, and, unless it is required for a definite internal commitment, it should be as low as possible. Prior to the depression it was 2% per cent. The articles of the agreement out certain principles to be followed in relation to the duties imposed for the protection of Australian industries have been the principal bone of contention, both in Parliament and without. Briefly, these articles provideIX. That protection would be afforded to industries reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success. X. That protective duties shall be based on the principle of affording United Kingdom producers full opportunities of reasonable should competition with the reservation that special consideration may be given to industries fully established."" XI . That existing protective duties should be reviewed by the Tariff Board and revised conform with the foregoing principle. XII . That no uew protective duties no existing duty should be increased amount in excess of the recommendation of the Tariff Board. XITI. That United Kingdom producers should have full rights of audience Tariff Board. Much criticism has arisen with to these articles, but Australia could have promised no less for such concesgratuitously. sions as I have indicated. The peculiar ciroumstances at the time should also taken into account. Australia was in depth of a depression, prices had slumped, the wool return, which had normally been between £55,000,000 and £60,000,000 annually had fallen to only £27,500,000 for 1930-31, and the total yield from exports had dropped from £136,000,000 Mr White. to £90,000,000. The Government had already declared on the hustings that it would not interfere with rates of duty, even where they were excessive, without, reference to the Tariff Board, so that article 11, undertaking a review, was understandable. That United Kingdom producers should have full right to appear before the Tariff Board, as promised by article 13, was' only fair, and that protection be afforded only to industries reasonably assured of success was merely common sense.",43
156,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,But were the circumstances investigated in every case?,45
157,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The Customs Department has many ways of checking costs. If an importer gives false evidence, he cau be prosecuted - The department sees invoices of all imports into Australia. Mr A. GEEEU - Are similar restrictions contained in the agreement between setting Great Britain and Canada?",45
158,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Yes . Somewhat similar provisions were made in the agreements with other dominions. Canada did not then have a tariff board.,45
159,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Were not the preferences specific rather than only general in all other agreements?,45
160,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"In some instances they were, but in others they were not. I know that it is desirable that preferences be definitely set out in schedules, rather than that we should not give undertakings which are capable of differing interpretations, but Australia to did both. We had schedules, and we gave undertakings. At that time our and tariff was out of joint. The depression to an had necessitated drastic measures to rectify the trade balance, and therefore a tariff review was essential, notwithbefore the standing the Ottawa agreement.",45
161,Mr HOLT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,-We have also made an regard adjustment of exchange.,45
162,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Yes , that was done We put it forward that exchange, like primage, was not intended be to be protective, and that it was only the fair to make a deduction to compensate for the incidence of exchange. Strong protectionists and protectionist newspapers supported that view. That alteration has worked quite fairly, and has not injured Australian industries. A deduction was made from the f.o.b. value of goods or from the duty in the first instance, and, according to recent reports more of the Tariff Board, a specific deduction operations. is made and an automatic factor operates when Australian currency appreciates in office some credit. towards sterling. Which articles may be deleted, they may be altered, will be decided view of the benefits that may accrue, always remembering that Australia must has not surrender its tariff autonomy, with encouragement towards a higher indusrate trialization being retained, and realizing also that there is great good in an agree in ment of this kind, especially during troublous world times, quite apart from the actual gains. Statistics show that the overhaul and the clarification of the tariff obligated in the agreement has not harmed Australian industries, but, on contrary, has removed excesses and excrescences from the schedules, and through reasoned and open inquiry by the Tariff Board has thrown a flood of light and instruction upon industries in Austhem tralia, which has helped in many ways towards price reduction and higher efficiency. Statistics also show that highest number of persons employed in manufacturing industries in any pre12 depression year was 452,000 in 1926-27. This number declined to 337,000 in 1932, since when there has been a rapid imcompetitive provement. In June 1937 the number had increased to 535,000, or 83,000 more than at the highest peak of our previous prosperity. This employment is spread over almost every field. I have no desire to introduce party arepolitics, but we have heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) at 1.Port refer to the Ottawa agreement as a ramp. I was glad to hear the honourable gentlehundreds of men. man admit today that the agreement had a certain amount of good in it. I the would agree that it is a ramp because a dictionary definition of "" ramp "" is an ""inclined plane between two levels"". If the Ottawa agreement lifted vester us out of the depths of the depression to facture Co. our present high level of prosperity, honchinery orable members opposite may call it a are ramp if they choose. In the metal and machinery industries of 14,000 more people were employed than in the peak year of 1926-27, and textile trade 15,500 more, while 3,400 factories have commenced",45
163,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Giv e your predecessors,46
164,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I approved of their action to rectify the trade balance. But or how this agreement has run for five in years, and, as the Minister who had the responsibility of implementing it, I know that each of these items under the tariff has received sepaattention, whilst the policy of the Labour administration, which was crude the extreme, was that of plastering duties ou with a spade, the inevitable result being retaliation by other countries. There was a total disregard of the fact that many imports are essential to manufactures. Of the imports this year, which the have increased from £44,042,000 to £90,591,000, about 50 per cent, are raw materials of industry. Yet the Opposition, when in office, increased the duties on raw materials and kept the primage on high, whereas now, in addition to 50 per cent, of the imports being raw materials, 14£ per cent, of them consist the of capital equipment for industry, and per cent, of them are motor vehicle parts and petrol. Only about 23£ per cent, consist of finished consumers' goods, of which only 15 per cent, are at .all with Australian industries. I shall specify some of the large industries that have begun operations in the last few years. Time will not permit, me to mention all of those now being developed, but some of the major ones The establishment of the alkali industry Adelaide which is already under way and will give regular employment to many 2. The establishment of a blast furnace for production of pig iron at Wyalla in South Australia. 3. The great extensions at the steel works of the Broken Hill Proprietory Co. at Newdifferent castle and Port Kembla. 4. The decision of the International Harto establish works for the manuof a full range of agricultural maat Geelong. If this company's hopes realized 400 people will find employment in these works within the next few years. 5. The erection of plants for the production paper pulp and paper at Burnie in Tasmania and Morwell in Victoria. 0. The laying down of extensive plants for in the the manufacture of carpets. 1. The manufacture of insulating boards from sawmill waste and Australian timbers and the manufacture of fibre board from sugar mill waste (Masonite Co.). 8. The extension of the Ford Co.'s works at Geelong involving an expenditure of £150,000. 9. The decision of the Armco Co. of America and John Lysaght Ltd. to combine together in the establishing of rolling mills to produce line steel sheet. If the efforts of certain interests to crush the motor body-building industry had succeeded, it would have meant much unemployment in Adelaide, and the steel rolling mills would not have been established in this country. That industry came here because of the tariff and the existence of a certain market in this country. These extensions in existing industries represent a capital investment of £11,000,000. An amount of £3,000,000 has also been invested in new industry and investments to the extent of £10,000,000 are in prospect. As these industries grow steadily, more units will appear, and feeder industries will be associated with them, particularly with those industries that I last mentioned. The new capital invested in secondary industries in the last five years, together with that which is in prospect, amounts to £24,000,000.' The tariff classification necessitated reductions and increases. I do not baulk at mentioning the number of"" reductions of duties-they have been cited frequently and loosely without analysis-but reductions were necessary where in some instances the rates were excessive and encouraged high consumer prices and exploitation. other cases the reclassifications were definitely helpful to secondary industries by removing from machinery and raw materials duties that hampered expansion. The total reductions were 1,198 British and 679 foreignOf these one-third occur in non-protective items. Many were made in aid of Australian industries. Of the reductions made in the protective items, 403 under the British preferential tariff represent reduction to offset the protective effect of the exchange, and 395 under the British preferential tariff and 296 under the general tariff were the result of specific recommendations by the Tariff Board. Increases were 32 British and 394 foreign. These results indicate that the Ottawa agreement has been of definite benefit to Australia, whether it be looked Sir. White. at from the viewpoint of the primary producers or that of secondary industry or that of Australian advancement generally, which is the end this Government prides itself it is seeking. The agreement is not free from imperfections, and some changes are desirable: it would be remarkable if it were otherwise.",46
165,Mr CURTIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Giv e us an outline of the changes that are to be made.,47
166,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"How could any country enter upon negotiations with an agreement ready to be signed on the dotted line? That cannot be considered. 1I have tried to show the benefits that we have received and to show that Australian industrial expansion will be allowed to continue. We shall see that the benefits under the new agreement will be really reciprocal. At all times and more particularly in recent years the factors concerned with trade and commercial intercourse are uncertain and undergo great changes. The position in Australia today is very different from what it was in 1932. Policies must change with changing conditions in the world economy, and the agreement needs to be brought up to date. Since 1932 we have seen the world emerging from the most severe and widespread economic crisis it has experienced. The policies adopted in different countries to help them through the crisis have left a deep impression on the world's economy. The almost universal drive towards a lessened dependence In U130H external trade, the cessation of external lending by the great creditor nations, the measures adopted in different countries to relieve them from reliance on outside sources for foodstuffs and raw materials are legacies from that period which have left difficulties for every nation. When the agreement is being reviewed it will be revised in the light of conditions as we find them today. The form the new agreement will take can only be a matter of conjecture at this stage, but real reciprocity will be the constant objective of this Government. Final agreement is always a blending of the views and aims of the two negotiating parties. The Commonwealth for its part will seek to maintain freedom to promote all-round development in Australia's march to greater strength and developTwo ment.",47
167,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Thes e are mere words.,48
168,Mr WHITE,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"If the honourable ber fails to differentiate between words and figures for the last five years that I have cited he is without hope. We shall aim to deal fairly between manufacturing aud rural industries helping both in the knowledge that the prosperity of the one largely depends the prosperity of the other. Empire trade is all important to and must be perpetuated. But where there is opportunity for trade treaties with foreign countries, these opportunities be and are being fully explored. Already treaties have been made with Belgium, France and Czechoslovakia; and it hoped that negotiations now beginning with the United States of America will enable a satisfactory conclusion to bo made to the present trade difficulty that country. To-day honourable members seen a change that should be helpful. Although the reason for removing the licensing system has only something to do with the present position, it is a system that is better replaced by straight-out tariffs. Rectification of the measure the trade balance with the United States do of America, enabled that adjustment to made. However small the trade result, a better understanding between that great democracy, the United States of America, and every part of the British Empire is of immense importance. [Leave lo continue given. \ I thank honourable members because enables me, in conclusion, to make this quotation from that practical idealist, Alfred Deakin, who perhaps did more than any other man to foster Empire trade and the Empire spirit:You may speak of commerce as indifferently as you please, hut tliero is no commerce in world that is mere commerce, that is commercial only. It carries with it relations opportunities; it creates agencies which of enormous value for the growth of national life. It draws you closer to your own people, if not by the mere transaction itself, by ties which it concurrently establishes many directions.",48
169,Mr MAKIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Hindmarsh) [8.36J senior members have addressed this House on .a subject which is one of the most important subjects that could ever memengage the attention of a chamber such the as this, but their carefully prepared speeches have been singularly free from any concrete suggestion as to what is the policy of the Government on trade _ matters. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) dwelt on the on history of trade matters from as far back as 1660, and revealed many striking features that have been associated with us, trade arrangements from that time up to the present; but although requested to give to the House some definite lead as to will the Government's intentions, he skilfully avoided giving honourable members the slightest indication as to what the policy is of the Government may be. His evasion is the - more remarkable, because he freely said that the Government would be glad to receive suggestions from honwith orable members regarding the negotia-. rions that are to take-place early next year. Surely we might, have expected have from the Government that leads public policy in this country something of a definite character in respect of the general lines and principles that it intends to follow in putting forward the claims of Anstralia at any trade conof ference that may be convened. We not expect that it will be reveal to us features of its policy which it is necessary, pending the negotiations, to koep to 'itself, but we have the right to expect some knowledge of the general principles of the policy that will actuate the Government. The Minister ""for Trade and Customs failed to give us any knowledge of what is it . behind the mind of the Government on this matter, but I wonder if the Government has any mind on it. We can be pardoned for wondering, because of the diversity of opinion among members of the Cabinet on this very question. When we remember the almost irreconcilable the conditions of mind that are represented and in the Ministry, as it is at present conare stituted, we can realise the need for the skilful evasion practised by the Minister other in his dissertation. No less skilful was in the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) 330 in what might be called his liant essay upon the trade relations and the new outlook commercial aspirations that the should be prepared to adopt. right honourable gentleman's statement examined closely it will be found to of little help in determining mind of the Government portant matter. In fact the right able gentleman tip-toed tulips very skilfully. The hardly does credit to itself in failing give the lead required. Another that emphasizes the uncertainty of possessed by the Ministry fact that the Attorney-General debate, when it is remembered he really has no claim an opinion upon trade mercial matters. That is not his forte. He is not even second man in this chamber. In the absence of the* Minister (Mr Lyons) the Minister Commerce (Dr Earle Page) is regarded as his deputy. How was it then that Minister for Commerce did not initiate this debate, seeing that it has a special relation to the Commerce and that it is a matter of to which he. should give attention? is it that his views have, up to present, been concealed? that the views that are being forced the Cabinet room upon the would not be popular among the peopio. We know full well that behind the doors of the Cabinet there is at the present moment a struggle for supremacy trade matters. Those who know thing about the way in which members the Country party are able to exert their overpowering influence on the other in the Government know what the ultiI mate result will be when it comes a declaration of a policy matters. It will amount to a "" fice of Australian industry and interests. We know that in the mind of the Deputy Lender of the Government Page) there is a feeling that there must threatened. be a scaling down of the there must be a reduction of the protecforgo tion to be afforded to Australian tries. Aided, as he is, by those aggressive members of the Country party who hold even more extreme views than he himself ilr. Makvn. brilholds, I have no doubt that he will be able niceties of to exert a very real influence on the imon pending trade negotiations. This House world has a. right to demand more information If thethan has so far been given to it .

This Parliament surely has to express the right to demand that all or comthe facts shall be revealed to it . It has special been definitely indicated that one of the Australian industries which is to be sacriPrime ficed is a primary industry.

But it is not (Dr Earle only the f r u it industry that is seriously Many secondary industries tariff; also will find that they are required to any prospect of advancement or the indusexpansion of their trade. Members of the Opposition have made quite clear where they stand in regard to trade matters. W it h them there is no equivocation. We say that Australian industries have an unchallengeable right to a substantial portion of the local market. It must be remembered that with a diminished market, in the United Kingdom, the only prospect of ensuring the security of our primary industries lies in the expansion of our secondary industries. That would provide a market which would pay them more handsomely than the export of their surplus production under any system of bounty or subsidy. During my participation in the proceedings of the Empire Parliamentary Association in London. I found members of the British Cabinet very unwilling to encourage an increase of trade from the dominions, particularly in primary products., I found that there luid been a decided change in the outlook of British statesmen from what I experienced no more than two earlier. When in London J985 I found that, allied to the unwillingness of British .'Ministers to encourage greater trade on the market of the United Kingdom, was a very persistent demand that the .manufacturers of the United Kingdom should have the right more full y to exploit the possibilities of the markets in the dominions. While in Great B r it a in this .year, participating in the deliberations to which I have already referred, I found that, Imperial statesmen had come to realise the necessity for the dominions to foster their secondary industries to the fullest extent, so that those would not only be helpful from the viewpoint of defence, but also provide a profitable market for the absorption of the goods produced by the primary industries. That being so, if the Government feels that when its representatives proceed to London, Ottawa, or wherever the conference is to be held!",48

171,Mr MAKIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I have no doubt that if my honourable friend to go to his spiritual home, be might find there quite' a lot, of fwouragement for the view-point that, be holds with respect to many matters. H is views are not very greatly at variance with the communistic idea, although he may not be prepared to admit it . The Government surely is under an obligation to indicate to this Itonse the methods it intends to apply. It should state whether it intends vigorously to make a claim for the expansion of the secondary, as well as the primary industries of this country, and whether there is to be left out of the new agreement that portion of the old agreement which provides that the manufacturers of the United Kingdom shall have an opportunity to be placed on a competitive basis with Australian manufacturers. How can it be said that there is protection of. Australian industries while a provision of that character operates, and while this Parliament is not the master of its own fiscal destiny, but is required to refer to a subordinate body the determination of such matters? The Government should be reprimanded by the House for having become a party to an agreement which deprives this Paryears liament of the right to conduct its busiin ness in matters relating to trade. We should demand that this shall not be made a feature of any future agreement. 1 hone that, before the conclusion of this debate, we shall have presented to us a statement along the lines that I hav - s indicated in general principle, so that we may feel that the Government is prepared to recognize more definitely the claim of Australian primary and secondary industries, and should know who is likely .to be the leader of the proposed delegation, and ho able to judge as lo whether be has the outlook correctly to interpret the desires of the Australian people. Strong objection will certainly industries be taken if the Minister for Commerce is permitted to lead the delegation. It would be calamitous to the industries of this country if be were permitted to be the chief spokesman for Australia.",50
172,Mr BRENNAN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The problem is how can he be prevented?,50
173,Mr MAKIN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has asked a very pertinent and justifiable question, were namely, how is it possible to prevent the Minister for Commerce from playing a very prominent part in the deliberations? Certainly, the department which the right honourable gentleman administers is the oue chiefly concerned. Whether he, or the Minister for Trade and Customs, will prevail in the private war which is proceeding in the Cabinet on trade matters, time alone, will reveal. It is quite evident, that the Government views with some fcarfulness and trepidation the possibility of the Minister for Commerce being entrusted with this responsibility, because today it felt it essential to ask the Attorney General to lead this debate, and thus allay any immediate fears. That does not deceive the members of the Opposition; nor will it deceive the country at large. In view of the nebulous character of the declarations already made on behalf of the Government, we must come to the conclusion that the policy which it proposes to follow will result in the "" selling"" of Australian industries and the sacrificing of their future possibilities. If that turns out to be the case it will, of course, be too late for this Parliament to come to the rescue. I hope that honourable members will emphasize that the Government has an undoubted obligation to see that Australian interests are fully secured, and that those who have invested capital in this country and who provide employment for good Australian workmen in the industries established here, have a right to full protection. The industries of Australia should not be sacrificed' to interests abroad, in order that the Government may placate people overseas who are seeking to negotiate trade agreements for their own benefit and arc unwilling to give reasonably satisfactory reciprocal conditions. Every care should be taken to protect the industries already established in'Australia, and 1 hope that honourable members on both sides of the House will require the Government to indicate much more frankly than has hitherto been done the definite attitude it proposes to adopt. A specific statement should be made by the Ministers who will be called upon to speak on behalf of Australia at the coming conferences on these all-important matters which will affect our trade and commerce.",50
174,Mr SPENDER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Warringah) [9.3] No more important subject could engage the attention of honourable members of this House than that which is being debated to-night, for it involves, as I see it, the economic security of Australia and of the people in it, and also of Australia as a component part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I suppose it is inevitable in discussing such a subject thatsectionalor local interests will obtrude themselves; but speaking humbly for myself, I believe that when they do obtrude they are apt to submerge the national interests. Speaking from the Olympian heights of an Independent, I think I am able lo assess the value of the argumentsthat have been advanced from both sides of the chamber. It appears to me that the Opposition has developed a strangeattitude which is entirely inconsistent with its declared desire to advance the interests of Australian industry. Australian industry is the very bulwark of Australian progress. I believe as firmly as any one can believe, that industry is wrapped up in the destiny and progress of the Commonwealth. Speaking for myself, I would not be a party, no matter what government was in power, to any measurewhich would reduce the security of Australian industry; but I wish to make it clear with respect to both primary and! secondary industries, that I do not believe either should be given any form of protection if it is not efficient and economic. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition. (Mr Eorde) expressed the view that certain trade agreements that had been made bad threatened, industrial development in. this country. I can see no evidencewhatever of anything of the kind. I do not wish to go back to the sixteenth or the seventeenth century. I am satisfied, to accept the facts that have been made patent to us since the Ottawa agreement was concluded. These establish completely to my satisfaction, as does my own reading, that nothing that has occurred since the ratification of the Ottawa agreement has threatened Australian industry in any way. It may be urged, of course, that our industries may have progressed more rapidly if the Ottawa agreement had not been made than, in fact, they have. .Such an argument can get us nowhere. In this discussion it is claimed, on the one hand, that all thebenefits which have been enjoyed since the making of the Ottawa agreement may be attributed to other factors than the agreement. I concede that it is difficult sometimes to reason backwards, but there has been a good deal of reasoning backwards. I concede, also, that the mere fact that benefits have accrued to Australia since a certain date, that date being the date on which the Ottawa agreement-was concluded, does not necessarily imply that the benefits have been the result of the agreement. I am perfectly satisfied, however, from the information which 1I have taken the trouble to collect, that it is a fact that - definite advantages have flowed to Australian primary industries from the Ottawa agreement and that as far as I can see nothing whatever which has resulted from the agreement has impeded the progress of our secondary industries. I. regard the development of secondary industries as of paramount importance to Australia, and I hope that before this debate concludes, the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) will add his assurances to those given to the House by the. Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) ami the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) that Australian industries will he protected in any negotiations that occur. I am, personally, prepared to accept the assurance given by the Attorney-General to this effect, despite the fact that it niay be urged that the right, honourable gentleman did not submit any concrete proposals to the House bur merely indicated^ the general principles that would bo borne in mind in approaching the revision of the agreement. A definite' complaint has been made by members of the Opposition that no concrete, scheme has been outlined. .'But surely it is obvious that honourable gentlemen who take that attitude must he speaking with the tongue in the check. It must be perfectly clear that, in facing a subject of this immensity, with all the difficulties that must be confronted, those upon whose shoulders the responsibility falls of carrying to a conclusion these negotiations, can only indicate the general principles upon which they will deal with it. believe that a sufficient indication has been given by both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs as to what these general principles will be, and I do not think that any suggestion has been made that Australian industries will be sacrificed. But, while I am prepared to accept the assurances given on this point, I think that, in view of what .!. have already. learned in my brief experience as a member of this House as to the' conflict of some kind that seems to exist between the United 'Country party and the United Australia party concerning our secondary industries, it is desirable that an assurance should be given by the Leader of the Country party that: the interests of Australian secondary industries will not be imperilled in these impending negotiations. The mere fact that a gradual scaling down of tariffs is occurring does not, it appears to me, reveal any indication that our secondary industries will be imperilled. It must be clear to all honourable members of the House that the world-wide tendency during the last twelve months has been to scale down tariffs, because artificial barriers have been created by all countries in the adoption of a suicidal policy of national isolation. As one who believes strongly that the destiny of Australia is indissolubly joined with that of the British Empire, I say that if we can, within the limits of the protection of our secondary industries, advance the cause of reciprocal trade with the United Kingdom'and also between the self-governing dominions and colonies of the Empire, we shall do a .tremendous deal to assure prosperity and security for our country. We must realise that our exportable surpluses are almost entirely primary products and that our main market is in Great Britain. We must therefore also concede, that to obtain a stable and secure market in the United Kingdom is something worth paying for, so long as the price does not imperil our national and economic security. I do not believe that that is likely to follow the giving of preferences to Great Britain in respect of certain items. We must develop our secondary industries, however, for we must all realise that, despite the huge sum I that has been spent, directly and indirectly, upon the development of primary industries, their power to absorb the unemployed and to add to our population is not at all proportionate to that expenditure, and our secondary industries are the only reliable basis for the absorption and employment of an increased population. It is because of this fact that I regard the preservation of the secondary industries of this country as of paramount importance. in approaching a discussion of the posal to revise the Ottawa agreement, it is important to bear in mind that neither primary nor secondary industries should be sacrificed ; nor should one be preferred to the other. Both primary and secondary industries should be dealt with on their merits. Our chief concern should be to insure that our industries, both primary and secondary, are conducted on an economic basis, for only thus can we ensure the welfare of our people. I do not suppose that any one will envy those upon whose shoulders must fall the responsibility of these negotiations. .In the circumstances in which we find ourselves it is idle for us to expect the Ministry to give anything more than a general statement of its policy. This the Attorney-General has already done and. in doing so, has assured us that the Government will do its utmost to protect our secondary industries. Yet we cannot overlook the fact that we have a large exportable surplus of primary goods for which we may find a good market in the Dnited Kingdom and also in some foreign countries, and to secure these markets we must have something with which to bargain. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) said, without any equivocation, that the policy of the Labour party was the preservation of the secondary industries of Australia at all costs. 1 consider that our secondary industries should be preserved if tljey are efficient and economic. To preserve industries which are not of this nature must do harm to the Commonwealth. It is important to bear in mind that since the making of the Ottawa agreement in 1932, and since the Tariff Board has sought to apply the provisions of article 10 to our industries, they have been conducted on more scientific lines. This has resulted in increased development. We should be able to discuss this subject dispassionately. Merely to talk in a general way about the need for secondary industries and apparently without any foundation beyond the fact, as stated in this debate, that the Country party forms part of this composite Government, to suggest that the Ministry intends to sacrifice the interests of our secon)/)-. Kiwulrr. pro- dary industries, will get us nowhere. Nevertheless, 1 hope that a more positive statement will be made of the Government's policy in this connection. I am prepared, personally, to accept the undertaking given by the Attorney-General that the preservation of our secondary industries will be in the forefront of the Government's policy. With all respect to the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), .1 hope that the approach to this problem will be on broader lines than that of the last conference. In introducing the debate on the motion for the ratification of the Ottawa agreement that honourable gentleman saidThe Australian delegation, with the full support of the Commonwealth Government, aimed for something nearer and more tangible tin*u a general benefit either to Australia or to the United Kingdom. From' the beginning of the preparation for Ottawa until the conference closed we worked for' benefits foi our primary producers. I believe that that was a wrong approach. To say, as I understand the honourable gentleman's remarks on that occasion to mean, that ""something nearer and more tangible than a general benefit either to Australia or to the United Kingdom,"" was desired, namely, "" benefits for our primary producers "" was not a satisfactory approach. It is my firm conviction that iii a matter of this description the approach should be in the interests of the people as a whole, and not in the interests of either primary or secondary producers. It brings ine, in conclusion, to a. consideration of certain articles of the Ottawa agreement which have been attacked by honourable members of the Opposition. In particular the Deputy Leader of the Opposition indicated that, in his opinion, articles 9 to 13 should be ' completely scrapped. I hope that they will not be completely scrapped. It is true that article 10, in its literal interpretation would, as I read it, result in fierce competition between British interests and Australian interests, but the actual facts are that the Australian Tariff Board has interpreted article 10 to give a. marginal benefit to Australian manufacturers after taking into consideration the added costs of raw material, labour, and overhead charges in Australia. 1 hope that that policy will still be pursued. In the approach of the problem of revision of this treaty which is again inextricably bound up with arriving at a correct, sound, aud just agreement with the United State of America, I hope that the basis will be a marginal preference lor Australian industry in accordance with the terms adopted by the Australian Tariff Board, and then preference to Great Britain or the United States of America in accordance with the joint advice and judgment of the advisers from Groat Britain, the dominions and the Tinted States of America. It. is charged with respect to articles .11 and 12 that the Tariff Board has been given too great an arbitrary authority. I have for years indicated, and I indicate again now, thai I am against the delegation of plenary powers to any non-parliamentary bodies where such plenary powers cannot be reviewed .by the people or be made subject to their control. .1. find with respect to articles 11 and 12 that too great a power is vested in the Tariff Board, and no doubt in the revision of this agreement consideration will be given to ensure that complete control is given to Parliament in these matters - But there can be no challenging the fact, that, having regard t« the conditions under which Australia was placed when the agreement was made, it was important to ensure - continuity of policy uninfluenced by any change of government. I have no doubt that articles J .I and 12 were introduced for that reason. I hope that .whatever articles are finally drafted more happy language will be employed than was employed in the last agreement. I am almost inclined to believe that articles 31 and 12 were drafted liy a lawyer, so full of ambiguities are they. I hope also that in the approach to the revision of the agreement we shall bear in mind that, even although we may be called upon to make some sacrifice, sacrifice, if its leads us finally to prosperity, is essential unless it imperils onr economic security. Taking the long view I believe that only in the great democracies of the world-the British Empire is the foremost one-lie s the economic solution of the difficulties of the world and of civilization as a whole.  wish to make a few brief remarks in defence of the Ottawa agreement. In the speeches we have heard today, we have had sufficient evidence that there is no serious reason why we should depart from the principle of trade relations with other countries through agreements such as the Ottawa agreement. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) in his speech today said that the truth is likely to bo found between the two extremes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) thinks it would be a great mistake for the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) to represent this Parliament at Ottawa. Between the views of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Forrest, the truth might be reached, as we may be regarded as expressing the two extremes in this Parliament. ! do not like the Attorney-General's indication that he would whittle away the provisions of articles 9 to 12 of the Ottawa agreement, which I consider contain the basic principles that have tended to make the agreement the great success ir. has been during its five years of operation. They were the principles that compelled its application in the form agreed upon. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) has shown very clearly the immense value to Australia of the export primary industries and the wonderful trading development which has resulted from the Ottawa agreement. In view of that, I ask honourable members what harm has the agreement done to our secondary industries? It has conferred a distinct, advantage upon secondary industries both in their establishment and in the employment which they provide. In regard to the prognostications of honourable members opposite and of some honourable members on this side of the House, that it would destroy the protective principle of Australia, I remind them that the Ottawa agreement, during the whole period of its operation, has resulted in great advancement of oar secondary industries and that, towards the end of its term, the highest, peak of employment in Australia has been reached. These factors call for a renewal of the agreement. When such distinct and widespread advantages follow the making of such an agreement, it is wise to renew it. When this agreement was first signed, there were 337,000 employed in factories in Australia; today, the number of factory employees has grown to 535,000. The Minister for Trade and Customs has informed us that the duties on something like 2,000 items in the tariff schedule have been reduced. Those reductions must have been of distinct advantage to industry generally. The Attorney General seems to think populating of this country depends upon the development of our secondary industries. The right gentleman is mistaken in that view, and I think also that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) is mistaken when he believes that the population and development of this country rest entirely on the development of its secondary industries.",51
175,Mr BEASLEY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"He did not say that.  orable gentlemen that had there been no f all of the prices of our export commodities, 97 per cent, of which were primary products, there would have been no depression in Australia. The financial and economic development of this country depends upon the extent to which we can sell our primary exports in the world's markets. Our secondary industries were in no way able during the period of depression to export their surplus output; their whole energy is expended in manufacturing goods to be used in this country.",55

Tho outlook for Australia is much more hopef u l at present than it has been for many years. Why alter it? The Board regards the Ottawa, agreement as having had a beneficial effect. We have undoubtedly regained prosperity. Can we hold what we have gained? Is it worthwhile dropping the Ottawa agreement and losing markets which we have gained? Why not improve them? Why not even go further? Dealing with this matter the Tariff Board saidWe will not easily forget the disquietude of thoughtful people in the years immediately prior to the depression. Our financial credit that the which had stood high because of high prices for our export commodities had been strained to the utmost by heavy external borrowing. Interest rates were high and internal costs honourable and prices wore inflated. Importations Were heavy and growing despite increase of duty rates. Costs were heavy on export industries and could only be supported while export prices (remained high. When these fell our London funds and our credit fell also and only emergency action enabled the Commonwealth to maintain solvency. Jinny serious warnings were uttered, but allhun^'h people were disturbed at the outlook, the position was .not remedied. Only when export commodities rise in price arc we able to say that we have turned the corner to prosperity. The prosperity which now exists was not brought about by the development of secondary industries, which can only be developed when primary industries arc successful.",55
178,Sir FREDERICKSTEWART,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"We must have both.  other as naturally as night follows day. On page 27 of its report the Tariff Board statedThere is room for development both in extent and variety of secondary industry, but the structure will be more firmly based if extension into lines imposing heavy excess cosis is restrained. A balanced economy does not imply seeking to produce goods which impose heavy excess costs. Reaching out after uneconomic production wilT restrict more natural development and will thus reduce the 1 general standard of living. This is the considered opinion of men who have studied this question. Unemployment is now back to normal. What is wrong with that? I contend that the Ottawa agreement has contributed largely to ' the present prosperous sta.te of this country by expanding markets for our primary producers. The Tariff Board went on to sayUnemployment is now back to normal. It must be realized therefore that if employment is pushed in one direction by costly assistance, he it by tariff or bounty, we only, transfer employment from more natural and economic forms of employment to that in which we have a disadvantage. Another important point is that referring to interference with trade negotiations Will good customer countries. Such interference is forcing other countries to produce artificial fibre to be used in place of our wool. In this connection the Tariff Board saidThe ultimate effect is therefore hard to foreand sell enough wheat. tell. There is now a general recognition the need to take cure lest any public action should place further handicap upon the placing of our wool on the world's market. In conclusion the B o a r d summed up followsOn the other hand it would lie futile pect that Europe w i ll completely open doors to the food from the newer lands. They, in common with ourselves, desire a balanced economy. They desire if only for defence mental reasons to grow much of their own food us we desire to manufacture many of our normal requirements. No sudden departure from this policy is to bo expected, but it is surely reasonable to expect that Europe will set a limi t on the exclusion of those healthgiving foods just an that .we should set a limit to production where excess costs must be heavy. The amelioration lies in not pushing the policy of exclusion too far-no t attempting to support production when the disadvantages arc too heavy. There are memlrers of this House who would have us manufacture in Australia at any cost, regardless of the diandicap that would be thereby imposed upon the people. There is such a thing as uneconomic production. The Tariff Board, an expert body, is offering its advice to Parliament and it is meet and proper that Parliament should give duo consideration to its utterances. report continuesAlong this line of "" l i ve and let l i Hie hope for the future, not only for Austral in, but for the world.",55
179,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Would not that criticism apply also to the growing of wheat when the industry has to be supported by the payment of a bounty?  wrong ideas in regard to this matter. The right honourable member for Yarra (Air. Scullin), when he was Prime Minister, did not ask the honourable member for Parramatta to export buses when he fought to re-establish the credit of Australia overseas; but he did have printed across every envelope that went through the post an. appeal to the farmers of Australia to grow more wheat. Why did he do this? He did it because he recognized that wheat was a primary commodity that could be exported and sold overseas in order to pile up credits overseas. He knew that he could establish Australia in a sound financial position if he could export He did of not appeal to the people to export more shirts or collars, or boots, or any other manufactured goods; he asked them t,o export wheat. I remind the honourable as member that the wheat-growers of Australia exported £150,000,000 of their to excajiital during the depression years, in her order to safeguard the credit of Australia overseas, and they were instruin bringing into Australia just £21,000,000 annually in new money. Sir FjMin.EKi.cii STEWART - All that interesting information does not make the Tariff Board's remarks any less applicable to wheat than to any other uneconomic industry.  Board has said in its report is on the lines of what Mr Bruce said in that classic spepch which ho delivered in 1929. At that time, he said that the depression which was approaching was different from any Otlier depression that Australia had experienced. Otlier depressions, ho pointed out, had been brought about by drought, but the approaching depression was due to other causes. He reminded the people that it was necessary to examine the position very carefully, and The to eliminate overlapping services as far as possible. He said that there should v e "" lies be only one Arbitration Court in Australia - The people could please themselves whether it was under State or Federal control, but there should not bo more than one. He also said that experts should be appointed to examine our fiscal policy, and to weed out uneconomic industries. I agree with what the honourable member for Warringah said about the development of efficient industries. It is necessary that industries become efficient so that we may discover how much protection they require. When Mr Bruce, in his wisdom, told the Australian people what they should do, the Opposition cried out that he proposed to abolish arbitration that the Labour narty had fought so hard for. and had almost shed their blood for. In this way, they were able to scare the working people. They then went to the manufacturers, and said that Mr. Bruce was going to do away with protection, so that the manufacturers money into their hands to help them to defeat the Government. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eorde) was appointed Minister for and Customs in the Labour Government. He revised the tariff without advice from the Tariff Board. He hedged Australian industries about, with such unnecessarily high protection that he lost £21,000.000 in revenue to no purpose whatever. every four minutes that the Labour Government was in power, a man lost his job. The Labour Government the income tax by 30 per cent., and was compelled to impose the pernicious mage duties and sales tax. The present Government, by participating in the Ottawa agreement, and by removing einbargc-.w and reducing duties, has helped to brinabout the satisfactory financial that. obtains today. The percentage of unemployment has been reduced to normal, while secondary industries never better off than they arc now. It is axiomatic that every increase of the tariff is followed by increased ment, while every reduction is followed by an increase of employment. Tariff Board recognizes that truth, and warns us against, excessive protection oE any industry. My remarks apply to primary industries, as well as to secondary ones. We should concentrate upon the development of our natural whether primary or secondary, way only can we achieve permanent prosperity and bring about the occupation of this country. policy of high protection we have reached a dead end. It seems impossible to increase the population, and there is a tremendous outcry from the Labour whenever it is suggested that fresh population should be brought into the country. We should accept the pronouncement of the League of Nations authorities Geneva, and adopt such measures as will encourage a fjwr flow of trade. that whatever delegation goes to Ottawa will take a broad view of the situation, and will recognize that only by the Mr I'roKse. development of our natural economic industries, and by the promotion of a natural flow of trade between countries, can we achieve national prosperity, and poured the effective occupation of the country.",56
180,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Henty) Deputy [ 9 . 4 0 ] - I feel under air obligation, as one of the Ministers of the United AusTrade tralia party Lyons Government which incoming negotiated the Ottawa agreement on behalf of Australia, to make some contribution to this debate. .First, however, I. secondary should like to congratulate the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) on his maiden speech. It is clear that For his presence in this House will contribute greatly to our debating strength. .!. do not know, and it is not for me increased to ask. who will be the two or throe delegates to go to Ottawa, and then on to pri- London, but. 1 do extend thorn, whoever they mmy be. my very warmest good wishes. .Particularly do I wish that when they come home they will receive a less hostile welcome than, was given to me. position I make an appeal to the members of this House, and to those whose interests are bound up in this matter, to reserve their were judgment on whatever is brought back from this meeting until the ease has been fully explained to them by the delegates themselves. I. think that if we were to unemployremove all bias from our approach to a subject; of this kind, we should find that, The after all, we were fair ly close to agreement 1 take no exception to the criticism to which the Ottawa agreement has been subjected at one time or another, but 1. point, out that during the two years since the visit, to Great Britain of the industries- Australian delegation of which, as M i nin this ister in charge of Trade Treaties, I was an active member, there has been no effective (rouble whatsoever on either side with Under the. regard to the working of the agreement. I'p to that time, 1 admit, there was a great deal of fuss in Australia about the restrictions allegedly imposed by the partu agreement, and in Great Britai n about the. interpretation of certain articles. However, since we thrashed the matter out, in .1935, we have at been, in Australia, extraordinarily happy over the agreement, and this 1 hope applies to both primary and secondary industries. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) this afternoon expressed the opinion that the Ottawa agreement had been subject both to too much praise and. to too much criticism. Well,' one could probably say that of every child that was ever born. That does not get us very far, but I do lb ink that the Ottawa agreement received, until the last two years, far more criticism than praise. It is only now coming iuio its own as a servant and aid of all industries in Australia. I say "" all industries "", because I think that the secondary industries, and employment generally, have benefited every bit; as much fro m the Ottawa agreement as have the people on the laud. It is difficult to estimate what the Ottawa agreement has been worth to us. I say its worth is incalculable, in the sense that it cannot, be calculated, but it is very great indeed. It is not to bo measured by the increased value of outexports to the United Kingdom. It is rather to be measured by the increased value of our primary production year by year. I do not need to emphasize our dependence on the United Kingdom as a market for a great part of our pastoral production, and for the heavier part of our agricultural production, including, of course, fruit, honey, poultry and the lesser rural industries. The following table the. percentage of the total exports of our main primary products taken by Great Britain in .1935-36:""utter .. Cheese . .' Kggs in shell Beef and veal. frozen and chilled .. Mutton and hunb. frozen .. Pork, frozen .. - Rabbits and hares*, frozen .. Apples, fresh .. Pears, fresh .. Canned fruits .. Sugar .. Wine Zinc concentrates .. Pig lead .. I have been careful to omit such commodities as wheat and base metals, because there is a certain amount of doubt as to the benefit they have derived under the agreement. They both enjoy a preferential rate, on entering Great Britain, but they must be sold at world parity. In years when the prices of wheat and base metals were low, it was good to have the British market free of duty to the Australian products, while the foreigner was subject to duty. Since the Ottawa agreement, the total increase of the value of Australian, primary products, apart from wool, wheat and base metals, has been slightly over £20,000,000, so that it may be fair l y said that benefit to the extent of £20,000,000 a year has resulted almost entirely from the agreement. I shall go further than that. Heaven knows what the prices of bur primary produce would have been had it not been for the British market and the Ottawa preference. Had there been open entry to Great Britain , and had our produce been on the same level as that of foreign countries, our primary industries would have been choked up with over production. Either we should have had to reduce our production severely or the prices would have been so low as not to cover the cost of production and transport to market. It is extremely difficult to calculate the benefit derived from the Ottawa agreement; but to say that it is vast indeed is not to exaggerate the position. We have about 100,000,000 sheep and 11,000.000 wine, or 12,000,000 cattle in this country. I find that the average price of prime shows wethers in Australia in August, 1931, was 15s. a head, whilst the average in 1935-37 was 30s. a head. This was due entirely to the reduction by 35 per cent, Per cent. of free imports of mutton and lamb under 92.(11 the Ottawa agreement. In August, 1931, 94.S0 prime fat lambs averaged 12s. 6d. a head, 90.55 but in 1936 and 1937 they were worth 2fis. Fat bullocks, which averaged £6 S7.05 97.07 13s. 4d. in August, 1932, reached £9 in 97.S3 1936 and 1937. The gain is not to be 93.29 measured merely by the increased prices 85.58 realized; we have also to bear in mind 94.77 the immeuse benefits of the greatly 85.50 98.49 improved farming and pastoral position 95.05 due to improved meat prices alone. 89.52 All breeding livestock has been 98.05 greatly enhanced in value. H u ndreds of millions of acres of land in Australia are more valuable now than they were prior to the agreement. The clearing of the market created a keen export trade and lifted the home consumption prices. The benefit has gone back to the very leaseholds themselves. ""Now I come to secondary industries. I have said that the benefit to these has been no Jess than to the primary industries, as it has given immensely increased purchasing power to those engaged in primary production. Owing to desperately low prices in the few years preceding the Ottawa agreement the spending power of primary producers was very low indeed, but the agreement lifted that spending power enormously, and it has been sustained only by the constant demand from London and the clearing of the surplus in Australia sufficiently to provide a good home market. Ottawa has had nothing whatever to do with the recovery in the price of wool, but the greater part of the prosperity we are now enjoying is due to a run of generally good seasons, backed by the sustained reasonable level of prices brought about in the main by this instrument. Therefore, I cannot understand how Ottawa can ever have been regarded as an enemy of secondary industries in this country. Those industries have never been more prosperous or given move employment than today. As the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) has pointed out, the acceleration of secondary industries is higher today than in any previous time in our industrial history. Perhaps I have as much right as anybody else, if not more, to speak about the articles of the agreement, because I drew the first rough draft of them, and put into them most of the points which they containThey were finished by the Lord Chancellor, after a number of conferences.",57
181,Mr MENZIES,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The Lord Chancellor always has the last word.,59
182,Sir HENBY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"-Yes ; I know that Lord Hailsham avoided putting these articles into strict legal language. They were framed in the simplest ivords that would convey their meaning. Despite all that has been said on former occasions in this House, a trade treaty is not a strictly legal document. I shall explain why these articles were indispensable in the making of the treaty. Some time before the Conference at Ottawa, the United Kingdom had granted i»s a temporary measure, a large number of preferences in favour of the imports of. Australia, and other Empire produce. The Australian delegation aimed at the increase of those preferences, and an obvious condition was that they should be continued for the life of any treaty made. In particular, the delegation sought a substantial restriction of mutton and lamb, and frozen beef, imported into the United Kingdom from Argentina. While they were urging these matters, the British delegates pointed out that it was their intention to pass legislation making all concessions granted effective within a week or two after their return to London. They very naturally asked us if We would be in a position to follow the same course with respect to our concessions to Britain. We were not. As the House knows, the United Australia party, which was responsible for the treaty, gave a definite undertaking, when it went before the people in 1931, that it would not increase duties without, reference to the Tariff Board, and we were obliged to adopt that policy at Ottawa. We told Great Britain definitely that there were no duties which we could arbitrarily reduce and that all we could promise was a series of hearings before the Tariff Board. It is true that we produced before the British delegation a number of recommendations for tariff reductions ' that had been left behind by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Eorde) when he was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government. '.Chat honourable member carelessly left behind the recommendations for substantial reductions of his own tariff that had been made by the Tariff Board. I think that there were 71 reports by that board that were waiting for attention when the Scullin Government went out of office. The honourable gentleman had these reports made, but, of course, took no notice of them. The Lyons Government, early in 1932, had those reports tabled and presented them at Ottawa as evidence of the downward trend in Australia. We had also asked the Tariff Board to investigate other important industries. Just before arriving at Ottawa, we were acquainted'with the text of some of the reports from those inquiries, and at Ottawa, we received the text of further reports. We produced them as further evidence of the fact that duties were coming down in Australia. The British delegation, however, said that the British Parliament was being asked to endorse all existing duties and to give them currency for five years, to increase a number of other duties, and to impose a number of restrictions..upon Argentine meat, whilst all that Australia was prepared to do was to promise that hy the grace of the Tariff Board British duties might one day be reduced. Honourable members opposite will agree that while from its viewpoint, that was a very proper attitude for Great Britain, toadopt, from our point of view it was a formidable obstacle around which we could see no way. Great Britain then asked us if we would agree to the drafting of some policy for the guidance of the Tariff Board which would assure British manufacturers of reasonable treatment. It was that and nothing else that led to the drafting of the articles in their existing state. . Mr KOSEVEAM - Non e of the other dominions had to put up with the same set of conditions.",59
183,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,They did. Article 10 went into the agreement between the United Kingdom and Canada. It has been taken out since. A similar article appears in the agreement between the United Kingdom and New Zealand.,60
184,Mr ROSEVEAR,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,Not exactly the same.,60
185,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Not exactly the same in words, but the same in principle and effect.",60
186,Mr ROSEVEAR,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,-Not at all.,60
187,Sir HENRY GULLETT,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"The honourable member is speaking without knowledge. I shall be pleased if he will allow nie to proceed. I can. see that the time has come for considerable amendment of these articles. . They were never intended to be permanent. They were inserted in order to avoid a difficulty of which there appeared to be no other way-of avoidance. They were telegraphed to the Australian. Cabinet and completely endorsed by it. Quite frankly 1 see little objection to article 9, which readsHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that protection hy tariffs shall lie afforded only to those industries which are reasonably assured of =OUIK1 opportunities for success. I challenge anyhonorable member to show me a report from the Tariff Board that has ever recommended the establishment of an industry, and at the same time said that, despite reasonable tariff protection, it did not have opportunity for success. That article has never caused me a moment's worry. I shall not care whether it is removed from or left in the agreement. Article 10 was necessary for the reasons that I have given. It readsHis Majesty's Govt'iiinient in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that during the currency of this agreement the tarilf shall lie based on the principle that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of ecoimniic.'.l and efficient production, provided that in the application of such principle special consideration may bo given to the case of industries not fully established. I admit that it has awakened very hot controversy, but I challenge the House to cite a single industry in Australia that ever suffered under that article. Some time ago the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser) mentioned the deisel engine, and I agreed when he did. so that its case was an exception, but, at the week-end I found that it was not an exception. The Tariff Board signed its report on the deisel engine taking away the duty on high power engines one day before the agreement was signed. Therefore, the Ottawa agreement was never a consideration in this matter. I assure the honourable gentleman of that.",60
188,Mr BERNARD CORSER,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"That was the reason given by the Minister at that time. Sir HEN RY GULLETT - I was out of the country at that time, but the facts are that article 10 of the agreement had no affect on deisel engines. Article 10 is to be the subject of negotiation, and I trust that delegates will be able to reach a satisfactory modification. ' I go further and say that since we found the articles necessary we have made a complete revision of the tariff with substantial reductions, and that we can now say to the United Kingdom that we have proved that our tariff as a whole has been substantially decreased. This is due to the fact that the tariff reached a preposterously high level during the tenure of office of the honourable member for Capricornia. I. do not, however, want to engage upon a controversy with that honourable gentleDoubt man who has become a convert to the cause of the Ottawa agreement. One contend article, I tli in It, should be removed-an that is article 12, which readsHis Majesty's Giiveinineiil the Commonthe wealth of Australia undertake that no protective duty shall lie imposed and no ing duty shall he increa-scd ou United dom goods to an amount in excess of the reI'oiiimeiidation of the Tariir Tribunal. I do not think that there will be a diffifound culty in having that article taken out the agreement at the forthcoming negotiacreased tions. What I have stated to-night represents my personal views, and .1. do not in any way desire to compromise or prejudice those Ministers who will go abroad next year to conduct negotiations on Ausmore tralia's behalf. 1 felt that as I had a in Australia. considerable hand in the framing of these articles T was justified in expressing my view as to the prospect of changing them in the future. I think that the Ottawa: agreement has been a great friend, not only to the Australian primary producers, hut also to the Australian secondary dustries.",60
189,Mr BADMAN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Grey) [10.9] - In al factories are in operation. approaching the subject of a revision of is the Ottawa, agreement, 1 desire to take the broadest outlook possible. 1 congratutries late the honourable mem her for WarWe ringah (Mr Spender) on his having raised the debate to a high plane. have had delivered to this House statefrom ments from the Attorney-General (Mr. Menzies) and the Minister for Trade Customs (Mr White) in respect of the Ottawa agreement. Complaint, has been made from the Opposition led by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde), that Australia might lose somefrom thin«; by a revision of the agreement, and by the association of the United Ausreturn tralia party with the Country party this matter. I think that the honourable member for Hindmairsli (Mr Makin) tried, if possible, to drive a wedge tween the two parties which today form the Government. When the Ottawa agreepire ment was framed the United Australia party was in complete control of the is treasury bench, and when the agreement was brought back to Australia and deof bated in this Parliament it was the subT ject of much consideration and thought. was expressed as to whether it would be of benefit to Australia, nut 1 that, after the experience of five d years, it can |jo stated that it. has had most satisfactory results. Not only have primary industries benefited from the new preferences that were given to this counexisttry by Great Britain, but also the seconKingdary industries, as was pointed out a short while ago by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), have that ibeir Australian market has inof creased substantially as the result of inpurchasing power that has accrued to primary producers as the result of the agreement. The primary producers have been able to purchase more of the goods imported in exchange for the goods that they send overseas, and of the goods that are manufactured The conditions that existed throughout the world in .1932 when the agreement was signed were deplorable, but since then the wheels of progress have been again set in motion, and in Australia, as was inpointed out. by the Minister for Trade and Customs, thousands of additionIt clear. therefore, that secondary industries as well as primary indushave benefited from the agreement rshould' take a broad view in considering what: might accrue from a reviWe sion from the Ottawa agreement, and trade agreements generally. At the present: moment there is in prosand pect an agreement between the British peoples within the Empire and the English speaking United States of America. Tn 1932 at Ottawa the Australian delegation, when approached by the delegates the United Kingdom, was prepared to give, and did give something away in for the greater preferences which in Great Britain gave to Australia. To-day we are not in a position to give as much as we gave in 1932. I contend that we behave to be very careful as to what we give to any section of the British Emin return for preferences. If , as has been stated in this Honse to-night, there a possibility of the export of fresh and dried fruits beimr restricted as the result the revision of the Ottawa agreement. ?hnll be entirely opposed to that revision, as I would be to any concessions being given to other countries which would deprive Australia of the market gained by means of the agreement. The United States of America would certainly demand from Great Britain preferences that might clash with Australia's interests. Therefore, Australia has to view very carefully the revision of the agreement. In Tim Economist of the 9th October. 1937, appears an article on Anglo-American trade discussions. Analysing the matter, the writer leads up to the following statementUnless CircHt Britain concedes a substantial modification of the Ottawa preferences; prospects for an Anglo-American trade treaty will lie slender indeed. I'or it is precisely in the agricultural products covered by the Ottawa preferences, that America is anxious tu extend her export trade. In that respect we are likely to clash with the interests of another agricultural export country. The writer goes on to sayI'Vir Britain, obviously, this modification of Ottawa is a very delicate matter, for it involves asking sacrifices of third parties, the dominions. The United States of America has made clear-and one can hardly blame h f r - that any compensation which the dominions may di-niaud for snei-iliciiij; their preferential rights under the Ottawa, agreement must b-j provided not by her. hut liy us. But. it. is not easy to sec what compensation we can offer, in view of the extraordinary advantages we already confer on the dominions, who. so for (lot us gratefully acknowledge), have shown themselves Far from unsympathetic t<> our claims and needs. That is an admission by an English writer that the dominions have not been unsympathetic towards Great Britain. I recognize that matters hud to be adjusted as hastily as possible so that the preferences to Great Britain outlined by the 'Minister for Trade and might be given. But there is another side to the position. Many people in Australia liveenamoured of the idea of developing secondary industries. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said to-night that Australian industries have a prior claim to the Australian market: rightly ao. if they are prepared to make their prices commensurate with those which our primary product? are able to obtain for their exportable surplus production. Our primary industries were unable to afford the prices charged for secondary commodities when the prices of their commodities readied the lowest level i u our history, and the wheat industry was obliged to obtain from this Parliament bounties which should not have been needed. The wheat farmer would have 1 been able to withstand the onslaught of the depression, but for the fact that he had to pay the high prices made possible by the erection of a tariff wall which * many foreign exporters could not scale. During the last, twelve months, the prices received for wheat and wool have been high. For many years the price received for wool has not been greater than it was last, year, while the price of wheat also was higher than it. had been siuce 1928-29. In both cases, however, the price is receding today, and if the production of wheat is increased the world over, and there are gcod seasons, who is to say that we i hall not again be in the throes of a depression that will land the wheat-grower in a worse situation than that in which lie found himself in 193233? T am not a pessimist, hut 1 try to look at the matter fair l y and squarely. AVhe'n wo are revising an. agreement under which preferences are given, wo must realise that we cannot give too much. At file same time, however, we must take into consideration the cost of producing those articles which provide the wealth for the purchase of goods .manufactured by our secondary industries. I hope that, whoever may bo deputed to represent Australia at the conference overseas will take these matter's into consideration. I feel sure that we can trust any member or members of this Government to do his or their best for Australia. In 1932-33, when the Ottawa agreement had to be ratified, thp Governm.cnt was criticized severely Customs for what it had done. I believe that, the doubts which then existed have been dispelled, and that, today, Australia is in a far bettor position because of the operation of that agreement. If the advance that we make in the five years following the revision of the agreement is as great as that uiacje in the last five years, the Government will have done a good job.",61
190,Mr GREGORY,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Swan) [10.24] - A good deal of the argument advanced tonight is in the nature of propaganda that we have often heard in connection with the tariff. I should like to know what loss has been caused to secondary industries generally as the result of the operation of the Ottawa ment, particularly of articles 9, 10, J1 and 12. All that we can learn proves the contrary. As Ave wero able to obtain markets for our primary products, and the value of our exports increased, the expenditure of our people within Australia also increased. The returns show that, the number of people employed in our secondary industries is much larger today than it was in 1931. I do not think that there is the slightest need for any 1 feel very strongly on the subject of the Tariff Board reporting on all questions of duties. We know perfectly well that in 1929-30 duties were increased without any investigation by the Tariff Board, contrary to"" the Tariff Board Act. I cannot understand why those who believe that the Government should be unhampered in the introduction of tariff schedules do not amend the law, so that they may comply with the law. In 1929-30 and 1930-31, the most extraordinary creases of duties were made. a good deal has been said about subsequent reductions, these have been inconsiderable. There is not the slightest doubt that, although we are receiving higher prices for our exports at the present time, the great difficulty is still the cost of production. One of greatest needs is a larger It is absolutely essential for our future welfarethat we shall make every effort to increase our population. If any other nation had possession of Australia, population of the area from Mount Gambier to Cairns would exceed by many millions what that area carries There are very large areas which are inferior to that rich country, but. they also must be peopled and developed. The cost of production is so great, and the value of our exports so low, that the work cannot be carried ""on economically and profitably. The honourable for Capricornia (Mr Eorde} quoted today from a speech made by Mr Watt. We know that Mr Watt is a company director, and is particularly interested in rubber goods. Anybody who reads the report of the Brigden committee of econoi\tr. fire nora. mists appointed by the Bruce-Page Government at the end of 1927, to report upon the economic effects of the Ausagree- tralian tariff, will find in one of the appendices a list showing the total amount paid in salaries and wages in different industries, and the value of the duties under which they operated. It shows that the salaries and wages paid in the rubber industry at the time amounted to £1,300,000 ""while the value of the duties it enjoyed was £2,100,000. Yet that is described as protection. The - honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin) spoke strongly on this matter, alteration. but forgot to mention that the dividend paid by General Motors was 40 per cent, in one year and 60 per cent, in another year. I direct attention to the report of the British Economic Mission, and also to reports by Sir Otto Niemeyer and others, which indicate clearly Australia ? 5 great need not only to preserve, but also to increase its export trade. This cannot themselves be done, however, if the cost of production is raised to a point which makes proin- duction unprofitable and markets Although destroyed by tariff restrictions. We must pay regard to the old axiom that people will not continue to produce if the value of the article produced is less than the cost much of producing it . Year after year from about. 1929, the Tariff Board, in its annual report, drew attention to the grave Australia's increases of customs duties that were population. occurring. In passing, I may say that it is regrettable that, although the board expressed these sentiments, it recommended frequent increases of duty. In the the annual report of the board for the year ended the 30th June, 1937, Ave find the following comments:today. We will not easily forget the disquietude of thoughtful people in the years immediately prior to the depression. Our financial credit which had stood high because of high prices for our export commodities had been strained to the utmost by heavy external borrowing. Interest rates were high and internal costs and prices were inflated. Importations were heavy and growing despite increase of duty rates. member Costs were heavy on export industries and could only be supported while export prices remained high. When these fell our London funds and our credit foil also and only emergency action enabled the Commonwealth to maintain solvency. Many serious warnings were uttered, but although people were disturbed at the outlook, the position was not remedied. From 1925 onward I was one of the few members of this House who called attention frequently to the effect that must low our inordinate borrowing overseas, and our rapidly increasing costs of production. After .1929, as we are not likely soon to forget, the value of our exportable goods fell so seriously that the whole country seemed to collapse. I have been pleased to hear the admissions by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ourtin) and others that the depression really occurred in consequence of decreased export values. Few people in Australia realise the marvellous value of our export trade. From about 1922 to 1929, this trade was valued, on the average, at £140,000,000 a year. In that period we experienced the highest . prices for our exportable goods that we have known in our history. But subsequently, prices collapsed, and a serious clopressioh overtook the country. The farmers' equity in their holdings was destroyed, at least, for the time being. This result was contributed to by the extravagant borrowing of more than £400,000,000 at ever increasing rates of interest, that occurred between 1919 and 1929. When the crash came the manufacturers of this country had to dismiss between 113,000 and 11.4,000 operatives. The value of our exportable goods in the years succeeding 1929, was as follows:1029-30 .. 9S,000,000 1930-31 .. 00.000.000 1931-32 .. 90,000,000 1932-33 .. 98,000.000 The average, therefore, was .about £95,000,000 as against £140,000,000 in the preceding five years. This fall in export prices affected the purchasing power of our people to an extraordinary degree, and caused the greatest depression that we have ever known. We shall have another depression if our export values fall. It is only by reason of our large exports of wool, wheat and other commodities that we are able to pile up credits overseas. The unemployment, destitution, insolvencies and abandonment of farms should show the fallacy of this policy of the past. Australia needs a greatly increased population to ensure sound development, and we must consider, in this connection, whether people should be encouraged to settle in the country or in the cities. It folwould, of course, be madness for any one to suggest that a wholly free-trade policy should be practised in Australia. ' No one desires to destroy the industries that have already been developed here. At the same time,' protection must be reduced, as numerous reports bf the Tariff Board indicate very clearly, and manufacturers must be given to understand that they must be prepared to accept world competition in the near future. If our tariffs are too high production costs increase, and that must seriously affect the progress of the country. It is highly desirable that people should be settled not only in the richer areas of Western Australia, but also in some other parts of that State and of South Australia, where settlement is impossible today because production costs are too high. Unless we take steps to increase our population we are asking for trouble. We shall live in a fool's paradise if we seek to maintain this country on the present basis. All thinking persons must be aware that it is useless to aim at developing great manufacturing industries in Australia until we have the people living here with the purchasing power to buy the goods. This purchasing power can be created only by an export trade. It is possible to live in a kind of way by taking in one another's washing, but a great nation can never be developed by that policy. We have to face the fact that today many nations, such as. Italy, Germany and Japan, have a rapidly increasing population, and no land available for their people. Naturally they want their place in the sun, and Ave shall find it increasingly difficult to justify retaining for ourselves a huge area such as Australia, which, although as great as that of the United States of America, carries a population of less than 7,000,000 people, Avhile the Dnited States of America carries a population of 130,000,000 people. In. the past, Ave have been largely dependent for our safety upon the Union Jack and the British Navy. If Ave may continue to depend upon the protection afforded us by Great Britain Ave may be able to hold this country for some longer period with its small population; but the time will come when we shall no longer be able to do so. The longer we hold Australia with its present handful of people the more we shall develop a spirit of enmity in otlier peoples of the world. Jt would he idle for any one to deny that Australia has enjoyed marvellous benefits in consequence of the Ottawa agreement. Our primary industries will suffer severely if anything is done to destroy the effectiveness of the policy decided on at Ottawa. In order to ensure a continuance of that policy, Australia must be prepared to make reasonable tariff concessions to Ureal Britain . The preferences that: we have accorded Groat Britain in the past, have - been in the nature of an investment hy Australia. But in these days there are such things as cartels and gentlemen's agreements. I direct attention to the following duties on various articles specified in our tariff schedules:DUTIES OX FOI t K l l i N I'ViH'injr win: 50 pur t-enl.. i!.ilvnni/.i-il ii'tMi . . liik. rictni: . . prr rent.

Honourable members opposite have complained about the effects of the Ottawa agreement, but they have not been able to direct attention to a single instance in which that agreement has been inimical ro the interests of either Great Britain or Australia. I want those who represent Australia to face the fact that world trade and a departure from the curse of economic nationalism arc absolutely essential for world peace. The Government must, of course, decide who shall represent Australia at the coming conference. It has been abundantly apparent to-night that the purpose of tin's discussion has been' to reveal that tinmanufacturers of Australia intend to do everything possible ro ensure Miar the delegation shall consist of persons fuvorMr Crryury. able to their point: of view; but the Government will make a sorry mistake if it seeks merely to pacify the manufacturers of this country. It must ensure that justice will be done to the interest of the pi unary producers. If any other course is adopted, some peculiar things will occur in this chamber when the report of the conference comes to hand. I ask for fair play to all the interests concerned.",62
191,Mr WILSON,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Wimmera) [10.42] As the representative of a. purely primary producing constituency, I wish to make a. brief contribution to this debate. I have realized very clearly today that the secondary industries of Australia do not, lack chain pious in this House. Ther.! are no secondary industries in my electorate so far as I know. .1I have been surprised thai; some honourable members have not realized rhe importance of our prima-ry-produciiig industries to the sol>:-!*. IMTO.IiTS. vency of Australia. Along the Murray Valley we have many successful f r u it growing settlements which iare of i UrilMi. immense importance to the country. The fruit-growing industry is highly 17). p r r r i - l if. + 1211s organized and is thoroughly efficient, ton fill |MT H'llt. but many of the people engaged » I . Hi. S,l. por I i , . in it are concerned about the Ir'rci-. ilHU. attitude that the Government may lii's. I lids. adopt in connection wiih the proposed trade treaty between the United States of America and Great B r it a in . Our f r u it growing industry has been developed in consequence of the preferences afforded to it under the Ottawa agreement. Because of these, we have been able to do a big and growing trade on the marker of the f n it e d Kingdom. In these circumstances. I would welcome a frank .statement by the Government as tithe attitude it proposes to adopt in the forthcoming negotiations, particularly in resravd to the fruit-growing industry. The fruit-growers of Australia were given certain specific promises which shoidd be honoured in everv respect. It is also desirable that the interests of the wheat-growing industry should he conserved. It appears to nic that the Government has shown a lack of stability in connection with both its tariff and its marketing proposals. Last year some strange decisions were made. in connection with the Government's trade diversion policy. We were told that, this policy was necessary in the interests of Australia and in order to maintain preferences with Great B r it a in ; but in consequence of steps taken at that time, a good deal of the trade which our primary producers bad been able to do with certain eastern countries, especially during the years of the depression, was lost, to us. This .trade, it should he remembered, was responsible in no small measure for the restoration of prosperity in Australia. Honourable members will remember how Government spokesmen subsequently on two occasions took advantage of the opportunity to speak over the air through the national network to defend the action which the Government bad taken; yet, within a comparatively short period of time, it turned a somersault, and reversed its policy. The blunders made at that time caused much damage to Australian interests in the markets for their primary products, from which it will take a long time to recover. I. hope that the Government will not repeat mistakes of this kind in handling the delicate question of trade treaties in the future. I do not want to give the impression that I am anything of a free trader - I believe in protection, but I want to >-ec it evenly extended to all sections of the community. I cannot follow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Fordo) in his bald-headed advocacy of protection at any prico. The policy of protection followed in Australia, for the last 2""i years has given a monopoly to Australian manufacturers; but, in my opinion, it has not had the effect of raising the standard of living for the workers of the country. On the contrary, it has had the opposite effect. If the position is analysed, it: will be seen that the purchasing power of the money received by the workers today docs not reflect the prosperity enjoyed by the manufacturers in secondary industries. I am prepared to go a long way to protect secondary industries, but I demand that protection be equally and fair l y applied to all sections of the community.",65
192,Mr GRKOORV,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,How wonld the honourable member do that?,66
193,Mr WILSON,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"-That , is a problem for the Government; it is not for me to make suggestions of that, nat-nre. Great industries such as the wheat industry should also receive consideration from this Government. The small benefit of 3d. a bushel mentioned by the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), which the wheat-growers receive under the Ottawa agreement, was, perhaps, helpful to us; but the industry is looking to the Government of this country to extend to it. sonic share of the protectionist policy of Australia, so that; it shall not again experience the throes of depression and have to come cap in hand to the Government for assistance. It is frequently said, "" See what it costs us to maintain the primary industries in Australia; consider the bounties that' are provided."" We arc conscious of tliese benefits; but those who make this complaint say nothing about the immense cost of maintaining the secondary industries, which far exceeds that of any assistance granted to primary industries. The Government should consider very carefully how it is to handle this proposed trade agreement. I ask - that special consideration bo given to the claims of the primary industries, especially those engaged in the dried and canned f r u it industries, which are the only Australian industries I know of at the moment that arc able, through organization, to give to their workers a reasonably decent wage. That is the position in which we should like to see every other primary industry, because we are anxious to remove the aspersion so frequently cast on farmers and agriculturists that they do not pay a decent wage to their workers. I stand for a decent wage for everybody. I should like to have a clear statement from the Government that, before entering upon these important negotiations for a trade agreement, it will take into its councils representatives of its primary industries. Mr A. GEEEN (Kalgoorlie) [10.51]. - I desire at the outset to remark that so much has been said in this chamber in favour of the Ottawa agreement that, it has been taken for granted that Australia has received a tremendous benefit at the expense of some one else. Always in the making of an agreement between buyer and seller it is presumed that neither would agree to the transaction unless each thought he was getting at least an equal, if not a greater, advantage out of it than the other. That . is the position with regard to the Ottawa agreement so far as Great Britain is concerned. It is obvious that those whom we delegate to go overseas in connection with this agreement will find that, in addition to the - review of the Ottawa agreement, the possibility of a trade agreement hetween Great Britain and the United States of America will come under review; the two will be taken together. I remind honourable members that today the United States of America has a tremendously favourable balance of trade with Australia. Australia produces a large number of primary products similar to those produced in the United States of America, but owing to the fact that one country is situated in the northern, and the other in the southern hemisphere, it should be possible for the two countries to have tin exchange of commodities at different seasons during the year. When, for instance, certain fruits are in season in Australia, they arc out of season in the United States of America and vice versa. I remind my colleagues that in these negotiations we are dealing with people whose early President, George Washington, spoken of as ""first in peace, first in war, and first in the hearts of his c o u n try m e n n ot only a great soldier but also a great statesman, laid down 140 years ago a dictum to his own country which we might well take to heart when our delegation goe3 to the Old Country. In his farewell address delivered on the 19th September, 1796"", he said :Harmony, liberal intercourse with nations, arc recommended hy policy, humanity, and interest. But oven our commercial should hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting exclusive favours or preferences: consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle moans the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing; establishing (with powers so posed, in order to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and enable the government to support them) ventional rules of intercourse, the best present circumstances and mutual opinion w permit, but temporary, and liable to he from time to time abandoned or varied, as perience and circumstance shall dictate I do not. intend to weary the House by reading a lengthy extract from his speech. J/r. A. fhrecn. That, is an opinion which the United States of America still holds. In my opinion the arrangement made in articles 9 to 11, which still stands, will not find a place in the new agreement. Anything that, threatens our independence of action as a nation is something that cannot be tolerated by Australia even from the Mother Country. That is precisely the. attitude that Great Britain takes up with regard to its own legislation. It was laid clown by the Minister controlling agriculture in the Old Country at, the time the agreement was being made at Ottawa, that the first consideration of Great Britain was to be its primary production. Although beef was one of our great hopes in helping our trade with Great Britain, a far greater quantity of English beef is consumed in England than is imported from abroad. The quantity of beef consumed in Great Britain in 1931-and no great change has taken place since then in spite of the Ottawa agreement-amounte d to 1,399,000 tons, of which S00,000 tons, or nearly two-thirds, was of British origin. Chilled beef imported from South America amounted to 464,000 tons; frozen beef from South America to 59,000 tons, from Australia to 57,000 tons and from l\ ew Zealand tn 19.000 tons. r The quantity of chilled beef imported from Australia was so negligible at that. time that it was not worth recording. Despite the fact that we have indulged in a great deal of propaganda in regard to the amount of chilled beef imported to Great Britain from Australia, ir is negligible as compared with that: imported from Argentina. The quanall tity of frozen beef, in respect of which we have always been given to unpolicy derstand we had supremacy, exported from South America to Great Britain is nearly as large as that sunt from Australia. Mr F. P. Kneesliaw, president of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, diswriting in the Melbourne Age. in Decemto ber last, dealt with what Ottawa has done confor Australia. He told a very different that story from what we have heard today ill from the ex-Minister who conducted negoextiations for trade treaties (Sir Henry . . . Gullett), from the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), and from the ""yes men."" from the other side, who backed up everything they said, with regard to the wonderful benefit we are getting from the Otta wa agreement. J list after the Ottawa agreement was signed, we. were told to go slow. It happened that Argentina, conscious that it would be cut off to some extent, bad rushed large supplies of chilled beef to Great Britain . Consequently, when the agreement came into operation there was a glut in the British market. The Prime Minister, on the .Sth November, 1932, almost as soon as the agreement was signed, stated in the Mouse of Representatives that there were to be restrictions on shipments of meat from foreign countries to the United Kingdom for November and December. 1932, as compared with the same months of 1931. Foreign imports of mutton and lamb - were to be rationed per (-ent., chilled beef cent. and bacon 20 per Meanwhile the Commonwealth Government had agreed that immediate Australian shipments of mutton and lamb should not exceed 90 per cent, of the amount exported in 1931. That is to .say, although we, had signed an agreement which the meat-producers thought was going to be of tremendous help to them, the immediate result was a reduction of the amount of meat that could be exported. It must, be remembered that 70 per cent, of the trade of the British Commonwealth of Nations is done with foreign countries, only 30 per cent, being intra-Empire trade. It is evident, therefore, that there may be something in the statement put forward by Dr E . E . Walker, and published in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 20tli July last, that the Ottawa, agreement, is a menace to peace. He proceeded to show that while intra-Empire trade had in creased considerably, the trade of foreign countries had been adversely affected by the agreement, which might easily give rise to those irritations and disagreements which are the forerunners of war. However, our good friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), with that innate pugnacity, that is characteristic of him, immediately challenged the figures of Dr Walker. He is reported as follows:He challenged figures quoted by Dr Walker, showing that since 11)32 Britain had bought £0.000.000 more of dominion produce and £34.000,000 less of foreign goods. "" Since 1932"", said Air. White, Britain's increased - i purchases from the Kuipirc have amounted to £84,000,000, while, purchases from foreign sources havy increased by £03,000.000. Since 1932 Britain has increased her exports, to Kmpire. countries by £.Y1,000,000. and lo foreign countries by £24.000.000."" So that, according to the Minister's own figures, the amount of trade we have done with foreign countries since this wonderful agreement was made, has increased side by side with our trade with Great Britain . As a matter of fact, Australia and New Zealand in 1931 supplied only 54 per cent, of the total quantity of meat consumed in the United Kingdom. In 1932 exports of frozen beef from Australia to the United Kingdom amounted to 47,000 tons. In 1933, they increased 20 to 53,000 tons, aud in 1934 to 78,000 10 per tons. That was a considerable increase, cent. 1 admit, but during the same period exports of frozen beef from Argentina had. increased from 32,000 tons to S7,000 tons. Moreover, we must remember that the quantity of frozen beef exported to Great B r it a in from Argentina is very small compared with the quantity of chilled beef which that country exports. For every £ 1 worth of goods that the I'nited Kingdom exports to Argentinawhicli does not belong to Great B rita in --the United Kingdom accepts £3 worth of goods in return. As a matter of fact, the amount of British capital invested in Argentina is stated to be not less than £600,000,000, and may be as much as £1,000,000,000.",66
194,Mr NOCK,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,The people of Argentina must pay their interest in goods.,68
195,Mr A GREEN,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"I shall show just how much interest they pay. I have been to Argentina, and also to Brazil, and I know something of what goes on there. In Argentina, many of the railways are a fact owned directly by British capitalists, but the federal legislature of Argentina determines the freight and passenger rates, with the result that for many years past the British stock-owners have received practically no dividends. We, on the orher hand, borrowed British money with which to construct our own railways, and despite the great losses which we have sustained in the running of those railways, we have always paid, and will continue to pay, the full interest on the borrowed money. Brazil, which owes --"":S0,U00,0On to' British capitalists, doe:? lint propose to pay OIKcent in interest year. In Australia it has boon our jio'icy tu balance our trade with Great Britain as far as wo can. except that we must always have a credit in our favour .if £27.000,000 with which to service our overseas debt. We know that, at the conference, table at which the Ottawa agreement was drafted, there were representatives, not only of the dominions, but of Argentina a* well, and they helped, to mould this essential piece of Empire policy, in 11)82, Argentina exported to Great Britain 390,000 tons of chilled beef, while in 1934 it exported 347.000 ions, a very slight reduction indeed in t ho circumstances. The amount of chilled beef sent to Great Britain from Australia in 1934 was 34,000 cwt; in 1935. i'2S,000 cwt.; and in 1936, 295,000 cwt. That seems a considerable increase, hut is a very small quantity compared with more than 7,000,000 cwt. exported by Argentina. We cannot expect any great advantage from the Ottawa agreement in respect of wlieat, because the British Empire produces an overage surplus of wheat of 100,000.000 bushels. That is a. very large quantity, and, as it is sufficient to supply a large proportion of Great Britain's requirements, we never actually'receive the supposed benefit of 3d. a bushel, because our wheat has to compote with that of other countries in entering the British market. With regard to meat, Australia gets a small benefit when it sells its birth right as provided under article 9 which statesHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of .Australia undertake that protection liy tariffs shall lie afforded only to those dustries which nnreasonably assured of .'ouud opportunities fnr success. Kven the honourable member for Henty, who was in charge of the negotiations for trade treaties, - is not now prepared to attempt to that article. Members of the Tariff Board of the United States of America declare that it is impossible to give practical effect to it. Article 10 statesHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that during the currency of this agreement, the tariff shall be hutted on the principle that protective Mr A. Oreru. shall not exceed such a level as will give United Kingdom producers full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and efficient production . . . If a member of this House desires an interview with the Comptroller-General of Customs in Canberra, he finds that that official does not occupy the suite of rooms on the ground floor of the Customs Department, but that these rooms'accommodate the High Commissioner for tin: United Kingdom. At the seat of government and in a building erected for the housing of the department that is expected to consider the requirements of Australian industry, a watchdog of Great Britain occupies the suite of rooms on the ground floor! If that is not literally true, it, is a fact that at the meetings of the Tariff Board, when Australian manufacturers submit their claims, a representative of British importing interests is seated at; the table. Whilst I am not an extreme protectionist, I desire to see the manufacturers of Australia producing all they possibly can in this country. My views may not coincide with those of the majority of the primary producers in Western Australia, but, I claim to take a broad view of Australia's best interests, and I contend that; the presence of trade representatives, even from the Mother Country, should not be tolerated at; meetings of the Tariff Board at which the claims of Australian manufacturers are being considered. Article 11 of the agreement statesHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that a review shall be made us soon as practicable by th« Australian Tariff Board of existing protective duties in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 10 hereof, and that after the in- receipt of the report and recommendation of the Tariff Board the Commonwealth Parliament shall be invited to vary, wherever neccs-"" vary, the tariff on goods of United Kingdom origin in such manner as to give effect, to such principles. justify That throws the gates wide open to the .manufacturers of Great Britain to the detriment of Australian manufacturers, who are, subjected, to the full blast of overseas competition. It may take several years to establish a local industry on a firm basis; but, in view of the skill and versatility of Australian workmen, and duties the brains that are brought to bear upon manufacturing problems, the possibilities of industrial expansion in this country are almost unlimited. years ago it. was considered that, owing to i;he liability to shrinkage of woollen cloth made in Australia, one could not wear suits made of this cloth and preserve one's self-respect; but today the difference in quality between Australian-made and imported woollen cloth is so slight that suits made from Australian woollen materials can now be worn with pride and satisfaction. L i Great Britain , important trade bodies conferred with the British subcommittee of the Cabinet for months prior to the Ottawa. Conference. questionnaire was sent, out as a preliminary measure, asking manufacturers in the United Kingdom to give a list of the goods exported by them to the dominions, to state the trade - barriers operating against them, and to compare them with foreign tariffs, to state the value of the preferences they enjoyed,, to set out the secondary industries in the dominions which were competing with them, and to indicate a fai r competitive basis for their products. For the last 25 years Australia has granted preference to Great Britain . Long before any suggestion was made that Britain should give a preference to Australian goods, we granted preferences to - the Mother Country without. haggling such a3 occurred at the last Ottawa Conference, and, no doubt, will take place on the. next occasion. A questionnaire similar to that circulated in Great Britain should be distributed among Australiau manufacturers. From time to rime, the Government has been requested to deal, through the Defence Department., with the Japanese ve - seis which are engaged ' in poaching pearl shell in Australian waters within 50 miles of the Northern Territory. The. Japanese pay uo duties in Australia on any of the goods they use. Our people have been fishing for the last 50 or 60 years on the north-west, coast of Australia, and, in more recent times, in the waters of the Northern Territory. The pearl beds were discovered by Australian fishermen, who buy their food supplies in this country at Australian prices, and, unlike their competitors, contribute to the income tax. The Japanese use the cheapest of labour, and, notwithstanding A few the warnings given, openly boast of their intention to fish 6,000 to us of Australian shell this year. They are equipping themselves with large vessels to unable them to work through the monsoonal season. The Australian industry could be assisted by means of the trade arrangements soon to be made with rhe United States of America. A preference of 20 per cent, should be given on shell produced by Australian citizens of the north. This would enable us to compete against the foreigner in our own waters.",68
196,Mr RGSEVEAR,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Dalley) [11.201. A When this debate was commenced, 1 expected an indication from the Government as to the lines to be pursued in the negotiations with regard to the Ottawa . agreement. I am amazed that the Deputy Leader of the Government ('.Dr Earle Page), in the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), did not take it upon himself to speak on behalf of the Government:, but, of course, my amazement is tempered by my knowledge of the fact that the two parties comprising the Government are not at one in their outlook or their fiscal policy, and probably would not. be at one in the views he might put forward on behalf of Australia at the meeting ar which it is proposed to revise the Ottawa agreement. I am also mindful of the. fact that, the United Australia party section of the Government could hardly stand up foi the policy that would probably be pur forward by the Deputy Leader of the Government, because during the recent election campaign lie told rhe people 'har the policv of his party was arbitrarily to get back"" to the 1021-28 tariff levels. Apparently lie was not concerned with tariff boards, Ottawa agreements, or anything else. His view. I take ir, i entirely different from that held by the otlier section of the Government, but, whilst lie is not prepared to show hi>? hand, and the Government itself is not prepared ro show its band, there is jn^r the possibility that the Deputy Leader of the Government will be representing the Commonwealth Government at the meetings that arc to take place for the .negotiating of the new agreement. It is important therefore lo know what his outlook is in regard to this agreement. 11has not favoured us with his views the matter. Apparently the Government has seen to it that he has not had opportunity to do so. I do not quite with the outline which the General (Mr Menzies) gave today of history of the circumstances that led to the formulation of the agreement. spoke of economic nationalism, but not think that was the cause of the OttaAva agreement, because the policy ot economic nationalism was - being practised hy European countries, which used to be very lucrative markets for Australian produce up to a certain stage, long before the OttaAva agreement was ever brought into operation. The reason for this <>l economic nationalism was not a purely economic one. It was largely governed the experiences of those continental tries during the Great World War, w - ih rather forced upon them by a conentered sideration of the prospects of another world war. It Avas their very laudable desire, after their experience in the conflict, to be self-contained concerned the production of their own necessary food supplies both in peace in war time, it was largely 'because those considerations that the policy economic nationalism spread like a bushB fire through Europe. Its spread, if was first practised* in the primary dustries of those countries, Avas one of the most prolific reasons Avhy Australia suffered, both through the collapse of the volume of its trade with Europe, and the price of the commodities previously plied to Europe. In 1932, the. Ottawa agreement was"" before chamber, I ventured to express opinion: that it was an attempt to set an Empire trading bloc, and that such a policy Would have its repercussions. I ventured also to express the A iew that the component parts of the British pire could not come together in a tradStates ing bloc for the purpose of excluding rest of the Avorld from Empire without inviting retaliation', and that has been the experience of Australia. have not only been excluded from other markets, but, owing to the foolish trade diversion policy of this Government year, added to the effect of 'the Ottawa agreement, Ave have most effectually excluded from some of the best, markets that Australia enjoyed in all parts of the Government Mr Itoncrear. on world. Much has been said to-night about the benefits that Australia has achieved the through the Ottawa agreement, but I. agree want to add to what the honourable memAttorneyber for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) has the already said regarding the repudiation up of certain aspects of the agreement by He Great Britain, almost before the ink was I do dry upon it . Honourable members will remember that, despite the promises made to Australia, and the undertakings by the British Government in the agreement itself, that Government, very soon after the document was signed, entered into what were known as the ""Blac k Pacts"" policy with Denmark and otlier northern European countries, for the supply of the very by products for which it had undertaken to coungive Australia an expanding' market. and Those trade agreements Avhicli were into were described, not only in Australia, but also in Great Britain, as ""Blac k Pacts"". Great Britain underlast took, under them, to gi\ e the northern r so far as European countries concerned certain preferences which it had already underand taken to give to Australia under the of Ottawa agreement. Wc have now another of repercussion of - British policy, because r it a in today is entering, or proposing because lo enter, into an agreement Will the inUnited States of America. Whether this is to suit its own particular interests, or for the purpose of increasing the dimensions of the British Empire trading bloc. I am at a loss to know, but I believe thai., supif the proposals which so far have been "" when divulged to the public are carried out,, this the effect Avill be detrimental to many the sections of Australia's primary industries,, up and, just as the Empire trading bloc under the Ottawa agreement created in ternational' trade antagonisms against Australia, so I believe that the extension r Emof the agreement to take in the United of America will only increase and the accentuate the difficulties. The honormarkets, able member for Warringah (Mr Spender) could see very little damaging effect We to Australia's secondary industries in articles 9,10, 11 and 12 of the agreement. Speaking as he said from the Olympian last heights of an independent, he seemed very been anxious to agree Will everything put forward by the spokesmen of the as to its intentions. Whether or not he is satisfied Will the vuguo statements of the Attorney-Genera 1 (Mr Menzies) and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), he will learn in due course, as we learned in 1932, that he will know nothing of the policy of the Government, and that thi? Parliament will have no voice in the direction of that policy, until the agreement is placed before it for its endorsement. In .1.932 the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) was asked in. this House the very question which is agitating the minds of honourable members today, namely, what policy the Government, proposed to pursue at Ottawa. The right honourable gentleman then gave the very definite jiudertakiiig that before the delegation leftAustralia this - House would have the opportunity to discuss the details of any proposals which file Government intended to put forward at Ottawa. opportunity was afforded. The delegation proceeded to Ottawa, and returned with the agreement that I now have in my hand. .Not one "" i "" could be dotted and not one "" t "" crossed by this Parliament. The delegation assumed the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the Government, and we had ro either accept or reject agreement in loto. That is exactly what will happen on the next occasion. The House, should not be satisfied with tlit, vague speeches that; we have beard today from representatives of the Government. Honourable members are entitled to know what policy the Government proposes to follow; for example, whether if proposes to accept an agreement in terms similar to those of the present agreement, whether if proposes to press for an amendment of articles 9, 10, 1.1 and 12, which are so objectionable, and have caused so much controversy in Australia, and whether it is prepared to perpetuate a breach of the powers conferred upon this Parliament byjho Constitution, such as occurs under article 12. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), not, being one of the ""dumb driven cattle"" supporting the Government, ought to stand up as an independent who is free from party affiliations, and demand to be given some concrete idea of what is proposed. He says that he ran see nothing inimical to secondary industries in articles 9. 10, 11 and 12. Article 9 readsHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that protection by tariff's shall be afforded only to those industries which are reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success. How does the honourable member think that that matter is to be determined ? Who is to decide whether an industry is reasonably assured of sound opportunities for success? Should that determination be made by the Government, the Taritf Board, or the representatives of overseas manufacturers? Should we allow a tribunal that we have set up to be dictated to by overseas interests in the determination of whether any particular industry in Australia should be allowed to exist? Surely it is reasonable to assume that the people who invest their money in an 0 'No such industry are. best' able to determine whether or not it, is reasonably assured of success. Let us look at article 10. It readsHis Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia undertake that during the currency of the-agreement the tariff shall he based on the principle that protective duties shall not exceed such a level as w i ll give to United Kingdom producers full opporthe tunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative costs of ciiconoinical and cllicicnt production. I point out that in every inquiry so far conducted by the Tariff Board into matters governed by article .10, the only costs inquired into are those that operate in"" Australia. The board takes evidence with respect to the wages paid, the conditions of labour, and the profits made by the industry. A similar inquiry is not made in regard to competing industries in Great Britain. Only last year the Government proposed to adopt the recommendation of the Tariff Board in respect of pottery. I was able to point out, that the principal firm in Australia which made that particular line of goods had not paid, a dividend for three years, and had paid only 2-£ per cent, in the current year. The Government, on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, proposed to reduce the duties on the lines that this firm was producing. I was able to show by British trade, journals that the overseas interests which at the inquiry by the Tariff Board demanded a reduction, of the protective duty on those articles, were returning profits of from JO per to 20 per cent.. and very time were urging on the Government of Great .Britain that the protection of from the Tariff Board. 20 per ceut. which they enjoyed in comlawyer, petition with foreign firms should raised to 30 per cent. Yet under article 30 of the Ottawa agreement, the Tariff Hoard was attempting to place the Australian industry on a. f a ir competitive Customs, basis with the British industry! It is unfair that Australian manufacturers to should be fettered by article 10, when only inquiry made by the Tariff Board is in regard to their affairs. .I shall now consider article 12, and, doing so, I wish to join issue with the honourable member for Honty (Sir Henry right Gullett) who. in reply to an interjection by myself to-night, said that the obligaeffect, tions of Canada and Australia under this agreement were exactly the same. Although he attended the Ottawa Confermay ence, I know that the honourable gentlevast man's assertion was incorrect, because this entered matter was very full y debated in this Australian Parliament in 1932. I i i view of the fact ihu'fc be has reiterated that statement, is just sis well to quote the relevant articles in the Canadian and Auscountry. "" tralian agreements. Article 12 of the Australian agreement readsHis Majesty's Government in the C'niniiioiiweiiltli of Australia undertake that nn |irntei'tive duty shall lie imposed and no ing duty shall he increased on United Kingdom goods lo an amount in excess of the recommenappear dations of the Tariff Tribunal. It is clear that article 32 of the tralian agtcement; makes it absolutely mandatory that the Government shall accept the decision of the Tariff Board. The relevant article in the Canadian agreement is article 14, which readsHis Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada undertake that no existing duty shall be increased on United Kingdom goods except after an inquiry and the receipt of report from the Tariff Hoard and in accordance approximately ' £8,600,000. with the facts as found by that body. The wording and meaning of each of these articles differ entirely. The Parliament has to accept the determination of the Tariff Board; there is no such obligation on the Canadian ment. The Canadian agreement provides for an inquiry by the Canadian Mr Rosevear. Tariff Board, but all that is asked of it in cent, that agreement is that it shall not at that increase the. tariff on any particular article until after it has received a report I am not a but .1 doubt whether article 12 be ' of the Australian agreement does not conflict with taction 90 of the - Commonwealth Constitution, which readsOn the imposition of uniform duties of the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and gram: bounties on the production or export the of goods, shall become exclusive. * * * * * * in The Commonwealth Constitution says that Parliament shall have the exclusiveto del.enni.ne the fiscal policy of this country, but the Ottawa agreement, in says that the Tariff Board shall determine that: pol icy° rega rdless of what - this Government, or this Parliament;, think on the matter. .There is a difference between the obligations into by the Canadian and Governments under the Ottawa agreement, particularly in respect it of the surrender by Parliament of the right to determine the fiscal policy of the There seems to be a disposition to disparage any .suggestion that Australia new has done anything for the betterment of 1 exist- - other parts of the British Empire.. [ have just, studied some figures which in the official Statistical. Abstract of the United Kingdom for the period Ausfrom 1922 to 1935. This is an official parliamentary paper, and for purposes of comparison I have taken the figures for the year preceding that in which the Ottawa agreement was signed, and 1935, which is the. last year for which figures are available in this particular journal. In 1931. Australia's exports to Great Britain were valued at £45,679,000, and a in 1935, at £54,285,000, or an increase of Canada's exports to Great Britain in 1931 were valued at £32,340.000, and in 1935, at Australian £56,000,000, or an increase of £21,000,000. Canada, therefore, gained an advantage nearly 250 per cent, greater Governthan Australia under the Ottawa agreecertainly ment. It might be claimed that that is because Canada has given a greater share of its trade to Great Brit'aiu, but the facts prove the opposite to be the case. Australia's imports from Great Britain in 1931 were valued at £14,527,000, ami in 1935, at £29,338,000, or an increase of £15,000,000. Canada's imports from Great Britain in 3 931 were valued at £20,550,000, and in 1935 £21,381,000, or an increase of £830,000. Thus, although Australia's imports from Great Britain were £15,000,000 greater in value in 1935, than in 3931, - its increase in trade to Great Britain was valued at. only £8,600,000, whilst, on the other hand, Canada enjoyed an increased benefit of £21.000,000, although the value of its imports from Great Britain increased by only £830,000. Although Canada has fared much better than Australia under the Ottawa agreement, and although Australia's trade figures show that Great Britain has had the better of the trading with this country to the extent of £7,000,000 during the period for which I have cited figures, Canada has had the advantage .'is against Great Britain to the extent of over £20,000,000. Thus, the effect of the Ottawa agreement in both countries has been entirely different. 1 readily admit that, Canada has something to boast about; the Ottawa agreement has been a Godsend to that country, but it has not proved nearly so beneficial to Australia. We may have exported more in volume to Great Britain since the Ottawa agreement was signed, but the prices we have received for our exports have not, shown any great increase. Therefore, to those people who continually disparage the part which Australia is playing in Empire trade, I say that, generally speakimr, Australia has fared worse under the Ottawa agreement than has any other part of the British Empire. It is the duty of this Government, if it should enter into another trade agreement with other parts of the Empire, and even if this trading bloc is extended to include the United States of America, to see. at leasV""rhat Australia gets a much better deal than it did on the last occasion. If it does not <mt something belter from the point of view of our trade balance, I urge it. at least, not to restrict the rights of this Parliament to any greater deirroe than statesmen in any otlier part, of the Empire areprepared to restrict the powers of their parliament. The Government should not sacrifice any rights which this Parliament enjoys under the Constitution by agreeing to delegate, to an outside authority created by the Parliament the power to control the fiscal policy of the country. Wc are entitled to know whether it is intended to pursue this policy again, or whether a fight will be made by our representatives for the same conditions for Australia as the Canadian statesmen were able to exact ""for that dominion. If it does so we may not have a great deal to cavil at, but if it. does not do so trouble is certain to occur. Those who think they can secure the peace of the world by a bloc of British Empire conntries, whether in connection with international trade or international war. arc likely to be disillusioned. It will be of no use for us-to attempt to exclude other than Empire countries from participation in the trade in raw materials of British dominions. The position will nor. be helped very much by forming a bloc of English-speaking peoples as it is apparently proposed to do. Such a policy will merely accentuate the difficulties which the world is facing and which confront all the English-speaking peoples, as well as all others.",70
197,Mr NOCK,THELATEHONORABLE SIR,"Riverina) [11.53] - We have been given today by the Attorney General (Ivlr. Menzies) and also by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) an outline of the policy which the Government intends to adopt in the negotiations for a renewal of the Ottawa agreement, and honourable members have had the opportunity to express their views upon the subject. It is extraordinary that., in the course of this debate, many of the arguments advanced five years ago in opposition to the Ottawa agreement have been repeated, although they have long ago been effectively exploded. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) used figures relating to 1935 in dealing with certain aspects of our trade in his comparisons with Canada, but they were so out-of-date as to be absolutely useless. The figures for the last two years which are available completely rebut his arguments. The fairest judgment is based on results anil snrely the best way to assess the value of the Ottawa agreement is to consider its effects upon the parties chiefly concerned in it. I shall refer first to British manufacturers. These have undoubtedly enjoyed an increased trade with Australia. Secondly our own manufacturers have been benefited. It was said when the Ottawa agreement was first made that the interests of the Australian manufacturers would be seriously prejudiced, yet our actual experience has been that they have enjoyed more prosperous times in the last few years than ever before. During the currency of this agreement our manufacturing industries have shown marked development, the employment of people in our factories has in five years increased by more than 200,000, and the amount of capital invested in Australian secondary industries has increased by £24.000,000.' The turnover and profits of our manufactures, ar revealed by their balance sheets, have also expanded enormously. The cement industry affords us a striking example of what has occurred. Even twelve months' ago certain. Jeremiahs declared that, unless certain action was taken by the Government the Australian' cement industry would be destroyed. The fact is that the. output of this industry this year will be-100,000 tons in excess of the output last year. Our primary pro-diicers have also enjoyed big advantages from the Ottawa agreement. Recently the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ; Mr A. Green) said that the Australian wheat-growing industry had not bene:'ited by reason of the Ottawa agreement, aud could not do so because sufficient wlieat was already grown within the Briush Empire to supply all the needs of the British people. That statement was not correct. During the last five years. Great Britain has imported a very large quantity of wheal from Argentina and Kussia, and on every quarter of wheat sent to England from these countries a duty of 2s. a quarter' has been paid. This duty has helped the Australian wheat-growers to the extent of 3d. a bushel. Figures which I obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician provide undeniable evidence of the advantages of the Ottawa agreement to the people of Australia as a whole. Mr Nock. The consumers have been protected against those who would exploit them and producers have been helped out of the financial morass. Many people fail to recognize the very defin ite in d i rect ad va n tage-represen t i ug millions of pounds-receive d by the primary producers of Australia through the Ottawa agreement due to the influence upon home prices which have invariably followed, the better export prices that have resulted from the preferences contained in the Ottawa agreement. Even the direct results have Contributed in a material degree to the financial rehabilitation of Australia, as shown by the following schedules in which appears the years, the product, the value or quantity exported, the rate of duty on the foreigner, and the extra amount received by Australia through being exempt from the tariff imposts.
