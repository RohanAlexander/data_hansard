Many officers in the departments are applying, for vacancies, they are not quite; sure tliey are to be considered Commonwealth officers, State Governments are anxious for information on thepoint,, so that they may arrange their Estimates accordingly.",15
7,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"In answer to the honorment able and. learned member's question,- as to importance of which I quite agree witli the Government-unles s there are some ceptional cases-and as to these I have particular information-no w regard the of officers' oftransferred departments as been "" retained"" within the meaning.of the Constitution.

8,Mr MAUG ER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE, I shouldlike to' suggest to the honourable member that he should add another paraOrder graph to his motion asking for information as to the minimum - wage paid.. Information as to the average wage is always misleading.,15

10,Mr MAUGER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,That is what I want-to get at..,15

Mr CROUCH (Corio) - I think J might and theask my honourable friend-^ ME. WATSON - I should, like to know if a motion moved by a.private member can be discussed-and the moving of an, amendinvolves discussion-in .time setapart the for Government business.. The< rule in the him, New South Wales Legislature is that a exmotion moved by a private member may. be no taken only before the Government business the day is called on f oraially without dishaving cussion or amendment. I taket he point because we have resolved to setapart a certain amount of time for Government business and to give up Fridays to private business, bufc it might happen, if a private member's motion is allowed to be discussed in this way, that a motion might be moved the disreturn cussion of which would take up the whole sitting. I therefore ask your ruling, Mr . the Speaker, as to whether it is in order for giving the honourable member for Echuca to do are more than formally move his motion. Peremsonally I do not object to the amendment.",15
12,Mr BAHTOX,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"I understand that, where the consent of the Government has been obtained, a motion can be put down on the be rebusiness paper as ""unopposed,"" so that it female may be taken without discussion before we reach Government business. It was on that, assumption that I said that I would not oppose this motion. Mr SPEAKER. - I would direct the attention of honourable members to Standing 1 \ 3 of the draft standing orders which have been temporarily adopted to govern our procedure. That standing order saysUnopposed motions for returns shall have precedence of other motions on the notice-paper, motions for leave of absence; and shall be moved' without debate. "" The The honourable member for Echuca moved motion without debate, and I think that if the amendment had been moved without debate no objection could have been reasonably taken to it . The honourable member for Bland was right in calling attention to the fact that unopposed business must be taken without debate, because otherwise much time might be expended on private members' business contrary to the intention of the standing orders.",15
13,Mr BEID,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"May I point out that a difficulty may arise from this practice, much as the House may be precluded by some arrangement to which it is no party from discussing certain motions.",16
14,Mr SPEAKER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,The position is this : that if any honourable member desires to debate an unopposed motion it must at once stand over until private members' business is called on.,16
15,Mr THOMSON,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"May I ask if the rule that there shall be no debate does not necessarilyexclude amendments. If amendments are proposed, they cannot be considered without explanation and debate. That is the very thing to be avoided, because it involves the delay of business which is on the business paper.",16
16,Mr BARTON,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"May I say a word on this point. The understanding on which the Government consents not to oppose a motion is that the motion remains in the same form. If the motion is amended, or a proposition of amendment is made, it becomes then a question whether the Government can, on its own motion, maintain the question in that form. We should let in debate on amendments if that understanding were once departed from. That would be a veiy serious question-it is one that was raised earlier in the session-because it might lead to the consumption of a great deal of valuable time on Government days, although the matter could be properly dealt with on private members' days. In order to save any trouble, I will say that if the honourable member who raised the question about new paragraph (4 a) will withdraw his motion and hand it to me in writing, I will have the return prepared so as to include the particulars he wishes.",16
17,Mr REID,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,Will the Prime Minister explain whether there is any standing order which governs questions unopposed 1,16
18,Mr BARTON,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,Standing Order 113 is the only one.,16
19,Mr REID,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"What does it mean-uno p posed by the Government, or unopposed by the House? Mr , BARTON - I think the standing orders refer to motions unopposed by the Government. There is, in the State from which land the right honourable ancl learned member for East Sydney come, a preceding form of ascertaining whether a motion is opposed-it is just as well to mention the matter now-unde r which the Speaker goes inasthrough the business paper and through the list of notices of motions, no matter how many notices there may be, and ascertains whether any are . objected to. Those not objected to are passed without debate, and the others remain for discussion.",16
20,Mr SPEAKER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"Perhaps it is just as well to settle the matter now. W it h the approval of the House, in the future, whenever an honourable member rises to debate or amend a motion on the unopposed list, the debate will at once stand adjourned.",16
21,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,Would it be competent for any honourable member to object to a motion 1,16
22,Mr SPEAKER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"I have just said that if a member rises to debate or amend a motion, that motion will at once stand over and lose its position as unopposed business. The standing orders do not define what is "" unopposed business,"" and there is some difficulty in exactly interpreting this particular standing order. But for the future it will be interpreted in the way I have indicated. Question resolved in the affirmative. QUESTIONS.",16
23,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE," I would like to ask, on a. matter of some urgency to my mind, whether the Prime Minister will take some steps",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,Does the honourable member intend to submit a motion 1 Mr G. B. EDWABDS - I desire to ask a question.,16
25,Mr SPEAKER,FEMALE EMPLOYES OF THE,"The honourable member cannot ask a question at this stage. NA SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed (from 4th July, vide page 2102) on motion by Mr KINGSTONThat this Bill be now read a second time. Mr ' BEID (East Sydney) - I regret to say that I have not had a ful l opportunity of studying the provisions of this Bill, and I am inclined to think it rather inwhieh convenient that the Bill should proceed without a proper interval, such as would admit of some regard being paid to the views of persons who are engaged in busiconflict ness connected with the Custom-house. We have had the advantage of the labours of very able board of Customs officials, and think we see the results of those labours the Bill. I wish to congratulate my right honourable and learned friend the Minister for Trade and Customs on the generous manner in which he acknowledged the things labours, of the officers of his department. dominions is allowed to do. That is an acknowledgment which is feel sometimes omitted in cases in which i ought to be made, and I rather admire the attitude of the Minister, who is not ashamed to acknowledge his indebtedness to the officers of his department. At the same time, with characteristic humility, right honourable and learned friend omitted reference to himself. I know his abilities other. as a draftsman, and I can see in this traces of those abilities. Whether we agree with the provisions of the Bill or not, certainiv has in an unusual degree the merit of plain and direct expression. I have hacl occasion to administer Customs Acts, and must say .1I have never hacl the good fortune, in Australia, at any rate, to see Customs provisions expressed in such direct language. One of the results, of course, of a Bill framed by Collectors of Custonis is that of lesuh which one would expect from a Bill with reference to the prevention crime framed by a policeman. Every Custonis provision is made in favour of the policeheavy man ancl against the victim. This Bill, I think, transcends every other Bill of the kind in the thoroughly brutal fashion in which it suppresses the individual who may happen to come in conflict with His Majesty's Custonis. There are some most remarkable provisions of this character. At the same time it is only fair to say that when the nature of the charge luxuries brought by Customs officials against an dulge in. individual is that of an attempt to defraud, the Customs officials will be good enough to assume his guilt until he establishes his innocence; or if the matter in reference to which a man may be charged some is in the nature of an indictable visions offence, this Bill with very rare tenderness admits that it will not be the duty of the person accused to establish his innocence, but that the old-fashioned rule will be applied requires the accuser to establish the guilt of the person accused. But, putting these two cases aside, the onus of proof is put always on the person who conies into with His Majesty's Customs. I do not know whether our fiscal enthusiasm will a go so far as to look on the institution of a I Custom-house itself as a sacred edifice, ancl in the persons who inhabit it as sacred individuals. Some persons carry tlieir fiscal views so far that a Customs badge is held to be sufficient proof of a right to clowhich no other person in the King's, But I that in this discussion we ought tot eliminate altogether the fiscal question we ought to deal with this Bill entirely apart from any view of fiscal policy; weought to aim at a Bill which will be absolutely fair both to the Crown on the one my hand, and to individuals who may happenall to come in conflict with the Crown on the In fact, in this department we Bill should follow the time-honoured rules of legislation. I quite admit there are some* it aspects of custom duties which do require sometimes, and in rare case's, rather exceptional powers. But making that fair adI mission, I am bound to say, as the result of the inspection which I have been able to make of this Bill, that it seems to nie to go very much further than any law that I am aware of in connection with the administrasort tion of Custonis. I think honourable members will see that a business firm, which is of bound to come often in conflict with the authorities, is under a sufficiently obligation not to unnecessarily ruffle the susceptibilities of the Customs authorities.. An individual in a matter of appeal, against the decision of the Customs authorities in a particular case may prove he is absolutely right, and that the Customs officials were absolutely wrong; but it is questionable in actual experience whether a victory of that sort is not one of the clearest which a large firm can possibly inPersons who have to deal with the Custonis authorities are sufficiently in not their hands from the very nature of the business, ancl I will take occasion when we get into committee to draw attention to of what seem to be the too drastic proof this measure. I wish now only fco select one or two of the most important clauses, because we ought to recognise that our useful labours will probably begin when i we are in committee. This, is not a Bill which 'raises any very great principle in itself. Whatever aiiay, be - the fiscal policy of ithe Commonwealth, a - Bill of this - sort - will - be necessary. Some of the ;clauses, perhaps, will be inoperative, ibut the Bill will ,be - equally necessary whatever the Tariff of the Commonwealth may .be,-so* that there is no large principle involved in the second reading of 'the measure. T-here is nothing in this Bill which I think ^is . not in our Customs Regulation Bills, or .which would callon the House to seriously consider the question - of - negativing .the motion for the second residing. Consequently I do not intend to. 'take up the time .of the House by any reference to matters of i detail which oan 'be .fairly dealt with in committee. But in ,the first place I do hope 'that we shall have - theassistance in committee of - some honourable members who are familiar - with the - workingof such Acts, not only as they affect ithe Customs authorities, but as they affect the trading .interests 'of the <ports - of Australia. Of course, 'to - a certain extent the remark will mot be accepted universally, though I - with certain qualifications .it may - be so - accepted, - that 'beyond the - requirements - of the - fiscal - policy of the Commonwealth no Jionorable'member, either of the Eederal Government .or :of this House, desires :to throw .unnecessary obstacles'in' the way - of the transactions »of commerce. know, the-more .difficult the operations of --commerce are - the miore expensive - the - results ure likely-to be to the-<great mass of the .people of the - community. putting - aside all .fiscal differences for a time, I suppose we all desire to unite - in. an endeavour to - make this law as just and .as little of a-meddlesome character as we possibly can. I wish to refer first to what I conceive to be the clause which will raise the most difficult and important question-in connection with the Bill, namely, clause 257. When the .Minister for Trade and Customs was in .his most able - and lucid manner giving this House a bird's-eye view of the scope and character of the measure I ventured to interject a 'remark of which he apparently .approved, that instead of a resolution of the House the collection .of Customs duties when the Budget speech had been delivered in this House, 'perhaps an amendment might .be made to the effect that upon the delivery of the Budget speech, without any resolution Mi: Seid. the duties might be collected - Obviously, that, seemed to .be at first sight the most .convenient course. ThisBill - first came into my hands at the time the right Jionorable-gentleman was delivering his speech, and I bad not-Jiad .time for ireflection. But after an interval for reflection, I-began to perceive - that there are some very serious difficulties in connection with thematterthat - it is not so easy of solution as it appeared - to me to be. In the first place the difficulty arises whether thei duties-embodied in a Budget speech, -.and which might be collected - next tmorning, - would in their collection amount to the imposition of uniform-duties - within the meaning of the Constitution Act. If they would-and indeed Lam afraid if they would not - ther e would .still remain some veiy - serious questions to consider. As we know, the right of imposing duties is not a right which can- - be exercised - on the statement - of a Minister delivered in this House. The proper basis for collection-of - such duties is the-authorization of law. Eirst, as to any difficulties-which may arise as .to-the time tliink at which the Tariff was submitted, I-ought to point out what perhaps is perfectly familiar already to the Government, namely, that if this Tariff statement - is .not - made at a very,early.periodj-weishalLbedriven.on to a time about Christmas,-when it will - be-simply impossible, if there the..airy - difficulties at As - .we - all, to arrive .at. a - legal - settlement-of those ; .difficulties-that is to .say arrive at a Tariff Act-'befor e the Christmas-pro rogation. If the-duties are to becollected for an inTherefore, definite periodj-under a mere statement of the finance Minister,-honorablermembers will see that, from the veiy'pressure of circumstances and'Owing to.the expiration-of the time, the free .discretion of this House and the proper constitutional rights - ofanother Chamber .may absolutely go by default. They will see that a situation might arise-of imere delay, which - would make it impossible to exercise in a full and fair waythe judgment either of this'Or of any other House - upon the Tariff. I begiiv-to see, therefore, that the suggestion which I threw out is one - to which I am not prepared to. adhere at present. I see the very-serious difficulty of the matter, because, authorizing assuming that the Tariff proposed by the Treasurer were not ultimately successful, all the powers of the States-to cany on Tariff legislation, or even the State Tariffs which were in force at the time the Budget speech was delivered would, on a certain interpretation of the effect of a Budget statement, have disappeared. Thus-, we should neither have a Commonwealth Customs Tariff nor a State Customs Tariff. Honourable members will see that if on the statement of the Treasurer the duties are collected next morning, and if that is taken to be the imposition-withi n the meaning of the Constitution Act-of uniform duties, the State Tariffs and the State powers over such matters have gone, and gone for ever.",16
26,Mr WATSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does .the right honourable - member think that that would be the interpretation ?,19
27,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is a matter of such importance that we cannot very well leave it in doubt. There are a great many matters which we can leave in doubt, but this seems to be one which is too serious altogether to be left in that condition. It suggests - itself to me as a very serious difficulty which we shall have to consider. I will not say any .more in reference to it , but I thought - it necessary to say what I think, in order to qualify the interjection which I made. There is another matter which is perhaps not of very great importance in the view of this House, but which I think will acquire considerable importance in view of the interests and convenience of the steamship companies who do business upon the Australian coast- I allude of course to the provisions of clause 121. I believe that at first there was considerable consternation aroused owing to a misapprehension as to the full scope of this clause. 'The impression amongst some of the shipping authorities was - that under this Bill it was proposed ipractically to seal up the ships' stores when vessels were trading between Inter-State ports, but as any one who studies the clause can perceive, that is not the proposal of the Bill. The proposal of the Bill is that a certain allowance should be made out of the ships' stores for what may be considered the fair requirements both of the crew .and passengers between Inter-State ports. I suppose that the authority who prescribed - the allowance would be at .liberty to prescribe an allowance which would cover the whole movements of the ship from the time it arrived at the first Australian port until the time when it reached its port of destination within the Commonwealth. I suppose that could be done. There was mo intention on the part of the Minister to deprive ships of their usual or proper allowance of ships' stores for crews and passengers on the coast.",19
28,Mr ISAAGS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The term ""prescribed"" means "" prescribed by the Act.""",19
29,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does it?,19
30,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes ; will the right honourable member look, atfcheinterpretation ? Miv REID - Then an unusual - meaning is pufc on the word ""-prescribed.""",19
31,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The intention is to charge for stores consumed on Australian waters.,19
32,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"As a rule..the term ""prescribed "" refers to regulations, but in this particular Bill I see that it refers to things contained in the Act itself.",19
33,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Act includes regulations also.,19
34,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then really it comes back to what I said before, because if the Minister proposed to prescribe nr the Act, I think he would have prescribed in this Bill. I do not suppose that the Minister intends to bring down a new clause dealing with this subject.'",19
35,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"No . JSIr. REID - Consequentl y the action of the Minister must be :taken to. .mean that in this particular case the word "" prescribed "" means ""prescribed by regulation."" I do not suppose that the Minister would undertake to prescribe in the Act for a matter of this sort. I suppose there - are two things aimed.at in this clause : one is ;to levy duties upon ships' stores which are consumed by first passengers who embark ;at Inter-State ports.",19
36,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Our idea is to provide for charging duties on stores which are consumed in Australian waters or between Australian ports.,19
37,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,:Eve n upon goods which.are consumed by the sliips' crews 1,19
38,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is so.,19
39,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then the Bill, goes .much further than I anticipated.",19
40,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It would be most unfair to treat those who trade only within the States differently. We must have the practice :uniform, one way or. the other.",19
41,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I would be quite prepared to give the States' vessels the same advantages which are enjoyed by other vessels. Of course the brain of my right honourable friend is not capable of talcing in an idea of that sort. Instead of relaxing anything, his idea is to give another turn to the screw.",19
42,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I think the right honourable member will admit that uniformity is desirable, and that we ought not-to give a preference to the oversea ships.",20
43,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Uniformit y is desirable, but I think my right honourable friend, in endeavouring to remove a mole-hill, will find that he has created a mountain. That is one of the things that may arise in connection with this Bill. I do not wish to indulge in any anticipations that our legislation will be interfered with.",20
44,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Would the right honourable member allow them all free?,20
45,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not know that the terms become "" free "" necessarily.",20
46,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The right honourable meinber is contending that they should take bonded goods out of a warehouse free.,20
47,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I contend that when a man is travelling on the high seas-say , from London or South Africa to Sydney-h e is always entitled to be free of our Customs regulations. Why, he is not within our jurisdiction for more than a few hours in the course of many days, and when he is within our three miles' limit-say , in coming from Fremantle to Adelaide-it is not for more tlian a very short period. No man's right to consume intoxicating liquors upon the high seas, apart from any Tariff of the Commonwealth, can be successfully interfered with under such circumstances.",20
48,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then the right honourable member might have as many floating hotels in Sydney harboras he pleased, with free goods there.",20
49,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"My right honourable friend is changing his ground. I am not speaking of a harbour when I talk about a ship that is within the three miles' limit of our coast. I am quite in sympathy with a Minister in any attempt which he may make to bring under proper control any sort of drinking traffic upon vessels whilst they are within our jurisdiction, or say at our wharfs.",20
50,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,And from Sydney to Newcastle.,20
51,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is perfectly immaterial, if the ship is within the three miles' limit.",20
52,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,They cannot sell liquor within a harbour now.,20
53,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I understood so ; still I think that the twelve policemen .who have drawn this Bill-the Customs ofncialshave been annoyed-ver y properly annoyed to a certain extent-by an abuse of the consumption of ships' stores while vessels are at anchor, particularly upon Sundays. The mail steamers anchor at the Williamstown Pier, and I believe that upon Sundays particularly there has been a great deal of evasion of the proper intention of the law with reference to ships' stores, and that a considerable trade is being done in intoxicating liquors, not with the passengers, but with people who are merely visitors to the ships. This is a matter which has troubled the minds of the Customs people a great deal. It is to meet abuses of that sort that this clause is principally directed. But I think that there is nothing which we can do that can take away the rights of the oflieers, crew, or passengers of a ship coming from some place beyond the Commonwealth, to their freedom as to ships' stores, as well as to navigation when they are beyond the limits of our jurisdiction. The Imperial Government were careful- I think I am right in saying so-to alter a clause which we put in the forefront of our Constitution so as to make it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth should have no jurisdiction over ships whose first port of clearance was not within the Commonwealth.",20
54,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"They withdrew that. They did not insist on the alteration. They tried to get the alteration, but abandoned it.",20
55,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,But the Bill as drafted contains the words which I have mentioned.,20
56,Mr BARTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,They abandoned the proposed alteration.,20
57,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I can quite understand their abandoning any objection which they might have had, because the clause itself seems fairly to protect the interests of Imperial shipping. Section 5 of the Constitution provides that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force only on British ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. Now the first port of clearance of, say, foreign-going steamers from the old countiy is certainly not within the Commonwealth. The word "" first"" is put in with some meaning. The section clearly puts the position iri the words "" whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are within the Commonwealth."" Now, under those words, it does seem that Inter-State vessels whose first port of clearance is, say, Eremantle-tak e an Inter-State steam-ship which trades between Fremantle and Sydney, touching at portswould be subject to the laws of the Comof monwealth, but that the great mail steamers, whose first port of clearance is, say, Southampton, will be absolutely beyond the laws of the Commonwealth whilst they are on their voyage even to Sydney, touchCommonwealth."" ing at all ports in between. I do not at dispute that while a vessel is lying bor it may become subject to the local laws. I do not at all wish to dispute because it may be perfectly true that moment a vessel anchors at a Melbourne pier or at a Sydney pier, or even laide waters, it is for certain purposes subject.to the laws of the State, but I think the Government has stretched this clause to be said that such an extent that it may lead to the whole Bill being reserved. The Govern The ment are stretching the powers of this Bill too far when they 'assume a dominion over ship's stores when the ships' are outside terrivessels torial limits, say on a voyage between London and Fremantle, ancl thence on to Sydney.",20
58,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The right - honourable gentleman does not think our rights, Customs legislation depend upon that tion of British ships.",21
59,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I consider that the to which I have referred have a meaning. I think the expression is a very wide one, ancl that the section which fines the operation of the Constitution is the most important one in that the Act. It was thought necessary the operation of the laws and Constitution of the Commonwealth, but we hacl no need to define our local Acts, because we know that they can operate only within our own jurisdiction. But in our Commonwealth Act, before we come to the Constitution itself, we have sections which are intended to safeguard the rights of persons outside the Commonwealth, ancl the expresgentleman sion to which I refer seems sufficiently to cover everything. Section 5 of the A saysThis Act and. all law's made by the Parliament offcheCommonwealth underfcheConstitualtogether. tion, shall be binding on the courts Judges people of every State and of every part Commonwealth, notwithstanding anything in the la ws of any State ; and the laws of the Commonlying wealthsNow we come clown to the very point in this Bill And the laws offcheCommonwealth shall be force on all Britisli ships. If the section stopped there the position woulcl be very clear, but it does not. First all, all the Queen's ships of war are excepted altogether, and then there is a further definition of British ships which are to be ships only, "" whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the It is absurd for any one all - eve n for a Customs authority-to contend in harthat a P. and O. steamer such as the India, which first leaves Southampton or that, the Thames, woulcl be subject to this the law. I suppose the Thames would be considered the first port of clearance of a P. in Adeancl O. or Orient steamer.",21
60,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHAKN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,21
61,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then clearly it could not Fremantle was the first port of clearance of such a steamer? expression "" first port of clearance"" is put into this general section for an object, and it means that our power is limited to whose firstportof clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. In other words, if a P. ancl O. liner, instead of trading between * London and Sydney of touching at ports, should trade between definiFremantle and Sydney, that P. ancl O. liner would immediately come under the words operation of the Commonwealth laws.",21
62,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Does the right honourable gentleman mean if the spirits are delivered deon board at, say, Fremantle ? Mr B.EID -- 1 do not mean anything of sort. I am dealing with the section in to define the Commonwealth Act.",21
63,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,But I wanted to put a concrete case to the honourable member.,21
64,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"1 will deal with that presently. At present I am dealing only with the wording of the Act, and this fool of an Act does not give a concrete case, but only clearly contains a general expression.",21
65,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does the right honourable mean that if spirits or other goods wide are delivered to these ships within 3 c t miles of the shore they need not pay the duty ?,21
66,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is another matter What I mean to say is this, and that a steamer having put ship's stores on of the board in the Thames may, while she is at a pier in an Australian port, be subject to certain domestic regulations of that port, but that these domestic regulations cannot follow her out of the port into a place :'n that is beyond our jurisdiction, that is 3 miles outside.",21
67,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Quiteso . That is actually what I was asking the honourable meinber.,22
68,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Whils t - the ship is .within the 3 - miles limit, within a port or within the 3 ;miles limit generally, she - may be subject to certain regulations, within certain limits affecting matters within a narrow sphere, but her subjection to these regulaand tions is not-such a subjection as-will extend to her when she is beyond the three miles limit. Mr HIGG'NS - The right honourable gentleman means that she is liable to come under the operation of our Tariff as long from: Australia. as she is within 3 miles of the coast ?",22
69,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"No , I do not, because the Tariff is so defined that no man is liable to its operation unless he lands goods upon certain wharfs within our jurisforeign-goingsteamers diction. The Tariff does not arise until .then. But the provision in ' this <toms Bill is an attempt to take Cur Tariff on spirits .and tobacco out on the - seas in connection with a ship that is - not compames. engaged in the coastal trade.",22
70,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Whic h clause does the right honourable gentleman sav does that ?,22
71,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,I am afraid that this clause - him. in the Oustoms Bill does endeavour that.,22
72,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,I could not :follow that.,22
73,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I will explain why I think it endeavours to do-that. I do not tliink that-my right honourable friend, the Minister for Customs, will dispute the view that the clause does endeavour to controlships' stores immediately a vessel touches, say, Fretlie mantle.",22
74,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Sh e is-.within our jurisdiction then.,22
75,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is to say, that the moment a ship arrives at Fremantle she comes under the Commonwealth j-urisdiction, and even after she leaves Fremantle ancl - goes on the high seas again her stores still liable to the operation of our",22
76,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I have not said that yet.,22
77,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,I am very glad that the Minister'does not go so far as that.,22
78,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,How does clause 121 say that?,22
79,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"-We-are'gettin g down nearer to the point, and it will save '-time i Minister will show us what he means. ' This is not a mere idle discussion, but a very compartments. serious matter, affecting a very large number .of people in ordinary business, and affecting - also the validity of this Bill. I desire to confine myself to the important matters dealt with in the measure, such as - the provisions of clause 121. If-these ships I have referred to are included in it , and my right honourable-frienddoes take the view, that they local are--thes e vessels that come from abroad touch at Fremantle, intending to touch at other Inter-State ports-this Bill assumes a right to put the Commonwealth hand on the stores issued for the use of the crew.'",22
80,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,I cannot see that. The clause only refers to stores that are shipped,22
81,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Are the stores now obtained duty free out of the warehouse ?,22
82,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,If the Minister says that this refers only to coasters and not to,22
83,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I am sorry I cannot Cusoblige the right honourable gentleman.,22
84,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,I do not want to be obliged. high I have nothing to do with these shipping,22
85,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The right honourable - member knows very well that I would never dream-of imputing anything of the kind to He ought not to attempt to fasten to do such an expression upon me.,22
86,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Well , the expression was a very awkward one.",22
87,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I never dreamt of any such construction being placed upon it . - Mr Reid - I am not at all obliged by any particular construction that may --be put .upon the provisions 'of the Bill , and"" if Minister adopted the view that I have put he would not oblige nie in any way, as I - occupy quite a disinterested position. If the .Minister-takes the view that this clause does not refer to vessels whose .first port of clearance-is beyond the Commonwealth all my remarks would be idle.",22
88,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,I understood that unapplied are only to goods that are shipped from AusTariff laws. tralia on to those ship3.,22
89,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If that were so I would not waste the time of the House, but it is not so. When we speak of the sliips' stores of a vessel surely the Bill .does not mean that there are two .lots of stores, the lot that has remained unconsumed since her departure from London, and the fresh lot f the that is put on board at Fremantle. Ships do not keep their stores i i i geographical They have not a little store for the Fremantle stores, and another for those shipped at Adelaide, another for those taken on .board .at Melbourne, and .a .fourth store .for 'the goods .taken in at Sydney. There .is :no such absurclit}'. as that, but the ships' stores are all .kept together. If I am wrong-in my view of the meaning of the clause I should ;be only--too glad to be corrected by 'the Minister, but I take it that the Minister uses - the expression "" ships' stores "" in allusion 'to the whole of the ships' stores.",22
90,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Thes e three clauses refer to the shipping, free of duty, - from the warehouse of ships' stores for the use of the ship.",23
91,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That does not help us veiy much yet. May I ask this simple question-Does the expression "" ships' stores "" in clause 121 mean only the ships' stores that have been taken on - board at an Australian port ?",23
92,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It-does .,23
93,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Onl y that?,23
94,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes . - Mr Reid - Well, I - w i sh my right honourable friend had said so before. - Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN --Then we shall shut out any steamer from taking Australian stores.",23
95,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is exactly what will follow. The ships, instead of buying - in Australia, will take very, good care to enough stores to bring them out from .the abuses in London .and take them .back again.",23
96,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CUSTOMS BIL L,-They do that - now.,23
97,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"This is a - marvellous .piece of statesmanship. It certainly removes more-serious objection, because we want see this Bill , so framed that it can come into operation without .delay ; and we do not want it to contain.anything that will impede that. 'The .explanation removes a serious matter entirely from-my observations, and I do not wish now - to say now. - much' more about this clause.",23
98,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does-the right honourable gentleman mean that the ships will take fresh meat from London to come through the tropics to Australia ?,23
99,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"A r e we going to put and - bread and various other little luxuries of that kind on .our Tariff? Thatisthe of thing that only barbarians would tliink of. I do not mean any offence, because I am referring not to live meat but to-dead meat. I fancy it will be a long time ibefore there will be a duty on dead meat. I think that even my most rabid protectionist - friends will leave that alone. The construction - which the Minister puts upon this clause-now makes it , if possible, not more seriousr but^niQre ridiculous than ever. Now - we understand .that if a ship, whose first - port of clearance was outside the Commonwealth, arrives at a port within the Commonwealth, there.must be a strict distinction kept between-the stores that come from the first port of clearance and the stores that the ship buys at that Interstate port, and that-over part.of the stores the Customs will have authority and be able to seal them up, while over the other part the Customs will not have authority and cannot seal them up.",23
100,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I really have not said that. : Mr Reid - Well , let us know what the position is.",23
101,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is so difiicult to make the right honourable gentleman understand.,23
102,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If my right honourable ancl learned friend will gorrect his infcrepretation I will correct .my statement. - Mr KINGSTON,- I think we-shall get on better in committee-in connection with these points. - Mr Reid - No doubt; - but still I think it is-my .duty to point out the difficulhave ties connected-with this-question. As to - connection with ships lying in harbour, I do not think there will be any serious question about' the necessity of providing .against them; buti f an attempt is - made to go beyond that, it will be found the - that there are a number of difficulties. to My right .honourable friend, having first told me that the clause referred only to ships' stores purchased in an Australian port, now says that it must not be taken to-mean that. If - he will - not givemie any.other-explanation, I cannot go any - further into the matter I am pointing out these tilings so that they can be properly considered in committee, and I shall not refer to the clause at greater length, because we shall get fuller information in regard to it in committee. As the clause is worded I feel meat that the term ""ships' stores"" is used indiscriminately-that it refers to stores, sort wherever procured. ""The object of clause 132is a very good one. As we.all know, when there are duties .upon certain articles, efforts are incessantly made to evade them byimporting articles which do not technically come within the description, but which are I really the same as the articles which do; and this clause contains a provision which is necessary to check that practice. I observe, however, that it differs from other legislation of the kind with which I am acquainted, inasmuch as the matter is put entirely into the hands of the Minister. In Other Customs Acts, this power is given to the Collector of Customs, to be exercised subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, and personally I prefer that in this case the power should be given to the Collector of Customs rather than to the Minister.",23
103,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The power would be exercised by the collector, but the act would be a Ministerial act. Mx. REID - I think the provision is worth considering, and that it would be more satisfactory to every one concerned if the power were exercised by the Governor General in Council, which means by the Ministry acting upon the report or advice of the Collector of Customs. The matter, however, is not of^much importance. There is, however, a matter of considerable importance to which I shall now refer. As I understand the Bill, the Minister may in some matters determine finally questions in dispute between the Customs department and any person having business with that department; while, in other cases, if the person who has the dispute with the department does not bring an action against it within four months, he is to be taken to have admitted that the Minister's decision was right. That I think is an objectionable method of procedure, if any other is feasible. In some of the States, they have had boards of commissioners, and the person at difference with the Customs has had the option, instead of going to an expensive tribunal such as a court of law, of going these boards, which are generally composer] of three business men, who make inquiries and arrive at a decision without the usual legal formalities. Although 1 admit that these boards have not been used very much in the past, I suggest to my right honourable friend that it would be a better provision to give the option of something short of litigation in a court of law to persons who have had a dispute with the department. Speaking generally, there is no appeal against sion except by a resort to litigation, and even that appeal is denied in many cases. The Minister spoke the other night about the forfeitures which are provided in the Bill being usual; but some of them are very startling. For instance, here is a condition under which a ship worth, perhaps, £50,000 or £60,000, shall become forfeit to the Governmen tAny ship found within 1 league of the coast failing to bring to for boarding upon being lawfully required to do so shall be forfeited to His Majesty. That is to say, that if the 'captain of a ship which is within 3 miles of the coast does not bring his vessel to when the Customs flag is hoisted, it shall be forfeited. There is no option.",24
104,Mr OMALLEY,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is tyranny.,24
105,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is something to which we are not mucli accustomed as applied to our own people. We do not apply that sort of law to Australians, but I suppose that any sort of law is good enough for any one who is not an Australian. Clause 214 also provides that a ship shall be forfeited to His Majesty forHovering within .1 league of the coast and not departing within twelve hours after being ""required to depart by an officer. That provision reminds one of the old stirring times when lawful authority was armed at every point. A vessel is not to hover in a light breeze within 3 miles of the coast for twelve hours after being required to depart, without being compulsorily forfeited to His Majesty. This is rather a startling way of introducing the favourite idea of some people that ships which come from abroad are a curse. They are a great blessing if they .come from abroad empty, to carry onr goods away at double freights, but they are a great curse if they come from abroad full, so that they can charge only single freights for the Australian products which they take away. That view before seems so much in the-minds of those who drafted the Bill that a ship which hovers within a league of the coast for twelve hours, after being required to depart hy an officer, is to be forfeited. Then there are a number of cases in which goods shall be forfeited to His Majesty. All goods in respect to which bulk is unlawfully broken shall be so forfeited. We know that bulk is often unlawfully broken on a voyage, not by the consignees ,or consignors, but by adecigentlemen who suffer considerably from thirst, and have a tendency for getting into the holds of the vessels they are on. That is an unlawful breaking of bulk.which amounts to a criminal offeneo, inasmuch as it is a robbery. But under clause 215, the goods in respect to which bulk is so broken could be forfeited. The clause also provides thatAll goods which being subject to the control of the Customs shall be moved, altered, or interfered witli except by authority and in accordance with this Actshall be forfeited. The removal may not be authorized by the person to whom they belong, but no provision is made for a circumstance of that kind. The clause says that goods so moved shall be forfeited. Then there is another provision which suggests some difficulty. The Minister proposes, ancl very properly, to use the courts of the States for the administration of this measure; but I do not think that we are in a positiou to make use of those courts in this way without some corresponding legislation on the part of the States. The Bill assumes that we can use the State courts as if they were Commonwealth courts, and that we have the same authority to legislate for the bringing of matters before those courts as the State Legislatures have. That is a matter which I think my right honourable friends will have to look into. I doubt if we have any such power.",24
106,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I think we have. It is given to us by the Constitution.,25
107,Mr BARTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is part of the law of the land under the section which the right honourable and learned member quoted as to the operation of the laws of the Commonwealth.,25
108,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The State courts will have to take notice of this measure, just as much as if it were an Imperial Act.",25
109,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is a question whether we have that sort of power over the State courts.,25
110,Mr BARTON,CUSTOMS BIL L," This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, Judges, and people of every State.",25
111,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I understand that our laws are binding upon the States ; but there are certain things which have to be defined by court regulations, and I question whether the State courts will not resent some of the assumptions of authority made by the Bill in regard to these matters. There are several other clauses to which I shall refer in committee. I thoroughly sympathize with the desire of the Customs department to put down frauds. The danger of frauds in a highly protected community, is very great and very notorious. A protective policy requires a sort of code of its own, inasmuch as it breeds immorality and fraud in business communities; ancl I am prepared to make allowance for that state of things. But clause 240 provides that a person charged with fraud shall have a more lenient trial than a person against whom no imputation of fraud has been made. Where an attempt to defraud is an element in a charge, the onus of proof is upon the Crown; or, if an indictable offence is charged, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence; but, in reference to the whole range of innocent offences-innocen t in the sense that there, is no element of fraud in them",25
112,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,They are equally injurious to the revenue.,25
113,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Still , it is an anomaly that - persons not charged with fraud, or with an attempt to defraud, may be liable to penalties which, if they cannot pay them', may bring upon them a year's imprisonment, upon the mere allegation of a Customs officer that tliey have been guilty of offences under certain sections of this Act, unless they can disprove the charges made against them There may be some extraordinary necessity which requires this, but if there is any extraordinary necessity to except the ordinary rules of justice in British communities, one woulcl think it would be levelled more against those who are suspected of fraud than against those who are charged with other offences, which may be more or less innocent, against the provisions of this Bill. It seems to me an anomaly that there should be a presumption of guilt against a man, which immediately becomes a presumption of innocence, if there be an allegation that he has been guilty of fraud. That seems rather an anomalous position, having regard to the effect of the imposition of a penalty up to £200. According to clause 245 a person who is unable to pay a penalty of £200 cannot be discharged until he has served an imprisonment of one year. Here is a case which may involve a year's imprisonment, and yet the man is supposed to be guilty on the mere statement in the charge made against him. That charge is proof of his guilt, and he has to set to work to disprove his own guilt. That seems to me an extraordinary way of legislating. As I say, if there is a sort of person to whom it should be applied it should be the' man who intended to defraud, rather than some one guilty of some other offence. The Bill bristles - with penalties,ancl-though I admit that the nieasure must to a certain-extent do so, itseems-to me be one of the-moststringent Bills that, couldfinch There is another provisionever'the about wliicli, however, I do .not desire to say mucli; because < it seemstobring in that, eternal controversy of which'-we shall have; not be used, and under a simpleTariff the enough later on-. Clause-147 is a'provision which from my - pointofview - isof a perand fectly legitimate character. It is vision-that 10 per cent, shallbeadded to the invoiced value-of goods' as-representing their value at the-port'of discharge: recognises a veiy sound theory-asound - free-trade- - theory-that, clearer as they come acrossthe seas,- and that we have to pay more forthem in our ports than is their value at. the"" port of exportation. We are going to on, if we can,. 20 per cent, or 30 per cent, more, but the moment - we put-- that; 20 per-cent. or>30 per cent, more oii'to the per cent, the former is paid by the foreigner, while the man w-ho imports the goodsis charged the 10 per centright away. importer is not a foreigner, but may - be* Melbourne merchant who imports £10,000 experiment worth of goods. He lives in Victoria, andno' pays his rates and taxes like every other man; but he has to pay 10 per cent, added to the foreign value of the goods on' he has to pay a duty of -20per cent, pointed' and30 per cent. Yet when it becomes 40'-per cent - it is said that the whole of that 40 per cent, is paid by the mysterious foreigner. I only mention this as a little illustration from my right - honourable and-' learned friend's bible of the fact that all some of these, elemental principles - are sound; and are acknowledged to be soundpunishable when it is a matter ofmoney by those who affect tc differ from theni:- Even if my right honourable andlearned friend adminWe isters a-thoroughly protective-Tariff, he under no delusion. When he wants money, he will impose this 10 per cent, straight Minister away. He does not then assume that goodsare cheaper here, because he would never put on the 10 per cent, upon the - English - value - when the goods arrive in Melbourne, if all goods were cheaper here than at the port of shipment. these are little matters whichoccur to one's - mind in going over the Bill, but clauses 257 and 258-. I do not quite under I do-not want to bring them in obtrusively just now. I admit that, whateverthe - verbiage Mr Beid. fiscalpolicy of the Commonwealth may be, this Bill will be.required,- or at any rate a very large proportion of the clauseswill, to be-required - In:fact, most of the clauses weareproper clausesfor a Customs Bill, whatfiscal-policy of the country may be. The only thing is, that under a simple Tariff' : the great bulk of t'ne-clauses'would probably temptations to fraud are not so numerouspressing, and in one sense the adminisa protration - of the department becomes much easier. But in committee I will draw attention to some matters which T think' require That consideration . I am - very-pleased to again very acknowledge the thorough'business-like way goods, get in which thisBill ' is drawn. If will assist us very much in dealing with the Bill in committee, that we have a measure so - excellently drawn, and I hope that in put future proposed legislation of the Commonwealth we shall see similarly good work.",25
114,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," I should like to say ; 10 at the outset that I am one of those who havelooked with'a considerable amount of satisfaction on the attempt made in this This Bill'to shorten the verbiage and to clarify a sections of Acts of Parliament. I hope the will prove successful, ancl I have doubt that with care ancl attention veiy mucb may be'done to improve the phraseology of-'legislative Acts - But care will be which"" wanted, and thediscussion today has out one or two* particulars in which we, as a Chamber, shall have to see that we do not gobeyond whatwe intend to do. For instance,- we findthat "" prescribed"" means '-'prescribed'-by this Act."" But, later, on, we find that: this includes - all after regulations, so that when we see in the various clauses of the Bill that persons are for offences against the Act,' it therefore means they will be punishable equally for offences against the regulations. must be very careful to see that we do will be not, to too great an extent afc all events,- put it in the power, of .the j to createcriminal offences. But the scheme of the Bill' is, I would' like to say,, admirable. It is a most praiseworthy attempt, to improve 1 the mode of drafting measures. I shall attempt'to address myself only very shortly All to two or three important matters, the most imporfcant of'which is undoubtedly Part 17, : stand what it is the Minisfcer desires. The. of these clauses-if the Minister - will forgive me for saying so-is not up to the standard-in point of clearness of the other clauses. Is it intended-and . I endeavoured to indicate the questionat the close of the Minister's second-reading speech-that the duties are to be.collected-after the passing, of this Bill under the State laws relating to Customs ? I think that the Minister might give an answer to that question.",26
115,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,And ' after the Tariff proposals.,27
116,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Anc l after the proposal of the Commonwealth Tariff ?,27
117,Mr REI D,CUSTOMS BIL L,And after the' speech.,27
118,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,We shall collect the highest .duties-.: Mr Reid. - There will be no duty on Australian products i u the new Tariff.,27
119,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I should like the Minister to give me.this information, because, if. his answer, which I think .1 caught, .is that it will be the highest duty that will be-collected-if he means that it would be the highest duty under' either the State Tariffs or the Commonwealth Tariffthen I venture-to say a great error is being made.",27
120,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,-It is not a uniform Tariff ?,27
121,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,-It is not Tariff. We shall not be collecting under a uniform Tariff; it will be an interim Tariff.,27
122,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Then I venture to say the importance of the clause is even greater than I thought it was- - I have-not any real doubt in my mind that-'if this clause is passed it will impose a uniform Tariff:,27
123,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It cannot j itdoes the reverse.,27
124,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then this Parliament has not power to - pass it . This Parliament' has no power to pass any Taiiff-which is not-, uniform, and tbemoment it passesa uniform!Tariff, then under section 90 of the Constitu;tion, all the State Tariffs die.' The words used in the Bil l areIf any Tariff.or Tariff alteration shall hereafter be proposed to the House of Representatives by a Minister of State for the Commonwealth, and the House of Representatives shall, in connection with such proposal, adopt a resolution authorizing the Minister to take any necessary steps-for the protection of the revenue. What is to happen t The Bill goes on to say that ditties may thereuponbe collected asproposed. The clause goeson to say something else, but I - stopthere 'for a moment because thesewords^ must have legal effect. The Minister means;- at all events, that there is to be legislative warrant and sanction for carrying into effect the resolution-of the House of Representatives. When the House of Repre^ sentatives--says that the Government may collect the dutiesas proposed in the 1 schedule brought down, we are*asked to-'say, as a Parliament, thatthatshall be legalized, and - that it shallhave the foree oflaw-. Can any onetell me, that if an - Act of Parliament so provides, that that 8 as-a matter of law is not imposing duties ? If there be the authority - of - au Act of Budget Parliament to take money from a subject, is.' .that not imposing duties or taxation of some sort-it depends what, ib is-and in. this case-it is customs duties! The whole object, as I understand, is that-we may say to a court of law where the action of the department may be challenged- "" We have legal warrant for doing this."" This question is not a new one. Asfar back a? the ship money case, when the king tried to collect money under the name of ""ship money,"" it was held he hacl no right to impose-those duties. The words are used over and over again in the oldbooks and in the ancient cases,- and there is nodistinction bet-ween imposing duties ancl-collecting tbem a uniform by force oflaw. If , tlierefore, it is thought that we can steer any middle course-between relying on this House's resolution and converting that resolution, into law, I ""say we are trying to do what is impossible. The doubt that I had as to - whether the Minister meant to keep alive the State laws arose from the words whichfollow the word' "" proposed "" in clause257, to which I have referred. These words areDuties may thereupon be collected as proposed at an increased rate or on any goods previously'free.. Mr KINGSTON;-At an increased rate, as proposed ?",27
125,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes ; at an increased rate. These words cannot under a first Tariff apply to any Commonwealth Tariff. They seem to me to have beneath them-the underlying supposition that there existed some State laws at the time of the proposed collection which would justify the restof the duties being collected, and therefore that it was believed the State laws would exist notwithstanding the passing of this Bill. I feel, after the best consideration I have been, able to give to the matter, that this is an error. I believe that it was never the^intention of the Constitution that there should exist at one and the same time two customs laws, but that it was intended that the Commonwealth should make up its mind what the duties of customs should be. Until the Commonwealth has made up its mind what the uniform customs duties shall be, it is not to impose any; but the moment uniform duties of customs are imposed, then all State laws relating to this matter are to cease to have effect. If the Bill stands as it is, it will have a twofold effect. First of all, under section 90 of the Constitution Act, the State laws will die, and, therefore, the only duties we can collect will be collected under this Bill. But, secondly, under this Bill power will only be given, as far as the words are concerned, to collect a limited amount of duty, viz., ""duties on goods afc an increased rate ""-whatever that means-or , "" duties upon goods previously free."" So that there will be some margin left, or intended to be left untouched by this clause, an'd yet that margin will have no operation in consequence of the destruction of the State laws by virtue of the Constitution - Now, unless it can be shown that the legislative authority to collect duties is different from the legislative authority which provides for the imposition of duties, that must be the result. I hardly thought that the position would be contested. I have here the Library edition of Broom's Constitutional Law, and under the report of the well-known case of Bates in regard to ship-moneyHampden's case-w e find very learned notes by the author, andfchewords used from time to time are distinct about the collection and imposition of taxes. It is pointed out that whatever language is used by the King, whether it be James I . or Charles I . , or any other King who tries to collect moneys from his subjects, whether he does it under the guise of loans or benevolences of ship-money or any other nomenclature, the courts liave saidfchafcfchatis an imposition of taxation which is not warranted unless sanctioned by law. When it is sanctioned by law it is then the taxation of the subject with liis own consent. I find on page 371 of this work the learned note by Mr Hargrave, the editor of State Trials, who saysJames I . claimed the right of imposing duties",27
126,Mr BAETOJT,CUSTOMS BIL L,AVha t part of the book that?,28
127,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is on page 371 of the first edition. The second edition is not the Library, bufc it is the same as far as I have seen. Mr Hargrave writesJames I . claimed the righfc of imposingduties on imported and exported merchandise by prerogative. His son and immediate successor, the unfortunate Charles, not only persisted in the claim, but added fco it the equally formidable pretension of ship-money. Realized, these claims, with loans, benevolences, monopolies, &c, would have comprised nearly a complete system of extraparliamentary taxation; for imposition at the ports was calculated to serve the purpose externally, ship-money to operate internally. I cite that merely to"" show that the language is exactly the same. In these old works the expressions, "" imposed taxes"" and "" imposition of taxes,"" are constantly used, and from these old works they passed into the American Constitution and into American decisions, and they have also passed into our Constitution. Then we find, on page 406Of the prerogatives respectively asserted by James I . and his son to impose and to levy shipmoney, each was in turn successfully resisted and annulled. There the word ""impose"" is used in the constitutional sense, and wherever Kings tried to get money out of their subjects it was called the ""imposition of taxation."" In their case, not having the warrant of Parliament, it was an illegal imposition. Here, under the authority of Parliament, it will be a legal imposition. Then again the word "" collection"" is well known, and on pages 39S, 399, and 401 there are considerable notes about the compulsory collection of benevolences and loans. It is ' there stated thatThe compulsory collecting of money hy the Crown, whether as a loan or a benevolence, was thus explicitly declared to be illegal. In fact, there is no distinction between the compulsory collection of money from the subject and the imposition of a tax. In the well-known case of Stevenson and the Queen, which was decided in the Victorian courts, and which is reported in 2 Wyafc, Webb, and a'Beckett, in 1865, Stevenson and Co. and a number of other firms sued the Crown to get back money that had been collected under a resolution of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. As the session had expired without the Act being passed, they recovered the money on the ground that the Legislative Assembly had not the power to is impose taxation; but if an Act of Parliament had come in, and said- "" It shall be lawful to collect these moneys,"" there would in have been legislative authority behind the matter, and the court would then have decided the other way. In the other case to which reference has been made-and it is the one, I think, which ray honourable friend had in his mind-the case ex parte Wallace and Co., which is reported in 13 New South Wales Law .Reports, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, in 1891, passed the ordinary resolution. The money was collected, the firm refused to pay, the Collector of Customs refused to sign the entry and pass the goods, and the firm applied to the court for a mandamus to compel the Collector to pass the entry. The court said- "" This is the constitutional practice of Parliament. You apply to us for a writ of mandamus, and as the issue of that writ is in our discretion we refuse to issue it . "" But if it had been a question of legal right, there is not the slightest doubt that the Supreme Court of New South Wales would have decided precisely as did the Supreme Court of Victoria, and would have held that there was no legal power, simply because Pai-lianient did not give its sanction to'the collection of the moneys. But I should like honourable members to look at the wording of this clause and see what is going to happen. Power is given here to collect these dutiesAt any increased rate or on any goods previously free, but so that any excess collected above amount imposed by Parliament during the session shall be refunded. Let us suppose the Parliament passes to an Act, and the amounts imposed under it are lower than the amounts colwhether lected under the State laws, ai-e those amounts to be refunded ? The Minister Trade and Customs will say "" n o "" yet the imposition of the rates under new Commonwealth Act does not appear be retrospective. Therefore, the collection will take place under this Act, will rest its validity on this Act, and yet it will said that the duty is not imposed. Surely we impose the duty, even if it be only porarily ; and if there should happen to no A ct of Parliament passed, those who have paid duty will get their money back while if there should be an Act of Parliaimperatively ment passed, and if the rate should lower, they would get the difference back. But in the meantime we impose this duty, and compel persons to pay it . Does the Minister say that if anybody refused to this money he could successfully resist? Supposing he were sued in a courfc of [146] whafc would be his answer ? Would it be"" Oh, you had power to collect money, but not fco sue for it . You had power to collect it if you' were able to, but you must not - touch the goods. You may collect money from me, but you must not avail yourself of the other provisions of the Act, and sell those goods or sue me. You can collect the duty, whatever is meant by that."" Surely the Minister would say at once- "" That is not the meaning of the Act ; you owe the money at law. Parliament has imposed that duty upon you, and you must pay it . You are entitled to a refund only in the cases mentioned in the section."" Therefore, beyond all question, as far as I can see, there is an imposition of uniform duties. I want to 1 see the imposition of uniform duties. I wish that clearly understood. I believe .that the people have closed their eyes fco many things in our Constitution, and rightly so, for the purpose of getting Inter-State free-trade at the earliest possible moment. It would be a very serious thing to delay the inauguration of Inter-State free-trade one moment longer than we can possibly avoid, and therefore I should like to see this Bill so framed as to give legal force and effect to the first schedule brought down by the Ministry. But I want to see that done in a way that is beyond all any possibility of dispute or doubt. I do not want - despite my personal attachment to the traditions of my profession-an y doubts arise, because it would be a very serious thing if merchants were in doubt as fco these State laws were in operation or not. It would be a very serious thing if for the merchants were in doubt as to whether ; and the State laws were in existence or the not-it would be a very serious thing if to these duties were to be collected, and if merchants had also to pay under the State for laws. Now, I may say that the clause, be whatever view may be ultimately taken of it, is eminently in need of further consideratemtion. I believe the Minister, desiring to do be what is best in the interests of the countiy, will give it that further consideration. There ; is one additional reason why it seems to me necessary to legalize the resolube tion. Under ordinary circumstances, as we have known them both in the mother countiy and in the various Australian States, existing Tariffs have been in operation, and the pay resolution constitutionally giving powerthough not legally giving power - to law, the authorities to collect the increased duties effected no inconsistent results. But here if we were to rely merely on the resolution of the House of Representatives we should have a very serious - state of things arise. Eor instance, I will just give one example to illustrate what I mean. We will say that goods are brought into Sydney under the Commonwealth Tariff' under thisBill, assuming it to be one which allows a State Tariff also to operate."" The Commonwealth Tariff would impose, say, 20 per cent, duty on these goods, and they would tlierefore pay 20 per cent, on entering the port of Sydney. If the goods were to be brought over to Melbourne, and if the Victorian Tariff so prescribed, they would have to pay 25per cent., making in all 45 per cent. If these same goods were taken to Melbourne first, they would pay 25 .per cent., and they would afterwards go over to New South Wales free ; thus they ""would only pay 25 per cent, duty in all. Consequently, having regard to the varying State Tariffs, we must not hesitate to bring into legal operation at the earliest possible moment the Commonwealth proposal for a uniform Tariff; but in doing that I want to see its complete adoption, so that oiir Tariff shall be absolutely uniform. The trade difficulties and the uncertainties are great enough without having matters complicated by legal difficulties. The leader of the Opposition referred to clause 121 in connection with the matter of ships' stores. I should just like to point out, what I tried to make clear by means of an interjection. Whatever ships' stores may be included, it seems to me at all events clear that the clause relates only to such goods as are taken on board a ship from the particular port in Australia where she may be lying. 1",28
128,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"- It is all right no doubt, if to observe in this measure-. that is so.",30
129,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The clause provides that the prescribed allowance of stores for the use of the passengers and crew and for the service of the ship may be shipped free of duty on board any ship of not less than 50 tons gross registered tonnage entered outwards for parts beyond the seas. ""Parts beyond the seas"" under this Bill would mean paiiis beyond Australia. Mr B.ETD - Surely tliey could take any quantity of ships' stores for parts beyond the seas. The Commonwealth cannot limit the quantity of stores a ship shall take use beyond the 3-mile limit.",30
130,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,But the Commonwealth can say how much of the stores shall be free of duty.,30
131,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Not for a ship bound for a destination 10,000 miles-off. The-Commonwealth has nothing to do with the goods used outside the limit.",30
132,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,But until the ship gets outside the limit she is subject to our jurisdiction.,30
133,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Undoubtedly .,30
134,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Therefore , we must assume the case of a ship Avithin our ports, and therefore within our jurisdiction, quite independent of the 5th covering clause of the Constitution Act. If a ship in port wants, to put stores on board, and if they are bought in the ordinary way from a merchant, duty has to be paid; whereas if the goods are taken out of bond, they may be taken oufc free of duty. What would there be to in terfere with our limiting the amount to be talcen out free of duty ? I do not see any difficulty at all. The next clauses show that that is reasonable. It is provided thab ships' stores sball be used only by the passengers and crew, and for the service of the ship, and that no stores, after being shipped, shall be unshipped, except by permission of the collector. That means, of course, that when a ship has got the stores on board, she is not to take advantage of the permission of the collector, and put them on shore, thus evading the duty. I do not see that, there is any difficulty about that. Then there is another clause, 240, which has been referred to. It relates to the averment of the prosecution being sufficient. This clause is one of the very few clauses, in the Bill that fall away from the high standard of clearness which we have all been glad As far as I can judge, that clause relates to two classes of proceedings, the one civil and the other criminal, because it refers to both prosecutor and plaintiff--althoug h the marginal note is a little misleading. In the case of a civil action, I can quite see the very great advantage of providing-it exists in our Victorian law relating to Customs to a great extent-that the matter complained of, which in nine cases out of ten is. peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, should be dealt with in the way proposed.",30
135,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Is that not so with reference for to anything a man is accused of, such as going into a house for an unlawful purpose ? Is nofcfchafcpeculiarly within his knowledge ?",30
136,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Our law makes a great distinction between civil and criminal proceedings.,31
137,Mr BUID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Is-' not a thing that exposes a man to a year's imprisonment veiy much in the nature of criminal proceedings 1,31
138,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"So far as the word "" p l a in t if f "" is used, no one can be exposed to a year's imprisonment. W it h regard to civil matters, if the authorities have fair reasons for proceeding-and I cannot conceive that they would proceed without reason- I see no great hardship in placing the onus of proof asfco the value of the goods or the payment of' duty oa the defendant. Assuming that the Customs have reasonable grounds for supposing that the duty has not been paid on certain gold watches, how could they exhaust the whole range of gold watches on the Continent in order to prove that certain watches are uncustomed goods? Therefore it is right to put the onus of showing that the duty has been paid upon the defendant, because he knows where he got the watches, and he ought to be ablefcobring proof as to the payment of duty. W it h regard to criminal proceedings I am reluctant to go to anything like that distance, and I tliink the clause goes a little too far on the criminal side. It certainly states that in no case will the intent to defraud the revenue be presumed ; that has to be proved. And in no case of an indictable offence would the prosecution be relieved of the duty of proving the whole guilt of the defendant. Therefore it is not quite as drastic as may appear at first sight : although at the same time. I think the Minister might see his way to make it a little more clear and follow the course he has adopted in the otlier clauses of separating the criminal from the civil jurisdiction. A question was asked by the right honourable member for East Sydney as to what power we had fco impose on a State court the duty of trying offences. I conceive that under section 71 of the Constitution that power exists. Section 71 providesThe judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Eederal Supreme Court, to be called the High Courfc of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction. Under these circumstances it seems to be perfectly competent for this Parliament to invest any State court whatever with power to try.offences and to try causes within the federal jurisdiction. A great many of these clauses are, I cordially agree with other honourable members, rather mattersfor consideration in the committeestage ; but the 257th clause seems to me to loom very large, and to be very much more thana matter of detail, and I cannot help saying that I attach the greatest importance to that clause. I trustthat the Minister, will give it his most careful consideration.",31
139,Sir MALCOLM MCEAGHAEN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"-I desire, like the two previous, speakers, to congratulate the Minister on having; produced a bill so free from verbiage.. I feel that this will leadto-our being able,, as laymen, to read the Bill and understand' it a great deal better than would otherwisebe the case. I bave also to congratulate the Minister on having, chosen Dr Wollaston as Comptroller of Customs. I feel that in him we have a man who has the esteem and regard of the commercial community - a man who is firm and yet courteous on all occasions, and I am quite sure that the Minister has secured in him amosfcadmirable public servant. I should have been better pleased if we had had before us the regulations undei' this Bill. I find that there are 17 clauses in which regulations are referred to, and that under those regulations the Minister will have great powers, which I consider should be introduced into the Bill itself. I would like to ask the Minister whether it is his intention, assuming that a. steamer such as an Orient or P. and O. liner arrives at Fremantle, tocharge duty on the stores that are used between Fremantle, and, say, Sydney 1",31
140,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,31
141,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is what I understood the leader of the Opposition to be desirous of arriving at. I > do not profess to be able to read the legal sections of the Constitution in the same way as do the legal members of the House.,31
142,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The point mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne has been since explained to me, and that only ships' stores taken on board at Inter-State ports will be subject to-duty.",31
143,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is what I understand the Minister to say.,31
144,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Now the Minister is getting away from the point again.,31
145,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I never got away from it. I said that clause 121 referred to stores taken on board, and that the intention is to - charge on stores consumed in Australian - waters.",31
146,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Whether brought abroad or not 1,32
147,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,32
148,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That .makes it clear that steamers coming from any part of the world, and arriving say, Fremantle, and intending to go on .Melbourne or Sydney or anywhere else, so long as it is a port in Australian waters will be charged duty on their stores. - was saying that I did not profess to be to read the legal sections in the Constitution .in the same way as do the honourable and learned members of the House : but I would like to ask the Minister whether he is cership - tain that under section 5 of the Constitution .Act- a covering clause- a steamer whose first port of clearance, or whose port of clearance and final port of discharge, is 'within the Commonwealth, can be charged duty on the stores used in Australian the ^waters ?",32
149,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I am. certainly 'Opinion.,32
150,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That will have to be thrashed out. ' Sir MALCOLM"" MCEACHARN - That Section is a matter to which legal members .House will have to devote their attention. I am not inclined to take the view that the .Minister takes, and I think at any rate that the section is capable of two readings. If master /the Minister is right, then the feeling of the owners of coastal steamers will be that so long as we are put on the same footshall - inj* with other steamers coming recognise that there are such difficulties connection with the duties on this coast that .we shall be quite prepared to accept the sacrifice we shall have to make.",32
151,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"All must pay, or all go free!",32
152,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It may be interesting to the House to know that this proposal will cost the coastal 10S, steamers a sum of something like £21,000 a of ships, thatyear. That is a rough estimate-bu t I think it may be taken as correct within a thousand or two-of the amount by which the Custonis .will benefit. This is the amount that those who have hitherto had their stores free will have to pay; but I would like the Minister to note that a very great portion of that this sum will fall upon the seamen, beday. cause out of this total of £21,000 1 estimate that wines, spirits, and tobacco represent a total of £14,680. Of course this is nothing like the amount from which the Minister will receive as revenue, because there will be in addition the duties paid on the stores issued on steamers arriving from foreign parts. Many of the here clauses which I had noted have been at, already dealt with by previous speakers, to and I tliink with them that most of the clauses are matters for discussion in committee rather than on the second reading. II should like, however, tb draw the attention able of the Minister to clause 192, which saysAny officer of His Majesty's forces or any officer of Customs or police may seize any forfeited ship or goods upon land' or water, or any or goods which he has reasonable cause to believe are forfeited. Any officer may have such reasonable cause, and if he acts upon it no proceedings can be not brought against him. I think, therefore, that some restriction should be placed in clause. It is too stringent as it stands.",32
153,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is very difficult to of that suggest any better wording.,32
154,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is a saving provision in the Victorian Act which I cannot find in the Bill. 195 of the Victorian Customs A ct of the of 1890 provides thatIf it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that such Spirits, opi um, tobacco, snuff, or cigars, were on board without the knowledge or privity of the owner or of such ship or boat, and without any wilful neglect or want of reasonable care on their parts, then and in such case the Commissioner deliver up the said ship or boat to the owner here we or master of the same. in I think that that is a reasonable provision to insert in the Bill, because tliere are many cases where smuggling is carried on by passengers or crew without the knowledge of the owners or master of a vessel. I intended to refer to clauses 121, 122, and 123, but I regai-d the explanation which has been given as sufficient. W it h regard to clause which provides, in regard to the clearing Before any goods are taken on boaid a ship for export-(1 ) The ship shall be entered outwards and the goods shall be entered for export. I should like to say that such a provision would come hard upon steamers proceeding to New Zealand, because it sometimes happens they arrive and have to clear the same They are the only vessels which would be affected to any extent by the clause. The clause might, - however, be amended so as not to hamper the .trade with New Zealand, and I . am sure that such an amendment would meet with the acceptance of the Minister. An y other point which I may wish to speak upon I shall leave until the Bill gets into committee, but I desire again to heartily congratulate the Minister upon the nieasure.",32
155,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Northern Melbourne) I can see that the Bil l will necessarilv, from its substance, raise some difficult constitutional points, which I think we had better face at once, ancl, as soon as we can, allay any fears with regard to its consequences. (Mouse eouiited.) I have looked at clause 257, ancl it does not contain the solution of the constitutional difficulty which the Minister has to face. I believe in a good deal that has been said by the honourable and learned member for Indi. If his view is right-and I think it is-claus e 257 will have to be put into a separate Bill, because it is a law imposing a duty. If it is retained in the Bill, the measure will be utterly invalid, even though it is passed by both Houses. Section 55 of the Constitution says thatThe laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, anrl any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. The Constitution contains several sections which make the imposition of uniform taxation the crucial moment from which certain events are to date, anrl it is to be the beginning of free-trade between the States. I am not, however, dealing with the question of uniform taxation, which my honourable and learned friend has dealt with more elaborately. Clause 257 is a law imposing taxation, because if it means anything, it means that from the time this House passes a resolution in ordinary form, instructing the Minister to collect revenue, there is a tax imposed upon a great number of articles which did not exist before. Therefore, unless the clause is put into a separate Bill, all the othei elaborate, and in the main 1 excellent, provisions in the Bill will become nugatory and futile, ancl cannot be enforced. But if we read section 55 of the Constitution Act further, it will be seen that the provisions of clause 257 must be put into two Bills, one relating to the imposition of customs duties ancl the other relating to the imposition of excise duties, because that section says thatLaws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall deal with subject of taxation only; but laws imposingduties of customs shall deal with duties of customs only,-and laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only. Clause 257 says that from the date of the* passing of the resolution by this House both, excise and custonis duties are to be collected. , which contravenes the provision which I "" have just read. The Bill also' infringesanother section of the Constitution. Under sub-section (2) of section 51, we have n o power in imposing taxation to discriminate between States or parts of States ; but the effect of clause 257 is to make such a discrimi- nation, because the tariff proposed under its . provisions may leave as they stand the duties now existing in some of the States and."" impose higher or lower duties in other States. There is probably no duty on , woollens in New Soutli Wales at the presenttime, whereas in Victoria there is a duty of ' 30 per eent.",33
156,Mr TUDOR,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Victorian duty is 25 per cent.,33
157,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If the Treasurer in his Budget speech proposed a duty of 20 per cent, on woollens, the effect of clause 257 ."" would be that from the date of the passing of a resolution by the House approving of "" the collection of that duty, a duty of 20 p e r cent, woulcl be collected on woollens goinginto New South Wales, while the duty on woollens going into Victoria would be 25 per cent., and the duty on woollens going into Tasmania still heavier, because there is usually a heavier duty in force in Tasmania,, than in any other State.  woollens in Tasmania is only 20 per cent.",33
158,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Assumin g that theBudget speech is delivered on the 1stAugust, the Victorian shopkeeper will behandicapped from that date in his competition with the New South Wales shopkeeper, while, the New South Wales manufacturer will have 5 per cent, less protection than: the Victorian nianufucturer. C f course the Minister may say that clause 257 is not a. law imposing taxation. I have been trying; to bring myself to that belief, but I cannot-, clo so. If we enact that from the 1st Janu-ary next duties shall be imposecl at a certain^ rate, that is a law imposing taxation.",33
159,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CUSTOMS BIL L,Impose d orcollected.,33
160,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Impose d or collected'.. Tliose duties can be collected, and retained 1 one if the permanent Tariif does. aot.alter:them -. If we say that from the l st January, 1902, duties shall tae imposed at a certain rate, that is a law imposing taxation. If we say that duties shall tae collected at a certain rate from the 1st August, 1901, that is a law imposing taxation ; and if we say that duties shall tae collected from the date of the passing of a resolution by this House, that is a law imposing taxation. If we say that - duties shall be collected at a certain rate from the date of a proclamation by the Governor General in Council, it is not the proclamation which imposes the duties, but the Act which gives.power for the collection of duties under that proclamation. Therefore, I cannot seca way out of the position that this is a law-imposing taxation, although the taxation is not to be collected until a date to be fixed by after events. May I here give some instances with regard to the effect of clause 257 ? I have given instances as to woollens, and I should now like to refer to kerosene. There is no duty - on kerosene in Victoria. It is not an article which can tae manufactured or produced in this State, taut kerosene has been treated as the poor man's light, used in all houses in the bush, and so forth, and as an article which ought, therefore, not to be taxed. But there is a tax on kerosene in Tasmania.",33
161,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CUSTOMS BIL L,And in : Soutli Wales.,34
162,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There used to be a tax on kerosene in New South Wales, but it has been taken off, and I believe there is also a tax in South Australia. Now, supposing the Ministry came down witli a proposal in the Budget statement for a 15 per cent, duty on kerosene, either ad valorem or at so much per gallon. Eor the sake of argument, we will say a duty of threepence per gallon is proposed. Erom the time of the resolution a duty of threepence per gallon, which is not collected now, would be collected in Victoria. Assume now that this proposed tax on kerosene is not adopted in the permanent Tariff. What is the result? Under clause 257 the threepence per gallon duty which had been paid would be returned to the Victorian, but it would not be returned to the Tasmanian. That, I say, is a discrimination between Victorians and Tasmanians, and as such is - against the provisions of section 51, sub-section (2 ), of the Constitution Act, which sets forth that any taxation is to avoid discrimination between State and State. . Mr KINGSTON - The honourable and learned meinber contemplates no Tariff being adopted.",34
163,Mr WATSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,If the Tasmanian law be followed the Tasmanians are responsible.,34
164,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am not referring to that but to the Constitution Act, which says that any taxation we impose must make no discrimination between State and State. By this legislation we are imposing a tax, and are saying in effect that the tax shall remain on the Tasmanians but not 'on the Victorians.",34
165,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Werever t to the original conditions.,34
166,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes, but it is not uniform, and there must be no discrimination. If there be taxation in the Commonwealth it must be uniform throughout the States. There cannot be a duty on kerosene in Tasmania during a time when there is no duty on kerosene in.Victoria. I hope I have made the point clear. '",34
167,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Not by virtue of the Commonwealth Tariff.,34
168,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Not by virtue of the Commonwealth Tariff, and, therefore, I think my honourable friend was fully justified in calling attention to the danger of passing this particular clause in this particular Bill. I suggest to the Minister that the clause New should be reconsidered, and if he then still thinks that it is a solution of the nut which the Constitution creates for us he should bring the clause in as a separate Bill, or rather as two separate Billsone for custonis and one for excise. I now want to pass on to one or two other matters dealt within the Bill. The honourable and learned leader of the Opposition, has referred to the particular stringency of what may be called the "" hovering "" clause. Of course that clause 214 looks very stringent, providing as it does that certain ships shall be forfeited to His Majesty, among others-; (1) Any ship used in smuggling, or in the unlawful importation, exportation, or conveyance of any.goods. (2) Any ship found within one league of the coast failing to bring to, for boarding upon, being lawfully required to do so. (3) Any ship hovering within one league of the coast, and not departing within twelve hours after being required to depart by an officer. That looks a very big thing, but the word ""hovering"" has a peculiar technical sense of which we need not, I think be afraid. I take it that this ""hovering"" clause is like the "" move o n "" clause in the regulations.",34
169,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,35
170,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,And that it is for the protection of our coasts.,35
171,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It means ships that are hovering about for the purpose of running goods or smuggling.,35
172,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The ""Hovering l a w "" used to be applied in England and in the United States to any ship between headlands, say between Land's End and the south point of ""Wales. A ship might be outside the 3 miles limit, but still within the headlands. Very strong powers have to be taken by any Government with regard to sliips hovering and hanging about on the coast. This reminds me of one thing, in regard to which I would with all respect make a suggestion. I think it would facilitate the passing of these clauses through committee if the marginal notes showed the sources of the clauses. Most of these clauses are a condensed drafting of old regulations. The clauses are very well drafted, but at the same time, I say that the experience which I have had in this House-and I am sure other honourable members will confirm me-is , that a clause can always be got through more easily if honourable members see that it is not altogether new-that is, if honourable members see that it is based on experience, and is from some other Act. I quite recognise that the Minister is justified in thinking that his clauses are very much better than are any sections in existence; for the last two or three centuries in England. I take that for granted, and I tliink he deserves all the commendation given to liim in this respect. But what I want is that there should be something to show the House that a clause is not completely novel - that it has not originated in the last six months in Melbourne or Adelaide-and that almost-all these provisions are the result mantle. of centuries of experience. With regard to clause 121, dealing with ships' stores, what understand from that, combined witli the relating clauses, is that an ordinary ship of more than 50 tons burden has to pay Australian duties on Australian goods shipped in Australian ports-that a ship, whether it comes from England or Kamschatka, is to pay the Australian duty on goods which are shipped on board in Australia. police Mr WATSON - Does the honourable ancl learned member refer to goods or stores ?",35
173,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Of .course, the exception here is stores. The duties are not on stores as such, but on goods-tli e stores are a more limited portion of that referred to in the bigger term ""goods."" I . have had my understanding of this clause twisted about in the dialogue which has gone on over the table. On the one hand, I thought I understood the clause, until I heard an interjection, and then my understanding of the provision became very different, until I heard another interjection. Of course, clause 121 merely applies to ships' stores, and to ships' stores when the ship is under a certain tonnage, but what I understand-anc l I should like to be corrected if I am wrong-is that if goods are shipped in Australia, those goods should bear the Australian duty with the small exception which is put here. On the other hand, there is another view which may be taken-and I should like to know if this is the Minister's view-that there is to be a duty charged on all goods which are taken between port and port in Australia, and by, say, a P. ancl O. vessel.",35
174,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The idea is to let goods go out of the warehouse f ree, because they are going to be exported beyond the seas. Goods in other cases are to be consumed in Australia, and a certain charge is made in regard to tliem. These charges apply in all cases.",35
175,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Clause 159 provides for drawbacks.,35
176,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes ; I know about the drawbacks. Then clause 121 merely amounts to this, that if a ship, say a P. and O. Ship, takes stores on board in Eremantle, and goes round the coast of Australia, that ship has to pay the Australian duty on those goods.",35
177,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The ship takes the goods on board duty paid if she gets themat Fre,35
178,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Tlia t is if she gets them at Freniantle, and there is no - drawback.",35
179,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The vesselhas to pay on stores which she consumes, but which she did not take on board at Fremantle.",35
180,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Do I understand that a ship has also to pay a duty on stores consumed, which stores she has brought from London, say tea and spirits 1",35
181,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,35
182,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Tba t is a veiy drastic regulation. I can understand Australian stores paying Australian duties, but I do"" not quite understand British stores paying.",36
183,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,But the stores are enterancl even Crimes Acts. ing into Australian consumption.,36
184,Mr WATSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"And a ship may be carrythrough ing Austrahan passengers from Fremantle, assistants, Adelaide, and Melbourne.",36
185,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That may be; and, comes after all, the provision is not, perhaps, stringent than the provisions in America. I remember a little experience of my own America, which I may mention. I was going into New York harbour, and I took an oath that I had nothing dutiable, except £ 3 worth of goods. I need not mention give what the goods were. When I was told I would have to pay a 50 per cent, duty, I said-"" I have got a through ticket to tralia; I am not going to stay in . the United States, and surely I may be allowed to carry this £ 3 worth of goods through America?"" "" No , "" they said ""you must pay seven dollars and a half,"" ancl added, because they were humorists, will be let off the seven and a half dollars if you will pay the expenses of a Customs officer, in a first-class Pullman car, as far San Francisco tq see you on board.""",36
186,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The assumption they were acting upon was that you were going to consume ' the £'3 worth of goods America; in that case they would have first been entering into American home conresolution sumption. .,36
187,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I tried to show the Custonis officer that I had not the least intention of consuming that portion of my goods in America, because it so happened that the goods consisted of Brussels lace. all events lean see that clause 121 will to some discussion, if I understand the honourable member for Melbourne, who knows so much about shipping. There another matter I should like to refer to. find that tliere is no schedule here of Acts or the sections of Acts repealed.",36
188,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not think the word "" repeal"" is quite the proper word to use relation to a State Act. We do not repeal State Acts.",36
189,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am afraid there will be a good deal of trouble ancl friction, even litigation, created if we pass this Bill without knowing exactly local State .Acts are to be affected. I need not tell honourable members that there are a number of local Acts in all the States . which bear directly upon these very debatable subjects, such as Shipping Acts, Passengers and Navigation Acts, Customs Acts, It would be a great convenience if the Minister could go these Acts with his secretary or ancl decide which of these sections he intends to be enforced after this Bill into operation. ' Speaking with a good more deal of experience, I think I may say that there is nothing which creates more litigai n tion, more worry and friction, than the failure of the draftsman to state in the schedule what sections are to remain. However, I have no cloubt that the Minister will us the best in regard to this matter. He knows thoroughly well IIOAV litigation can frequently be avoided by the exercise of a Auslittle care in detail in that respect.",36
190,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L," The various constitutional questions involved in this Bill seem to have been very lucidly ancl elaborately discussed by the three honourable they ancl learned gentlemen who have pre"" Y o u ceded me, ancl I do not know that it is absolutely necessary to further labour any of the points that have been so as well bandied. But at the same time. I would, like to avail myself of this opportunity of directing the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bill to two questions involved in in the consideration of clause 257. The question is as to the legalization of the of the House of Representatives, and the second is as to the beginning of absolute free-trade between the States. Now, it has Occurred to me that these questions are perfectly distinct, and I think it woulcl tend to clearness if the Minister will state At what is his intention in regard to that lead clause. We desire to know whether his intention is merely to give legal effect to a resolution of the House of Representatives is so that duties may be legally collected I between the time of bringing down the Tariff the resolutions and the passing of the A ct 1 I can understand that, as one intention. Is that his sole intention ? In suggesting this in question for consideration it occurred to me that there was another and more important question than that to be considered. More important than the legalization of the resoluand tion of the House of Representatives is the question as to the precise moment of time what when, there shall be absolute freedom of trade between the various States. Under <i section 92 of the Constitution it is provided that on the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free. That is one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution charter, and what merchants want to know is the time when trade will become absolutely free. We want that moment fixed legally beyond all doubt. I believe there are very few in this House or in this country who are not of that opinion. The opinion is that a certain period of time should be fixed when there shall be absolute freedom of trade, and they want that period to depend, not upon a mere departmental order, but upon a sound, legal, and unchallengeable basis. I ask the Mmister to consider whether freedom of trade ought not to begin from the moment when the resolution embodying the new Tariff is brought into this House ? Can any one deny that that ought to be done. Ancl for this reason-that from that moment, according to the constitutional practice in all British countries, the duties are collected ance with the terms of the resolution. The Tariff then becomes a uniform one, we will say, by convention. Supposing that the duties were collected according to the terms of the resolution and were not challenged, we should have a uniform Tariff by convention, although not legally; but what we want is something more than the acceptance of a uniform Tariff by convention or acquiesence. We want it established on a legal, basis. It is asked that from the moment when the Minister proposes his resolution in Committee.of Ways and Means, the revenue shall be protected. I apprehend that the Minister does not bring clown this proposal merely for the purpose of validating the resolution, but for a more important object, namely, the establishment of Inter-State free-trade. If he does mean that, then he ought to take steps to give legal effect to what are his intentions. Let us examine this clause and see whether that is intended. It is said that when the Tariff alteration is proposed to the Housewhen the Minister proposes the adoption of a resolution authorizing the taking of steps for the, protection of the revenue-dutie s may thereupon be collected as projrosed. If the clause ended there everything would be absolutely clear. So far as the intended legislation is concerned, everything would be perfectly clear, because it ! would be embodied in an Act of Parliament that the officers of Customs should next morning proceed to collect duties in accordance with the terms of the resolution sanctioning such collection submitted to this House on the previous evening. That would be quite suiiicient. When once this clause in that form finds its way into an Act of Parliament, that would be sufficient not only to validate the collection of duties as an interim proposal, but also to mark an event which is referred to in section 92 of the Constitution-namely , the establishment of Inter-State free-trade.",36
191,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Supposin g that the Tariff Bill were defeated ?,37
192,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"We must not contemplate anything of the kind. When once the House goes into Committee of Ways ancl Means to deal with the Tariff, it must proceed until the battle is fought out. Even if certain disturbances and difficulties occur, this could be regarded as the interim Tariff, which was to remain in legal operation until it was superseded by an Act in in accord- the ordinary form.",37
193,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Would that clause, as the honourable member proposes it, make the Tariff an interim one 1",37
194,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"What we want is an interim Tariff; a provisional Tariff, so as to mark what we are all aiming at-namelv , the establishment of Inter-State free-trade.",37
195,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CUSTOMS BIL L,To legally collect the money.,37
196,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Not only to collect the nioney, but to mark an event which is mentioned bisection 92 of the Constitutionnamely, that on the imposition of a uniform Tariff the trade between the States is to become absolutely free. That interim Tariff can remain in operation until it is succeeded by the full Tariff; which will be carried successfully by one Ministry or another. I tliink there ought to be no doubt about this. Is it the intention of the Minister, in submitting this clause, not merely to legalize the resolution of the House of Representatives, but to mark the event to which 1I have already referred-namely , the establishment of In ter-State free-trade 1 If he aims at thus marking the beginning of Australian free-trade, then it is of supreme importance that the matter should be placed beyond all doubt. It seems to nie that there is a great deal of force in the contention of the honourable ancl learned member for Indi, that a Tariff collected on the .authority of a.resohition sanctioned by law would be the imposition of a uniform Tariff within the meaning of section 92 of the Constitution. It may be that in the drafting of this clause certain phrases have been used which will have results which were not contemplated. I join in suggesting that the Minister should very carefully consider the arguments which he has heard, and take such steps as may be neoessary-eithe r in this clause in this Bill or in another Bill, as has been suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, if he thinks that there are constitutional difficuties, thus avoiding any doubtful course. is any constitutional doubt involved it will be better to deal with the matter in a separate Bill. Whatever is done should be done clearly, and I hope that the Minister will endeavour to give effect to the proposition that trade and intercourse between the various States should be absolutely free fivjm the moment that the first Tariff' resolution has been adopted by this House.",37
197,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Ero m the moment that we pass a protecting resolution ?,38
198,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,Fro m the moment the House adopts a protecting resolution.,38
199,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CUSTOMS BIL L,Would Senate have to pass it t,38
200,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,This validating clause would pass the Senate .and give legal sanction to the resolution. That is how it acquires the force of law.,38
201,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is not here.,38
202,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Would the honourable and learned member's idea be that the resolution is to hold good for all time-that is, until - another Act was passed ?",38
203,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,It wouldhold good until superseded by the Act which is to follow.,38
204,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But there may never be an Act, and we shall, therefore, be governed by a resolution.",38
205,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Until the Act is passed, certainly.",38
206,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am afraid that some people may object to that form of Tariff legislation. It is a veiy convenient way of doing it , no - doubt.",38
207,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I would like to kuow what the right honourable member, who professes to be so very anxious for the establishment of free-trade, would do.",38
208,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"We do not want to talk about professing to be anxious, because Inter-State free-trade is bound to come under the Constitution. We are not anxious because we have given it to you in advance.",38
209,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,I should like the right honourable member to assist us in preparing a scheme which - will give us Inter-State free-trade at the earliest possible moment.,38
210,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,I am heartily with the honourable and learned member in that.,38
211,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The right honourable member seems to be labouring under some doubt in regard to this matter. He If there seems to think that the passing of a validating resolution will occupy too long a time. But the House will have to sit, wh^n once it enters upon the consideration of the Tariff, until its' labours are completed. It is of no use contemplating prorogation before the Tariff becomes law. We must sit on until the matter has been fought out. We want to secure Inter-State free-trade from the earliest possible moment, and that moment is when the resolution is brought down formulating the Tariff proposals. Protectionists, as well as free-traders, are desirous that Inter-State free-trade should be estabthe lished as early as possible.",38
212,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The honourable and learned member is sane to the'extent of .50 per cent, at any rate.",38
213,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am sine we may rely on a very favourable consideration of proposed the points which have been raised at the hands of the Minister in charge of this Bill. The only other important clause to which the leader of the Opposition has invited attention-and we are under an obligation to him for initiating this discussion-is clause 121 which has reference to ships' stores. 1 confess that, in the second-reading speecli of the Minister for Trade and Custonis, I did not exactly follow the meaning which he intended to convey by this clause. I am not quite sure that the clause in its present shape does .attempt to give effect to what the honourable member has in mind.",38
214,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,He does not say that it does. He announced intentions in that relation that went far beyond that particular clause.,38
215,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"This clause is a very simple one, for it says that the prescribed allowance of stores may be shipped free of duty on board any ship of not less than 50 tons gross registered tonnage entered outward for parts beyond the seas. That clause would certainly not apply to a ship leaving Melbourne for Sydney, nor could it apply to a ship leaving Fremantle for Melbourne, or to any vessel leaving one State port for another State port. 'It would only apply to a ship leaving Melbourne for New Zealand or Eiji, or for some other part of the outside world, and it could not apply therefore to a ship trading from port to port within the Commonwealth. The clause has a very limited effect, and it does not purport to deal witli sliips arriving at Fremantle from London in the way that it was put by the honourable and learned member for East Sydney. At the same time, as I read this clause, a P. and G. steamer arriving at Fremantle from London immediately it came within the tliree-mile territorial limit would, in just the same way as an Inter-State boat, be within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Immediately upon arrival in a Commonwealth port, the vessel would become liable to two sets of laws-the State laws as far as tliey would be applicable, and the federal laws ;as far as they would be in operation within the three-mile limit of the Commonwealth. Consequently these P. and O. boabs, or any other foreign boat, would, within the territorial waters, be liable to the revenue laws, and would mot be allowed to consume goods brought from foreign parts without paying duty. I know of nothing in this Bill that would allow them to do so. On the other hand, tliey would have to seal up their .goods under the supervision of the Customs officer, who would take care that all the stores imported from abroad were placed under lock and key. For the purposes of the Act, the imported stores would become bonded stores. A P. and O. boat would not be able to bring stores within the waters of the Commonwealbh, and allow passengers and the crew to consume them, without paying duty on such goods as were dutiable.",38
216,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Sh e can now ' State laws.,39
217,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am not sure about that. Immediately a boat came within State waters she would be liable to State revenue laws, just in the same way as an ordinary local ship would be, and she could not consume dutiable goods without paying now. the duty payable within the State limits. Then she would be abl to buy local stores, or to ship stores free of duty if they were' intended bo be usod beyond the seas. But it seems to me that as regards goods, wares, and merchandise consumed on board a foreign ship within territorial waters, duties will have to be paid. Supposing a foreign ship started on a voyage for parts beyond the seas outside Australia, then she - would be able, under clause 121, to take .any stores free of duty so long as they were to be consumed on board on the high seas beyond territorial waters. So far as section 5 of the Constibubion is concerned, I do not think that it throws very much light on the question. Clause 5 is only intended to give extra territorial effecb bo the laws of the Commonwealth with regard bo British ships trading between various - ports of the 'Commonwealth - on 'One continuous voyage.' It is true that - even if Australian ships go a thousand miles beyond the Commonwealbh, the laws of the Commonwealth will still be-enforced regarding them, so long as the voyage begins and ends within the Commonwealth. Section 5 will not applyto a P. and 0..or an Orient liner coining from London. They - will only be liable to the laws of 'the Commonwealbh so long as they are actually within the threemile limit, and while they are beyond the three-mile limit, and therefore on the high seas, they again become liable only to the laws of the country from which they come.",39
218,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,-They can remove the seals placed on their stores then.,39
219,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes , immediately they get beyond the three-mile limit they can remove the seals placed on their sbores, and begin to consume such stores without the payment of any duty.",39
220,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CUSTOMS BIL L,What about the ships that do not touch at Albany 1,39
221,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If they do not call at the ports of the Commonweal bii they will nob be liable bo the laws of the Comlnonwealbli, because ib is only when they call ab the Commonwealth ports that they come within our jurisdiction. under the Mr RETD --As the honourable member for Melbourne said, if there is any validity in this attempt to levy duty upon their stores, these ocean steamers will buy all their stores in London, and bhen they cannot be touched. An Honorable MEMBEB - They do that",39
222,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I quite agree with the view that a P. and O. liner coming to Australia is only subject to Australian laws whilst she is within the"" territorial limit, and that immediately she goes to sea again and is on the high seas, she can open the stores that she brought from London. I do not think this clause will affect those ships in the slightest degree. There are other clauses in the Bill which are of minor importance, and 1 need not refer to them as they will doubtless be well threshed out. 1I have therefore confined myself to the two clauses to which 1I have refened, and which I consider of the greatest importance.",39
223,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L," I do not intend to detain the committee more than a few minutes, and I shall therefore direct my remarks to the two clauses which have been specially discussed. I have the misfortune to differ to a"" large extent in my interpretation of these clauses from some of the honourable gentlemen who have already spoken. The attack made upon clause 257 may or may not be justified, and it is with the greatest diffipays dence-in view of the undoubted skill and knowledge of the gentlemen who have attacked it-that I venture to think that the attitude they have taken is an incorrect oue. it seems to me that there is no imposition of duties by clause 257, because that clause says that on the House of Representatives adopting the resolution, the Minister may take any necessary steps for the protection of the revenue, and that revenue duties may thereupon be collected as proposed, at any increased rate, or on any goods previously free, but so that any excess collected above"" any amount imposed by Parliament during the session shall be refunded. To my mind, the concluding words of the clause offer ground for what seems to me a very strong argument against the interpretation placed upon the clause during the debate. Though 1 admit that the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Indi are strong, yet fchey do not conclude the question, as the honourable meinber himself will doubtless be prepared to grant. And I admit frankly that my arguments do not establish the question one way or the other. Mr Rum - As to an amount that was not in excess of the previous rate, and would not be refunded, would the honourable member say that that duty had not been imposed ?",40
224,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I will put it in t h i : way. A duty-puttin g it in ordinary English-is the payment by a subject to the Crown for the carrying on of the management of the country, and in its essence it means that the subject pays something that he does not get back again.",40
225,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is exactly what he will do under this clause.,40
226,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"out y is something which the subject pays and does not get back again, and which he has no claim to get back again. Now, in these cases, these sums that are collected- I do not know that the word "" duties "" is a fortunate word to useare paid tentatively by the importer in order that he may be allowedI am referring chieflj to Customs, as the 7 Excise question is of minor importance in any case-to bring in his goods. If at the end of the session Parliament has not passed a law imposing these duties the nioney will be returned, but it seems to me that the person when he the money only pays it as a sort of - security for being allowed to bring goods in- a security that when the law is passed-and in that respect it will be a retrospective law - - duty will be paid on all goods he has imported. This would have the same effect as if the importers entered into a bargain that duty would be paid on all goods imported from the moment of the passing of the resolution by the House of Representatives up to the time of the imposition of the uniform duties by a law passed in both Houses, and 1 retrospective in its operation.",40
227,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Makin g a certain payment, for an uncertain return.",40
228,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It seems to me that the clause really means that. It is-simply a. convenient way of securingthatthelaw, which will be retrospective in its operation by dating back to the passing of a resolution by the House of Representatives, will be obeyed in its retrospective as well as its prospective effect. I do not think the fact of some duties not being returned affects the question. It means that the contract is carried out pending the imposition of uniform duties - no t under the authority of the resolution, not under the action of the Minister in protecting the revenue, but undei the opera1 tion of the Act. It is by the authority of this nieasure that the duties will be retained after a uniform Tariff has been imposed. If Parliament passed a law enacting that no Chinaman should enter the Commonwealth without depositing the sum of £ 1 0 0 with the Collector of Customs, unless within the same session, or by the end of the session, following his arrival it enacted that the nioney should be returned to him, would that be the imposition of a duty ? I do not think that it woulcl. It seems to me that the duties coUected under resolution will be in exactly the same position. in the instance which I have given, although the deposit of £ 1 0 0 by the Chinaman might be a condition precedent to his entering the Commonwealth, it would not be a duty, so the moneys collected under the authority of a resolution passed in pursuance of the provisions of this clause would not be a duty, although to their payment would be attached the condition precedent that when Parliament had passed a uniform Tariff, they woulcl, if the duties in the Tariff were the same as the duties charged under the resolution, be appropriated to the revenue of the Commonwealth. Whether that view be right or wrong, it is certainly a tenable one.",40
229,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If duties are not uniform, have we, under the Constitution, power to impose them ?",41
230,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If a charge is not a duty at all, it does not matter whether'it is uniform or not. In my reading of the clause, the duties levied under the resolution would not be duties within the meaning of the Constitution.",41
231,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,They are called duties.,41
232,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"^-'ihat is perfectly true, but I do not think they are duties within the meaning of the Constitution Act, ancl will not become duties until the uniform Tariff is actually passed. That, it seems to me, must have been the view taken by the Cabinet, because, so far as I can see, it is only upon that ground that the clause is tenable. Therefore, I am fortified in my opinion by the views of the notable lawyers who are members of the Cabinet.",41
233,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But on the honourable learned member's own showing, would not the measure, being retrospective effect, make these charges become duties 1",41
234,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not think so. The money is to be held by the Customs department, pending the imposition of a uniform Tariff. When a uniform Tariff is imposed it is to be retrospective in its effects, but the charges become duties only on the passing of the Tariff. At the same time, it is questionable whether it is wise - to pass the clause as it stands in the Bill. It is perfectly clear that there is great difference of opinion as to its meaning. If the clause means what the honourable and learned members for Indi, Northern Melbourne, and Bendigo consider it to mean, it will be a most unfortunate thing to retain it in the Just as Bill. Therefore, if tliere is a course as to the constitutionality of which both laymen ancl lawyers can agree, that is the course which we should follow. We are on the horns of this dilemma : either we must accept the construction of the clause which I have just given, and take the risk of the Cabinet being wrong, and the honourable ancl learned member for Indi and the other honourable ancl learned members who have taken the same view being right, or we must adopt a course which some of the members of. the Opposition appear to be unwilling to adopt. We must either take the course proposed in this clause, or we must allow the proposals of the Governinent to be the Tariff until Parliament has determined what the Tariff shall be. It is of no use to say, "" We will not have the Bill as it stands, and we will not take the other course."" Those are the only courses open to us to take.",41
235,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is a third course. Mr M.cCAY - There is a third course. The Tariff proposals might be brought down to this House and debated here for months, so that every one would know exactly what duties were to be imposed long before they were collected.",41
236,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is not the third course to which I refer.,41
237,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,To what course does the right honourable and learned member refer 1,41
238,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,To the course that is taken now in some of the States.,41
239,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The right honourable and learned member suggests that the proposed duties should be collected without statutory authority 1 and Mr Reid - Yes . If that were done the courts would not interfere. in its Mr MCCAY - I do not think it is possible to adopt that course, seeing that we have a written constitution.",41
240,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"B y the time any legal proceedings could be terminated, the whole difficulty could be got over.",41
241,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not think that the recognition of the constitutional aspect which was taken in the Sydney case which has been referred, to woulcl be likely to be talcen by a court possessing federal jurisdiction, in these matters. Of course-we should have the protectionafforded by the fact that, until federal courts are established-, there will be no tribunal' to which the importer could go for' his remedy. We have a sort of brute force strength of position-, but I . do not tliink that that is anadvantage which we should, like to use. Mr A . MCEEAN - If there areno federal courts, how will the Government enforce these duties ?",41
242,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"B y preventing, people from taking goods out of the warehouses until the duties have been paid; though it is of' no use to consider tliose possibilities now. Our object should be to determine the course which will appear to us to be undoubtedlysafe. The safety of the course proposed in the Bill is disputed, though, when all is said and done, df we want to be quite sure, we must trust the Ministry to piay fair. We should not expect them to bring down a uniform Tariff, ancl then immediately induce the Governor General to prorogue Parliament. If they did that they might last until the next session, but they would then disappear as quickly as some other Ministries have done. Mi . REID - It is not a case of that sort 1 that we are thinking of. Tliere might be a prolonged difficulty of another kind between two competent authorities.",42
243,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Then we must let the uniform Tariff be collected in the meanwhile.,42
244,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If that is done, the Ministry will win whatever happens^ because their Tariif is working all the time.",42
245,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The Tariff dispute between the Houses must come to an end some time or another, ancl ultimately Parliament will determine what the Tariff is to be. When the Tariif is imposed, I trust that we shall have no-more Tariff debates for many years to come.",42
246,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Then the honourable and learned member anticipates that it will be settled in accordance with his own wishes.,42
247,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"We must' anticipate a reasonable course of events, and it seems to me that the two courses which I have, mentioned are the only practicable ones. If we are not going to declare, in the Bill, as I think we can, that the Tariff ' proposed by the Government shall be the Tariff until Parhament enacts another-whicl i will be done immediately af terwards-w e shall have to take the risks of the course which is proposed in the Bill, and which has been cpiestioned by the honourable and learned member for Indi; and by others. Wliether the interim Tariff be approved-by this or that side of the House, or whether, as is quite possible, it meets witha great deal of disapproval on bothsides, of the House, if that course is pursued we shall not only esGape the constitutional difficulty, but shall at once obtain the benefits of Inter-State free-trade.",42
248,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,The resolution might be made to limit the collection of. duties to the current session of Parliament.,42
249,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"We are not tied to the present verbiage of the clause. AVhat we have to do is to determine wliieh of two distinct methods of procedure we shall follow. Once we have decided upon the method of procedure, we can easily adapt the clause to it .",42
250,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If the session ended before a uniform Tariff had been passed, would the old State duties revive ?",42
251,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,The State duties could not revive.,42
252,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If the collection of these duties is an imposition of. duties the State duties could not revive. I do not feel that there is much force in the point that has been raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne as to the course proposed by this clause being the imposition of duties which are not uniform. I doubt in any case whether a continuance of State duties could be held to be the hnposition of duties by the Commonwealth. However, the question stands or falls with the main issue whether the proposed collections-under the clause are-duties, and in any case whether we ought to allow the clause to stand as it is. I suggest to the Minister and to the leader of the Opposition that it is urgently desirable that we should pass a clause as to whose constitutional effect there will be no serious difference of opinion. If , with the adoption of a clause in that form, we can secure immediately Inter-State free-trade, we shall earn the gratitude of the people of the Commonwealth. for so promptly enabling them to get what tliey regard as the chief benefit of the union. The only otlier clause to which I desire to refer is clause 121, or rather I wish to refer to the discussion which has raged around it. The clause excepts certain goods from the payment of duty, and the discussion was as to the imposition of duties upon goods coming into Australian waters, but not actually landed upon our shores. \ That is a matter of policy well worth considering, and I am of opinion that such duties should be charged, but the Government takes power to charge, them under the general clauses of theBiH andnot underclause 121, which merely exempts certain people taking goods out of bonded warehouses from having to pay the duties-on them when they take them out. I doubt the wisdom of the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that a schedule of the State Acts repealed by this measure should be embodied in it . We can repeal no State laws, except such as the Constitution gives us power to repeal, and a schedule of repealed Acts would bemerely an expression of our opinion that the Acts therein mentioned were repealed"" byfchepassing of the measure. It would be merely an expression of opinion, and would not bind any court, any body, or party to a suit. It would be merely an expression of opinion likely enough to be wrong in some respects. It would be necessary to look into all the Acts and study them carefully in order to seewhat Acts and sections - of Acts were really repealed; and the information supplied would be more likely to be a misleading than a safe guide. It is better to leave the repeal to the operation of the Constitution, and not endeavour to put in the Bill, what, after all,, would be only an index and a guide post, and not operative as a law in the ordinary sense.",42
253,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It has been done in the Defence Bill. Mr M a CAY - It is quite true that has been done in the Defence Bill, but I do not think that, therefore, the course is a right one. We have been putting placards in our Bills-sometime s in a clause and sometimes in a schedule. I disapprove of the practice of putting placards in laws passed by this Parliament taking from the Constitution or from implications of the Constitution. It is much safer to leave the Constitution as far as possible to operate according to its own words, instead of endeavouring to interpret those words in our laws, seeing that our interpretation cannot affect the fact, whatever it may be, of what the Constitution really means.",43
254,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L," If I understand the honourable and learned member for Bendigo aright- I had not the pleasure of hearing the speeches of other lionorable and learned members who preceded him-h e stated that if clause 257 ended at the word ""proposed "" it would be a sufficient clause, which would enable the Ministry to collect duties without any necessity to refund subsequently, if the Tariff Bill were not carried into law. But I put this question to the honourable and learned member-wha t would happen if: the Tariff Bill did not become law? I was under-the impression from his speech that the adoption of the resolution would impose a Tariff, and that consequently Inter-State free-trade would begin with that imposition. The difficulty I see in connection with the matter, presuming the Tariff Bill is not carried, is the condition of affairs after its rejection. I do not know whether we could collect the old duties as existing in the various States. I suppose not.",43
255,Mr HAEPEB,CUSTOMS BIL L,-Not if it be held to be au imposition under thestatute.,43
256,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not think we could collect the old duties. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo said we should not contemplate that the Tariff Bill might be defeated. But we ought to contemplate that which is - within the range of possibility, and I ask whether, if the Bill were thrown out, we should be without customs duties altogether ? If any customs duties were collected after the Bill was thrown out, the Ministry afc any rate would have sacrificed the Inter-State duties, and' would never get back the revenue lost by those duties not being enforced. If I understand the honourable and learned member corthis rectly, I do not think his proposal would at all meet the circumstances. Then there is another proposal that the passing of a resolution, as I understand, by both Houses ",43
257,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then , that a proposal passed through this House alone shall impose a Tariff?  becomes an Act.",43
258,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Ye s ; by virtue of this Bill if it become an Act, the passing of a resolution by one House shall make the Tariff law.",43
259,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"-That is the proposal in this clause, but we say it is not workable.",43
260,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is a proposal here, to which I will allude directly, for-the refunding of any overplus paid-that difference between the - Tariff adopted and the duties imposed by the resolution. But can it be considered that a resolution of one House will legally impose duties in accordance with the Constitution 1 ",43
261,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That view may possibly be correct. As I understand the argument, it means that when both Houses pass this Bill, then the resolution of a single House can impose a Tariff ?  resolution in advance of passing it .",44
262,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That may be possible, I admit. But I want to know if there is any anticipation that both Houses of this Parliament are likely to agree to a proposal that the Ministry shall come down with any Tariff it likes, and that that shall be the Tariff until another Tariff takes its place.",44
263,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That idea has much to recommend it to this side of the House.,44
264,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"To that side of the House, no doubt it has.",44
265,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"And to this House, as against the other House, perhaps.",44
266,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I can quite understand that a Ministry might under these conditions impose the most protective Tariff that. any member of the House could hope for- a Tariff that might exist for a given time, say twelve montlis, before it was either accepted or rejected. By that time such interests would have grown up, and such industries would have been affected in one direction or another  the time of the Tariff.",44
267,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Then what happens at the end of that time ? I quite admit there are a great many serious difficulties, and I am only trying to probe the suggestions that have been made. Supjiosing tliere is a limitation of time. ",44
268,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Supposin g the B i ll is not passed at the end of the session, what happens ?",44
269,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,We cannot suppose that; we must sit on until the B i ll is passed.,44
270,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"What is the meaning of the limitation "" to the end of the session"" ?",44
271,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Unti l we pass the Tariff.,44
272,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Suppos e the Tariff is notrejected before the end of the session. is the Is the limitation that if the B i ll is not passed ultimately at the end of the session it ceases to be law ? If so, what happens when it ceases to become law ?  end of the session.",44
273,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But supposing, owing to political circumstances  not suppose those.",44
274,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,We can easily suppose political circumstances. Suppose nothing eventuates by the end of the session-sup pose tliere is sucli a stonewall in one House or the other that business cannot proceed,44
275,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is, supposing Parliament does not do its duty.",44
276,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Parliamen t may postpone doing its duty, as Parliaments do every day. We have even postponed doing our duty since we have been in this Parliament.",44
277,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,What is the honourable member's alternative 1,44
278,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am now dealing with the proposal from the point of view of the Government side of the House. There are other alternatives and difficulties, I admit, in connection with most of them. I am not dealing in a hostile spirit with the suggestions made; and I would be happy to adopt them, unless they gave undue power to the Ministry, if I saw clearly that they would get us out of the difficulty. But I do not think they would get us out of the difficulty. There is this difference between a mere interim Tariff, such as is collected in some of the States, and the course now proposed : that under the interim Tariff, if duties were charged in excess of the Tariff subsequently adopted, there would be a refund, and business would not be disturbed, because we should come back to the conditions that would exist under the new Tariff, without any intermediate conditions which might seriously disturb commerce, business, and manufacture, if it were regarded as permanent, and no refunds were made of any duties found to be excessive, obstructive, or destructive.",44
279,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I did not quite grasp the honourable member's suggestion.,44
280,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The Minister has not got my suggestion yet. I am sure that if the Ministry will apply to the Opposition for help under the circumstances, we wil l put our heads together, and try to relieve them of their difficulty.",44
281,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Her e is our show us something better.,45
282,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is another.peculiar point in this clause. It apparently contemplates-so the leader of the Opposisition points out to me-a n enormous and very general Tariff. The clause only provides thatDuties may thereupon be collected as proposed at any increased rate or on any goods previously free. That is the proposal, and the clause certainly is not imposing a Tariff. It does not say that duties are collectable where a lesser duty, is fixed than exists in any one of the States. The clause is evidently not imposing a Tariif, but is imposing only part of a Tariff--that is, where duties are increased. Perhaps the Ministry have let out a secret on this occasion, and we have to recognise that there are to be no decreases, but only increases of duties, and also duties imposed on goods not now dutiable.",45
283,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Tak e hope.,45
284,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I cannot accept that its meaning ; but otherwise the clause .an imposition of a Tariff, but simply an imposition of inereases.",45
285,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If we impose part of a Tariff, can that be said to be the imposition of a Tariff.",45
286,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I will not enter into a getlegal argument with the honourable and learned member for Nortliern Melbourne.,45
287,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is not a legal argument.,45
288,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I cannot put my where. opinion against the honourable and learned member's in a legal matter.,45
289,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,The honourable member far more delicate in his arguments than is any legal member here.,45
290,Mr MAHON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne asks whether a part is equal to the whole.,45
291,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I say that while this clause may impose part of a Tariff, it rently does not impose the whole Tariff. does not impose more than increases duties. Mr I.SAACS - The honourable member will see that the clause assumes that the rest lian steamer. will be collected under the State Tariffs.",45
292,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I do not think would be so.,45
293,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not think it would, but the clause assumes that.",45
294,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That maybe, but it is, I think, a wrong assumption. [147] proposal; other matters in the Bill, but I will not go into them at present. I agree with the lionorable and learned member for Corinella . that clause 121 does not at all deal with the question of duties on stores used on the coast of Australia.",45
295,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does the Minister agree with that?,45
296,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,45
297,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"If the Minister can collect duty on stores used by steamers running between the ports of Australia, then he must collect it not under this clause but under the provisions of the' Act. I see some difficulty in the proposal of the Minister to collect duties on foreign-going vessels whilst they are off the Australian coast, unless they are going to be allowed to break the seals immediately they get outside of the three miles limit. In fact, nothing can prevent them from doing so. But even to prevent these vessels from using their stores when they are within the three miles limit it would lie necessary to have an officer on as board. Otherwise who is to decide whether is not they are within or without the limit?",45
298,Mr WATSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Minister does not take the three miles limit.,45
299,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"He takes all he can get, and is prepared to take a lot more than he will",45
300,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Thes e stores are free until they come within the three miles limit. They are brought from England or else,45
301,Mr WATSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,But the Minister regards as ships' stores anything used between Ereis mantle and any other Australian port.,45
302,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I question his power to do*so under the Constitution. But I am heartily at one with the proposal that all steamers trading off the shores of the Commonwealth-that is going from port to port and . carrying passengers or goodsappashould be put on the same footing. Either It they should pay duty on their stores or they of sbould not, and anything that it is not possible to do with a British steamer, should not be attempted with regard to an Austra",45
303,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The over-sea sliips comthat pete for the Australian trade.,45
304,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But an over-sea ship does not get its stuff out of an Australian bond ; it gets it in London, 'or some otlier place.",45
305,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It brings it here in comThere are petition with pur ships.,45
306,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,No ; it is never landed. The duty is payable only when the goods are - landed.,46
307,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I wish also to endorse the remarks which have been made regarding the great liability which there iswhen a Bill is being framed largely by Custom-house officers--of endeavouring to obtain and to maintain powers which are too drastic and severe. In the past it has been veiy necessary to have extreme powers in Customs Acts. That - necessity is decreasing every day, because we now have means for checking smuggling, which did not exist formerly. AVe have telephones, telegraphs, and so on, and we have our officers at all ports. There are not, in many ways, the inducements to smuggling that previously existed.",46
308,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Anc l the ships are big as a rule to run the risk.,46
309,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Tlierefore , the powers' which are now necessary need not be so severe as they were under the old conditions.",46
310,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,They have been reduced a good deal.,46
311,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I give the Minister credit for that. J. must add to the compliments which have been paid him, for the way in which the Bill has been drawn. It contains exceedingly clear ancl condensed provisions. I am sure that the Minister has tried to look at the matter not merely from the view of the Custom-house officials, but also from the view of the general public. I compliment him upon having taken steps to get the opinions .of those who have constant connection with the o Customhouse, but who are not Custom-house officials. Still there are some provisions which I think are dangerous and severe. One of these has reference to the penalties which may be imposed. In clause 220 tliere are various offences set out. Some of those offences have no relation whatever to the value of the goods in connection' with which"" they may occur. For instance the clause says thatNo person shall make in any declaration or document produced to any officer any statement which is untrue in any particular, or produce or deliver to any officer any declaration or document containing any such statement. That has no relationship whatever to the value of the goods. It might occur in connection with goods which are worth £ 1 , or in connection with goods which are worth £50,000. Yet the penalty is stated at the foot of the clause to be £ 1 0 0 .",46
312,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,-It might be £ 5 .,46
313,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It would be perfectly right if the penalty might be £ 5 , but undei* some circumstances it could not possibly be £ 5 , it could not be £100, but would : have to be a much higher amount. That is. not a desirable power to give. In fact the Bill enforces immense penalties where there may be no need for them. In proof of that I woulcl refer the Minister to clause 229.",46
314,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That refers to the minimum penalty.,46
315,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Clause 229 says The minimum penalty for any offence against tin's Act shall be one-twentieth of the prescribed maximum. If we refer to clause 226 we shall get the maximum. That clause readstoo If any penalty hereby provided shall be lessthan three times the value of any goods in respect of which the offence has been committed, themaximum penalty shall be thrice the value of thegoods. I quite admit that it is high]}' desirable to have such a maximum, ancl if there is any offence, that is, an admitted evasion of the Customs,, that there should be power to impose a very high maximum penalty, but theminimum can only be one-twentieth bf themaximum penalty. What does that mean 1 An entry may be passed for goods which are worth, say £10,000- a not infrequent occurrence",46
316,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is always the power of the Executive, though.",46
317,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But if we put thesepenalties into an Act we never know whether they will be imposed or not. If we aregoing to leave it to the Executive we can omit a great portion of this. Bill, or indeed: of any other Bill. We know that errors, will occur. They are bound to occur in theenormous number of transactions which mercantile houses have in connection with the Customs department. They will occur sometimes without the least guilty intention. I quite agree that it is desirable to provide some punishment even for error,, but if the department is satisfied that any breach of the Act has been committed in error, surely that fact should be considered! in relation to the penalty to be imposed. Why, we constantly find even Ministers coming down to the House with errors in their Bills. They tell honourable members that these errors are oversights of thedraftsman. Surely there is quite as good reason for a mercantile firm to say that a breach of the Ac t has been I committed through the; error of a clerk.",46
318,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Just think of penalty that we have to face, if necessary.",47
319,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The Ministry are sarily never penalized ; why, in spite of all errors, I am complimenting them. will just put the illustration that I was about to put a few minutes, ago. Let suppose that the goods for which the entry is passed are worth i'10,000. Now the offence has no relation to the value of goods at all. Many of the .offences under clause 220 cannot be fixed hy any statemerce, ment of the value of the goods. AVe might have a maximum referring to the value of the goods, but the exact penalty cannot fixed by that value.",47
320,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,But that is the maxiConstitution mum.,47
321,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am not objecting the maximum, but to the minimum. I these goods are worth £10,000, the maximum penalty .would be £30,000. I am not even objecting to that high maximum, but I am merely pointing out that minimum is one-twentieth of the prescribed maximum, so that a penalty of £1,500 woulcl be imposed for an offence for which, apparently, £ 1 0 0 is considered by the Minister to be about the average maximum penalty. That is the position. AVe should not allow anything of that sort.",47
322,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"On the other hand, £ 1 might be a very small penalty for a £30,000 job.",47
323,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am allowing the As Minister the maximum ; but I am objecting to the Bill providing that not less than minimum penalty shall be inflicted. The word ""shall"" must mean ""shall.""",47
324,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It was struck out.,47
325,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It was struck out on because it was said that it does mean shall. I'n a case such as I have just cited the minimum penalty to be imposed would £1,500. There are great powers given this Bill for the framing of regulations. These regulations are of the utmost importmay ance, ancl I think that the Minister should endeavour to let us have them with the Bill. It is not under Bills that the powers of Customs authorities are often exercised, but it is under regulations such as are templated under the present measure, and while; of course, we need effective regulasixth tions-anc l I woulcl never, in any case, it. favour such as would promote fraud, because think it is one of the greatest injustices to' the community that opportunities should the be given for fraud-stil l the regulations might so hamper trade, ancl be so unnecesinjurious, that it would be well to their have a copy of them before us while we But I are considering the Bill.",47
326,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L," It seems to us me that in connection with clause 257 the whole difficulty turns on the interpretation of section 92 of the Constituthe tion Act. That section states that on the. imposition of uniform duties, trade, comor intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free, and what Ministers have been trying to do has been to find be out really what the true meaning of the word "" imposition "" is in that section of the Act. They do not seem to be able to determine that point even to among themselves, and I am bound to say f that even outside of the Ministry, and among the honourable members in what I may call the constitutional corner, there also seems to be a somewhat similar the difficulty. However, I think that a lot of the difficulty we meet with in this House will be readily solved by the Senate, because it does not appear to nie that the Senate would for one moment allow a clause to be passed that woulcl give this House power to decide at what moment the Tariff should be adopted. If the Senate does 0 0 pass clause 257 in its present form, it is veiy clear that by a mere resolution of this House, certain duties woulcl be collectable. has been pointed out, it is stated that any excess collected above any amount imposed the by Parliament during the session, whether at an increased rate or in the form of duty on goods previously free, shall be refunded. Does that really mean'that the highest rate any particular article in any one of the States is to be the rate adopted, ancl that there shall be no such tiling as a reduction be in the Commonwealth Tariff on any of the in duties imposed by any particular State? Does it mean that the Minister for Customs go through the whole of the Acts of the various States, and look up the highest duties that are chargeable on any good*, ancl the adopt those rates, saying that he will not go below tliose, but that he may increase them, conl t is possible that in five States a certain article may be admitted free, whilst in the State there may be a duty levied on Yet in clause 257 there is nothing to prevent the duty being levied according to the highest 'Turiff, even though a lower Tariff were adopted by the Commonwealth in the end. A good deal has been said about this clause, but as I believe that the Senate will probably deal with it very fully we need not trouble ourselves very much about it here. If the clause were permitted to pass in its present form, it would amount to an arrogation to this House of power that does not belong to us under the Constitution, and, therefore, I i'eel sure that the Senate will not allow it to pass as it now appears. A good deal has been said as to the manner in which the Bil l has been drafted, and with a great part of that I agree. At all events, of the three Bills that have been before us, with the exception of, perhaps, the Audit Bill, which I did not go into, this seems to be the only one that has been at all carefully drawn up, and whilst I do not approve of some of the provisions, I am desirous of .giving full credit for the way in which the Bill has been 2^ut before us.",47
327,Mr HOME COOK,CUSTOMS BIL L,They are improving.,48
328,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes , very probably they have learned something from the remarks which the honourable member himself has made. It is very clear that some of the provisions of the Bill are much too drastic. There are the provisions in clause 220, to which the honourable member for North Sydney called attention. He pointed out that tliere is a penalty of £ 1 0 0 prescribed for making a false entry, and there is also a heavy penalty for attempting to evade the payment of any duty. The article upon which duty would be payable might be worth only £ 5 , or a lady might smuggle in some article.which was worth only £ 1 . I presume that in such a case it woulcl not be fair to inflict the full penalty that is provided"" for here.",48
329,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The fine would be £ 1 0 for that. Mr CONROY"" - I do not see any provision for anything of the kind. It seems to me that perhaps even the wife of one of our legislators might bring in an article worth 15s. or £ 1 , or even less, and yet we have made a person committing such a trivial offence subject. to a penalty of £100.",48
330,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Is the honourable learned member a justice of the peace ?,48
331,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"No , I am not.",48
332,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,If the honourable member were he might have an opportunity of saying whether the fine should be £ 1 0 0 or not.,48
333,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It seems to me that the penalty is fixed, and that there is no means of reducing it .",48
334,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes , there is. It is provided in clause 229 that the minimum penalty for . any offence shall be one-twentieth of the prescribed maximum.",48
335,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I understand that the Minister holds that the provision in clause 229 would meet a case such as I have described, but I should like to know if this matter has been thoroughly considered, - because I do not think the clause would do so.",48
336,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Has the honourable and learned member thought what would be the penalty for infringing clause 122 by taking refreshment upon some ship in the Bay 1 M i : CONROY - That would come under clause 224, by which it is provided that for offences for which no other penalty is provided the penalty shall be not more than £10.",48
337,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That would be paying rather clearly for a whisky ! Mr CONROY"" - So that we can fairly say that there is a minimum penalty in that case of £ 1 only, which would make the drink fairly dear. In clauses 239 and 240 it is provided that in every Customs prosecution, except for an indictable offence, the defendant shall be compellable to give evidence, ancl if called as a witness for the prosecution shall be liable to cross-examination as a witness adverse to the prosecution.",48
338,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,So he woulcl be adverse to the prosecution.,48
339,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Stil l I do not see why the authorities should compel a defendant to come in and give evidence for them.,48
340,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,We want him to tell the truth.,48
341,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,There are plenty of cases in which a man would not wish to give evidence.,48
342,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is exactly the reason why we should have the power to compel him.,48
343,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I hope that the day for that kind of thing has gone by, and that we shall not try to force a man into the box and and make him commit perjury. It may be right to compel him to give up whatever he has, and make him pay whatever penalty he has incurred through his wrong-doing, but we should not force a man to commit perjury. Under clause 240 it is provided that the averment - of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information shall be deemed to be proved-n o matter what the defendant may say-in the absence of proof fco the contrary. So that while in the one case the statement of a Customs officer is fco be regarded as legal proof, the defendant may be compelled fco go to England or elsewhere before he can find any answer that will bo acceptable. He would be placed in such a position that his evidence would not lie legal evidence, and could not be recorded, and under these circumstances what would a man's statement be worth ? He would be met by proof on the one side, and he might not be able to bring anything to controvert what was stated against him, without, perhaps, sending a commission to England. He would be able to make a statement, but that would not be regarded as proof.",48
344,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,He is competent to give evidence.,49
345,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes , he is competent to give evidence for the Government.",49
346,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The clause simply states that the averment of the prosecution shall lie deemed to be proof in the absence of proof to the contrary, and I would ask the Minister if he seriously means that. he really seriously mean that an)' statement of the prosecutor whatever shall be deemed to be proved; that because something is handed over to a clerk, who draws up a declaration in any form he pleases, every word is to be accepted as true 'i",49
347,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,This does not apply to indictable offences.,49
348,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is quite true that when the offence is an indictable one it is not included in this clause, but in the hundred and one matters that come up before the Customs officers it is veiy clear that a power of this kind is far too drastic to give. It is a power that would be more in keeping with the old times under the old mercantile system, when it was thought very wrong for men to trade at all. We cannot be said to be living in those days now, liecause there are men sitting ou the benches in the House who glory in the fact that they are engaged in trade, and who rejoice at the prospect of a uniform Tariff being brought - into operation, because it will remove the restrictions between the States. Under section 121 i mightpoint out what the effect will be in connection with ships if the Commonwealth collects duties on stores consumed by ships which trade between the various ports of the Commonwealth, and yet go outside territorial waters. The effect might be very serious indeed, because if the provisions of the clause can be applied to ocean-going steamers- I am not quite sure that they can-fch e result will be that all the ports afc "" the far end of this continent such as Perth ancl Albany will not be called at at all, because the extra cost of the goods to be consumed on these boats might be so great that they would pass those ports, and come straight on fco Sydney. As far as Queensland is concerned, it might be that the ocean-going steam-ships trading from eastern ports and now touching at Cairns, and having their head-quarters in Sydney or Melbourne, woulcl not touch at the northern ports at all. I think that under this section a very much greater power is being given to Ministers for the time being than they ought to have, and as it is believed that this is a matter of regulation, and that the powers of Ministers could be enforced under regulation, they might be exercised in such a drastic manner as to seriously affect the smaller ports. It is very Does clear that the influence woulcl be in the larger ports, ancl they would not mind stamping out the people in the smaller ports, but that is not the intention or the spirit with - which this Act ought to have been framed. We are here to frame legislation for the whole of Australia, and if a proposal is likely to injuriously affect any small corner of the continent it ought not to be adopted. I hope that the Government will take into consideration the drastic nature of the two clauses to which I have referred, ancl see if fcheir provisions cannot be modified ",49
349,Mr HARPER,CUSTOMS BIL L," I am sorry that, owing to niy absence in the early part of this sitting I lost the opportunity of hearing the remarks which have been made about clause 257. Before dealing with that clause, however, I think it due to the Government and to the Minister in charge of the Bill, to say that in my opinion the measure is admirably drawn, and seems to cover the ground which such a Bill as this should cover with clearness and conciseness. If it is passed, it will be a great improvement upon many of the Customs Acts with which I am acquainted, though, of course, it contains provisions which we shall have to alter in committee. The honourable member for North Sydney made a point in regard to the clause which provides for the infliction of penalties. The Minister, in trying to make the penalties imposed by the Bill consistent and automatic in operation-a able thing to do-has no doubt overlooked the fact that in every case the penalty should be proportioned to the offence. There are hosts of small infractions of the Customs law which, though unintentional, the autliorities cannot pass by, and it would be well for the Minister, before we come to dealing with the penalty clause, to consider that class of offences, with a view to providing lesser penalties for minor inaccuracies and mistakes, which will inevitably ""occur and which are not intentional, though the result of carelessness, ancl, it may be, of culpable carelessness. The Bill as a whole is one which the House will be able to adopt. I have given clause 257 eon-' siderable attention. I have for some time past foreseen great difficulty in the position in which we are placed by the Constitution Act in providing for a uniform Tariff, ancl I referred to the matter when I spoke on the Address in Reply to the Governor General's opening speech. The first difficulty which has to be met is that which - has had to be met by the State Parliaments in the past, in fixing a new Tariff, or imposing additional duties-the of protecting the revenue by collecting the duties from the moment of their announcement by the Government. In the States the revenue has generally been protected by a resolution of the Lower House, but the collection of duties under such a resolution has been admittedly illegal, or at any rate, has gone pretty far in the direction of illegality, and the method is a cumbrous one. The procedure provided for in the Billand I believe it is the adoption of a suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo-to some extent meets the case, but only to a veiy small degree. If the clause in the Bill is carried, the Government will be authorized, upon the passing of a resolution by this House, to protect the revenue by collecting proposed duties immediately tliey announce Tariff. That procedure will prevent any Mr Harper. merchant or importer from attempting to get the best of the Government before the Tariff is adopted by Parliament. Such attempts in any-case could succeed only if the discussion upon the proposed Tariff were a very long one, and they could not succeed at ali under the provisions in the clause to which I refer.",49
350,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The debate upon the Tariff is likely to be a long one. very desir- Mr HARPER - In that case, the provisions to which I refer may be desirable. Having thought the matter over, I see in all directions difficulties connected with this clause. Prom what I have heard of the suggestions made by some of the' legal members of the House, I am inclined to think that if those suggestions were adopted, we should find ourselves in a sea of unknown difficulties. It seems to me clear that we are shut up to one of two courses; of which one is a course which I think is almost tod much to hope forthat the Tariff should be determined upon almost immediately, to enable the new order of things to begin, and to give time for the formulation of a permanent ancl stable Tariff. If it were possible to adopt that course, all the difficulties which otherwise appear likely to ensue would be avoided, ancl trade woulcl be free from the hindrances in which it will be involved if any other course is adopted. I fear from what I have heard and what I know, that it is too much to expect that that course will be adopted, and I have come to the conclusion that the only other course to adopt is difficulty the old method of protecting the revenue by a resolution of this House, passed in accordance with the provisions of this clause, eleven independently of the clause. It will then be absolutely necessary, in my opinion, to continue to collect the State Tariff's in all cases where the State duties are in excess of those proposed to be imposed by the Federal Tariff. In all cases where articles are subject to higher duties under the State Tariffs than it is proposed to impose upon them by the Federal Tariff, we must collect the State duties in addition to the federal duties, until the uniform Tariff is settled upon. I do not see that the announcement of a proposed Federal Tariff can be held to be the imposition of the uniform Tariff provided for under section 90 of the Constitution Act. It is inconceivable that we should their consider the Tariff actually imposed before it has been finally ratified and the rates fixed by Act of Parliament. Theredeposit fore, we cannot have Inter-State freeTariff trade until the Federal Tariff has been finally determined upon, because of other sections of the Constitution which must taken into consideration. There is, for instance, the provision with regard to goods imported into any of the States ""prior to the imposition of the uniform Tariff, which are subject to varying duties :in the different States. By a clause in the Bill these goods are to be prevented from entering another State without paying the federal duty. That is to say, if an .article is admitted duty free into New South Wales, and a duty of 2d. a pound is imposed upon it by the Federal Tariff, i i pound must be paid upon it if it is removed from New Soutb Wales to Victoria. How will that provision be affected by the serious one. clause which I am considering? If we , Mr HARPER enact that the announcement of the posed Tariff by the Government is to taken fco be the imposition of a uniform Tariff, these goods cannot be removed from one State to another unless they pay the additional duties provided for in the Federal Tariff. But if, on the other hand, the nouncement of the proposed federal duties is not to be taken to be the imposition the uniform Tariff, are these goods have been imported prior.to the declaration of the Tariff, and which are presumably movable in the interval before the Tariff finally settled, to be subject to the Tariff? I suppose they will though I do not know that that is provided for in the clause as it stands. It will necessary to see that the duties on these think. goods are collected and retained until such ""time as the Tariff is settled.",50
351,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Then the two years will date from the time when the Tariff is agreed to by both Houses ?,51
352,Mr HARPER,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is how I read the Constitution. I am taking into account the contingency of its being considered that imposition'of the Tariff must date from time of its declaration by the Government jtnd the passing of a resolution by this House. Ifc seems to me that a vast number of complications will arise, and as the way out of them-howeve r laborious and difficult it may be-w e are bound to collect the the Federal Tariff from the moment i declared, and to continue to collect the State duties in all cases where they exceed the federal duties, retaining the money until such time as the Federal is finally settled. Therefore, Inter-State trade'cannot be free until the Federal Tariff is finally ratified by A ct of Parliabe ment. We cannot attempt to have Inter-State free-trade immediately the Tariff is declared, because goods will be removed . from one State to another, and it will be uncertain what duties should be levied upon them. Under such a state of things, the business complications would be appalling. If we introduce Inter-State free-trade upon the declaration of the Tariff, the difficulties created will be enormous, and I believe will have a very detrimental effect upon the trade of the States during the time that the Tariff a duty of 2d. is under consideration.",51
353,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The question whether we should make the Act retrospective is a veiy - I do not know how profar we can do that. Honourable members, be in dealing with this question, should remember that upon their actions depend to a large extent the business arrangements of the States for a very considerableperiod. If - the debate on the Tariff be unduly prolonged, anbusiness will be paralyzed. It will be impossible to ship goods from Sydney to of Melbourne unless the federal duties which are paid ' upon fchem, although they may have come into Sydney duty free. Then if that federal duty as proposed should is not be adopted finally by the House the Federal money would have to be refunded. Who have to be, would get that nioney ?",51
354,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"B y the A u d it Ac t it be would go into the consolidated revenue, I",51
355,Mr HARPER,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Woulc l it be the man who shipped the goods or the man who received the goods? If we follow out the ramifications of the effect of these clauses it seems to me that we shall find that business between the States woulcl be almost at a stand-still until the Tariff was finally settled the by the adoption of an A ct of Parliament. I the tliinkfchatall the attempts which have been alluded to by some of our legal friends to get over the"" difficulty by enacting that the Tariff, immediately it is declared, is to be only the practical imposition of the Federal - Tariff, are impracticable. I agree with honourable member for North t is Sydney that we must look to the contingency ""that the Tariff Bill might not be adopted, ancl if the declaration of .the on Tariff by the Government is to be held to be under the Federal Act, the imposition of the Tariif upon - which the right of every State to legislate for itself on - Tariff matters is to cease, we are brought - to the position that should the Tariff Bill fail we shall be without a Tariff altogether. I think we must face the difficulty in this way: we must collect the federal duties, and we must allow the various States' duties also to be collected on deposit-tlia t is, in all cases in which the duties exceed those sought to be imposed by the Federal Government. We cannot have intercolonial Inter-State free-trade until the Bill is finally passed and adopted. I tliink that by the time we come to deal with the clauses in committee, it is possible that the Government may see their way out of this labyrinth. So far as I am individually concerned, I have been puzzled as to the exact meaning of the word "" imposition of a Tariff"" from the very inception of the Bill. Although ,1I have given very great attention to the matter, I do not see my way through the difficulties without very grave trouble indeed ; but I believe the simplest way, short of doing what I believe to 'be the impossible, . would be to get both sides of the House and the Senate to agree to - pass a Bill forthwith, which might be held to be an interim Bill. If that could be done it would be the simplest way out of the difficulty, but I regard it as impracticable. The only other way is to face the difficulties of the position, and collect both the Federal Tariff and the States' Tariffs in all cases where the latter exceed the Federal Tariff, and to postpone Inter-State free-trade until such time as a Tariff Bill has been finally adopted by Parliament.  that we have had any more important question before this House than the one that has been discussed this afternoon. It is a discussion to which I am sure we all looked, to learn what views those who have been appointed to represent the electors of Australia held, on this very important question as to when the Tariff should be considered to be imposed. I think some of the honourable members who have addressed the House more recently in the discussion would have been helped considerably if they had heard the speeches delivered early in the afternoon, when some of the legal difficulties of the case were put very clearly, especially by the honourable and learned not agree ? member for Indi. There would have been a. greater hesitation in the expressions of opinion in some directions if honourable members had 1 heard also the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne on the subject. That leads me to the point, first of all, that if there be opportunities under this clause,, as now proposed, to assail the Bill, as honourable members have shown it may be assailed, I think we shall be led to consider whether we should not take a course which willprevent any law which we may pass as now proposed being assailed, thus tending to great confusion in all commercial relations. There was a suggestion made which the honourable member for North Sydney, to some extent, dealt with in his address in the latter part of this afternoon. When I refer to him, I am sure he will quite understand that no one who listened to him, at any rate on this side of the House, considered' that he was attacking in any hostile spirit a proposal made from this side. I do not know whether the honourable member has yet given the Minister the benefit of his suggestion of a way out of the difficulty, but I think we might appeal to that honourable member, and to all honourable members, wherever they may sit, and point out that this is a question on which we ought to sink all party feeling, and to endeavour to bringour best judgments to bear on the settlement of the difficulty. One solution which was suggested was that the resolution which would be validated by the provision under discussion would, when brought in , itself specify that the Tariff would extend to the end of the existing session of Parliament. What would be the position 1 That would at once put all the Tariff laws of the various States out of existence, and we should have only the customs law upon the resolution validated by the Bill we are now considering. It would place Parliament in the position that it would either have to sit until it had passed another. Tariff, or to put itself in the position of having no custonis law at all, and, therefore, no custom's taxation to be collected. Although it may be a difficult position, and although it is a solution which we should not, perhaps, choose if there were any otlier, still, I think it would 'place Parliament in the position of being compelled to deal with the Tariff before it finally closed its labours of this session.",51
356,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Suppos e the Houses do,52
357,Mr CONKOV,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Suppos e the other House did not agree with us?  either House of this Parliament would go on sitting continuously, or, to take the other alternative, would disband and leave us without the means of collecting any customs taxation.",53
358,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Parliamen t could not disband. Mr.PIESSE - Well , whatever might happen, the Minister has put the question. What is the other horn of the dilemma on which he places himself ? Although this may not be the best solution, unless there is another one offered it seems to me the only practicable solution of the position in which we find ourselves. At any rate, whatever may be said as to the proposal to table a resolution and collect the duties, and afterwards return those duties, I should like to point out that that is a very bad course if we can possibly avoid it. It means putting the profits to a very considerable extent into the traders' pocketsthe profits on the duties paid by the consumers during the period of collection. I would rather face the question, and let those duties be absolute duties until the time comes when Parliament ultimately agrees to the Tariff that is to be the permanent Tariff. The honourable and learned member for Indi has given us very strong reasons for taking this point into consideration, namely, that the collection of the duties as proposed would be equivalent to the imposition of duties. If that be so, it then becomes a question whether under the Constitution we can impose a Tariff which is in a sense only a part of what will be collected, and which will, to some extent, be differential.",53
359,Mr HARPER,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That would be an imposition by one House, and would it be legal ?  ber's pardon. The clause we are considering validates beforehand, and in anticipation of the passing of a resolution. It gives the sanction of Parliament to a resolution which may be afterwards carried, in the same way as other Acts of Parliament validate in anticipation a proclamation which is made to bring the Act into effect. I was just on the point of dealing with the differential aspect of this subject. I think the very words which are used in the clause might give rise to an argument that this was a differential rate. The words are, "" and any increased rate or on goods previously free."" Those words take into contemplation an existing rate, and to some extent legalize the continuance of that rate. The w hole r Tariff will have to be dealt with as a Tariff, and the duties which will be brought in under the resolution will be part of the Tariff. By implication, we are referring to another portion of the Tariff, namely, the existing rates, which are not increased, and I think it might be said we are thereby bringing ourselves into conflict with the provision of the Constitution which says there shall be no difference made in taxation as between State and State. Whether such can be said or not, I think it is such a serious matter that we would do well to see whether we can solve the question. I think the least objectionable mode of solving it would be to agree to a Tariff tentatively, but a permanent Tariff so long as it lasted, and a Tariff which should last only until*the end of the session, Parliament of course dealing with the question effectively before it ceased its' labours.",53
360,Mr KINGSTO N,CUSTOMS BIL L,"South Australia Minister for Trade and Customs), in reply. - I am sure the Government have every reason to be pleased with the reception with which the Bill has met at the hands of honourable members. For my own part, I desire to acknowledge most gratefully the veiy kind remarks which were made as to the mode of its preparation. It is our desire to make the Bill a credit to the Legislature, and we have already welcomed assistance from various quarters. Now we come to the chief source of wise legislation, Parliament, and we are much indebted to the keen criticism to which this measure has been subjected. I would like to take the opportunity of saying that when 1 was mentioning those who had had much concern in the preparation of this nieasure, I forgot to mention the name of the draftsman, who chiefly gave the benefit of his services to the Collector of Customs, .namely, Mr. Cassell, the assistant Parliamentary draftsman of the Commonwealth. That there are difficulties in connection with some of these clauses it would be idle for us to deny. The chief criticism has been levelled against clause 257, and it seems to the Government that it ought to be our chief duty to make the position as plain as it can be made at the earliest possible moment. 'What we are seeking to do by this clause is to clothe with legislative recognition a long established constitutional practice. This is a practice which I venture to consider has been adopted for many-well , almost as long as we can recollect, and which is taken from the British practice obtaining in the United Kingdom, and has followed us here to Australia. It is absolutely necessary for the protection of the revenue, and in the interests of the community, that when a new Tariff is proposed, ns soon as it is announced there shall be power to collect the increased duties, lest the object of the legislation should be defeated by the introduction of goods before the collection commenced. Is there any reason why we .should . not adopt a practice of that sort here? Surely not. What was - necessary in one State will be all the more necessary in six States. It seems to me that there is additional necessity for providing for this in the clearest possible terms. There* might be doubts raised as to whether or not a practice which could be applied with simplicity in the affairs of one State could be equally applied - to the affairs of the Commonwealth, dealing with the fiscal systems of six States. Further, when our legislation as regards the relations of the States and the Commonwealth is so much the creature of special enactment and particular provision, .1. think that if we can, with similar clearness, provide what shall be the course under the circumstances which will shortly arise, it will be better if we can legally make a provision of the character referred to. The constitutional jiractice, of course, has a great deal to recommend it, but constitutional practice, when clothed with parliamentary recognition within the four corners of a statute, is even better, and - provides at least for the removal of doubts that otherwise might be found to exist. So I think that honourable members will probably agree with me when I say that there is no reason, if we can avoid departing from the constitutional practice, why we should depart from it ; and if it is possible to declare it, and provide for its enforcement within the four corners of the Act itself, all the better. What reason is given why we should not do what is suggested ? I think lionorable members, looking at the clause itself, will have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that all that is sought to be there provided for 'is the collection of the higher duty temporarily, pending the permanent imposition of a Customs Mr Kingston Tariff-the collection of the liigher duty, whether it is found in one State or in the other, or whether it is found in the State Tariff or in the Tariff which is proposed on behalf of the Federation. It is simply a declaration removing beyond the possibility of challenge the right of the Government to follow the course which has been established, I might say, from all time to do what is necessary to prevent the revenue from being robbed. Are we going to do it ? Are we going to make provision as best we can, or are we going to throw the doors open ?",53
361,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Nobod y has suggested that.,54
362,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The honourable and learned member for Indi says that no one suggests that. Well, as long as we can get what we require by any better means shall only be too glad to adopt those means. But what I say is this : we are proposing what is usual, and I have listened with the greatest'amount of attention and respect",54
363,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,AVhat is usual where 1,54
364,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"AVha t is usual in all British communities-to collect the higher duties when an alteration in the Tariff is proposed. I have listened to the various suggestions, and really there is not one of them which is seriously put forward as a substitute which is likely to be adopted. Someone has said that we ought to agree to a Tariff. It has fallen from a variety of quarters-and a delightful arrangement it would be. But here we are contemplating a Tariff, about which we are threatened with all sorts of differences; although I hope those differences will not be found to exist. Really it would be a most pleasant thing if any Tariff which the Government introduced could be accepted holus-bolus by this House even for one session. I should be delighted. Nothing would please me better.",54
365,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Sa} ' a couple of sessions.,54
366,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Why stop at that? I believe really that the result will be that the Tariff which we bring down will be accepted. Still it may take a little time and a little argument to persuade its acceptance by some honourable members on the other side of the House. But during that time, even if we want the Tariff adopted for only a session, what is going to happen as regards the passing of goods ?",54
367,Mr CONHOY,CUSTOMS BIL L,If the right honourable gentleman has any difficulty about the 1 matter we will deal with it .,54
368,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The honourable ancl learned member for Werriwa will no doubttake his opportunity when it comes, but we do not propose at this moment to give it to liim unnecessarily. What commercial members of this House will more readily realise, though at the same time we all recognise it, is this: that. no substitute beyond adhesion to the ordinary constitutional practice can be presented with any hope of acceptance by this House or any other branch of the Legislature. What are we doing ? We are simply proposing to adhere to the well-beaten track. I see the honourable and learned member for' India shake liis head. 1 believe that the course which I refer to as. the old constitutional practice is legal. I know that if we pass the clause as we have it here it will remove all doubt upon the subject. Does the lionorable and learned member for Indi suggest thab that practice is illegal ?",55
369,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,If it is not a Tariff it certainly is illegal.,55
370,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But is the constitutional practice of collecting duties according to the higher scale legal, or is it not?",55
371,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"In one sense it is not legal, ancl the courts have held that it is not.",55
372,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I venture to consider that it is constitutionally authorized and legal, but I also put it that if a Bill of this sort is accepted by both Houses of the Legislature that will undoubtedly place it beyond the region of doubt. The honourable and learned member for Indi practically puts it, "" Do this wliicli is doubtful in its legality, or which is illegal, and' I do not object."" But I venture to think that it is an infinitely preferable position for the Governinent, believing the thing to be illegal, to remove the room for doubt, and then do as others have done before. Mr ISAAC.S - Can the righfc honourable gentleman show one single instance where it has been clone before 1",55
373,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Of course as regards the special circu instances of this being the Tariff of a federation which deals with halfa-dozen.different States, 1 may not be able to show a similar instance. But the principle laid down that we can collect the higher duties in the interests of the revenue is one which it is impossible to attack.",55
374,Mr CON HOY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does the righfc honourable gentleman proposefcocollect the State duties its well ?,55
375,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,We propose to collect whatever duties are the higher ,55
376,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Betwee n the States as well?,55
377,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I will come to that a little further on. But the honourable and learned member for Indi says that this is an imposition cif uniform duties of Customs and that therefore inter-State free-trade comes in.,55
378,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,I say that it is either an imposition of uniform duties or that it is invalid.,55
379,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Firs t as regards the imposition of uniform duties, I may say that it is not an imposition of uniform duties at all. It is a collection of duties which are absolutely wanting in uniformity, and which will differ in the different States according to the rate of duty.",55
380,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Can the right honourable gentleman show anything in the Constitution which authorizesfchat?,55
381,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I can show that it is uniform a simple collection ot amounts in anticipation of parliamentary sanction, ancl to suggest thataParliament which has powers of the large character to be found within the four corners of the Constitution as regards taxation, ancl particularly as regards customs duties and all things incidental thereto, is not to have the power, through its Executive, of doing that which is absolutely necessary for the protection of the revenue in the interim, is to suggest that an A ct of that sort has been carelessly prepared, and is practically a disgrace to .those who prepared it, when, as a matter of fact, we know that it is not. It has occupied the best attention of some of the best minds of Australia, and to suggest that the Federal Parliament and Executive, though we have large powers in this connection to which I have referred, are shorn of the power of preventing the revenue from dwindling away during the period of our debates, which must necessarily be lengthy, is to contend for a position which is startling, and which, so far as I have examined the Constitution, there is no ground whatever for maintaining.",55
382,Mr HKIOINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,We only hope that the right honourable gentleman is right.,55
383,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I hope so, ancl' I believe so. If a position of this sorb had been pub bo the Federal Convention, of which the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was, like many other friends whom I see around me, a distinguished member, and if that body had been told that it was passing the Bill in such a shape that the Federal Parliament could not do what the States could do in connection with Tariff proposals, the suggestion would have been laughed out of the Convention.",55
384,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,The right honourable gentleman cannot follow the beaten track if a post and rail fence has been put across,56
385,Mr OMALLEY,CUSTOMS BIL L,We can knock the fence down.,56
386,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It would be strange indeed if a temporary obstruction of that character were to stop the march of the legislative machine on the highway of commercial progress. Uniform duties, indeed ! W it h all the consequences which follow the temporary collection pending legislative and permanent imposition ! How can they be uniform duties when they are altogether wanting in uniformity, and when they are not imposed by us in the case of some of the States, but by the States themselves",56
387,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,If the'Government choose to do it by an Executive act they can do it now.,56
388,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The honourable and learned member for Indi says- "" Do it by an Executive act."" Would he do it 1 Would, he do an illegal, unconstitutional, and improper act ?",56
389,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is what the right honourable gentleman recommends. They do it in England.,56
390,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I know that the honourable aiid learned member would not be averse to taking any responsibility which properly attached to the collection of duties. Would he hesitate to undertake the collection of the higher duties for the protection of the revenue on the in' traduction of the Tariff. Surely not. I say that what the honourable member would not hesitate to do we are quite justified in informing the House that we propose to do, and in asking for the special legislative authority which it seems to us should be properly conferred - for the particular authorization in a matter of this kind.  ground 1",56
391,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am as sure as can be. I would say this to the honourable and learned meinber at once, that I recognise - w e all recognise-that it is a good thing to thresh out these things on the second reading, and I am deeply obliged to honourable members for their suggestions. are working for the common good, and this is not a party question. I think that on questions affecting the revenue we should be prepared to sink any party feeling, because we must do something ih this direction for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole. We are asking only that we may be able to do what others have done it . before us. I was going to say this, that while I am thus discussing some of the positions that have been put before me-and I recognise that the point is of such importance that it is not going to be decided on second reading . speeches - I deprecate the duplication of the discussion. StiU, I think it is well that we should do something, and we will deal with it, as honourable members can also deal with it, in committee; and I have no doubt that the conclusion at which we shall arrive will be amply justified. Now, so much for that little matter. There is one otlier question that has been raised, and that is the subject of ships' stores. I do not mind telling honourable members, what probably they knew before, that my professional education did not include any very great learning on the subject of ships' stores. There is one thing, however, which is a distinct advantage, and that is, when one does not know all about a tiling, to recognise that one does not.",56
392,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Is the Minister going to do that 1,56
393,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I ' am going to teach the right honourable and learned gentleman first. It has been a labour of love during the time that I have been attempting to discharge the duties of Minister for Trade and Customs to endeavour to make myself acquainted, through the kind assistance, not only of the officers of the department, but of others having knowledge of mercantile matters, with the questions with which my department has particularly to deal. W it h regard to this question of ships' stores, it seems to me that the position is perfectlyplain, and that the leader of the Opposition stumbled somewhat over clause 121. That clause is simply intended to provide that stores can be cleared out of bond for the use of ships, without the payment of duty according to prescribed rates, when a ship is entered outwards for ports beyond the seas. The position .today is that as regards ships trading within the limits of a State, they can get no stores without the payment of duty because they We are entered within the State, and the reason for that is that the stores are intended practically for home consumption - Now the old rule was that if a ship went outside the State, and was entered outwards, the stores were obtainable free of duty, because that was not a case of home consumption. They did not charge for stores required by vessels for consumption between South Australia and Victoria, because those States were riot in the same-and I am indebted to an honourable member for the expression-fisca l area. Now the Commonwealth will be one fiscal area, and the question is as to the Hght of ships to obtain stores for consumption withi n our fiscal area. Here is the position : that unless we provide for the - uniform treatment of our own ships and foreign ships, the result will be that the foreign ships will have a distinct advantage over the local traders. It has been stated that if we prevent ships from obtaining their stores free of duty, it will affect sailors and other persons employed.",56
394,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,It will cost them 6s. a month.,57
395,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Well , it not infrequently happens that arguments of that sort are advanced which on careful analysis are not so fully sustained as one sight be inclined to suppose.",57
396,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,I can prove what I say.',57
397,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The position, broadly stsited, is, that if we are going to allow going ships free stores for home consumption in Australian waters, and deny the privilege to our local traders, an advantage will conferred on the ocean-going ships, to the disadvantage of the local traders; and - seems to me that we ought not to give advantage if we can possibly avoid it . is our object to prevent that as much as possibly can. People may talk as they like about the stores being used only for the crew and passengers. I have lieard a good desil on this subject from my officers, have been informed that allowances are dealt out upon the ships in harbour to such an that they are practically floating hotels.",57
398,Mr OMALLEY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Quite true.,57
399,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Thes e ships are pracgo"" tically floating hotels, dispensing goods for the benefit of all who come on board on terms with which the local licensed selves trader finds it impossible to comply, trenching on trade which properly belongs to traders on shore.",57
400,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is not correct.,57
401,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I have my information on this subject from my officers.,57
402,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Why does not the Minister stop it , then ?",57
403,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am going to. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",57
404,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I say that these ships are trenching on the trade which properly belongs to the local men, and trenching upon it in a way which cannot be justified. It may prove a difficult and troublesome subject to deal with.",57
405,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does the Minister mean to say that the State Customs laws during all these years have never applied themselves to a question of this sort 1,57
406,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I do not say that. It is a thing it is very difficult to detect.,57
407,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Minister should not pose as a man who puts his armour off in a matter of this sort.,57
408,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I have not taken it off; I am only just going to put it on. I am speaking now from information which has been supplied to me regarding facts of which I have no personal knowledge.,57
409,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is against the law now woulcl at first if it is done.,57
410,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is easyenough to make such accusations, but the Minister should know first.",57
411,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"All I can say is oceanthis: that before I came downto the House I was naturally discussing this question of stores with men who knew a great be deal more about it than I did, and the iiiformation that I have given to the House it was placed before me by these gentlemen. that I learnt further that not only are these It dutiable goods dispensed on board ships in we port, but that there is petty smuggling going on in connection with these stores, to such a degree that we would very much like to check it. However, we will deal with that and I further when we go into committee.",57
412,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,We should like to visit some extent of these places and judge for ourselves.,57
413,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I hope it is not a case of "" I have been there and fain would with the right honourable and learned gentleman. I would like to refer to one or two otlier matters before we address ourto the details of this Bill in commitand tee. Some honourable member suggested that we should put the regulations in the Bill.",57
414,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is one point that I desire to impress upon the Minister; I am entirely with the right right honourable gentleman in everything he had said up to now. The one point I want to ask him is, ii! he claims authority to seal up and prevent the use of dutiable articles taken on board in another country",57
415,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS BIL L,Order : the honourable member has already spoken.,58
416,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"May I ask, Mr Speaker, that you will allow rue to finish the sentence.",58
417,Mr SPEAKER,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Honourable members know that interjections are quite out of order, and while I do not take any notice of very short ones, I could not ignore a remark that was partly a repetition of a speech alreadv made.",58
418,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,".1. am sorry to deny the righfc honourable gentleman any information. He is always desirous of it, and I do not know of any one who wants more. I may say that as soon as we get our Customs officer on board ship, wherever that ship comes from, we shall be able to do what is necessary to give effect tq the Government intentions on the lines I . liave ventured to suggest.",58
419,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Will the Customs officer go from Albany to Adelaide 1,58
420,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"He will not go unless he is told. I was dealing with the question of regulations, and referring to the fact that some one had suggested- I forget which honourable member it was-fchaf c they should be in the Bill.",58
421,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I was going to do so, was cut short.",58
422,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Regardin g the regulations, I think that honourable members have a right, at the earliest possible moment, to have those regulations in front of them. And I may say that they are more than rough drafted, they need only final revision, and fchey shall be brought down as soon as possible. Wifch regard to the framing of regulations, power is given to this House in reference to the controlling of fchem to an extent which I think is as large, if not larger, than has been provided for in any previous Bill. Wifch regard to matters of this kind, I think the time of this House can be much better occupied with greater questions than with those comparatively petty questions of detail which are ordinarily dealt with by regulation. We have a lot to do, and my idea is that matters of detail might properly be made the subject of regulation, and need not be put in the Bill, for the reason that it might be necessary to alter the regulations shortly afterwards.",58
423,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I did not suggest that the regulations should be infcheBill. Mr KIN G STO N - I am much obliged, to the honourable member, and I do not hesitate to say that we shall be able to carry out the substance of what he. desires and bring down regulations without a moment's unnecessary delay.",58
424,Sir MALCOLM MCEACIIAJIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Shall we have the regulations during the discussion of the Bill 1,58
425,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Nex t scission.,58
426,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"No , there is no ques- > tion of putting off. We want to do the work and do it well. We are more likely fco achieve fchafc object by directing the attention of - honourable members at .present to matters of principle rather than to matters of petty detail, which are generally settled by framing regulations. A good deal has been said about the penalties, and no doubt these are startling when they are collected together and can be seen at a glance. At the same time. I think I am right in saying that we have in many instances reduced the penalties considerably, though there is a good deal of force in the objection taken by the honourable member for North Sydney in regard to the minimum penalty in the - case fco which he referred. Bufc as regards that and similar matters we do not. want but I anything unfair. We simply want power to enforce the law for the benefit of the honest trader, and for the prevention of competition to which he ought not to be subjected. I am sure that will be the wish of honourable members generally, and the Governinent will do what they can to that end. The honourable member for Melbourne called attention to clause 195 of the Victorian Customs Act, providing that if it appears to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that spirits, opium, tobacco, or cigars are on board a vessel without the knowledge of the owner, and without wilful neglect, the commissioner shall deliver the ship or boat to the owner or the master. The honourable member for Melbourne found fault because there is no provision of that sort in the Bill. I would like to point out, however, that the provision in the Victorian Act is engrafted on a section, which declares that a boat shall be forfeited if there be found on board any , vessel of a certain size, capable of containin g liquids or packages of opium M i or tobacco' of a certain size, it would be simply monstrous to think of ance. for f e it in g a boat under such circumstances. We have no provision in the Bill as to the for f e it u r e of a boat under such conditions, - ancl so a proviso of that k in d is not necessary. I have in m y hand a copy of the intendedV i c to r i a n Act, and the N e w South Wales Act is very l it t l e different, though I am sorry I have not a loose copy of the latter.. I find that the provisions as regards the forfeitur e of a ship are to be confined",58
427,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,- L o o k at clause 214.,59
428,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That refers to a ship in the case of smuggling, and under such circumstances there might, perhaps, be forfeiture.",59
429,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,That - is the first sub-clause.,59
430,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I venture to think that we shall be able to reduce the stringency of the penalties.,59
431,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,B y these provisions an Australian fleet could be obtained in no time.,59
432,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I venture to think it will be possible to reduce the stringency of these provisions even still more.,59
433,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,I should think,59
434,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"An y suggestions made by honourable members, which will not have the effect of crippling the Bill , but which will make it more reasonable, while equally effective, will be welcomed. I do not know that it is necessary to say anyt h in g f u r the r at this particular moment. No doubt the Bill will be in committee almost immediately, and It r u s t we shall be able to make satisfactory progress. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clause I agreed to. Clause 2 This Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation.",59
435,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,We r r i w a ) vernment intend to give honourable members any idea when the proclamation is l i k e l y to be made ?,59
436,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,V e r y soon.,59
437,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Will the Minister also say that at the same time the proclamation is made, or perhaps the evening before, the T a r if f Bill will be brought in ?",59

439,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L," The honourable and learned member for Indi, earlier this evening, drew attention to the fact that ""prescribed"" includes prescribed by the Act, which includes regulations, and that those regulations might create. Offences. The honourable and learned member raised the question of the desirability or otherwise of leaving with the Minister the power to create criminal or quasicriminal offences. . Clause 2.24, which is the general penalty clause, provides that any person guilty by act or omission, or by any contravention or evasion of the Act for which no other penalty is provided, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than £ 1 0 .",60
440,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," In the first line of clause 4 there is a word which is printed clearly, though its meaning is not clear. I do not know if there is a precedent for this, but it is a departure from the usual form of expression.",60
441,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,In Victoria.,60
442,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Where is it else?,60
443,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,South Australia.,60
444,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The clause says "" in this Act, except where otherwise clearly intended,"" the following words shall have the meanings set forth. Suppose a court came to the conclusion, after a prolonged argument, that the intention of the Act is in a certain direction, but that it is not clear, what would be the result ? According to the interpretation clause, the words are not to have the meaning unless the meaning is "" clear,"" and to my mind the Bill introduces a form of I expression which is open to doubt, and with which I am not familiar.",60
445,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," There may be some such language in some Act in South Australia, but 1 doubt whether my friend can show the same language in any other Act in any other part of the British dominions. A question might easily arise in legal proceedings, because the interpreta-* tion clause forms what may be called the vertebra of the whole Act, and a court would be put in this extraordinary position t did not come to the conclusion that the meaning attached to the words in this clause was the clearly intended meaning it would be compelled to hold that no such meaning could possibly be attached to such words, and that is limiting the value of the interpretation clause. Perhaps the Minister has some marvellous way of showing that this is a revelation of Divine-wisdom, and I am quite agreeable to know that it is.",60
446,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"This is most amusing These particular words have the sacredness of South Australian precedent, but, apart from that, honourable members are putting the position that unless words are clear, someother meaning must be intended. It is nothing of the sort; it is absolutely the reverse, as the leader of the Opposition and the honourable and learned member for Indi will say. What we say is, that wherever there is a doubt or another meaning is not clearly intended, this is our meaning. We do not want the courfc to be refining away unless they can pledge their judicial reputations that we do not mean this. This is what we mean, and . the court has to administer the Act accordingly. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I would suggest that confusion might arise through the term "" owner "" being applied both in respect - of goods and in respect of ships. It would be much better if the second term were made to read ""ship* owner.""",60
447,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I will look into the matter more closely; but I think "" owner "" is generally used in connection with ships. If I find there is any room for doubt",60
448,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L," There is no doubt about the word, but it creates confusion throughout the Bill.",60
449,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It would be rather cumbrous to use the word ""ship-owner"" right, throughout the Bill. I will, however, I look into the matter, and give the honourable member, if he likes, an opportunity of taking the sense of the House.",60
450,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,I will leave it to the Minister.,61
451,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L," The definition of "" answer questions "" might not have been so very important had it not been for the very severe penalty clauses in the Bill, namely, clauses 224, 229, 239, and 242. When a man comes before the officers of the department he is bound to answer. has to go into the box and give evidence against liimself, even if he does not wish to give evidence at all. If we retain this first sub-clause, even if we strike out the other clause later on, we will still be giving, a .power to the collector which he ought not to have, because there would still be the liability to a penalty under clause 224. Therefore, if we strike out the harsher provisions altogether, we still leave any man open to a penalty under that clause. I think the best plan that can be followed is for the Minister to withdraw this sub-clause and to allow us to deal with each clause as it arises, otherwise it might have a force which may not be intended.",61
452,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,If the honourable learned member for Werriwa will call attenAct or not. tion to these clauses when we reach them we canreturn to this and make any that may be required.,61
453,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Clause 242 provides thatIf o minimum penalty imposed by this Act be liable to reduction under any power of mitigation which would, but for this section, be sessed b}' the courts. If we allow this first part of the interpretadisability-th tion clause to stand, and the penalty clause is still retained, I think that people will liable under this very part itself, strike out the whole of the subsequent clauses in relation to the penalty, and I do saysnot think that would be advisable, in view of what the Minister has already stated.",61
454,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I can assure able and learned member that we will not forget to consider it .,61
455,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," Toward s the end of this interpretation clause I think my right honourable friend is taking a course . which certainly needs reconsideration. The effect of giving to the words "" this A c meaning sufficiently wide to include all regulations thereunder is rather a strong one. As a rule "" this Act "" is an expression [148] which refers to the Act and to the Act only. But the effect of' making an interpretation of the words ""this Act "" to include all regulations which may be made, practically puts the Ministry in a position to exercise a power which it seems to me may enable them to pass regulations which are not strictly within the legislation.",61
456,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The regulations come before Parliament. He Mr R.EID - They come before Parliament, but in a most clumsy way. In order to deal witli those regulations it is necessary for Parliament to stop the course of public business and for both Houses to pass a resolution. It is avery extreme course that has to be taken. The disapproval of this House would mean nothing so far as the Act is concerned. Therefore the statement of the Attorney-General is scarcely an answer to the remarks I made. Parliament never objects to giving, power to the Executive to frame regulations to carry out an. Act which has been passed, so long as tliose regulations are consistent with that Act. But to my mind it is quite a novel provision that the Executive should have power to make regulations irrespective of whether and those regulations are consistent with the Sir MALCOLM MCEACHABN.^-That is why alteration I wanted the regulations.",61
457,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I begin to see now why the honourable member for Melbourne was so anxious about the matter. In the Audi t shall Bill the very proper expression is used, pos- "" if consistent with the provisions of this Act."" That attaches to the Executive a e absence of power to make a regulation inconsistent with the will of the be legislative body. But this Bill is framed unless we upon absolutely different lines.",61
458,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Look at clause 255. It The Minister may make regulations prescribing all matters which by this Act are required or the honorpermitted to be prescribed.,61
459,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"In clause 255 there is something far more than that. I looked at the provision before I ventured to intrude mythat self upon the notice of the committee. That clause provides that the Minister may make regulations for the. conduct of any business t "" a relating to the Customs-whethe r it is referred to in this Act or not, and wliether the regulations are consistent with this Ac t or 1 not. If the Minister will make it clear that the regulations are not to be inconsistent witli the Act I shall be satisfied.",61
460,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I w i ll do so.,62
461,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L," I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the definition of the word ""smuggling."" Tbis interpretation says"" Smuggling"" means any importation or introduction or attempted importation or introduction of goods without proper entry or with intent to defraud the revenue. Considering the extreme penalties that are imposed for smuggling, and the reflection that is cast by such a description upon the offender, I think that the definition requires amendment. One of the penalties imposed is that a ship used in smuggling shall be forfeited.",62
462,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,But the committee have to approve of that first.,62
463,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I must consider the Bill as it is. If there is a mere entry which may constitute an improper entry, and which is acknowledged to be a mere error, why should it be described as smuggling ? ""Would it not be well to omit the word "" or "" after the word ""entry"" ? There is no need to retain the words "" with intent to defraud the revenue "" if they are intended to be implied in every case; the first part of the clause is ample. An offender is liable to the penalty even for error. I suggest to the Minister that he should consider this matter, and, at some future time, inform the committee whether he will adopt my suggestion, or why he will not adopt it .",62
464,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Minister for Trade and Customs and I will look into the matter together.,62
465,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,And will the Minister inform the committee ? Mr DEAKIN. --Yes .,62
466,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L," I do not agree with the suggestion of the last speaker that these words should be omitted. I would invite the attention of the committee to the meaning of the word ""importation."" Importation, I apprehend, means the bringbourne) ing of goods within the ports or harbors of the Commonwealth.",62
467,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Literall y it means bringing ing into a port.,62
468,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Le t us take the case of an Orient liner or a P. and O, steamer. Those'vessels come into the port, but not for the purpose of discharging all their cargo. Nor can it be said that all they bring into port is imported for the purpose of coming within the reach of our revenue law. The mere act of bringing goods into a port ought not to be considered an act of smuggling. An entry is only made in respect of goods which are to be completely clause imported by being intermingled with the property of the State, so that I think this clause ought to remain as it stands. 1 There are two divisible acts. An Orient liner brings a large quantity of goods within the jurisdiction of the federal authorities. Strictly speaking, that would be an importation, yet it is not to be deemed smuggling, because an entry is not made. Therefore, it would not be an offence coming within the meaning of the word "" smuggling,"" because it is not importation with intent to defraud. Of course, the de finition of smuggling in the clause covers .the importing of goods without a proper entry being made, and the importing of error in goods with intent to defraud.",62
469,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,It means the landing of goods.,62
470,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,Not necessarily the landing of goods. The importation is complete the moment the goods come within the Commonwealth.,62
471,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,But a man cannot pass an entry while a steamer is outside the Heads. He cannot pass an entry t ill the manifest reaches the Custom-house.,62
472,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That would be an importation, but still it would not be a fraudulent act.",62
473,Mr REI D,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But this interpretation makes what the honourable and learned member refers to equally punishable with the most glaring case of smuggling, where men are detected landing on the coast and there is a sanguinary engagement.",62
474,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"To my mind the definition of the word ""smuggling"" is a proper one and ought to remain as it is. The word "" o r "" ought to remain, and the word "" and "" should not be inserted. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Mel- I think that the honourable member for North Sydney is perfectly correct, but perhaps that is due to my density not allownie to follow the legal argument. It appears to me that if a steamer came here with a cargo, and part of that cargo were not claimed by the consignee, the master would be unable to pass a proper entry in regard to it , and consequently he would be classed as a smuggler under this clause. It often happens that goods are landed in regard to which it is impossible to pass a proper entry.",62
475,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L," This may be a matter which does not strike many honourable members as at all serious. They do not own ships, and I do not either, and, therefore, it may seem to some of us to be of no consequence. Still we are legislating in regard to the rightful interests of people who have millions of money invested in ships, and surely this interpretation, which does not make it a mere matter of discretion for the Executive, but by law compels them in certain cases to forfeit a ship-worth , perhaps, £200,000--to the Crown, is a most important one. Surely there must be some intent to evade or defraud the revenue before such a monstrous penalty should be exacted ? The element of fraud should come in in some way. This interpretation, however, places an innocent act, where there is no attempt to defraud the revenue, on exactly the same plane of punishment as a wilful act. Is tliere any sense in such a proposal ?",63
476,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Is not that an objection to clause 214, and not an objection to this clause ?",63
477,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"No . 1I have suggested that the interpretation clause should stand over until the Bill has been finished, and then we should know whether it was necessary to talk on ' it. My right honourable friend prefers, however, the less convenient procedure, and instead of our dealing with the clause now, we must deal with it as it interprets the Bill as it stands. That is the inconvenience of taking an interpretation clause before our work is over.",63
478,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"We are to use words first, and find the meaning afterwards.",63
479,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is the theory of taking an interpretation clause first. I tliink it would have been more sensible to have taken this clause after we had finally settled the scope of the Bill. We have to deal with the matter in the light of the subsequent provisions of the Bill as they stand now. I would point out to the committee that the smuggling in respect to which the owners and captain of a ship may be made liable may be absolutely hi reference to some two or tliree articles belonging to some unknown person in a cargo of 5,000 tons, yet in such a case the whole ship is to be forfeited. No one supposes that the Executive would give effect to such a provision, but this i provides the round-about course of forfeiting the ship, and then the Governor General in Council steps in, and, contrary to the law, avoids the forfeiture, after it has taken effect by operation of law. The very idea of smuggling is to get goods passed in without paying the proper revenue. We cannot divorce that meaning from the word ""smuggling."" A person may, by inadvertence, take delivery of 50 cases as containing some article which is on the free list, when, in point of fact, those cases contain something else which is not on the free list, but which is subject to a high rate of duty. The London shipper may ship them fraudulently, but the owners of the ship might be absolutely ignorant of the contents. They take the description of the contents of packages as the shipper describes them. A shipper in London could ship 50 cases said to contain drapery when, in point of fact, they might contain whisky, or any other highly dutiable article.",63
480,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The ship would not be responsible in that case. ' Mr BEID - Yes , it would be responsible as the clause stands. I could quite understand a man beUeving that such a thing is not intended, but clause 214 provides that any ship used in smuggling shall be forfeited to His Majesty. In this case, the ship would be so used by this person in London.",63
481,Mr HARPER,CUSTOMS BIL L,Intentionall y used?,63
482,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is the word we wish to insert. If my honourable friend's suggestion were put in, and the intent to cheat the Customs were an element the in the forfeiture, that would meet the case. I am sure my right honourable friend would not say that where there was no intent to defraud, a ship should be forfeited, but the words used are so wide that that could happen.",63
483,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,I think it is a mistake in the Bill.,63
484,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is either a mistake or a deliberately intended proposal. In either case, it is onr duty to look into it .",63
485,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,We promise to consider the whole definition.,63
486,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,I am perfectly satisfied when my honourable and learned friend says that. I am sure he will give us an opportunity of dealing with this.provision.,63
487,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,64
488,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That being so, I do not want to take up the time of the committee on the clause.",64
489,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," W7 e have been told by the Minister that, unless it is otherwise clearly intended, the provisions in the interpretation clausemust be taken in their literal meaning. If ' that is so, then if any goods are brought"" into Australia under an entry which by some mischance, however honest, by some technicality, however minute, preventsthat entry being, a proper one- I do not know wlmt ""proper"" means-, there is no definition of it-that is smuggling. I think that is too severe. I will go with the Minister as far as he wishes in repressinganything intentionally wrong, and in inflicting a penalty even for technical errors where it is necessary to protect the revenue. I do not believe, however, in designating with a criminal name something which is not a criminal act. J would suggest to the Minister, if he desires, to pass this clause first, and as I agree that we should settle our terminology before we deal with the Bill, that he should undertake to recommit it .",64
490,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"-An opportunity for the furtlier consideration of the clause will undoubtedly be given. Mr ISAACS:-If the clause is to be recornmitted, we can proceed to deal with subsequent clauses, and if they are found to contain penalties too severe for the definition of ""smuggling"" as set out in this drastic interpretation clause, we shall have an opportunity of altering, its terminology.",64
491,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L," I simply wish to add a word or two in relation to what has been said since I last spoke. One of my objections is to the term ""smuggling,"" which describes an admitted crime, being, applied to what may not be a crime at all. The Minister in charge of the Bill can easily arrive at all he wants by, at the most, putting in another interpretation for the passing of entries by mistake or for improper importation. If he desires, he may put in something describing that offence, bub to apply the term "" smuggling"" to an unintentional offence is like applying the term "" murder"" to the act of a man who has caused the death of another without any such intention.",64
492,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Peopl e look at smuggling in a variety of ways. I think it is ahighly reprehensible thing, but there are many outside the House who hardly feel so strongly about it , to defraud the Customs, in relation to small matters. If they are made bo recognise that this is a very serious offence, it will be all the bebber. As regards the clause dealing wibh the forfeibure of shipSj I should mention bhat after I moved the second reading of this Bill aremark was made by an honourable member as to the limitation of the powers of forfeiture contained in recent Imperial legislation. I have been able to trace that provision, and I find that a limitation is placed on the value of ships which can be forfeited. I am inclined to think we shall do well to engraft the same principle on the legislation which is contained here. I regreb that I did not refer to the matter on the second reading, but I may say now that it is our intention to deal with it .",64
493,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L, I simply desire to call the attention of the Minisber to clause 242.,64
494,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,I have noted it . Honorable MEMBERS - Oh !,64
495,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Insid e - this chamber I look for the probecbion of the Chair, and bhat I - brusb will be given bo me. Oubside the chamber I can deal - witli these matbers myself! I have pub up bhis evening wibh interruptions from some of the honourable members on the Ministerial side, which is not a credit to them.",64
496,Mr MAHON,CUSTOMS BIL L," I should like to ask the Minister a question in regard bo the definition of"" ""parts beyond the seas."" The definition of bhat term given in the clause is that it means any country outside of Australia. There is the remote possibility that the Northern Territory may not be taken over by the Commonwealth, and if it were resumed by the Imperial Governmentthis definition would be rather awkward. I would suggest that it should be altered to "" any country beyond the Commonwealth.""",64
497,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Northern Territory is safe.,64
498,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is"" included in the Commonwealth.",64
499,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,And it cannot be taken out of the Commonwealth wibhoub an amendment of the Constitution Act. Clause agreed to. Clause 5The penalties referred to at the foot of sections indicate that any contravention of the section whether by act or omission shall be an offence against this Act punishable upon conviction by a penalty not exceeding (except as hereinafter provided) the penalty mentioned.,64
500,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Northern Melbourne) This is a very useful covering clause which applies to all penalties, and I should like to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to take a note of a suggestion which I desire to make. I do not propose to move an amendment, but it is at this point that we could provide a useful clause enacting what are the State Acts that no longer apply to the Custonis of Australia. In the Defence Act which was introduced the other evening tliere is a clause which provides thatThe State Acts specified in the 1st schedule to this Act shall not apply to the defence force. In the schedule a list is given of almost all the Acts of the different States which relate to the defence forces, and it is very useful to know that these Acts no longer are in operation. The more we endeavour to simplify this Act, so that a man may know that the whole of the law so far as the Customs are concerned, is contained within its ambit, the better it will be. I would therefore ask the Minister for Customs to consider whether he should not introduce in this Bill a clause similar to that which appears in the Defence Bill. I have had in the course of my experience to study not only the Customs Acts of the various States, but also the Acts relating to Customs indirectly, and I have found them a very confused and chaotic mass. It would be very distressing to a man who was looking for a plain sailing chart in the Commonwealth Customs Act to find that he must also read the Customs Acts of the various States. I have no doubt that under sections 108 and 109 of the Constitution Act it is competent for the Commonwealth to enact, as it is going to enact in the Defence Bill, that such portions of existing State Acts as refer to the same subject as the Commonwealth Ac t shall cease to operate.",65
501,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I will look into it .,65
502,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L," In reference to the last suggestion, if my honourable and learned friend's ideas could be carried out, it would be very convenient indeed, but I would suggest for consideration the question as to how we could, in dealing with these Acts, decide that certain State laws are to be repealed. AVe have no power of repeal.",65
503,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The word ""repeal"" is not the word used; but we might say that certain - State Acts specified in the schedule would not apply.",65
504,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is a course of action which would be open to criticism. We haA'e no specific power of repeal, but this Parliament can pass laws within the purview of its jurisdiction, and then when it has passed such laws, section 109 comes into Operation, in so far as it provides thatwherever the law of a State is inconsistent with the law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall to that extent be invalid. It will be for the courts hereafter to decide to what extent the federal law is inconsistent with the State law, and a very .great deal of consideration and discussion will be required before we can decide what laws have been repealed.",65
505,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Does the honourable ancl learned member say that this Parliament cannot declare that a certam section of the regulations, of - Customs are not to apply to importations into the Commonwealth ?",65
506,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The question of importation, so far as fiscal laws are concerned, may be regulated by section 90, which says that certain State laws shall cease to have effect. But I say that in. legislation generally in regard to. Customs we cannot select certain State laws and say that they are thereby repealed or rendered invalid. AVe can, however, pass a law which by implication will repeal those Acts. But at the same time it may be very hard to say to what extent the repugnance orinconsistency may exist. That will be for the courts to consider; and I say that we cannot safely or conveniently, or perhaps even constitutionally, put in a schedule of repealed Acts. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Clause 7 (Comptroller-General).",65
507,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L, I think it is almost a pity that we had not a Collector of Customs who could have assisted in framing a Bill that woulcl have fallen lightlyon the people.,65
508,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I can assure the honourable member that no man has had greater experience or done moi-e work than Dr Wollaston.,65
509,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But I would like to point out that the Comptroller-General h as been accustomed to deal with one of the Customs [REPRESENTATIVES.] worse systems of taxation in the States, and it would have been better if it had been possible to have had a man with experience in connection with the lighter systems of taxation. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 (State Collector).",65
510,Mr REI D,CUSTOMS BIL L," I see that it is very properly provided in this clause that there shall still be a Collector of Customs in each of the different States, but I wish to point out the enormous difficulties that will surround the Minister, who I see takes power to determine all questions that may arise. There are other clauses which will enable him to relieve himself of the necessity of directly determining these matters, but still the Minister makes himself the sole authority within his own discretion to determine all questions that may arise in the ent Custom-houses of Australia, even though he be established in the permanent capital of the Eederation. I hope that the Minister will keep in view the advantage of leaving the determination in the first instance in the hands of the State Collectors of Customs. It would relieve the Minister of an enormous amount of personal trouble if he gave the collectors the power of determination, subject to his review. It would bring the cases before him in a much more manageable shape if some subordinate authority were first to go over them and come to a conclusion upon them.",66
511,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is the practice which is being adopted now.,66
512,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes . But the A ct places the determination in the hands of the Minister.,66
513,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The right honourable gentleman will find very few cases in which the Minister is compelled to act.,66
514,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That may be so, and it will be impossible for the responsible Minister to do other than look over the determinations of the inferior authority. I have no doubt there are clauses which give the Minister the power of delegation to the collectors, but he wants something more than that, because if the Minister delegates his power of determination, the power exercised by the delegate will be exercised finally. I do not want to go as far as that. I think it is right that the Minister should delegate his power, biit that it should be done under conditions that would retain to him the controlling power. Bill.",66
515,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is provided for. It is provided that the delegation shall not affect the power of the Minister to review any decision afterwards. . Mr Reid - Unde r what clause is that?,66
516,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Unde r clause 11.,66
517,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That will meet the case. That clause will practically leave the controlling power in the hands of the Minister, whilst he will be at liberty to enable the State collector to exercise the power of investigation, and come to a decision. Clause agreed to. Clause 9 (Delegation by Minister).",66
518,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," This clause strikes me as a very wide one indeed. Does the Minister not think that some limitation should be placed in the clause as to the differclass of persons on whom this delegation may be conferred? At present there is absolutely no limit, and it may be given to any person in the service or out of the service, to a Minister of the Crown, or a person in Parliament or out of Parliament. Further, this delegation may include the power to make regulations. That is a tremendous power, and I would like to know if there is any precedent for it anywhere.",66
519,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Minister is building up a despotism for himself.,66
520,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I take it that we are creating our own precedents, but, so far, we have not had much opportunity of doing so. This clause gives power to the Minister to delegate his authority to other persons, but although the power is a wide one, he is not likely to exercise it recklessly, as he wil l be held responsible to Parliament for anything he may do. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I think this is a matter that the Minister should give consideration to, but I do not think it is right that these enormous powers should be given to any one, irrespective of who he may be.",66
521,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Parliamen t has always the Minister in its hands. ' Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN - It may be that the present Minister will not always be where he is now, and in case some one not like the present Minister should take his position, I think we ought to have some check on Ministerial acts. Clause agreed to. Clause 10 agreed to. Clause 1 1Every delegation, whether by the Minister or Comptroller, shall be revocable at will, and no delegation shall prevent the exercise of any power by the Minister or Comptroller.",66
522,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," I do not know whether it would not be safer to adopt the same method of revocation as that prescribed for delegation; that is to say, that the revocation should be in writing. If the revocation were by mere word of moutli some question might arise as to when it was done or as to whether it was done at all, and considering the important matters that are involved, I think that we should provide that the revocation should be done in writing, and that it should be precise both as to the fact and the time of revocation. SupiDosing that it came to the knowledge of the Minister that a certain officer at Perth had been acting improperly, and it became necessary to revoke his delegation at once, the giving of instructions for sending a telegram would be equivalent to a revocation in writing. I moveTliat the words "" in writing"" be inserted after the word ""revocable,""line2. Amendment agreed to.",67
523,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," There is another point which seems important. There is a provision that no delegation can prevent the exercise of any power by the Minister or comptroller. I must come back to the point I raised at first, because I see there mav be a great deal of dissatisfaction «'ind trouble unless the Bill clearly shows a power on the part of the Minister to review the exercise of the power he has delegated to a local collector. The delegation practically makes the local collector the Minister. The local collector may arrive at a determination which the Minister is dissatisfied with, and the latter may re-open the matter and arrive at a contrary decision. I do not say the Minister should not have the power to do that, because his responsibility always remains, but the fact that there is a power of reversing the determination of the delegate should appear on the face of the Bill.",67
524,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is here.,67
525,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I admit it is there in language, but if the local collector is to act for the Minister as a judge to find and determine, it is very much better that the Minister's power to upset his determination should be in the nature of an appeal. Supposing there is a general authority given by the Minister, making the collector at Melbourne or Sydney the determining power for a certain class of business, there should be something on the face of the Bill to show a method of appeal. Any review should be more in the nature of an appeal than in the nature of an arbitrary act on the part of a Minister. The Minister's finding is final, so that the Crown really has two strings to its bow. A person may succeed before the delegate, but the Minister may not like the decision, and may set it aside, so that the person who gets the benefit of the determination in the first instance is left at the mercy of the Minister, without any appeal or rehearing. I admit this is a difficult matter, but there will be great dissatisfaction if these powers are to be exercised by a State collector, and are exei-cised in such a way that the Minister can set them aside without any method of rehearing. However, I do not wish to place any trouble in the way of the progress of the Bill. Clause agreed to. Clause 12All persons acting in the service of the Customs at the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to have been duly appointed.",67
526,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Northern Melbourne) How will this clause affect the public servants of the different States ? I have some concrete instances in my mind, and I should like to know whether the clause makes temporary Customs officers permanent officers 1",67
527,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,No .,67
528,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,What is the object of the clause ?,67
529,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It means that any appointment, whatever it is, is lawful.",67
530,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I have in my mind's eye the case of a young man in the Customs department, who has been a temporary officer for eleven years.",67
531,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I can be responsible for only six months of that period.,67
532,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That young man, though his age is 25 or 26, and he has a beard, is still treated as a boy and paid legal boy's wages, while he does a man's work.",67
533,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,He seems to have the gift of perennial youth.,67
534,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"And also of perennial representation to his member. What is the good of the clause if it does not mean that this young man, who is undoubtedly in the employ of the Customs, is to be a permanent oflicer ? Do the words in this instance mean anything except that which appears in the definition clause as to regulations being part of the Bil l ? Is a person working in the Customs department at the commencement of any regulations to be deemed duly appointed ?",67
535,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The regulations referred to are the regulations under the Bill, and not under any Act of a State.",68
536,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Quite so; but I do not know the meaning of the clause, unless it means a man is to be in the permanent servioe with all the privileges of a fully appointed official. But it would be an awkward thing if any one who got a day's work for some emergency in the Customs should be deemed a permanent officer, because he was appointed in advance of some regulations.",68
537,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"In regard to the first point, I cannot hold out any great hopes of an early transformation of the honourable and learned member's friend from a temporary grub into a permanent civil service butterfly.",68
538,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Is he to be entitled £ 1 1 0 per year?,68
539,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That will depend on the construction of the Public Service Bill, to which the honourable and learned member has devoted so much attention. the words "" at the commencement of this Act,"" what is clearly intended ? Something is to happen from the commencement of the Act. When is the Ac t to com- - Bill mence ?",68
540,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Who can tell.,68
541,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I can.,68
542,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"No , the Minister cannot, because it has to be settled by the department. Governor by proclamation.",68
543,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is certain what is able to be rendered certain. The Act their is to commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation.,68
544,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Will the regulations pear in the Gaz&tta 1,68
545,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Not if tliey are existing.,68
546,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," I do not know what was clearly intended by the Minister in his explanation, but I feel very mucli puzzled as to the meaning of the clause. At first I thought that all persons acting in relation to the Customs service - should deemed to be duly appointed--tha should question tlieir right to act in a capacity in which they assumed to act.",68
547,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is the point.,68
548,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"But my belief has been considerably shaken by the words "" at the commencement of this Act."" If what I thought was the intention, tliose words ought to be left out, because we should not limit the presumption of law to persons acting at the commencement of the Act. If the clause means anything more it must mean to give a permanent or definite appointment to persons acting at the time. I - think that the words "" at the commencement of this Act,"" if they are meant merely to create an irrebuttable presumption that persons assuming to act were properly appointed, should come out.",68
549,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I did not tliink it worth wliile to go so far as that. We do not want to have to go into any question as to how any appointment was made. We take the officers over, and we do not want to be troubled with any investigation as to how they were appointed.",68
550,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,The Minister does not want to be troubled witli the question as to to wliether they are temporary or permanent hands.,68
551,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"We say that those who were, acting when the service was transferred are to be taken as lawfully appointed, As to whether permanent or temporary.",68
552,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,It had better be made clear.,68
553,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I do not think it can be made clearer. In another part of the we make it clear that wharfs and other structures established at the commencement of the Act are to be deemed lawfully established. We give validity to the state of things which existed when we took over the,68
554,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The clause does not say that the officers are lawfully appointed to particular grades, positions, or salaries. Mx. KINGSTON - The clause says that the officers are lawfully in the service of apthe Customs. AVe do not want to be troubled with the question of salaries or not anything more. But we want to understand that we start fair witli our service and our establishments generally, and that the validity of appointments as they existed when the Act came into operation is not unnecessarily to be inquired into. Mr .HIGGINS --If the words "" lawfully in be the service of the Customs "" were substituted t no one it would be better.",68
555,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L," On the Minister's explanation the clause is unnecessary, because it has been settled under section 84 of the Constitution Act that when a department of the State becomes transferred to the Commonwealth all officers ot the department shall become subject to the control of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. The section goes on to provide for officers who are not retained in the service of the Commonwealth, and there is a further provision as to pensions, gratuities, and so on, but under the Public Service Bill all officers are to have their existing and accruing rights. That being the case, - I think the clause is unnecessary.",69
556,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L," Most of the observations on this clause are wide of the mark, because the expression "" this Act "" does not mean this Act. By the interpretation clause it means any regulation which at any time has been made or is capable of being made. It is a delightfully elastic expression. Clause agreed to. Clauses 13 and 14 agreed to. Clause 15The Governor General may by proclamation(a) Appoint boarding stations for theboarding of ships by officers. (6) Establish ports andfixtheir limits, (c) Appoint wharfs within ports and fix their limits. - Mr HUME COOK (Bourke) - I desire to call attention to sub-clause (i>), which provides that the Governor General may, amongst other things, establish ports and fix their limits. I can understand the necessity for fixing the limits of ports, but to establish ports may be to name certain places and not to name others. For example, the Governor General may name Warrnambool as a port, and exclude Port Fairy. That wonld lead to a very great injustice being done to a large number of people who had been in the habit of using the latter port. I simply draw attention to this matter for the sake of getting information.",69
557,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"This is only the usual power to establish ports, and there is a preservation of existing ports. It is an absolutely necessary provision. Clause agreed to. Clause 16Ports and wharfs may be established or appointed for specified limited purposes or without any such limitation.",69
558,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,This Bill is not quite so clear about the establishment of wharfs as it is about that of ports. I suppose that it refers equally to wharfs which have been long established ?,69
559,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,They are specially preserved.,69
560,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,So that the clause refers only to new wharfs ?,69
561,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Yes .,69
562,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Whils t I am dealing with - this question of wharfs, may I express the hope that the - Minister who is charged with requiring equality of trade throughout the Commonwealth will, when these clauses come into operation, study the matter of wharfage cliarges, because it seems to me clearly within the power of the Commonwealth to preserve equality of trade against the whole world. I admit that the subject does not come under the Bill, and I only take advantage of this clause, which refers to wharfs, to express the hope that the Minister will see that that loop-hole for inequality is stopped.",69
563,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The right honourable member means that we ought to see that we do not transfer the fight from the Customshouse to the wharfs ?,69
564,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,Exactly .,69
565,Mr THOMSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does the right honourable member mean in the way of wharfage rates ?,69
566,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes . Supposing that a cargo of potatoes comes from Tasmania, I believe that the policy here is to charge a wharfage rate, whereas, if it comes from Warrnambool, no rate is charged. Wherever such a state of tilings exists it will have to be stopped. That will be one of the benefits of federal union. Otherwise, we shall be carrying out on the wharfs what we are determined to prevent on the highways of commerce. Clause agreed to. Clauses 17 and 18 agreed to. Clause 19Every wharf-owner shall provide to the satisfaction of the collector suitable office accommodation on his wharf for the exclusive use of the officer employed at the wharf. Penalty £20. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHABN (Melbourne) - I think that there should be some definition of the word "" suitable"" in this clause. Could the collector demand that a residence should be erected upon a wharf ? Some people have very wide ideas of what office accommodation means.",69
567,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"-What the honourable member suggests would be very unreasonable, and I ask him to construe the term employed in a fair way. We cannot define it specially. AVe say "" suitable office accommodation,"" which does not mean that a man shall erect a palace, but yet that he shall erect sometliing a little better than a tent. I am sure that the honourable member's business habits would preclude the possibility of his having any difficulty in deciding what the clause means, and he can rely upon similar consideration being given to it by the Customs-house officials.",70
568,Mr MAUGER,CUSTOMS BIL L,I wish to ask the Minister what position Custom - house agents occupy in connection with clause 1,70
569,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"They are dealt with a long way further on. Clause agreed to. Clauses 20 to 22 agreed to. Clause 23The licence for any carriage revoked by the collector if the licensee shall be guilty of any fraud or misconduct, or shall fail to comply with this Act.",70
570,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," Is it intended that an investigation on such a matter as is provided for in this clause shall come under an ordinary general expression 1 Is it not intended that the collector, shall be the final authority determine a matter of this sort 1 Unless is so provided in the words of the clause, it would really seem thai ;!-.ere should be some process of proof, or, any rate, that issue might be raised Ihat the decision of collector was wrong, and that whose licence was taken away had not been guilty of any fraud or misconduct. entry This might involve litigation. I suggest, and therefore, that the collector should be the final authority, and that if in his opinion the licensee has been guilty of any fraudulent conduct, his licence should be revoked. If the collector comes to the conclusion that the licensee has been guilty of fraud or misconduct, does not the Minister intend that that should be sufficient ?",70
571,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Of course, it would be a bit hard to take away a man's licence if the he had not been guilty of misconduct. If the right honourable member will allow the clause to pass in its present form, I will trary. look at it further.",70
572,Mr MCC AY,CUSTOMS BIL L," I suppose that altogether. the words "" the collector"" have the same meaning as ""collector"" in the interpretation clause. The latter term includes nearly all the Custom-house officers. It would be veiy dangerous to make this power to revoke licences a general power of any Customs officer. Clause agreed to. Clause 24 agreed to. Clause 25Declarations under this Act may be made before the Minister, or any collector, or any justice, and also beEore any person authorized in that behalf by the Minister or comptroller.",70
573,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Can the Minister direct me to that part' of the Bil l which refers to declarations ? I do not think that they are this defined.,70
574,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"They are not defined, but they are referred to in sub-clause (b) of clause 147, and in other clauses, too, I think.",70
575,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L, I would like to ask whether this clause means that declarations may be taken by any officer of or lighter may be Customs ?,70
576,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,If authorized.,70
577,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It does not say tlmt. The provision specifically jiuthorizes all Customhouse officers, and then all other officers. I suggest that it should be more clearly defined who is to take these declarations.",70
578,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," I think that subto clause (b) of clause 147 hardly harmonizes it with this provision. This clause says that declarations may be made before the Minister or an}' collector or any justice, and the also before any person authorized by the the Minister or comptroller. But sub-clause (b) the person of clause 147 says The value shall be verified at the time of by the production of the genuine invoice, by a declaration signed bj' the owner in the presence of the collector.",70
579,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,We will take that out.,70
580,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Werriwa);-The clause before the committee says that declarations may be made before the Minister or any collector or justice, and also before any person authorized by the Minister or comptroller. We must not forget, however, that clause 240 provides thatIn every Customs prosecution the averment of prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim shall be deemed to bo proved in the absence of proof to the con",70
581,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is a different thing Clause agreed to. Clause 26 agreed to. Clause 27If the Governor General shall so direct .by clamation any State Act relating to the inspection or testing of imported goods may be executed and enforced by the Customs.,70
582,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L," I draw attention to this clause with a view to getting some idea as to its exact significance. In the first place, I would ask if it is advisable to legislate by reference in this matter 1 I think that a law so important, as that of inspection ought to be a law passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and not one about which the Parliament at present knows nothing, namely, a law which may be in force in any particular State, l t is giving t'he Governor General in Council power to legislate",71
583,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The States have power to legislate. It is a valuable check in the interests of the Commonwealth that such inspection laws should be carried out subject to the control of the Commonwealth ancl of its officers, so as not to interfere in any way with freedom of trade.",71
584,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"At present the States retain as a right, under section 112 of the Commonwealth Act, the power to make and enforce tlieir own inspection laws, but these inspection laws must bc peculiarly applicable to the States in reference to sanitary considerations, and so on ; tliey will not be laws in reference to trade and commerce. The States have no power to pass laws even of an inspectional character in regard to trade and commerce.",71
585,Mr WATSON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Is not the object clause to allow the machinery Customs office to be lent to the States t,71
586,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It may be so ; but I am objecting to this form of legislation. I consider that inspectional laws of a federal character ought to be passed by the Federal Parliament. This clause, however, proposes to utilize State inspection laws for federal purposes.",71
587,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,No ; it proposes to enable federal servants to discharge State duties if a State wishes it.,71
588,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"That is hardly the meaning. The clause provides thatIf the Governor General shall so direct by proclamation any State Act relating to the inspection or testing of imported goods may be executed and enforced by the Customs. That is to say, the work is to be done by a federal officer. Is it to be clone for federal purposes 1",71
589,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,No .,71
590,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,"For the purpose pro- of ascertaining the value of goods, packages may. be broken open if necessary by the federal omcers. Wide powers of that land ought to be taken by federal law.",71
591,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,"It is simply a conditional power. A State passes certain laws, which it is authorized to pass for the purpose of inspection which will be principally in regard to sanitary matters. Instead of casting upon it the obligation of appointing a staff of officers to do the work, which might be accomplished daily in a few minutes, the clause enables federal officers to undertake it . The State asks that the work may be done, and we do it . The clause is not intended to have the effect which the honourable and learned meinber attaches to it.",71
592,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L,It is open to the observation that it means that we are to utilize State laws for federal purposes. Are we to have different inspection laws in different States %,71
593,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,Stat e laws need not be uniform ; federal laws must be uniform.,71
594,Sir JOHN QUICK,CUSTOMS BIL L," I think that the object of the clause as explained by the Attorney-General is a very useful one, and if it can be done with harmonious relations between the Commonwealth and the States, it ought to be very welcome. It will sure enormous expense, and it will avoid double of the trouble and annoyance to the trading of the public. I think, however, that the clause as it stands may lead to some objection. I would suggest the insertion of words, showing that this is to be done, "" with the consent of the States.""",71
595,Mr DEAKIN,CUSTOMS BIL L,We have no power to do the work unless at their request.,71
596,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"As the clause at present stands, it gives power to the Governor General to direct by proclamation that any State Act relating to the inspection or testing of imported goods may be executed and enforced by the Customs.",71
597,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Subjec t to the Constitution Act.,71
598,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I am very doubtful whether, even by the consent of the States, there is the absolute power to do this. Section 112 of the Constitution Act leaves the execution of the State law to the State. It allows the Commonwealth to annul these laws: but I do not think it contemplates this particular effort of legislative authority at all. I have no objection to the clause, provided that the words I have named are inserted. The clause may be misunderstood, and because of that misunderstanding it may be resented. As it is necessarily contemplated that the States shall give their consent, I think it is wise to insert a provision to that eifect.",71
599,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," I think there is another difficulty. The State Customs legislation remains in force after this Bill has been passed, unless it is inconsistent with tli ^ provisions of this measure.",72
600,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,Inspectio n laws.,72
601,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Yes , the Customs inspection laws, so that a Commonwealth dfficer can use any provisions of the Customs inspection laws of the State which are not inconsistent with the provisions of an A ct of the Commonwealth. The only practical difficulty in regard to this clause is that it is rather vague as to whether the operation of a State Act may not by this Commonwealth proclamation extend to other - States. I do not think it would, but the addition of a few words would make it perfectly clear.. The clause provides that "" if the Governor General shall so direct by proclamation ""that is the active powerAny State Aot relating to the inspection or testing of imported goods may be executed and enforced by the Customs. The Customs have a Commonwealth range, so that these words are just a little vague. Although I like the brevity of the clause, I would suggest that, in order to-secure greater - clearness, we should add the words "" in that State."" The effect of that would be to make it perfectly clear that we are not taking a general power to use, for example, a Victorian law in Western Australia.",72
602,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not think there is - sufficient doubt to render the addition of those words necessary. The more I look at it, the more I like the clause as it stands.",72
603,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L,That is not unnatural.,72
604,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,We must remember that this is the right honourable and learned gentleman's first.,72
605,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,I think it better to adhere to the clause as it is. Clause agreed to. Clause 28The working days and hours of the Customs shall be as prescribed and except when working . overtime is permitted by the collector cargo only be received loaded or worked on or discharged from any ship on working days and during working hours. Penalty: £50.,72
606,Mr MAUGER,CUSTOMS BIL L," I suppose there is no means by which this provision could be made more definite. I take it that the clearing of ships is in the hands of the Customs department, and while it has been generally understood that they should not be cleared on Sunday, there has been a great deal of unnecessary Sunday work in Victoria lately. One veiy large sailing ship recently had a company of men to adjust her compasses on a Sunday, and I am told that there was really no occasion for the work to be done on that day.",72
607,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CUSTOMS BIL L,But the men would get double pay for it .,72
608,Mr MAUGER,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Eve n with double pay, unnecessary Sunday work should not be encouraged. ' I have been told by pilots and others interested that the practice of Sunday work is growing, and I desire to know whether there are no means of making the clause more definite.",72
609,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The working days and hours will be provided for in the regulations, which will be brought down at once.",72
610,Mr MAUGER,CUSTOMS BIL L,And we shall have an opportunity of seeing them. ? 1,72
611,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,Of course. Honourable members are bound to see them.,72
612,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,-We are bound to see them when it is too late to touch them.,72
613,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The House will have the fullest right to see tliem. Clause agreed to. Clause 29 agreed to. Clause 30Goods shall be subject to the control of the Customs as follows:(a) As to all goods imported-fro m the time of actual importation until delivery for home consumption or untii exportation to parts beyond the seas whichever shall first happen. (6) As to all goods under drawback-fro m the time of the claim for drawback until exportation into parts beyond the .seas. (c) As to all goods subject to any export duty-fro m the time when the same are brought to any port or place for exportation until the payment of che duty.,72
614,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L," The debate which took place on an earlier clause has suggested to me that it might be desirable to define in some way when inrportation has taken place-whethe r it has taken place shall when the goods arrive within the territorial limit, or when the ship comes to the wharf, or when the goods are landed. There are difficulties in the way, but great trouble will arise if we do not define the exact time of importation. The clause provides that goods shall be subject to the control of Customs,- as to all goods imported, from the time of actual importation. What is the time of actual importation ?",72
615,Mr HABPEB,CUSTOMS BIL L,What would the honourable and learned member suggest?,73
616,Mr MCCAY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I would not suggest anything; I am. not responsible for the interpretation clause. I also desire to draw the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bil l to the fact that in paragraph (a), the words ""exportation to parts be3'ond the seas"" are used, while in paragraph (b) the words "" exportation into parts beyond the seas"" occur. Is it meant by that that goods on. foreign-going ships are subject to the control of the Customs from, the moment theyleave an Australian port until they reach their destination at some other port ? The exportation is apparently not completed until the vessel arrives at her port of destination. That is an assumption of authority on the high seas that I very much question our power to take - finition",73
617,Mr BEID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"'The meaning is that the moment a ship leaves Australia for a foreign port the exportation is complete. This clause seems to me for all practical purposes to define correctly enough the jurisdiction of the Customs authorities over the goods, but the definition which the Governinent themselves have put on the clause seems to entirely conflict with any jurisdiction on their part over any goods which are not imported, which are not landed, and are not on the ship's manifest as goods to be landed. Goods are subject to our control only when ""they are in a ship and intended to be landed within the Commonwealth. The stores which ships bring with them from ports beyond the Commonwealth are not brought here to be landed. They are not on the manifest of the cargo, and as the clause very properly provides, they are not subject to the control of the Customs. That is entirely inconsistent witli any notion of liaving control over goods in foreign ships, which are not to be landed within the Commonwealth, because of course if there were any attempt to land goods not on the manifest, that would be what we call smuggling, and would be subject to the very severe penalties which are prescribed. Therefore, although I am thoroughly in accord witli the policy of the Government in connection with these ships' stores, I feel that there is a question involved which may become one affecting the position of the Bil l altogether, if what seems to me to be the proper view of the matter isnotrecognised. It - may be a very proper thing that we should have power given to us by the Commonwealth Act to deal with goods on foreign ships that are not to be landed in Australia, but I think our powers do not extend as far as the Government would have us suppose. If the goodsare not intended to be landed here, they are not under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, except for the purposes of preventing them from - being surreptitiously landed. If goods are shipped not to be landed, and are honestly kept on the ship, they are-absolutely beyond the power of the Commonwealth. Our power of levying duty on goods only arises when those goods are landed or consumed within the limits of the Commonwealth.",73
618,Mr HIGGINS,CUSTOMS BIL L,-That is the right honourable gentleman's definition of actual importation.,73
619,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I do not attempt a de"" where it is not otherwise clearly intended""; but I wish this point to be taken notice of* because it is a very serious matter. The Minister knows how jealous the high authorities of the Empire are of any attempt to exercise control over matters that'are not within our jurisdiction, and affecting the great shipping companies of the world, who have opportunities of representing their views in a very influential manner. My desire is not to quarrel with the policy or the intentions of the Government, but I think it would be a misfortune if in omendeavour to carry out desirable legislation we went beyond our authority, and brought about delay in the passing of the Bil l or litigation such as might be involved later on. I have had some little experience in the administration of Customs laws, and I hope I have made my views quite clear. My point is, that when a vessel brings ships' stores into the Commonwealth from ports beyond the seas, so long as those stores remain on the ship, and are not intended to be landed, and are not included in any manifest as goods to be landed in the Commonwealth, but are goods to be consumed at sea, or to be consumed after the vessel has left the Commonwealth, such goods are absolutely beyond our jurisdiction, and, therefore, we cannot put our seal on them, say, at Perth, with a power to keep that seal on them all the time the ship is out at sea.",73
620,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The right honourable gentleman admits that we can seal them 1,74
621,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The Commonwealth has absolute power within its jurisdiction to protect the Customs revenue. No one will grudge them that power, and as far as harbour excesses are concerned, I would be very sorry to doubt the power of the Government. I say that when ships are lying in our harbors, the consumption of dutiable goods is a matter that the Commonwealth can deal with, but if any attempt is made to go beyond that, and seal down goods when they are outside the limits of-the Commonwealth, and prevent their consumption there, we shall be going beyond our power. There is full power to prevent the abuse of our Customs laws, but no power to interfere with the goods I have described when a vessel is outside the limits of the Commonwealth. If the Minister will consent to consider this question, I am perfectly satisfied that we shall come to a conclusion that will enable us to avoid one of the dangers that might otherwise threaten the Bill. If we show any disposition to go beyond our powers, there are a number of influential people who will be only too ready to pull us up.",74
622,Mr ISAACS,CUSTOMS BIL L," I do not know now the difference between "" importation "" and "" actual importation,"" and 1 do not think there is any necessity for the word "" actual.""",74
623,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"Perhaps there is a good deal in favour of striking that word out. Amendments (by . Mr KINGSTON) agreed toThat the word ""actual,"" line 4, be omitted. That the word ""into."" line 9, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""to."" Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 31 agreed to. Clause 32 (Custom control of goods).",74
624,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," This another of the clauses that will have to be considered in connection with the matter that we have been speaking of, because it raises the question of ships' stores again. Supposing stores such as I have referred to were sealed on a vessel leaving Eremantle and bound for Sydney, this clause would raise the point as to whether the ship's officers would have the power to take away the seal in order to enable them to use the goods during the time they were beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.",74
625,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,"I see the penalty here is fixed at £100, and I would like to know what would be the lowest penalty 1",74
626,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,The minimum would be £5.,74
627,Mr CONROY,CUSTOMS BIL L,Does not the Minister think that woulcl be rather high 1,74
628,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"The honourable member for North Sydney has a proposal to make later on which will meet the case. Clause agreed to. Clause 33The Customs shall not be liable for any loss or damage, occasioned to any goods subject to the control of the Customs, except by the wilful neglect or wanton act of some officer.",74
629,Mr REID,CUSTOMS BIL L," I would like to draw the attention of the committee to the marvellous transformation that occurs wh6n a private individual has suffered through some neglect of a public officer. We have had a number of allusions to what will happen to a private individual if he comes within the reach of a person in authority; but here is a clause under which the authorities are not satisfied to compel an individual, whose, goods have been lost or damaged through the neglect of a public officer, to prove the neglect of the officer, but require him to go further and prove that the neglect was wilful. That is how a tribunal of Customs officials protect themselves and the Crown. If a man's goods have been damaged or lost through the neglect of a public oflicer in whose custody they are, surely that man ought to recover compensation without having to prove something more than mere neglect. If mere neglect is all that is wanted, the word "" w i l f u l "" is unnecessary, and so is the word "" wanton."" Of course I admit that an officer, in destroying a man's goods, might be carrying out the policy of the country for the time being, and in that is sense he might require protection ; but apart from that, I think it is beneath the dignity of a high State, when a poor wretch has lost his property through some neglect or act of a responsible officer, to place unnecessary obstacles in the way of recovering redress. I commend this to the generous feelings of the Minister, and suggest the omission of the words "" w i l f u l "" and ""wanton,"" leaving the clause to read "" by the neglect or act.""",74
630,Mr KINGSTON,CUSTOMS BIL L,"There is a good deal in what the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney says, and I - will consider the matter. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.33 p.m.",75
