13,Mr MARRS,PRESIDENT OF TH E,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice 1: Whether commercial aviation firms already established in Australia will be given an opportunity of tendering for the Defence Department's requirements and for mail and other services ? 2. As extensive experiments in carrying mails by air have already been made in England, France, and America, and as the records in connection therewith can be obtained in Australia, is it considered necessary for further experiments to be carried out by the Defence Department ? 3. Will the A i r Board co-operate with and advise the 90 per cent, of shire councils in Australia who have expressed their willingness to give every assistance possible in providing landing grounds, provided they are guided by a responsible Government Department? 4. As shipping is catered for by means of charts, lighthouses, dredged channels, &c, will the Government consider the urgent necessity of assisting commercial aviation by providing landing grounds, hangars, maps, &c? 0. As several passenger-carrying time-tables have been arranged between several capital cities and outlying towns, and as the services have been suspended until the issue of the A i r Navigation Regulations, when will such regulations be issued?",20
14,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,PRESIDENT OF TH E," answers to the honourable member's question s are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes, although it should be pointed out that requirements which must be imported are obtained, as a general rule, direct from manufacturers in the United Kingdom through the High Commissioner, who, in the case of aviation equipment, would have the assistance of the Australian Liaison Officer at the A i r Ministry. This would be usually more advantageous than dealing through an agency in Australia. I stated recently in the House that should the Government receive a definite offer from any civil aviation' company stating exactly the route over which they proposed working,"" proposed time-table, type of machine and engine to be used, the number of machines to be used in the service and in reserve, the places at which they will establish landing grounds, hangars, and workshops, the amount of mail matter they are prepared to carry, and the remuneration they desire for the service, it would no doubt be suriously considered by the Government. 2. It is not thought that the records regarding the carrying of mails in England, France, and America, countries which have large populations, and where large commercial cities over various routes are fair l y frequent, can be taken"" as n guide in connection with the possibilities of aerial mails in Australia. It is considered that the commercial success of such mails depends entirely on the attitude of the public as to whether they are prepared to send correspondence by air, and, perhaps, to pay extra for the faster service. It is considered, therefore, that the only possible way of arriving at a proper conclusion is by an actual t r i a l in Australia. 3. Yes. As soon as it is possible certain definite air routes are to be surveyed and mapped, and over these particular routes officers will be sent out for the purpose of getting into touch with those shire councils and others concerned. 4. The Government will take action along the lines suggested in the question, though it is doubtful whether it will be possible to provide hangars for purely civil purposes. 5. Legislation for the control of civil aviation is being prepared for submission at the present session. Meanwhile, those whose activities will be regulated thereby may assume that Australian regulations will follow British provisions, subject only to sueh modifications as might be found necessary for local conditions. FUEL OIL. Mr ATKINSON "" asked the Minister for the N a v y , upon not i c e Whether he will inform the House1. From whom he recently contracted to pur-' chase fuel oil at £7 10s. per ton? 2.

It is the intention to provide a complete Institute when the Oeneral Post Office has been remodelled. Queensland - The Institute Organizer has also just returned - from Brisbane, where he has been conducting a similar investigation, and the matter of establishing an Institute there under present conditions is under consideration. South Australia - Provisio n has been made in the Adelaide building proposals for the purpose of an Institute, and steps will be taken to establish, it as soon as circumstances permit. Western Australia - Provisio n for Institute, accommodation has been made in the new General Post Office, Perth, and the matter will be taken in hand as soon as the building is completed. Tasmania - An Institute will be established as soon as opportunity offers. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT . MECHANICAL BRANCH RESIGNATIONS.",20

18,Mr WISE,PRESIDENT OF TH E,"During the period 1st October, 1918, to 30th September, 1920, 125 officers of the mechanical branch of the Postmaster-General's Department resigned their positions. NA AUSTRALIA.",21
19,Mr MATHEWS,MILITARY PRISONERS IN,"for Mr BRENNAN) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Howmany persons approximately who were convicted by court martial are imprisoned for military offences in prisons in Australia? 2. How many are in the Pentridge stockade at Coburg? 3. Are some of the latter ""hunger-striking?"" 4. Have grave complaints been made regarding the medical treatment of these last?",21
20,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,MILITARY PRISONERS IN,"Th answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. There are twenty-one ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force convicted by courts martial serving sentences in prisons and Deupon noticetention Barracks in Australia. Of these four were convicted for military offences, and teen for civil offences, such as manslaughter, robbery with violence, forgery, shooting intent, and theft. [241]- 2 2. Eight, comprising one for military offences, and seven for civil offences. 3. The State prison authorities,- in whose charge these men are, have reported that some of them were hunger striking, but it is understood that this has now ceased. 4. No such complaints have been made to the Defence Department. PEDERAL CAPITAL DESIGN.",21
21,Mr STORY,MILITARY PRISONERS IN,"for Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Minister for Home and Territories, upon notice I. Is it the intention of the Government to give effect to Mr Griffin's design for the Federal Capital at Canberra? 2. Is it the intention of the Government to empower Mr Griffin to give effect to his design forthwith? 3. Is it a fact that adequate plans are available to enable the work to proceed at once? 4. If so, do the Government intend - to give effect to such plans, and thus honour the decision of Parliament?  have already announced its intention of proceeding with the Federal Capital. It 13 proposed to generally observe the design furnished by Mr Griffin, subject, of course, to the obligations of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act. With a view to an early occupation of the area, consideration is being given to a scheme for the provision of works, temporary and permanent. Meanwhile, the initiation of certain preparatory work? is being authorized. NA AUSTRALIA. Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether, in view of the presence in Australia of Sir Arnold Gridley, formerly controller of electric power supply in Great Britain during the war, the Government will consider the advisability of obtaining a report from him on the best methods of securing a comprehensive power supply scheme for Australia that would insure economical development and maximum benefit without overlapping?",21

23,Mr GABB,POWER SUPPLY EOR,"the Prime Minister, Whether he will appoint a Committee of sevenmusical experts to decide upon or compose a distinctly national song for Australia, so as with to bring about uniformity in the matter ?",21
24,Mr HUGHES,POWER SUPPLY EOR,No . NA,21
25,Mr CAMERON,SOLDIER SETTLEMENT IN,"the Acting Minister for Repatriation, upon notice I. What are the terms that govern the grant of £1,000 per soldier land settler to the States by the Commonwealth Government? 2. To what purposes must this money be applied by the' States?",22
26,Mr RODGERS,SOLDIER SETTLEMENT IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. In connection with land-settlement work undertaken by the several State Governments, the Commonwealth agreed to advance a definite sum to settle a fixed quota of returned men. At the last Premiers' Conference, further financial assistance was sought; and, as the proposals were so extensive, and the cost of placing the settlors on the land varied so much, the Commonwealth agreed to advance, for any additional settlers over and above the quota previously agreed upon, a sum equal on a flat basis to £1,000 per settler, being £625 on the average as working capital for each settler, the balance being applied to cover the cost of land resumptions and works, incidental to land settlement, which have been approved hy the Commonwealth Government. 2. See No. 1. NA",22
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"On the 14th October, the honourable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb), asked the following questions:1. Whether the Colonial Sugar Befining Company have informed the South Australian Fruit-growers' Co-operative Society that it will be unable to let it have sugar for its new f r u it nreserving factory, at Nuriootpa? 2. If so, will the Minister explain how it is that this fruit-growers' society in South Australia has been refused sugar, when the jam manufacturers of Tasmania and Victoria are able to obtain sumcient, not only for home consumption, but to make and export jam to South Australia and overseas? I am now in a position to f u r n is h the honourable member with the following replies to the above questions:1. No. The facts are that the Fruit-growers' Association of South Australia was promised 100 tons of sugar per mouth; but this quant it y was subsequently increased by 10 tons per month. The manager of the association then asked for 50 tons per month for a new cannery to be opened at Nuriootpa in December next. Tho Colonial Sugar Befining Company naturally declined to promise a definite quantity of sugar for a factory which is not yet in existence, but .promised that everytfRng possible, so far as the stocks of sugar on hand might permit, would be done to assist the new factory. I might add that arrangements which have now been made will, I hope, enable us to supply all necessary STATES. sugar for jam-making and canning purposes. 2. See reply to No. 1. MR. ERNEST TILL .",22
28,Mr HUGHES,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"On 15th October, the  Moloney) on behalf of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), asked me the following questions:1. Is it a fact that one, Ernest T ill , permanently resident in New Guinea, but for some months past, for health reasons, temporarily resident in Sydney, has been refused permission by the Public Trustee to operate on his banking account at Rabaul, on the ground that he was an enemy alien? (2) If this is so, in view of the fact that Dr. J. V. Danes, Consul for the Czechoslovak Republic, has certified that the said Ernest T ill is a subject of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, is it the intention of the Federal Government to permit him, and other similarly situated, to freely operate on their own accounts at Rabaul ? I the n promised to m a ke in q u i r i e s in to the matter ; and 1 a m n ow in a p o s it i o n to f u r n is h the honourable member with the - f o l l o w i ng replies:1. Mr T ill is reported to be a national of an MAKING. ex-enemy country, who was granted permission by the Administrator of German New Guinea to leave that Territory on 20th A p r i l, 1920, with £600 in his possession to cover his maintenance in Sydney until October, 1920, when he expected to return to Rabaul. In July last, Mr T ill reported to the Public Trustee that, in addition to having spent £600, he had borrowed and spent £180, making his total expenditure £780 for three months; and he asked for per""mission to withdraw from New Guinea a further sum of £500 to meet his indebtedness, and to cover his cost of living until he left for Rabaul in October, 1920. On behalf of the Administrator of German New Guinea, inquiry was made into the case by the Public Trustee, who advised Mr T ill that the Public Trustee would be prepared to support any application he might make to the Administrator for £65, as representing a sum to maintain him at the rate of £5 per week u n t i l 20th October, 1920. Until Mr T ill produces definite proof that he is not of German, or Austrian, nationality, it is considered undesirable to allow him to withdraw from German New Guinea large sums of money which, under the present circumstances, are subject to retention for the Reparation Fund. 2. No restriction will be placed by the Federal Government upon the property of persons who prove, in accordance with the requirements of the Treaties of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany and Austria,' that they are subjects of the Czechoslovakian Republic. NAVIGATION BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Senate's message) : Clause 23Section 88 of the principal Act is amended by inserting in sub-section (1) after the words "" otherwise than in accordance with the terms of his agreement "" the words "" or the provisions of this Act."" House of Representatives' Amendment Omit the clause and insert the following new clause :"" 23. Section 88 of the principal Act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead :' 88.

""",22
29,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) move That the amendment be not insisted on, and that the amendments made in the original clause by the Senate be agreed to. Honourable members will recollect that we forwarded to the other branch of the Legislature twenty-one amendments to this Bill . The amendment which we made in clause 23 referred to certain privi leges which the seamen were to obtain if they were discharged prior to the ter^ mination of their agreement. But we made that amendment in such a way that inadvertently it deprived them of those advantages if they were discharged at the end of their agreement at other than their home ports. That was not the intention of the Committee. Our intention was to give them exactly the same advantages if they were discharged prior to the termination of their agreement, at other than their home ports as they would obtain if they were discharged at the end of their agreement. All that the Senate's amendment does, therefore, is to give effect to the intention of this 'Committee. Motion agreed to. House of Representatives' 'Amendment After clause 33 insert the following new clause"" 33A. Section 135 of the principal Act is amended by adding the following paragraph:' (e) make provision, where such can be provided without detriment to the 'safe navigation of the ship, for a wheelhouse or, if such is not practicable, such temporary shelter as may be prescribed.'

30,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"Richmond-Minister a for Trade and Customs) [3.19] - I moveproper That the Senate's amendments be agreed to. The amendment made by this Committee in section 135 of the principal Act provided for the equipment of steamships operating on the coast with a wheelhouse to protect the man at the wheel from the weather. But it made that portion of the vessel's equipment [3.18] - I appear as an alternative, whereas in truth it was an addition. Motion agreed to. Resolutions reported; report adopted. CUSTOMS BILL . ' SECOND READING.",23
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.21] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. If honourable members will glance at the Bill , which has been circulated for some time, they will see that it is confined to one subject only. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) and other honourable members have drawn attention London. cn several occasions to the difficulties which importers were experiencing in dealFrance, ing with goods from various countries, particularly Prance and Italy , which a depreciated exchange position. They liave also drawn attention to the fact the Customs Department, collecting duty - and carrying out the law as we believe it to be-at the min t par rate pf exchange lire; and Belgium, 52.85 francs. on the value df the invoice in the curreasons rency of the country from which the goods came, were thereby making it tically impossible for those countries trade with us under existing conditions. I propose this afternoon to try to set in regard to a subject which is somewhat complex, but as clearly as I can, the change. principles upon which the Bill is framed, and the reason that it has taken this parparticular ticular shape, which honourable members will see is somewhat new in Customs cedure. I think I shall be able to show that, owing to the abnormal condition affairs which exists, we must apply a somewhat abnormal remedy. I assist honourable members somewhat to appreciate both the reasons for the introbills duction of the Bill and the form of Bill itself, if I set out briefly the broad principles underlying the theory of foreign exchanges, and the causes that .have led to the present abnormal condiLondon, tion of affairs. I shall then endeavour show how we propose to get over the diffiof Belgium. culties which these abnormal conditions present, and the reasons for the form the Bill itself. I do not propose to weary the House with a long dissertation on complexities of the foreign exchanges which, however interesting it might would probably take us a long way from the consideration of the particular subject before us. I shall confine myself as much as possible to the broad principles of matter, and show why the Bill has been presented in this form. Let me state position as it exists today in comparison with pre-war days, when the exchange position, generally speaking, was normal. Taking the three countries, Prance, Italy and Belgium Mr TuDOh - Do you mean by themselves, or as compared with Great Britain .",23
32,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"I am comparing the currency of those countries with our lutely identical goods. sterling currency, and the figures I giving are for sight bills drawn The pre-war par rate of exchange on London per £ 1 sterling was: 25.23 francs; Italy , 25.23 l i r e ; hut and Belgium, 25.23 francs. To-day the had rate of exchange on London for the £ 1 sterling- I got these rates from the Comthat monwealth Bank yesterday, so that, presumably, they are up-to-date-for sight bills is:-France , 52.85 francs; It a l y , 89 For which I shall give directly, the rate of exchange in pre-war days never pracvaried very much above or below par to between London and those countries which practically, for purposes .of international out, exchange, traded on a gold basis. That is why I have given the par rates of exI t was not necessary for my purpose to state the exchange on any day. It is sumcient to say that, for reasons which I shall give later, the proexchange rates never varied very much above or below par in pre-war days. Cono f sequently we can say that, speaking broadly, in pre-war days £ 1 0 0 worth of t may English bills on France could be exchanged for 2,523 francs worth of French on London, the same number of lire the - on Italy , and the same number of francs on Belgium. To-day £ 1 0 0 worth of English the bills on France can be exchanged for 5,285 francs worth of French bills on 8,9.00 lire worth in the case of to Italy , and 5,285 francs worth in the case It will be readily seen that, presuming-this is a presumpof tion, and I am not stating it as a fact that the relative increase in the cost of the manufacture, such as the rates of wages, raw ma'erial, cost of coal, plant, & c , be, has been the same in England and France, all other things being equal, if today for some reason or other a French merchant wished to exchange £ 1 0 0 worth the of British goods for identical French goods, he would have, at the present rate the of exchange, to ship more than double the amount of French goods, if there was to be an equality in the two bills of exchange drawn as between the two coun, tries. That is the position today, presuming that the cost of the articles' had risen proportionately in both countries.",24
33,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"Taking, for instance, French silks and British heavy woollens ?",24
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"I was taking absoI f France and am England, for instance, were both making on blankets of the same weight and using the same class of wool, presuming that all things were equal, if Paris drew a bill on London, and London drew a bill on Paris, a? between different importers, the French .importer importing British blankets and the Britisli importer importing French blankets, you would have to get twice as many blankets from France if the two bills were to balance. I shall show directly why this inequality does not exist in reality, and I hope to show also how and why the inequality is not necessarily coextensive with the variation in the rates of exchange, even when full allowance is made for the purchase of raw material abroad by a country whose exchanges are adverse to it . When I deal with the question of raw material, as I must later, I shall show to what extent the raw material, which is being bought by France and every other country with an adverse exchange position, must necessarily cost it more in the currency of that country, as compared with sterling, than it is costing British manufacturers. But I shall also be able to show, I think, that, owing to the fact that these countries are establishing long-dated credits for the purchase of raw material at the present time, this does not enter into the calculations to anything like so great an extent .as might be otherwise anticipated.",24
35,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"But it will do so in the event of the exchange being the same when the amount is due, as it is today.",25
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"Yes , if it is; but those credits vary from three to five, and up to seven years, and, of course, we hope that long before those credits become due and payable, the French position, and the exchange position generally, will, if not quite normal, more closely approximate to normal than it does today. I should like to say this before passing on: it'has been said over and over again in the press that the exchange position in which France and other countries find themselves makes it difficult for them to trade. I do not believe for a moment that that is so; because, if the exchange position of France and other countries with a depreciated exchange be made more difficult, it necessarily follows that a country with an appreciated exchange position, as America, for instance, will have its position made easy for it ; if it be difficult for France today, under the existing exchange position, to trade,, then, with an appreciated exchange, it must be necessarily more easy. Of course, that is absurd. In the case of America, while before the war, £100 would buy 486 dollars worth of goods, today £100 will buy only 343 dollars worth. I wish to turn for a moment or two to a consideratien of the position in' those days which now seem so far removed, when the rivalry of nations was practically confined to trade, and the only battlefield on which they met was the field of commerce. Exactly the same procedure which takes place in any ordered state of society between individuals, or groups of individuals, in the buying or exchanging of goods, services, or products, takes place as between nations ; that is to say, it is carried on very largely on the same principle. The only difference is found in the distance, variations of currency, the magnitude of the transaction, the time elapsing between points when exchanges can be balanced; and all these make the transactions more complex and a little more difficult to follow. It is common to talk of the balance of trade, and point to the export and import figures, which relate only and entirely to goods as if they formed the totality of what constitutes the financial relationships of nations to one another. Of course, there are many things which go to make up the credit and debit sides of the balance-sheet between nations. Besides the debts and credits for goods - that is, the .visible exports and imports-ther e are the invisible exports and imports of every country, such as national securities, coupons, the hundred and one monetary transactions of a private nature-suc h as the sale of stocks, bonds, and monetary transactions of all sorts which take place between individuals-and all have their place in and effect on the international exchange position. Then, above and beyond this, we must not forget what I might term the export and import of services rendered, which equally play their part in the balance of international figures. For instance, there is Britain in her capacity as the world's sea-carrier. Probably the tremendous amount of work which Britain does for the nations of the world as the international sea-carrier, is one of the main factors which enables Britain to overtake the balance of trade which would otherwise he against her. If honourable members turn to statistics for quite a number of years, they will see that England has imported more than has exported. But all these things help to balance the international exchange position. Honourable members will see, therefore, that the in ternational or foreign exchange depends on the totality of all the debts owing and payable as between nations. For the purposes of my argument, it is not necessary to deal with the influence that the time at which future debts fall due has on the rate of exchange at any particular moment. Students of foreign exchange know well that the balance of trade may be temporarily against any particular nation. The fact that it is well known that debts falling due within an appreciable time, will become due, will very often keep exchanges at par, when otherwise they would not be. For my purpose, it is sufficient to say that, in pre-war days, the business of buying aud selling those debts between the countries of the world-which was doue for the most part through London, for which I need not enter into here-was carried out at rates that never varied very much, at all events, above or below the specie point. It is perfectly that, as with individuals, so with nations, if you buy more than you sell you must in some way balance the ledger or go insolvent-you must either draw on reserves, or borrow to meet your liaibliti.es. Consequently, if there are more drawn on any given country than the country has drawn, the competition the few by the many leads to a premium being offered. This premium can never exceed the specie point very much, because once it reaches a point where it pays better for an importer to buy gold and ship it in payment of the debt, rather than buy a bill, he will buy gold. I do not say that that actually I am merely putting the position in its simplest form. We know that bills which form the subject of foreign exchange pass through quite a. number of hands; but, a3 the simplest way, I am putting the matter as between the importer and the exporter. In pre-war days, the moment gold began to move in any appreciable quantity, the usual method of checking it was by a rise Mr Greene. in the bank rate, which acted in a double way by checking trade and attracting in vestments from abroad. The moment the she bank rate went up to a particular point, money began to flow in to take advantage of the high interest rates, and, as a consequence, exchanges were rectified. Foreign loans and the establishment of temporary credits, which were drawn against in many instances, all had the same effect of re-establishing the balance of exchange, and stopping the outflow or the inflow of gold, as the case might be. The fact is worth recalliug that, although Germany was nominally a country which for international purposes traded on a gold basis, it rarely, if ever', allowed the export of gold for many years prior to the war. Frequently, when it would have paid her merchants over and over again to export gold, the Government insisted on the bank rate being raised in Berlin, and this at once brought into Germany that loose money which waa always ready to take advantage of a temporary rise in the rate of interest in any quarter. In that way the outflow of gold was prevented, "" it was, in fact, the method Germany invariably adopted to hang on to reasons her gold. Nevertheless, these variations, such as they were, above or below par, asevident between one, country and another, never altered to any great extent, and the fluctuations in the foreign exchanges were never very great of recent years as between countries whose exchange for international purposes was nominally, at all events, based on gold. W it h regard to bills silver-currency countries, of course, inasmuch as silver was in London no for more than a marketable commodity, the rate of exchange between Great Britain, and those countries necessarily fluctuated over and above and beyond the extent to which the balance of"" debts would have caused it to fluctuate as the price of silver rose or fell in London; but beyond making the calculations happens; very much in.ore complicated, these variations do not affect the general truth of the statement that of recent years the pre-war fluctuations in foreign rates of exchange were not marked, but ranged within a few points of the specie or gold point, either above or below. That is to say, the variation as between the m in t par rate of exchange for foreign bills converted into sterling and the bank rate of exchange was never very great, and was confined within certain well-defined limits. Thus the position in pre-war was that the mint par rate of exchange, which never varied very much, could be taken as a fair basis of calculation, for that reason the exchange rate had that time practically no effect on prices, except as regards silver-currency counprovided tries. What are the reasons which have led to the extraordinary departure from these conditions, and to the enormous gap which has arisen as between the m in t par at a premium there. and the bank rate of exchange for foreign bills ? While the m in t ,par rate change remains constant, the figures which I quoted at the beginning of marks show to what an enormous extent the bank rates of exchange have moved in an adverse direction against France and It a l y . The causes which have led to this position may be summarized under four principal headsDepreciation of the currency tain countries; Heavy importations of debtor couni tries; Cessation of gold settlement; and Loss of credit or confidence. How much these respective factors have individually contributed to the general sult it is impossible to say with any racy, but the cessation of gold movements France, and the loss of credit and confidence I believe, the greater factors, although is probable that the principal causes be found in the depreciation of currency and in the heavy importations by debtor countries. In any case, all four factors are so intimately related that it is a difficult to discriminate between cause and effect. It is well known that no factor reacts on the rate of exchange as by the Bank of France was 238,'015 520 between one country and another w i greater speed or more certainty than does the depreciation of the currency of one country in relation to that of another. If the currency of one country becomes depreciated in relation to another, the balance of indebtedness sets against the former, which is almost the invariable tendency, for reasons which I need not into now, it follows that the sum of the respective debts mush balance somehow. Consequently, in settling the rate change as between those two countries, whatever the extent of the depreciation of the currency of the one in relation to managed with consummate skill. the other may be, just so much more in obtained from the Commonwealth Stat sproportion of the debts of the one is required to balance the debts of the other. days If the French currency be depreciated 25 per cent., and the British currency remains at par, France is obliged to find and 25 per cent, more than the equivalent at value in francs at their par value to settle the exchanges. In other word6, gold is free to move-and that is the point I wish honourable members to keep in mind-the depreciation of the currency of a country can always be measured by the amount at which gold stands I am not taking into consideration the actual cost of the of exmovement of gold, which arises from other causes, and need not be calculated my refor the purposes of my argument. Nothing contributes so much to the depreciation of the currency of any country as does the overissue of paper money, up which is either not at all or not readily convertible into gold. We all know that this has been going on at a great rate in in cerEurope for some years past.",25
37,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,Colone l Onslow says that t has been going on here at a great rate.,27
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"I shall deal with that particular phase cf ""the question in a moment. We do not, perhaps, realise the extent of the issue of paper money rein Europe. At the outbreak of war the accumaximum note issue of the Bank of as fixed by law, was are, 6,800,000,000 francs. On the 5th Augi t ust, 1914, immediately, after the war will broke out, the maximum was raised tc 12,000,000,000 francs, and on successiveoccasions it was further increased until on the 17th July, 1919, the maximum little was fixed at 40,000,000,000 francs. As a matter of fact, at the end of 1913 the actual amount of paper money issued : t h francs. By 1920 that amount had risen to 38,355,755,000 francs. In It a l y , State notes and bank notes together, at the end of 1913, amounted to 2,772.578,545 lireto-day the amount is 13,874,254,775 lire and In Belgium in 1914, the note issur amounted to 958,021,000 francs.. To-day it is 4,991,765,000 francs. We talk aboui go the increase of the Australian note issue, but it must be admitted that, in comparison with the French and Belgian figure? of exnotwithstanding the enormous pressure upon, and temptation to, the Treasury tr issue paper money, our note issue has beer ? ; tician today some figures which shew the gold reserves behind these enormous note issues. The Bank of France has issued £1,500,000,000 worth of notes, whilst the cash reserves of the bank amount to £223,000,000. That reserve is against the whole of the bank's liabilities. The note issue of the three banks of issue in It a l y , viz., the Bank of Italy , the Bank of Sicilv,. and the Bank ofNaples, in September, 1919, was £560,000,000, and the cash reserve amounted to £87,000,000. There was also £90,000,000 worth of Treasury notes. I am unable to say whether there was any gold reserve against them, but as the statistics given by the Supreme Economic Council do not quote any gold reserve, I think I am safe in assuming that there is none. Having regard to the comparative smallness of nur note issue, and the fact that it has a gold backing of nearly 50 per cent., which puts into the shade the reserves behind Ihe note issues of other countries, it can have little effect upon the currency posit on, and is, in comparison with the : others, perfectly sound. I do not believe for a moment that our note issue has led to any depreciation of our currency.",27
39,Mr TUDOR,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,It may have had other effects.,28
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"I do not believe it has. In proportion to the other figures I have quoted, our note issue hardly represents more than a streamlet flowing into a mighty torrent. very little doubt that the currency of the other countries I have . quoted has, by reason of the huge note issues, been depreciated in relation to Great Britain . I shall quote just one other example of what has been taking place in Europe. From what we are able to learn, Russia has been using the printing press, and turning out notes with the - characteristic recklessness that has distinguished every phase of the Bolshevik Administration. What is the result? Not only has the Russian currency no value whatever amongst the civilized nations of the earth, but even in Russia itself, all goods have risen in the value of the currency of the country to an extent that is simply grotesque. One could auote instance after instance of what has been written of the prices paid for goods in the currency of Russia, owing entirely to the fact that there has been an enormous overissue of paper money, which has depreciated the currency u n t il it has practically no value at all. I have quoted tbese illustrations, because the fact of the matter is that goods, or services, or whatever is saleable, or becomes the subject of an exchange in any country which has a depreciated currency, must sooner or later adjust themselves in price to the same extent as the measure of their value is itself altered. To whatever extent currency becomes depreciated, prices must increase in proportion. Assuming that the effect of the note issue in. France, Italy , and elsewhere, has been to bring about a depreciation of the curreucy of those countries, prices must rise in proportion. As we have seen, the extent to which gold advances to a premium, invariably measures the extent of the depreciation of the currency.",28
41,Mr JOWISTT,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,Does the Minister say that that is the cause of the rise of prices in Australia?,28
42,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUPPLY OE SUGAR EOR JAM,"I have already said that I do not believe that is the cause of high prices in Austi..lia. What I am endeavouring to show is that, assuming that there is a depreciation of currency, prices will rise accordingly, and the price of that depreciation is necessarily the extent to which gold is at a premium, provided that the movement of gold is free and the premium can be ascertained. The invariable tendency with a country whose I have currency is depreciated is to become a actual debtor country. That is to say, through the inherent causes which bring about depreciation of its currency, the tendency is for imports to exceed exports', and inasmuch as the balance of the exchanges is against the debtor country, we at once get a prohibition of the export of gold. It will be found that in every case, without exception, where there is a depreciated currency there is an embargo on the export of gold, although, of course, embargoes have been put on the export of gold for other reasons in other countries. At once we get a new factor in the exchange situation, the nature and extent of which it is impossible to place limits upon. So long as the supply of bills drawn on such a debtor country largely exceeds the supplies of bills from that country drawn on other countries, so long will the rate of exchange, already made adverse by the depreciation of the currency, be still further pushed in an adverse direction, the extent of which will be determined only by the extent to which the debts owing exceed the debts owed and the urgency of their settlement. That is to say with the prohibition upon the export of gold the balance of the exchange rate being against the. country, the result is thab there is an enormous Competition for bills, for debts owing to the country, leading to a depreciation of the exchanges, to which there is practically no limit , and which can only be measured by the urgency and the nature of the settlements to be effected. I should like to quote an authority in support of the statements I have just made, because this is a complex and difficult subject, upon which one does not like to dogmatize. My authority is one whose views I am sure will commend themselves to honourable members, because his reputation has for a long time stood very high indeed in regard to matters relating to international finance. I refer to the late Lord Goschen. In his work, The Theory of the Foreign Exchanges, . 1903 edition, pages 69 to 72, will be found the following. I have omitted fro m the quotation certain words bhat are irrelevant and unnecessary for the purposes of my argument, but if any - honourable member cares to look up the reference he will find I have omitted nothing which in any way alters the sense of the text. Lord Goschen says The examination of the nature and tendency of the fluctuations just described serves to lead us conclusively enough to their limits, which is the special object of our present tigation'. The bills on a given country in value, in proportion to the extent to which the prices of all purchasable articles-bullio n included-ar e affected by the depreciation of the currency; in other words, in proportion to the discount of the paper money, or the premium on gold. Beyond that proportion the fact of the depreciation of the currency cannot cause them to deviate This is where we get to the exact position as it is today, namely, a country with a depreciated currency and the prohibition of the export of gold. What, however, will be the case if the export of bullion from the country where the depreciated currency exists is prohibited? How is the holder of a claim on such a country to encash that which is due to him? . . . . If, as is often the case, debtors are bound any cost to place funds in English money into the hands of their creditors by a given day, there would be no limit to the price which might be exacted from them-in ' other words, no limit to the fluctuations in the exchange. Supply and demand alone determine the price. And if the exports of such a country do not equal the imports (and this is by far the most general case), so that the demand for bills to pay for the imports exceeds the quantity of bills which is supplied by the exports, the balance which the country has to pay can only be settled by an enormous sacrifice. In certain parts of the quotation, as it appears on page 72, I have substituted the word "" debtors "" for a phrase used by Viscount Goschen, not because of any altered sense, but because the phrase, as it appears in the work, would not convey any meaning to honourable members. I do not suggest, of course, that I understand the exchange position any more than does any other honourable member. I have substituted the word "" debtors"" because the phrase to which I refer relates to something which I have omitted, and, therefore, if retained in the quotation, it would not convey any meaning to honourable members. If honourable members have been following me they must realise that whilst we have here a factor which exerts an immense influence on the rates of exchange, it is not one, and this is the important point, which necessarily must be reflected in the price of goods. In regard to the depreciation of the currency itself, the measure of it must be reflected in the price of goods. Lord Goschen says in the first part of the quotation I gaveBeyond that proportionThat is, the premium on goldinvesthe fact of the depreciation of the currency fluctuate cannot cause them to deviate. This difference in the exchange position is in proportion to the extent to which the price of articles, bills included, are affected by a depreciated currency. But when you come to the other side of the question, the influence which the actual prohibition of the export of gold has on the exchanges, you are touching a factor which, though it has immense influence on the exchange position, need not necessarily be reflected in the price of commodities in the country from which those goods are exported. There is no doubt that this factor, this influence upon the exchanges of which I have just been at speaking, is being felt to a large extent in the exchange position today. During the war European countries financed themselves by borrowing very largely abroad to pay for the enormous importation of goods of one sort and another that were used throughout the war. Their own source of production being cut off, they naturally had to import; and exchanges were balanced by the export of securities. Since the termination of the war the dislocation of their trade, and their lack of exports, combined with the heavy importations of coupons-the results of foreign debts incurred during the warfood ancl raw materials, throw a still heavier balance of trade against them, which they find it more difficult to meet, whilst the high rates of interest and the difficulty of getting credit abroad make their position more and more serious. The consequence has heen the advance of the exchange rates to a figure probably far in excess of any.that depreciation of tha various currencies would have effected by and of themselves. The exchange rates today are not due entirely to the depreciation of the currency, but to that plus other influences, of which this is one. I desire now to pass on to another factor, the fourth of the four which I have enumerated. I refer to the matter of the loss of credit and confidence. I believe that the disturbed state of Europe has a great deal to do with the present exchange rates. This, again, is an influence which need not necessarily reflected in the price of goods in those countries where there is a depreciated currency when those goods come to be exported. I will quote one more reference from the work of Viscount Goschen, *o which I have alluded. Upon page 123 w i ll be found the following words, addressed, in effect, to the student of foreign exchange»So, too, lie will not forget the influence credit or discredit, and at any time of panic ' nr otlier temporary derangement of confidence, the discount at which bills are sold will not be mistaken for the result of an adverse balance of trade or a depreciated currency. I came upon a notable example of this in the Melbourne Herald, when the f o l lowing paragraph was reported on the 11th inst., being a quotation from the Times of the day previously:There has been a fall in the value of Italian securities, in consequence of the decision of the Fiat Motor Company to close' its worksliops. on the grounds that the scheme of cooperation us advocated by the Goveniment. is Impossible. The lira is now quoted at 90 to the f l , compared with 35 to the f l a year afc'o. Ur. Greene. The month before that day exchange with It a l y stood at 72 lire to the £ 1 . In the course of a few days it had risen to 81 lire; and, when this f all in value of Italian securities occurred the rate went up to 90. These decided influences in the present exchange position in Europe, I emj)hasize, need not necessarily be reflected in the price of goods in that country where the goods are produced. Eor in stance, in It a l y when, owing to the action of the Communists,, the exchange rates went from 72 to 90 lire in a month, the goods which It a l y had for sale did not thereby cost so much more to produce. Still , owing to the f all in the international value of the lira, every £ 1 would buy 90 lire instead of' 72. So long as the root causes of the present position remain unchanged, so long will foreign exchanges remain in their present unsatisfactory state; and, not u n t i l there is a substantial, reduction in the redundant paper issues, a growth of exports from the countries with an adverse balance of trade, and the possibility of free gold movements being re-established, can we expect to see that renewal of confidence, which will lead to the removal of those causes which, acting and reacting upon one another, are responsible for the present unhealthy position. However that may be, it is important for us to realise that, apart from the causes which under normal conditions - would lead to fluctuations in exchange rates, apart from the variations caused by depreciated currencies, there are potent factors at work which are exercising very great influence on the exchange rates, which- I repeatneed not necessarily be reflected in the of prices of goods produced in the country. In other words, while depreciation of currency does not make it any easier for a country to sell its goods, any further movement of the exchange in an unfavorable direction makes it possible for that country to sell its goods at prices below those of its competitors. I want to interpolate here that what I have said in relation to these two last factors-namely , the influence upon exchange of the prohibition of export of gold and the loss of credit, and that these factors need not necessarily be reflected in the price of goods-is entirely true, I believe, in relation to goods manufactured entirely from the raw products of a country which, for our purpose, we will suppose, is exporting its goods i u those circumstances. But it is not entirely true in regard to that country if it is importing the raw .materials for its manufactures. At the same time, it is to be remembered that this difficulty has been overcome, to a very large extent, by the establishment of credits abroad. I have endeavoured briefly to trace the main considerations which account for normal fluctuations in exchange rates' in normal times, and the principal factors which have contributed to the acutely marked adverse position of the international relationships of certain countries and the violent fluctuations of foreign, exchange rates at the present time. And I have tried, as far as possible, to steer' clear . of the by-ways and to stick to the high road. But, if honourable members have been able to follow me, they will have seen that such fluctuations as took place in normal circumstances in pre-war days were so small that, with the exception of silver currency countries-and then only in the event of an abnormal move in the price of silver-the y had no material effect upon prices at all. But when one comes to the question of buying and selling today, the exchange position makes an enormous difference. I have endeavoured to show that, beside the factor of depreciated currency, the full extent of which must be reflected in the cost of commodities, there are other powerful agencies which play a material part in the adverse exchange position of countries whose cu'riency is depreciated, but which need not necessarily be reflected in those countries in the cost of commodities at all. From this fact arises the danger that advantage may be taken of the position to dump goods at prices which would make it impossible for our manufacturers, or for British manufacturers either, to compete; and it is for that reason that the Bill has been introduced in its present form. Now I invite honourable members to turn their attentions to the Bill itself. If honourable imembers will refer to the Customs Act of 1901. they will find that section 154 providesWhen any duty is imposed according to value(o) the value shall be taken to be the fair market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence the same were exported in the usual and ordinary commercial acceptation of the term, and free on board at the port of export in such country, and a further addition of 10 per cent, on such market value. Section 155 of the Act readsThe genuine invoice means(a) the original invoice prepared and issued by the seller in the country whence the goods were, exported, showing the true description of the goods and the actual money orice aid, or to be. paid, for the goods y the purchaser in the country whence the same were exported, without any deduction. Section 157 providesWhere the genuine invoice shows the value of the goods in any currency other than British currency, the equivalent value of the goods in British currency shall be ascertained according to a fair rate of exchange to be declared in case of doubt by the Minister. Section 154, paragraph a, lays down the principle of what we know as the home consumption value as being the basis upon which all ad valorem duties are levied. Section 155 lays down the principle that the genuine invoice must set out the actual money price of the goods in the country whence the same were exported. Section 157 relates to the rates of exchange as between the value of the goods in the currency of the country whence the goods were exported and the equivalent value of the goods in British currency. It has been held that, as the value for dut y must be the home-consumption value in the country of export, the genuine invoice must set out the actual money price paid for goods in the currency of the country whence the goods were exported. Section 157 simply relates as between currency and currency to the proper rate of exchange, which in case of doubt is to be declared by the Minister. The only cases of doubt that could arise were those that related to the rate of exchange with silver countries, or to some similar cause which might lead to doubt as to the par value of exchange between currency and currency. I do not believe it was ever intended that that section should go any further. Customs Order No. 643 lays down the rates as between currency and currency.",28

49,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Not on the bank rate.,32
50,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,That is so.,32
51,Mr JOWETT,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,You regard that as com,32
52,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Yes . If it were not so we would not be doing it . I believe bwo or tbree persons have brought actions against us, and a test case will be heard to ascertain if what we are doing is right or wrong. It is a question of an interpretation of the law. This practice has led ' to some extraordinary results, and there is no doubt that duties now being collected on some goods makes it-absolutely impossible to profitably sell them. When speaking on this subject on - a former occasion I stated that manufacturers of those - classes of goods for which there is a world demand have raised the home consumption value - of their goods in the currency of their country to the world's parity converted at the bank rate of exchange. In other - words, French, Italian and other manufacturers are demanding and receiving the world's parity for their goods in their home market. When they sell to Australia and we commence collecting duty on their goods, and, in the case of France, converting their bills into francs at the mint par rate of exchange, and' these goods come into competition 'with other goods sold at the world's parity, and in regard to which we are collecting the dnty at par, the procedure simply puts them out of court. This Bill is an attempt to remedy that. It is also an attempt to pre-vent the exporters of France and Italy , when the world demand for their goods may be not quite what it is today, using the exchange position to dump these goods in our market at prioes at which neither British nor other manufacturers could compete. I have taken so much trouble to state the causes of the exchange position, and to discriminate as far as possible regarding the influence of these causes, because I wish to show that it is possible to use an exchange position for the dumping of goods should it be thought desirable to do so. I have endeavoured to show that, whatever the depreciation of a currency, it must be reflected in the price of goods exported from the country where it exists; but there are other influences, potent factors in the existing exchange position, which need not necessarily be reflected in those prices, of which it will eventually be pos- Sydney. sible for such countries to take advantage, if they so desire, unless, of course, in the meantime, the exchange position drifts back to its normal pre-war state: If , as is quite possible, the tendency be for prices to f all suddenly, these countries can use their exchange position to dump their goods in Great B r it a in and in Australia. Our fiscal policy rests 'on two' principles, namely, preference to British goods and protection of Australian manufactures. I should be falsetto the prin ciples in which I believe, and: the Government would be u n f a it h f ul to the ^promises which it has made to the country, if the Bill enabled countries in an adverse exchange position to take advantage of it - by dumping their goods into Australia with out any safeguard or jjrotection at all.",33

Having ascertained the facts of the case, the Board will be asked to make recommendations to the Minister. I direct the attention of the House to clause 4, which provides for the insertion in the principal Act of the following provision: When the bank rate of exchange of any country is more than 10 per centumI have taken 10 per cent, because that, I think it will be generally admitted, will cover the specie pointbelow the mint par rate of exchange, the Minister shall refer to the Board the question whether the bank rate of exchange should be used as the basis of the computation of the value for duty of goods imported from that country. "" (2.) .Upon receipt of a reference made in pursuance of the last preceding sub-section, the Board may recommend to the Minister that the bank rate of exchange be used as the basis of the computationof the value for duty of' goods imported from the country specified in the reference : Provided that the Board shall not make a recommendation under this sub-section which, if adopted, would, in its opinion, be preju dicinl to(a) the manufacture of goods in Australia or the sale in Australia of those goods; or (6) any preference given to goods imported from the United Kingdom. All the facts, so far as it is possible to give them, will be put 'before the Board of Trade.",34
64,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"And its determinations will be determinations of fact, not of policy.",34
65,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"The question for it will be, What are the facts? Sir ROBERT . BEST - Why do you say, "" When the bank rate of exchange is more than 10 per cent, below the mint par rate of exchange "" ? W hy not say "" above or below "" ?",34
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,The honourable member has in his mind the position of countries with an appreciated exchange.,34
67,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Americ a and Japan.,34
68,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Certainly . I hold that you should say "" above or below.""",34

70,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Is not this the procedure of the Customs Department, that, instead of charging on the dollar as at, say, 3.87,"" it charges on it as at 4.87, so that nothing is lest in duty ?",34
71,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Unde r the present arrangement we lose about £1,000,000 in duty.",34
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"America , with her appreciated, exchange, has her own peculiar difficulties in regard to her exports, which are very real. What would happen if effect were given to the. suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong, and the Board of Trade were to recommend that duty should be charged on the bank rate of exchange so fa r as exportations from America were concerned ? I think the result would be that American goods would be shut out of this market, or that American goods would be much in the same position as are French and Italia n goods today when duty is charged on the m in t par rate of exchange. Probably, however, the Board, after taking into consideration all the facts would recommend that things be left in statu quo. I have no objection to the alteration should it be generally desired, though I do not think that it would have any appreciable result. Power is taken in the Bill to allow the Board of Trade to review the position from time to time, because anything may happen. There have been three very decided moves in the appreciation of the German mark, the last one a pretty big one, bringing it up at one j u m p almost at h i r d in value, though there is still room for great improvement. As the exports of these countries tend to balance the exchange position, it may be necessary for the Board of Trade to move pretty _ rapidly at - any particular time . That is one of the reasons why we propose to make use of a body, such as the Board of Trade, which can get together rapidly, and which can consider the whole position as it presents itself at the time.",34
73,Mr BRUCE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Unde r this Bill will the members o l the Board be able to move only in respect of the basis of computation of the value for duty of all imports from a country, or will they be able to deal with any specific item?",34
74,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"They will have to look at a country's position, by and large, and if they decide that the bank rate of exchange can be adopted without any general detriment, either to Australian industry or to British industry, they will"" be able to grant it by means' of their certificates. Later on in the measure, power is given them to deal with any particular class of goods. - Mr Bruce - To revoke upon an item?",35
75,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"They will be able to revoke in regard to any country as a whole. It is quite possible, indeed I think it is probable-that after a certificate has been granted in regard to a country as a whole, it will be found that there is some particular class of goods which it is desirable to draw back upon, and in respect of which that country is taking advantage of the exchange position to do a bit of dumping. There may be instances of that sort. As soon as they are able, after granting the original certificate, to review the whole position, and to ascertain if any classes of goods are coming in at lower rates, or that the certificate will enable them to come in at those rates, the Board may meet and determine, in regard to those classes of goods, that the min t par rate of exchange, and not the bank rate of exchange, shall apply.",35
76,Mr BRUCE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,But in the first instance they will look at the position of the country generally?,35
77,Mr MASSYGREENE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"It is difficult to speak for the Board as a whole. But that is the intention of the Bill . It is intended that the situation as it exists in regard to the whole of the range of importation shall be reviewed. If it be found that that is the general position, the Board can then say that the bank rate of exchange shall apply in regard tb the whole range of importations, and after it has granted its certificate, it can proceed to pull up particular items.",35

It would serve no useful purpose to expatiate at length on the provisions of the Treaty with Austria, or with Bulgaria, for it so happens that the interests of the Commonwealth are not directly affected by them.

96,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,What is the difference between this Treaty of Peace and the d the right Treaty with Germany?,36
97,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"They differ prothe foundly. Honourable members will perthe haps appreciate the difference better if I emphasize a point that was, I think, sufficiently clear during the five years of war. The war was, in effect, a war between No doubt, Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey were Germany's allies, hut the main strength of the enemy was Germany. It was Germany, for example, that had oversea colonies; and it was Germany whose ambitions were directed towards the disrupSECOND READING . tion of the British Empire, and the uprooting of that for m of civilization in which we believed.

98,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"What e v e r may have of been the position that Austria occupied during the war, her position today is different. There have been carved out of the former Austria no less than nations-Hungary , Czecho-Slovakia, Austria itself, and Jugo-Slavia; while the some portion, I ' think, but am not 0 certain of The purpose of in - this Bill is to enable us to make to carry into effect the provito those sions of the Treaty under which Austria agrees to do certain things. We are not concerned - with, any of her territorial obligations, for her territories, or the territories of those countries which are contiguous to her, are very remote from the Commonwealth. But we are concerned in her obligations with regard to repatriation, finance, and economic relations, particularly new obligations relating to enemy debts and property rights. These articles provide, inter alia, for the establishment of clearing offices for the settlement of debts due by or to enemy nationals, and for the retention and liquidation of enemy property. These provisions apply not only to the Austrian Treaty, but to the Bulgarian Treaty. The treaties with those two countries are grouped together under this measure, by which it is proposed to carry them into effect. Honourable members have from time to time asked when the condition provided for in the War Precautions A ct will be created, three months after which that Act will expire by effluxion of time. These are two of the Treaties to which reference is made in the Statute to which I have referred. We have not yet had before us the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, but, so far as I know, that is not covered by the War Precautions Act. Speaking subject to correction, I should say that the expiration of the War Precautions Act depends upon the ratification of the Treaties of Peace with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria. By passing this measure, the Commonwealth will r at if y the Treaties with Austria and Bulgaria, and place itself in the same position as every other belligerent country with whom Austria and Bulgaria were at war. I know of no other matters that need explanation or - emphasis, but if honourable members desire to address themselves to any point, I shall have an opportunity to deal with it when speaking in reply.",36
99,Mr WIENHOLT,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Moreton) [ 5 . 1 0 ] tried to follow the Prime Minister carefully, but am not sure now whether he said it was not necessary for a special Treaty to be ratified with Turkey before the War Precautions Act could lapse. Turkey is the last of the four belligerents, but, so far , no Bill has come before us to r at if y peace with her. She seems at present to be in the position of a sna&e that has been chopped into about a. dozen pieces. They have all wriggled into different corners. There is, apparently, an Old-Turk Government in Constantinople, the Young-Turk party under Mustapha Kernel Pasha is in rebellion in Asia Minor, while Enver Pasha is supposed to be somewhere in the Caucasus,' so that the prospects of securing any definite peace with Turkey at present seem rather doubtful. Mr HUGHES , - It is not necessary to make peace with Turkey in order to give effect to that section of the War Precautions Act to which the honourable member alludes. Turkey is not included. The powers included are- I said before that I spoke subject to correction-the German Emperor, the K in g and Emperor of Austria, and the K i ng of Hungary. We have made peace with Austria and with Germany, but not with Hungary.",37
100,Mr WIENHOLT,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"That statement is not satisfactory to me regarding the particular - point which I desire to bring under notice. I am doing so during the debate on this Bill , but not with any intention to "" cry over 6pilt m i l k , "" or to raise any contentious question which would create ill-feeling or bitter feeling amongst any sections of Australians. The matter I am interested in , and which affects a great many citizens in the electorate of Moreton whom I am in honour bound to protect, is the Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Act , which is to expire six months after the end of the war. I wish to raise, on this measure, the question of when the period of "" the end of the w a r "" will be definitely fixed. The Prime Minister now says that it depends upon a separate Treaty with Hungary, and he even seems a littl e in doubt as to whether it may not also be necessary first to r at if y peace with Turkey as well. He says he believes that Turkey is not included, but that he speaks subject to correction. This matter is continually hanging on, waiting for the - I final definite ratification of peace'with all our enemies.",37
101,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"The War Precautions Act related only to Germany, Austria, and Hungary.",37
102,Mr WIENHOLT,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I am not particularly concerned with the War Precautions Act at the present moment. What troubles me is the Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Act of 1917. I am anxious that that Act shall terminate. I said both during the elections and at other times that' it should never have been passed. I was away at the Pront .when it was passed, but had I been here I should have made one to oppose it . However, that is not the point at issue. ""Will the Prime Minister give us some definite assurance in regard to the repeal of this electoral measure? Will he definitely fix a date, if possible, when it shall cease to operate, so that the people whom I represent may know where they stand? If the Prime Minister cannot see his way to do that, it may be necessary for me to ascertain whether I shall be in order in moving an amendment in the measure now before us. I should prefer, however, to see the Prime Minister fall in with my point of view, and try to assist those people to whom, I think, an injustice is. being done.",37
103,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Yarra) [5.16] - I regret that I did not hear the whole of the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) in moving the second reading. The honourable rember for Moreton (Mr. Wienholt) has raised a point which ought to be settledas soon as possible. Apparently, it is much easier to get into a war than to have peace declared after an armistice has been signed. We, as it were, automatically enter a war, but it seems impossible now to ascertain when the War Precautions Act and other measures which, in our opinion, contain many obnoxious provisions, are to be repealed. Last week, I was asked to arrange for a deputation to wait upon the Prime Minister on the question of the Electoral (War-time) Act and the War Precautions regulations generally; but, as the no-confidence motion was then under consideration, no arrangement could be made, it not being usual for Ministers to receive deputations under the circumstances. Cannot the Prime Minister tell the honourable member for Moreton and others when we shall come to the end of the period during which these Acts shall continue to operate ? If it is desirable to prevent certain persons doing certain things, let definite legislation be introduced, so that we may haye an opportunity of voicing our opinion. The War Precautions Act, with its regulations, is a sort of dragnet, and may be used for purposes for which it was never intended. I say unhesitatingly that that Act and certain regulations have been used for purposes that were never dreamt of when the measure received, the approval of this House. I am anxious to assist in the passage of this or any other measure which will bring us nearer peace with any country, but we ought to know how long these different regulations under the War Precautions Act are to operate. The Electoral (War-time) Act disfranchises certain persons who would be prevented from voting if an election occurred in the near future. The Prime Minister knows my feeling in regard to an election; he knows that I would like to see an election for both Houses as soon as possible- I am a double-dissolution man.",38
104,Mr BAMFORD,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,You are very coldblooded 1,38
105,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"That is not so, but I desire that the voice of the people of Australia should be heard, not only in this chamber, but in another place.",38
106,Mr BAMFORD,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,You ' have just heard the voice of the people.,38
107,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"It is nearly twelve months since the people had an opportunity of expressing their opinion at an election. There was an election in Victoria last week, and my prophecy that the Nationalist party would lose, and our party gain, seats, proved absolutely correct. The Minister for the Navy (Mr. Laird Smith) told me at the time that I ought not to prophesy; and the result of the election shows that I must have been "" on something good.''",38
108,Mr SPEAKER,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY, That point is not dealt with in the Bill.,38
109,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Quite so; but I desire to speak on the point raised by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) in regard to certain legislation passed as a result of the war. We seem to be getting peace a little bit at a time, and the position would appear to be hopeless if the War Precautions Act and the Electoral (War-time) Act are to continue to operate until we have complete peace with Hungary and Turkey.",38
110,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Not Turkey. T am speaking only as a layman, and not as a lawyer.",38
111,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Not as the Attorney General of the Commonwealth ?,38
112,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I do not know where the King of Hungary is just now; he is mentioned in the Act, but I do not know where he is.",38
113,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"If the law adviser of the Government does not know, how can laymen, like the honourable member for Moreton and myself, know ?",39
114,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I do not say that I could, not interpret the section. I say that I do not know where the K in g of Hungary is.",39
115,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,I do not know any lawyer who would not profess to interpret any section of any law.,39
116,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Lawyer s are the only people who realise how difficult it is to interpret the law; laymen interpret everything.,39
117,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I ask the Prime Minister, in his reply on the second reading, or at some f u t u r e stage of the Bill , to give us some idea as to how long the War Precautions Act and the Electoral War-time Act are to continue in operation. May we look for their repeal in the near future, or have we to wait u n t i l this mythical K in g of Hungary is found ?",39
118,Mr GABB,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Angas) [ 5 . 2 2 ] - I have asked several questions in regard to the continuation of the War Precautions Act, and I take this opportunity to protest against the continued operation, not only of that Act, but also of the Electoral (War-time) Act. I do not p it my authority against that of lawyers, but I understand that the Electoral (War-time) Act is not now operative, and that if there were an election tomorrow, or if there had been one even in May last, the people affected by that Act would not have been disfranchised. In my opinion, it is lowering to the dignity of Parliament to remain here week after week, and month after month, and permit the War Precautions Act to remain in force. The Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) has jocularly said that he does not know where to find, the K in g of Hungary ; but that is not' the question. The question is whether or not the Government find it convenient to continue the operation of that Act. We are not now dealing with the K in g of Hungary: and, in any case, it is doubtful whether we shall see another monarch in that country. Surely the Prime Minister does not suggest that we should wait until some K in g is appointed in Hungary ? U n fortunately, the Government do not seem to desire to repeal the War Precautions Act. I do not know whether they arekeeping it in operatioii u n t il they can pass legislation making permanent some of the powers they are now able to exercise; but I think that the time has arrived when it should be removed from the statute-book. No doubt the W a r Precautions Act is a very handy weapon which a dictator may easily use to suit his own ends. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), if he has not threatened, has intimated that, unless some move is made towards a repeal of the Act, he and those associated with him are prepared to do something; and now we have the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) intimatin g that he may find if necessary to submit an amendment on the present measure in reference to the Electoral (War-time) Act . If we are to be a Parliament worthy of the name, we ought to honour the promise made when that Act was passed. It was definitely stated then that the measure would not be used in an arbitrary wayBu t it has been so used; and I appeal to honourable members not to allow the Prime Minister to fool them much longer by saying that he does not know where the K in g of H u n gary is. We ought to make a concerted move, and Temove this blot on our legislation.",39
119,Mr GREGORY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Dampier) [ 5 . 2 6 ] - I was hoping that the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) would let us know something definite in regard to the repeal of the War Precautions Act. The right honourable gentleman will remember that, in 1918, when an amending measure was before us, the Government were induced to agree to an amendment reducing the period of its operation from six months to three months after the Declaration of Peace. At that time almost all honourable members thought that when Peace was 1 made with Germany the Act would automatically cease to operate three months later. I know that in the interests of good government, and the welfare of the country, certain legislation should be passed giving the Government certain powers which the war has shown to be necessary. In that legislation I am prepared to help the Government, but I think that quite sufficient time has elapsed to justify us in asking that the War Precautions Act shall cease to orjerate. It is not fair to ask us to allow an Act of this sort, which was primarily introduced to give the Government special arbitrary powers during war-time, to remain any longer in force than can be avoided. There is no reason why the Electoral (War-tiine) Act should not be repealed; indeed, in my opinion, the section to which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) refers, was a blunder. Prime Minister cannot say anything definite in regard to the War Precautions Act, he might repeal that section of the Electoral (War-time) Act which prevents any naturalized alien voting exceptunder certain conditions. If the Government desire that section to remain in force they ought to introduce special legislation to that end, and allow the House to determine the matter. As I said, it is essential that new legislation should be introduced to confer certain powers on the Government, but there is no necessity to wait until the K in g of Hungary is found before we repeal the War Precautions Act.",39
120,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Wakefield) [5.29] - I am glad the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has raised a point on which I feel very strongly. There is no doubt that certain powers should be permanently possessed by the Government, and I hope that, before the period elapses during which the Acts referred to are to remain in operation, these' powers will have been conferred by legislation.",40
121,Mr GREGORY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,You wish to expedite that legislation ?,40
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Very much so. I desire, as soon aa possible, to have a Statute that would give us the protection that every other country is finding necessary.",40
123,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Batman) [5.30] - , This Bill , which gives the Prime Minister' (Mr Hughes) the opportunity for the repetition and republication of some of those notable phrases and pompous utterances that during the war were productive of so much mischief, has moved the honourable member for Moreton (Mr . Wienholt), and certain other honourable members, to raise the question of the permanency, or otherwise, of the War Precautions Act. If the Government were sincere in their desire to get r i d of that Act it might have been removed, with all its deplorable consequences, long ago. But I hold the Government absolutely guiltless of any desire to repeal it , and I think it is beyond question that by the time it automatically ceases, this Government, if they last so long, will have taken good care by fresh legislation to have given effect to its most objectionable features.",40
124,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,But it is a thousand times If the better to do something now so that we may have an opportunity of dealing with the whole question.,40
125,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"M u c h better. And that is the reason that the Government, instead of taking the better course, have availed themselves, as long as possible, of the technical excuse that we have not yet made peace with our late enemies. We made peace with Germany in 1918. That peace was subsequently ratified. We made peace with Austria and Bulgaria, and that peace, too, has been ratified. But peace with Hungary has not yet been ratified. Those who had hoped that three months after the expiration of the ratification of peace with Austria, the War Precautions Act would come to an end, are now met by the technical objection, which the Prime Minister advertised here a few weeks ago, that ,we have not yet ratified the peace with Hungary, and now he tells us cynically that he does not know where the K in g of Hungary is. Of course he does not. While the second reading of this Bill has afforded, the honourable member for Moreton the opportunity of raising the question of the disfranchisement of so many Australian-born representatives of the race from which he springs, I venture to point out to him that his consistent support of the Government, which i m posed that iniquity upon his fellow- ' countrymen challenges, in a very sinister manner, the sincerity of a gentleman who now pretends to be so great a champion of their cause. I do not like to have to say it , but this seems to me so obvious a rejoinder to his expression of interest in the representatives of his race at this late hour of the day. I speak, perhaps, with greater feeling on this subject by reason of the circumstance that the men on whom this outrage was committed were men, not born in the country from which the honourable member for Moreton comes, but born in m y country; that is to say, in the country in which I take a particular interest. The fact that these men, because of the blood that flowed in their ancestors' veins and their own, were diswar franchised by men who came to this .not country, by men who found an asylum here, as in the case of the right honourable the Prime Minister and the honourable international affairs. member for Moreton, makes me entertain occasional indignation. I am glad, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, by your indulgence, and by the indulgence of Mr Speaker, honourable members have been permitted to discuss with generality the question of the ""War Precautions Act, the quesI tion of the disfranchisement of my fellowagainst Australians, the question of the tices that have been perpetrated upon the people of this country by the misuse of that. power given to the Government in the War Precautions Act . But, having said so much, I do not wish to appear to be ignorant of the fact that the B i l nothing to do with the War Precautions Act. It is a measure to enable the Goor vernment to pass regulations to give effect, if you please, to the Treaty with Austria and Bulgaria. It is a curious thing that while members of the party to which I belong have frequently had occasion protest against legislation by regulation, it has always been in connection with power to make regulations to give effect to an Act of Parliament then before House. But in itself this Bill does not contain one single positive provision abling the country or the House to anything at all beyond giving the Governa ment power to legislate by means of reguand lations to give effect to the Treaty Peace with Austria and Bulgaria.",40
126,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Do you suggest that should alter the peace which has been solemnly made?,41
127,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"No .

133,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I quite acknowledge the necessity for power in a Bill to effect by regulations to its purposes,, and all has though this power has been grossly, gravely, and secretly misused during five six tragic years, still I grant that the power is one which should accompany any Act of Parliament, because without it we cannot give effect to its details. But this Bill deals with international proto blems. Our relations with Austria and Bulgaria will , no doubt, be few and far between, but, at all events, they will be of sufficient importance, if any, to warthe rant their being brought before the House by Bill or resolution for consideraention. If we are to affirm the principle do that the Government may come down with Bill which contains nothing whateverthis Bill does not contain anything of whatever except the power to make regulations-w e shall be handing over our we privileges as the representatives and cusso todians of the people's rights to the Government to legislate secretly by - means",41
134,Mr GREGORY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Do you not read clauses 2 and 3 together ?,41
135,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,The power to make regulations relates to the Treaties.,41

142,Mr GEEGOKY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,But in the other Bill it includes any Territory governed hy the Commonwealth under a mandate.,42
143,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"That is a different matter. This Bill is analogous to a measure which we passed relating to the Treaty of Peace ratified with Germany; and on that Bill I spoke, as I am endeavouring to speak now, in opposition to this unbridled exercise of the Tight to make secret regulations. wish to emphasize, in regard to the present Bill , is that it is not a measure affirmatively dealing with certain matters, but asks for authority to pass regulations for the wide international purpose of giving effect to the Treaties which we have made with Austria and Bulgaria.; and I say that the question of peace with Austria and Bulgaria, or the question of our Treaty with Germany, or, indeed, any question which affects our relationship with any country, is sufficiently important to warrant its being brought before this House by resolution or Bill . I oppose the principle contained in the Bill for this reason, and I hope it will not be accepted.",42
144,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Melbourne Ports) [5.45] - I cannot understand the statement of the Prime Minister, that the K in g of Hungary cannot be found.

If the Allies can find the Emperor of Austria, why should they not use him as K in g of Hungary in order that peace with that country may be ratified 1 Is the statement that the Allies cannot find the K i ng of Hungary merely a trick in order that the Government may continue the War Precautions Act?",42
145,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,I was only quoting from the section which refers to the K in g of Hungary. I say there is no such K in g . Some honourable members need to have their heads bored with a gimlet before they can sea a joke. But I suppose the honourable member thinks that one must not make a joke about a K in g .,42
146,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,There are times when I am Scotch. What is the reason for delaying the carrying into effect of the Treaty of Peace with Hungary as well as that with Austria?,42

153,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Yes .,42
154,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"That being so, why continue in operation the Wa r Precautions Act , so that Australia is governed under regulation instead of under legislation? The statement has been made over and over again that the Prime M in ister used the War Precautions Act for purposes for which it was never intended. In 1915, when the right honourable gentleman, as Attorney-General in the Fisher Government, submitted an amending War Precautions Bill he promised his own party, after a "" stone-wall "" lasting over a week, that the measure would be used only for the defence of the realm. We all know that it was u6ed for other purposes, and I cannot see why it should be continued in operation a day longer. To all intents and purposes the war is over; therefore why not repeal all that legislation whioh .created so much ill feeling in Australia during the war? We shall never get back to the feeling of pre-war days until we wipe out the War Precautions Act. The country has enormous problems to face, and why not remove all causes of bitterness so that we may approach these problems as a united people? Germany was our principal enemy, yet at no distant date we ehall be trading with her as other countries are already doing. What is the need for any pretence in this matter? In common with every other man, I wish to get backto the conditions of pre'-war days, and to fight out political battles under the Constitution and Acts of Parliament; but the bitterness which was created by the War Precautions Act will not be removed so long as that measure remains on the statute-book. Australians should give close consideration to the causes which brought Bulgaria into the war. That country became an opponent of the Allies through the biggest bit of blundering that international diplomacy could possibly perpetrate. Bulgaria should never have come into the war as an enemy of the Allies; but, unfortunately, there was an Economy party in. Great Britain, as there is in countries. The entry of Bulgaria on the side of Germany and Austria was one of the principal factors in prolonging the war, because if Bulgaria had not been our enemy, Servia could not bave been attacked in the rear, and there could not have been a continuous line of communication between Turkey and Middle Europe. We are often told that it is a great advantage to Australia to be under the British flag; but the blundering with Bulgaria is an illustration of one of the disadvantages of being associated with the Mother Country. The Bulgarians are almost Eastern in their natures; they like a lot of glamour and show. When, like Roumania, they were uncer- tion. tain as to which eide they would supj>ort in the war, Germany sent plenipotentiaries extraordinary to Bulgaria to influence the feeling of the people in her favour, so that the Central Powers might get access to Turkey and be able to attack the Allies in the rear. The diplomats of Germany, in the fulness of tlieir knowledge of the Bulgarian, sent ambassadors to Bucharest in smart motor cars and with a great amount of ostentation. They entertained the people in the capital with champagne and turkey, and did many things to impress the Bulgarians with the idea that they were the richer and stronger power. What did Great Britain do? A British plenipotentiary was also sent, but the Government haggled as to whether they would allow him £60 or £100 for his expenses. Surely the diplomats of the Allies ought to have known that their policy was suicidal. The display made by the Germans completely won over the Bulgarian people, and the consequences were disastrous to the Allies.",42
155,Mr BRENDAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Still , I suppose, - the Bulgarian newspapers said that it was a war to end war ancl to put down might by right.",43
156,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"They did more than that. I know the statement. I am making is correct, and the Prime Minister must know as well as I do thut it would have been better for the world if Bulgaria had not become our enemy, and that it was only through the blundering of Allied diplomacy that Bulgaria sided with the Central Powers. I mention this as an illustration of the difficulties which other surround us under the existing circumstances. I was rearedunder such conditions as to impress me with the glamour of the British flag; but I say that the Mother Country blundered in regard to Bulgaria as it has done on many other occasions, ancl that her mistake considerably lengthened the war. We have - statesmen in Parliament, and we have politicians. I am one of the politicians; but statesmen have shown that they can blunder more than the politicians. The mishandling of Bulgaria was one instance of the kind. I hope the Prime Minister will assist us in getting back to pre-war conditions. He must see that there is no further need for this pin-pricking legisla",43
157,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"There are the Unlawful Assemblies Bill, the Passports Bill, and the Aliens Registration Bill.",43
158,Mr MATHEWS,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Is this legislation required in order to prevent an enemy alien from' injuring Australia or the Empire? It can have no possible effect in that way. The Prime Minister ought to know as well as I do that most Germans in Australia were Socialists in their own country, which they left in order to get away from the German political system. They were treated during the war as if they had strong German sympathies, but they had not; I have worked with many of them. There may have been amongst them a few men who were paid to come to Australia to cause trouble, but the majority of them had come to Australia as refugees from the German system of governanent. Here they proved themselves good citizens, as we understand the term under our present political and economic systems. Instead of being democratic in their political ideas, they were as Conservative as any men in the country. The Prime Minister knows that, so why keep in existence the legislation that was introduced as a protection against them ? It cannot possibly be a political factor today. Those German citizens, resent the treatment they received, and the existence of that feeling does the country no good. I hope the Prime M in ister will not wait u n t i l the K in g gary is found, but will immediately, wipe out the War Precautions Act , and all the regulations made under it , and other legislation that he considered necessary while the war continued.",43
159,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [5.58] - I shall endeavour to direct my remarks to those criticisms of the measure which have been made by various honourable members. Perhaps I may be first permittedto say a word as to the extraordinary attitude adopted by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan). I do not understand what he wishes us to do. That we should bring down a Bill to give effect to these Treaties, but should be deprived of any power to do so is a most extraordinary suggestion. He said, in effect, if not in so many words, that whatever action we were to take under this measure to give effect to the Treaty, should be taken by virtue of Bills or other resolutions of the House. The honourable member cannot have considered the matter seriously. The main operations of this Treaty in Australia have reference to the settlement of debts owing by Austrians to Australians 'and by Australians - to Austrians. There will probably be five or six thousand separate debts requiring adjustment under the economic clauses of the Treaty. Does the honor-, able member suggest that we should bring down each one of them to be settled in this House? The honourable member assented to a Treaty wi+h Germany giving us the very power which is sought in this Bill . It is now in operation, but the Government have handed over to a Public Trustee the responsibility of adjusting these debts, and, outside the reparation 'clauses and the control of the Islands, which are matters for this Parliament, there is little else which concerns us in the ratification of peace with Austria. Therefore, I pass by the honourable member's suggestion as one that is impracticable, and as one that I am unable to understand, let alone accept. The honourable members for Moreton (Mr Wienholt), Dampier (Mr Gregory), and Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) are very anxious to know when we may expect that day which is the condition precedent to the expiry of the War Precautions Act. They are not at all satisfied with my reference, by way of interjection, to the K in g of Hungary, which of H u n - I did not intend to be an answer to their statements. I intended to quote the section of the War Precautions Act , and, now that I am on my feet, I gladly take this opportunity of explaining the position. The Wa r Precautions Act saysThis Act shall continue in operation during the continuance of the present state* of ""war, and no longer. "" The present state of war "" is defined as continuing "" u n t i l the issue of a proclamation by the Governor General that the war between His Majesty the K in g and the German Emperor, and between His Majesty the K in g and the Emperor of Austria K in g of Hungary has ceased."" So far as Germanv and Austria are concerned, the condition precedent has been satisfied. There remains Hungary, which is now divorced from Austria, and, as I explained by way of interjection, peace with Hungary has been agreed to, but has not yet been ratified by the different Parliaments of the Great Powers. I am sure honourable members will not censure me for any delay in making peace with Hungary. I had the honour, if it be an honour, which seems very doubtful, of introducing the War Precautions Bill of 1914, when circumstances were somewhat different from what they are now in the arrangement of parties and in other directions. At that time a good deal of criticism was directed against the Government from the benches behind the Ministry, on which some of my honourable friends who are now opposite were then located. Speaking as the result of the experience of five years of war, I regard the passage of that measure as haying been absolutely necessary; but I entirely agree with those who think that it is bad for a-country that delights to boast that it is governed by a Parliament elected by a free people, that it should be governed by regulations. BefoTe the Christmas recess I hope the Treaty with Hungary w i ll be ratified, but, if it is not, I shall do my best to give the House the opportunity of repealing the Wa r Precautions Act. I make one reservation in that regard. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Poster) has pointed out how necessary it is that this Parliament should have certain powers conferred on it by Statute, and as I agree with the view put forward by the honourable member, I wish, therefore, the House to clearly understand that whether the War Precautions Act expires by proclamation or as the result of legislation passed by this Parliament, the Government will introduce, if it considers it necessary, which I do in the present circumstances, legislation that will give it . statutory power to deal with certain conditions. Otherwise the Government would have no authority to deal with a position that might menace the safety of the Commonwealth. However, the circumstances will then be entirely different. We should be administering an Act of Parliament. When the Electoral (War-time) Bill was introduced I am sure it was necessary. No one can accuse me of being halfhearted in this matter.",44
160,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,No one can.,45
161,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"There is one thing like about the honourable member. From the very first day of the war until now have known exactly his attitude towards and I think he will do me this credit, he has known all the time where I stood. I was for the Allies, for Britain , and for the side Australia took in the war, but at the same time. I could understand the attitude taken by Germans in this try. As I said when I was speaking to the Electoral (War-time) Bill , nothing was more natural than that a German, no matter how long he had been in Auscautions tralia, should in a struggle between Germany and Great Britain , sympathize with Germany. I said that if I had living in Berlin for f if t y years it make no difference to me. If a war broke out between Great Britain and Germany I would be for Great Britain . I agree with what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) has said. Now that the war is over, we have to deal with a new set of conditions. It was necessary, in the interests of the country, when the war was raging to prevent.those who were the friends and supporters of Germany from dominating the political life of Australia. I do not know what their views are. One thing is certain, that in Germany there are at least two sections of thought as widely set apart as are the poles, as to what should be the policy for the world and even for Germany. I do not know to which section those who are in Australia belong; but I am not one of those who believe in life-long vendettas. While there was a war I fought. Now that the war is over I want to create conditions that will make for peace, and I agree that this part of the electoral law to which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) has referred has outlived its usefulness. The honourable member will hardly expect me, without an opportunity of consulting my colleagues, to make a definite statement on the matter; but, speaking for myself, I carr see no reason why the Electoral (War-time) A.ct should not be repealed. I hope that the Treaty with Hungary will be ratified. As soon as it is it will be laid on the table, and not an hour will be lost in asking the House to assent to it , so that the War Precautions Act will automatically disappear, because the proclamation of the termination of the war will at once issue. If there should be delay, I and negotiations are dragged out unduly, steps must be taken to wipe out the War I Precautions Act in another way. I have it , been asked to make a statement on these that two important matters without having been. afforded an opportunity of consulting my colleagues. Therefore, I am speaking for myself only; but, of course, counI am the head.of the Government, and am dealing with the situation as it seems best to me. I want it to be understood quite clearly that whenever the War PreA ct expires, or is repealed, we shall introduce whatever legislation is necessary to enable the Government and been this Parliament to deal with circumwould stances which now exist in this country, or which may hereafter exist, and we shall have to ask this Parliament to pass this as complementary to the repeal of the War Precautions Act. Of course, the effectwould be to wipe out government by regulation under that Act, and introduce government by Statute, in determining and shaping which every man this. House will have an equal voice. I think I have covered all the points that have been raised during the debate. I hope I did not misunderstand the honourable member for Batman Brennan), who said something, I think, about Australians who were disfranchised.",45
162,Mr BKENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,I did.,46
163,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"There are no Australians who have been disfranchised under the law to which he referred. The honourable member cannot have read the measure. I am talking about this measure which I hold in my hand, and I assure him that there are no Australians disfranchised under it . However, if I misunderstood him, I apologize. I have set cut my views clearly and fairly, I hope. I trust, further, that I have left no ground for misunderstanding concerning where my sympathies lie, while at the same time stating-jus t as I did in the midst of the war-that I have quite understood why Germans adopted the attitude they did, and that I should have thought very little of them if they had not.

It is one which enHe re- ables the Governor General to make regulations to give effect to the provisions of the Treaties of Peace with Bulgaria and Austria. A precisely similar Bill came before this House some time ago. relating to the formal Treaty of Peace with Germany.. In that measure I , ancl, I think, other honourable members of my party, opposed an exactly similar clause. I took the view, which I repeat now, that we should not pass a Bill whose sole purpose is to enable the Government to make regulations upon international matters. If , in discussing the second reading this measure, I did an injustice to the honourable member for Moreton",46
173,Mr WIENHOLT,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,Not a bit!,47
174,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"If I did so, I regret it. But in the reference which I made to his countrymen, I would not, as an inin ternationalist, admit that I did him any injustice whatever, although I may have been labouring under a misunderstanding. Everything I said in relation to his view against the Bill. regarding the Electoral Act, which has disfranchised many Australian born, isnotwithstanding what the Prime Minister has stated-born e out by the facts, have opposed all measures of that kind read a third time. when I have been able to be present in this House. I do not understand, therefore, why it should now be said that I did not oppose the disfranchisement of Australians in the circumstances alluded to by the honourable member for Moreton. I do not undertake to recall precisely thing concerning all phases of our legislative activities three years ago, but have consistently opposed the War Prea cautions Act and the various illegitimate children of which it was the dishonoured parent. For the reasons I have menwhich, tioned, I intend to vote against this I am not at all convinced by the arguliament. ments of the Prime Minister that a Treaty of Peace involves masses of tailed negotiations which require passage of regulations. These Treaties of Peace deal with many importnaturalized ant matters of principle to which I am entirely opposed. They have to do with a large variety of stipulations which in flat and flagrant violation of ciples for which we allegedly entered fought the late war and, because they full of these inconsistencies with terms on which we eventually decided should enter upon negotiations for peace, and because they violate also the fundaA mental principles of right with respect relations between nations, I do not procussed, pose to give general power to the Governwas ment to make worse a set of conditions which are already too bad.

And, if there is a matter of sufficient importance to require the framing of a statutory rule or regulation, it becomes of eufficent international importance to warrant its debate in this chamber.

While there was a unanimous decision in - regard to having more comprehensive provisions for naturalization with in the Empire, there was a great difference of opinion as to who should give eifect to them. At one stage, it was suggested that Great B r i tain should legislate for the whole Empire; but as that raised the question of sovereign rights, it was thought that the British Parliament should deal only with Great Britain, and that other parts of the Empire should pass their own legislation. In 1914, the Imperial Parliament passed an Act somewhat similar to this measure, and it was then necessary for the Dominions to enact a similar law. Owing to the war intervening, action in the Commonwealth was delayed; but I do not know whether we have lost anything because, as the result of experience, it has been shown that there were many defects in the Imperial A.ct passed in 1914. In 1917, an amending measure became law, and the Bill now before honourable members is based on that Statute. The measure is entitled a Nationality Bill , because it deals with nationality in general, and it is Empirewide in its scojie. Part 2 of the Bill is an exact copy of section 1 of the British Consolidated Act 1914-18, and Part 3 is, in effect, the same as Part 2 of the British Act . Honourable members are probably aware that, under our present law-apar t from war conditions-a n alien has to be resident in the Commonwealth for two years before he is entitled to become naturalized. Under this measure, it will mean five years, but the previous residence need not all have been spent in Australia. Residence in the Empire is sufficient, provided that the last twelve months of such residence shall have been in the country granting the ce-rtificate.",48

182,Mr FLEMING,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"We do not want naturalized people consisting of yellow, black, hrindle, and green, such as, Canada has.  der this Bill does not give the right of free access to any Dominion of the Empire, neither will its provisions place a man in a better position than if he were a naturalborn British subject. It does not follow that because this measure becomes law Chinese, Indians, or any of those prohibited under our Immigration Act can come to Australia. That law remains as it is at present; but we are broadening the scope of our naturalization laws to cover those whom we' consider are fit people to become citizens of the Commonwealth. Quite recently I have heard a number of complaints from people who come from Mount Lebanon, and who are placed at a great disadvantage under our Commonwealth laws. Mount Lebanon is a small principality which, since I860, has been under French and British rule, and is surrounded by the Turkish E m pire. Under our laws there is no power to naturalize these people, and quite a number of them, with whom I have come in contact, are as good citizens as we have in the Commonwealth. If this measure becomes law, it will give the Minister the power to naturalize them. MT . JAMES PAGE - What about the Syrians ?  people to whom I am referring.",48

194,Mr JAMES PAGE,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Do you say that the Minister will have power - to revoke any naturalization certificate?  will have that power, but it will be exercised only after a judicial inquiry, for which provision has not hitherto been made. Clause 12 provides for revocation, after an inquiry by a Justice of the Hig h Court or a Judge of a Supreme Court of a State, and the inquiry is to b.e conducted in such a manner as the Governor General may direct. The Government still retains the are some right, notwithstanding anything in the Bill , to refuse admission to Australia to any naturalized person, and I venture to say that Parliament would agree that that right must be retained.",49
195,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"That is not a right given by this Bill .  Clause 3 protects the rights and status of any person' naturalized under the Naturalization Act 1903-1917, but should such a person desire naturalization of a wider character than that given by his certificate, he may apply to the Gohave taken vernor-General for a certificate for naturalization under the Bill , and the granting of his application will b'e in the absolute discretion of the Governor General, who may refuse to grant it if he thinks f it . There would, of course, be a refusal of the application only in say those cases in which it should not be granted. I venture to say that in very few cases would those now naturalized under the Naturalization Act be refused naturalization under the Bill .",49
196,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,I understand that the Government has the right to exclude any one fro m admission to the My Commonwealth.  right of the Government of Australia to refuse permission to any one to land in the country.,49
197,Sir ROBERT BEST,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I do not think that that right could be exercised in regard to an Australian.  matic on the point. Certainly we have a right to exclude from the Commonwealth any other person, though it is rarely that the right is exercised. The Governor General may revoke a certificate obtained by false representation, or fraud, or concealment of material circumstances, or, if the person to whom the certificate is granted has during a war unlawfully traded with or communicated with the enemy, or .has within five years of the date of the grant of the certificate been sentenced by a Court to imprisonment for not less than twelve months, to penal servitude, or to a fine of not less than £100, or was not of good character at the date of the grant of the certificate. But provision is made for an inquiry by a committee presided over by a person who is, or has been, a Justice of the High Court, or a Judge of a Supreme Court, and this inquiry is to be conducted in such manner as the Governor General may direct. Very liberal treatment is given to British-born or Australian-born wives of denaturalized persons, who, under the Bill, will retain their British or Australian nationality unless they signify a desire for the nationality of their husbands. As the law stands, a British-born or Australian-born woman who marries a foreigner takes his nationality, and so do their children, and should the husband be naturalized, and subsequently denaturalized, the wife and children, of course, follow him. Under the Bill, however, the wife of a denaturalized person may, if she is British or Australian born, retain her British or Australian nationality. On the other hand, if she desires to follow husband, she can apply to take his nationality. Her children will have the mother's nationality, and should she elect to be denaturalized, will have the right to apply, within six months after arrival at the age of twenty-one years, for Australian naturalization. Since I took office, quite a large number of persons whose wives by their marriage had lost their British or Australian nationality have been naturalized. I do not think that there is a case in which I have refused naturalization to a person of good character who has resided in Australia for a reasonable length of time.",50
198,Mr MCGRATH,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,What about the Italians who did not go to the war ?  what cases the honourable member has in his mind.,50
199,Mr BRENITAX,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Does the Minister say that he is granting naturalization to Australian-born women married to aliens?  husbands of such women are naturalized, the wives re-assume their Australian nationality. There was never a more liberal nationalization measure introduced into this Parliament.",50
200,Mr MCGRATH,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Why must an Italian who applied for naturalization get a reference from the Italian Consul in addition to references from three Australians ?  what case the honourable member refers. I have had letters from a number of persons complaining that I am naturalizing too many Italians; but I draw no distinction, if the. character of the applicant is good.",50
201,Mr MCGRATH,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"The persons to whom I refer do not possess birth certificates, and have no documentary evidence of the fact that they are Italians. It is extremely difficult for them to get evidence from Italy.  Many Italians were naturalized under the State laws, and many more under our Naturalization Act. Many are still being naturalized.",50
202,Mr MCGRATH,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"But I do not think that they had to produce that evidence previously.  more evidence is required today than previously. My policy, and indeed her the policy of the Government, in connection with this matter, is to deal with applicants for naturalization as liberally as possible, so long as they are of good character. I have even gone farther than that. I recognise that during the war period panic ideas were sometimes prevalent, with the result that the reports which we obtained in regard to certain applicants for naturalization were not as reliable as they might have been. Since peace conditions have obtained I have made it a practice in cases where men were alleged to have heen associating with the enemy, or to have said something, perhaps in a public-house bar, which was derogatory to the Empire, to secure fresh reports concerning them, and in quite a number of cases I have found that the first reports were a littl e biased, and in othera that they were the result of family feud°..",50
203,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"It was upon those wicked prejudices that men were victimized without trial. I hope that the Minister endeavoured to be fair ; and if the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) had followed his example he would have done better.  myself. I endeavour to hold the scales evenly as between all subjects of the Commonwealth. All that I require of applicants is good character and good citizenship, and quite a number of honourable man.'bers will support me in that statement. In Committee we shall much closer grips with the measure, and I shall then be able to. explain any portion of it to which my attention ""may be directed. I ts broad principles are those which I have indicated, and I ask honourable members to give it fair consideration. I believe that it is the most liberal Bill connected with naturalization that has ever been submitted to this Parliament. Unless for some very special reason, I ask honourable members not to amend it , because its amendment will mean stultifying its operation to a very great extent, seeing that it is a copy of an I m perial Act . The whole Bill is based upon uniform legislation by the Imperial Parliament, and if we alter it in such a way that it will not conform to the Imperial Act, I cannot guarantee that it will be acceptable to the Home authorities.",51

210,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"It is nothing of the kind. It ie not an international compact in regard to the issue of passports. Every nation has acted independently in respect of that matter. Before the outbreak of war it was possible for men to leave this country and to land in any part of the world without a passport. For instance, the Minister for the Navy (Mr Lair d Smith), who was a member of the Empire Parliamentary Delegation which visited the Old Country a few does the years ago, was able to land anywhere without a passport.",51

At that time members of the Butchers Union, slaughtermen, and members of the Australian Workers Union were not permitted to travel from the Commonwealth to that Dominion, nor were New Zealanders able to come here without passports, although it is an advantage that they should be able to enter both countries with the utmost freedom. Since then the Minister has been able to make an arrangement with New Zealand under which this passport system will be abandoned.  from New Zealand under the new arof rangement will arrive this week.

Some months ago several of the Orient liners were kept back because of the difficulty which passengersexperienced in obtain^ ing passports at the time. 1 If I thought that by so doing I should benefit Australia and the world geneally, I should certainly vote against the Bill , because, as the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has said, it is a measure which has arisen out of the abnormal conditions caused by the late war. If people going from Australia to Great Britain , America, and Canada can be permitted to depart under an arrangement similar to that which has been made with New people to Zealand, it will be infinitely better than the present cumbrous passport system. Moreover, it ' is very expensive to arrange for passports.  any part of the west coast of America charge twelve dollars, to look at one's passport.",52

Whatever else honourable members opposite may desire, I am sure they do not wish it to be revenue producing. I would not even go so far as to say that it should be made to pay for itself. If the authorities upon the west coast of America are charging twelve dollars to look at one'spassport, that is, roughly, equivalent to £3, and if that amount is to be charged every time a passport has to be inspected, the system is going to prove very expensive.  have been in communication with the authorities at Washington, with a view to the abolition of the system.",52

Many of us hoped that we had left that state of things behind ns, especially as we are now two years away from the odious conditions of war, and , it is about time we made some protest against the passage of a Bill such as this. I suppose it and a number of other Acts will be passed, so far as they are necessary to perpetuate the main provisions of the War Precautions Act , because there is in power in Australia a Government who cannot divest themselves of the war feeling, and the pleasure of indulging war powers and war restrictions, and, in a general way, if I may say so without giving offence, making themselves, as far as is consistent with true patriotism, public nuisances.",53

We are asked to pass a measure Bill . of this kind on the ground that our people cannot be permitted to land in other parts of the world without a passport. Minister, in his second-reading speech, showed clearly that, so far as this measure is concerned, even if persons come here from other\parts of the world armed with a passport, we should not permit them to enter Australia unless we so desire. In other words, the Minister says that the carrying of a passport is no guarantee to a traveller that he will be able to land in Australia. If it is necessary for people's freedom to be curtailed in this way, and for them to be compelled before they can sail from Australia to England, or from England to Australia, to obtain a passport, then dt ought to be equally incumbent on the Government of the country of destination to accept that passport in all good f a it h . If a person is armed with a passport we have no right to refuse to allow him to enter. If we can so refuse, the passport .is of no value. We must give some consideration to the trouble to which people are put. We try to simplify things in our own country as much as possible, yet many people have been put to great inconvenience in the endeavour to obtain passports in order to go away. I have had letters on the subject, and Senator Gardiner, in another place, quoted the case of a lady who found it difficult to obtain a passport with in a reasonable time of the date for which she had booked to sail.

I am somewhat in doubt as to the real purport of the Bill. I quite realise the sity for great care in the case of immigration, but I cannot see the same necessity in the case of emigration. The Bill - would appear to be a measure to prevent emigration, imposing, as it does, many restrictions and heavy penalties on persons desiring to leave this country.

That has already been done under the War Precautions Act, and the Government will, no doubt, take care to retain the power when the operation of that Act ceases. I am sorry that any Government of a free and enlightened British community should feel it necessary to introduce a Bill of this kind. When we have a League of Nations, and there are efforts being (made everywhere to bring the nations of the world nearer together in brotherhood, a measure of this kind should not be deemed necessary. I have carefully read part of this measure, and I am struck with amazement that it should be compulsory for a British subject- I can understand other arrangements for subjects of Asiatic origin-to have a passport to enable him to go from one part of. the Empire to another. We hear much said about Imperial FederaI tion, and so forth; but if such measures as this are necessary we are not only a long way from Imperial Federation, but drifting in the direction of breaking up the Empire.

257,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Y a r r a ) [9.21] - Durin the. second-reading debate, the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) pointed out that the Bill did not provide for persons coming into Australia, excompel cept in a subsequent clause, under which certain exemptions may be granted. Under this clause, it is fitting that should raise the question as to the power of the Government, by virtue of reguladifferent. tions made under the War Precautions Act,, to compel persons coming to Auspeople tralia to produce passports. AYES. heard that a very eminent Britisher who had visited Australia was obliged to obtain a passport to return to Great B r i tain. It is an absolute scandal that per"" sons, against whom nothing can be alleged, should be subject to this indignity. This system may be employed to keep out persons who, in the opinion of the Government, may be undesirable; but who, in every other respect, may be very desirable citizens. Under the War Precautions Act, certain things were done which would not have been tolerated NOGS. in ordinary circumstances, and as we have got back to normal conditions, I hope the Government will abandon this practice as soon as possible. In Great Britain, the same course of action is, no PAIRS. doubt, being taken under the Defence of the Realm Act , but I do not know under what authority immigrants are controlled in the United States, where the charge, I understand, is about $12 per head. The immigration laws of the United States are very stringent, but I have found, that persons travelling first-class or saloon get infinitely better treatment from the immigration officials there than do persons who travel second-class, or who, unfortunately, have to travel steerage. I enter my protest against the Government continuing the practice, authorized under the War Precautions Regulations, of examining passports of persons coming to Australia. There is no other authority, and the regulations promulgated under that Act were never intended to be used for this particular appurpose. I hope the Minister will take an early opportunity of dealing with the matter.  by, or have no power, under the Constitution, of the to keep people out of the Common",57
258,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"We have power undei g the Constitution to do that by legislation, and we passed the Immigration Restriction Act for that special purpose, but there is not one word in that measure to persons to produce passports. If Parliament decides that we are to have this system, which, not very, many years I ago, was denounced as the Continental system, the position will , of course, be Great Britain prided herself upon the fact that she offered asylum to who were driven out of their own I have country, and who afterwards proved very good citizens of the United Kingdom. Of course, some honourable members may say that , she has now seen the error of her ways. I do not think so. We may say the same in Australia. Many people who have proved good citizens of the Commonwealth left their own country on account of the laws passed there.",57
259,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Darling ) [ 9 . 2 8 ] j o in with my leader (Mr Tudor) in expressing the hope that these petty i r r it a tions will cease. About two years ago I drew attention to a scheme, not confined to the British Empire, but world-wide in its operation, for the interchange of photographs and copies of passports.",58
260,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,It was called a black-list.,58
261,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"It is purely a black-list, against the militants of the world, and so well has it worked that the Government have taken full advantage of the principle. I have not the slightest doubt that, under this Bill , the militants of America will be prevented from coming to Australia, and the militants from Australia will be blocked from landing in America. This Bill will only legalize what has been done for some years. The object is to preserve the present systems of government throughout Heaven knows we already have plenty of laws; for every offence there are about ten different Statutes.",58
262,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,The Government create offences and then introduce Statutes to deal with them.,58
263,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"We are asked to create an offence in order to provide some scope for the operation of the measure. I object to the evil customs of Europe being transplanted to Australia. It will not be long before Australia is in the same position as some European countries, such as Germany and Austria, where a man cannot go round the corner, without a passport, which he must take to some oflicial, who asks all sorts of impertinent questions. I foresee the time when a man passing from Victoria to New South Wales will be subjected to scrutiny by some meddlesome official, whose especial duty it will be to see that the working class agitators do not freely mix with the community. What, is the necessity for such restrictions? A r e the Government afraid of a revolution ? Are a' large number of people, who will seek to wreck the present system of government, tryin g to gain admission to Australia? If that is the reason for this legislation the Government should say so. I have held the opinion for some years that the capitalistic Governments adhere to the passport system because they have found it to work well in their interests. It keeps a tag on every militant man. I know that the record of one of The Worker staff is , con- I tained in the American files. The record of ever}' militant journalist and politician in Australia is known to the authorities in Europe, and if any of those men attempted to land in America, they would be watched, if not refused a landing. The Commonwealth Government have supplied the Americanauthorities with that information, and I have not the slightest doubt that the American Government has reciprocally furnished the Commonwealth authorities with the names and histories of all persons who are likely to come to Australia and affect, not so much our system of society, as the jobs which Ministers hold.  true merely because the honourable member says so.",58
264,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I have not in vented these statements. By reason of the world. information I have received from America I know that my statements are true of several men who are well known in Australia, and I have not the slightest doubt that the names and the information were sent to America by the present Commonwealth Government. This is part of a reciprocal arrangement for keeping the existing Governments in power, and to maintain supervision over all people who are likely to cause inconvenience and anxiety to those Governments.",58
265,Mr TUDOR,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Would the present Government allow Mr H a r r y Holland, M . H . R . , of New Zealand, to come to Australia ?",58
266,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"I cannot conceive of his being allowed to land in Australia under the passport system. If the Government are afraid of revolution, and for that reason desire to prevent militan t propagandists coming to Australia, they should speak their minds frankly, and not introduce this legislation under the pretence that it is necessary to keep out of Australia some chap of whom nobody knows-som e anarchist, or nihilist, or person of that sort. At first it was thought that this measure might be required for health reasons, but that is not so; already we have enough laws to safeguard health, so far as arrivals from overseas are concerned. The Bill aims primar i l y at the militan t propagandists of the world, and I shall oppose it at every stage aud shall vote against every clause in it .",58
267,Mr GABB,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Angas) [9.35] - Passpor t is defined as a passport "" which was, not more than two years previously, issued or renewed by, or on behalf of,, the Government of the country of which the person to whom it relates is a citizen or subject.""

270,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Hunter ) [9.37] There is a good deal to be said for the amendment. A person may get a passport with the intention of travelling to another country, but he may make a prolonged stay in some other land en route. If he remains there for two years-his passport will be required to be renewed ; and how can that be done unless it is sent back to the country in which it was  should give careful consideration to this provision, for it may be placing an obstacle in the way of many bond fidetravellers.

Clause 3(1) Subject to this Act, no person who is, or appears to an officer to be, more than sixteen years of age, shall embark at any place in the Commonwealth for a journey to. any place beyond the Commonwealth unless(a) he is the holder of a passport or otherdocument authorizing his departure; and (J) his passport has been viseed or endorsed in the prescribed manner forthat journey.

273,Mr BRENNAN,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Batman) [9.45]  understand that this Bill was a benevolent measure designed to assist citizens of Australia to make arrangements to travel conveniently to foreign countries by taking with them a passport supplied to them by him for a small consideration; but I find from a close scrutiny of the Bill that, if the Minister fails to be as generous as he promises to be, and does not kindly supply a passport, the tourist becomes liable to a fine of £ 1 0 0 , or imprisonment for six months, for not having availed himself of the kindness of the Minister.  Mr BRENNAN "" - I understand that certain persons may be exempted by the Minister, but the - only reference in the clause to tourists is to persons travelling to Papua or Norfolk Island. As it is a monstrous proposition to render people liable to a fine of £ 1 0 0 , or imprisonment for six months, for having failed to avail themselves of a passport, I propose to move an amendment later to reduce the penalty to £ 1 .",60
274,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Darling) [9.50] The Bill will create enough trouble without the discretion given in this clause to an officer to say to the passenger, "" Y o u are apparently over sixteen years of age, and will need a passport."" It is a discretionary power that should not be allowed. Trouble in this direction might be raised when a vessel is on the point of departure.  which the honourable member relates has occasioned no trouble or hardship.",60
275,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"If it has not operated I see no use for it . is possibly some verbiage copied fro m an overseas Act. I see no reason why the age should not be fixed at sixteen years, and all discretionary the better. power taken away from any officer. W it the view of deleting this unnecessary ridiculous provision, which is likely to cause a good deal of trouble, I move That in sub-clause (1) the words "" or appears to an officer to be"" be left out.  Home and Territories) [9.54] - Of course, the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), being opposed to the Bill , lock, stock and barrel, is endeavouring to make it more difficult to work. If the words he asks the Committee to omit were struck out, it would render necessary a sworn declaration as to a person's age; whereas now the simple admission by an officer that a person is, or is not, under sixteen years of age, is sufficient. The honourable member wishes the passenger to be submitted to all the difficulty of producing a birth certificate as to his age. Since I have been administering the Act, I ' have not heard of any hardship having been occasioned by this provision.",60
276,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Hunter) [9.55] : The clause needs revising. It will cause hardship in many cases. Eor instance, persons who are travelling with their families will , be obliged to secure passports costing 10s. each for their children between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one years; and if they are visiting America the examination of each passport will entail a payment of £3. If we are not compelled by legislation of a similar character elsewhere to provide that every child over sixteen years of age must be furnished with a passport when travelling abroad, I see no necessity for this provision. There is also the case of persons who are leaving Australia to go to their friends"" in other countries, and who, very often, are hard pressed to raise sufficient money to get away without having to incur this additional expense of providing themselves with passports. I am not inclined to move an amendment, but to I think the Minister would be well advised to make the age twenty-one years.  It because the age of sixteen years applies in legislation in other parts of the world. Mr ' CHARLTON - It is a ridiculous provision, and the sooner it is amended I am sorry that we are h obliged to follow in the footsteps of Goand vernments elsewhere that make mistakes of this kind. Additional expense will be entailed on the immigrants we are endeavouring to bring to Australia, or on the Government, if parents are compelled supply their children between sixteen so and twenty-one years of age with passports. Surely it should be sumcient if the parents themselves are provided with them. At any rate, whatever is done other countries, we ought to be in a position to decide upon the conditions under - Mr BRENNAN (Batman) [ 1 0 . 4 ] which we propose to allow people to come into Australia. There is no need f to make our laws in. this respect identical with those in force in other countries. is not fair to compel children under that a young person who is not twenty-one years of age to have passports when their parents are already provided  would be well advised to look into this matter. I regard this as restrictive lation, which we ought not to pass. Amendment negatived.",60
277,Mr BLAKELEY,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Darling) [ 1 0 . 0 ] consider the age of sixteen ridiculously low. This piece of legislation should not seek to gather in persons under twentya one. If the law means anything at all, it is intended to keep watch upon people arriving in and leaving this country. Who will say that any boy or girl sixwere teen and a-half years of age ""was conoffence, templating or instigating a revolution i Australia?

285,Mr CHARLTON,BRITISH EQUIVALENTS OF THE CURRENCY,"Hunter) [10.8] Why should the Government persist in its opposition to the amendment? They should not be so greatly concerned over persons desirous of leaving Australia. Their chief interest lies with the class of people who want to get into the country. Why. should it be"" made obligatory on the part of those who desire to leave our shores to obtain a passport ? If a person appears to be sixteen years of age, even, though he or she is not, this clause provides for a fine of £ 1 0 0 simply because an officer has been guilty of misjudgment. That is monstrous. Why all this fuss if a youth desires to work his passage on a vessel in order to see a little more of the world, or even if he seeks to stow away ?",62
