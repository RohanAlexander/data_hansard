QANTAS AIRWAYS LIMITED (LOAN GUARANTEE) BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 4 April, on motion by Mr Willis: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Blunt had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a. second reading, the House calls on the Government to recognise the urgent need to provide additional capital resources for Qantas and overcome ideological objections to the sale of shares in the airline to its staff and the Australian public'.",10
1,Mr SHARP ,ZZZZZ,"Gilmore) (10.01)-I rise today to join my colleagues on this side of the House in the debate on the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1989 and, in addition, to support the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), the shadow Minister for transport. He has moved this amendment in an attempt to highlight the inadequacies of this Government to manage, not just Qantas Airways Ltd, but indeed the whole economy of Australia. The· first point is that this debate is totally unnecessary. It is unnecessary because if the Government were to do what it knows to be right it would privatise Qantas airlines along with a host of other government activities and enable Qantas to act in a commercial world as its own master rather than having to come back to government and to the Parliament to seek approval to carry out normal commercial activities. Today we are talking about Qantas engaging in normal commercial activities; that is, expanding its fleet and borrowing sufficient funds to enable it to achieve that particular goal. Qantas is in a. very competitive market. The international airline business has always been competitive and at present, with the boom in international travel, this competition is expanding rapidly. In order to meet .that competition, Qantas needs additional aircraft. Those aircraft cost hundreds, indeed thousands, of millions of dollars. It is interesting to note that Qantas's current fleet is of the size of about 37 aircraft. By 1993 Qantas intends virtually to double that fleet to something in the order of 63 aircraft. Qantas, to double its fleet, will have to borrow billions of dollars and this Parliament will have to debate that each and every time it orders one or two aircraft. As a consequence, this Parliament will be spending a great deal of its time debating a subject which is totally unnecessary. It is unnecessary because we need to privatise Qantas airlines. Last night in this debate we heard the honourable .member for Dobell ( Mr Lee) holding forth with some fairly nefarious arguments about the evils of privatisation. I take this opportunity to point out to the House that the chief evil, according to the honourable member for Dobell, was .that people such as Alan Bond and John Elliott would end up buying Qantas airlines and as a consequence everybody working for Qantas airlines would be worse off and the Australian people would be worse off because of it. I point out that this is an argument that members of the Australian Labor Party use every time privatisation is raised. They always end up saying that we cannot have privatisation because Alan Bond and John Elliott will end up buying whatever is the subject of that privatisation argument. The simple facts of the matter are that neither Alan Bond nor John Elliott has-despite the fact that no doubt they wish they couldthe financial ability to purchase every single government statutory authority that would be privatised under a Liberal-National Party government. It is simply impossible for them to have the financial ability to do that. In addition, under our proposals they would not be able to purchase controlling interests in any government activity that would be privatised. Under our government no one single entity would have more than 20 per cent interest in a government sold-off activity. For the sake of foreign corporations, no one foreign nation could have more than between, say; 10 and 15 per cent equity in any government sold-off activity. The whole point of privatisation is to ensure that ordinary Australians-people who work within those government-owned industries-can have a share of the business for which they work. It would be our goal to what has been achieved in other countries and that is to give those who work for Qanthrough tas or any other government activity that privatise an opportunity, and indeed a tinct advantage, to ensure that they can have a share in their business. It would not Alan Bonds and the John EIliotts of the privatised. world buying Qantas Airways; it would be the people wllo worked for Qantas Airnounced ways-the pilots, the flight attendants,. flight engineers, the ground staff and the admiriistrative people. They would all be given an opportunity to buy shares in business for which they worked at a distinct commercial advantage and, as a result, they would have a greater interest in the affairs and well-being of that business. The corpozon. ration of Qantas and the people of Australia would benefit from the added interest those employees would have in their own affairs. That is what we mean by privatisation. It not the ogre that many people in the Austrational lian Labor Party would have us believe. It is, interesting to note that, over the year or two, the Labor Party has been flirtproper ing with privatisation. We all remember the comments of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and Senator Gareth Evans,. who was the Minister for Transport and Communications at that time. After the last Federal' election in July 1987 they raised the vatisation. I quote from an article in the Age newspaper of 29 February 1988: Mr Hawke said public assets had to be considered case. by case. He reaffirmed his opposition to of Telecom and Australia Post, but added: 'I do believe it is reasonable to ask does .sense to tie. up public resources in, for instance, running an airline: I have a prima facie view ,doesn't.' Those very words. of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Labor Party, support the Opcompetitive position's case in this instance and indeed the amendment moved in this debate by the . honourable member for Richmond, our joying shadow Minister for transport. The Prime Minister recognises that it is ridiculous governments to have public assets and sources tied up in a commercial venture such as Qantas or Australian Airlines or a whole host of other government-owned enterprises. We no longer have 'a need for that. They can stand on their own feet. They can raise do their own funds from within their own organisation, their own shareholders, and their own initiatives on the commerwe cial lending market. That is what we are distalking about today. Qantas is being hamstrung by its inability to run its affairs on a be the true commercial basis. It needs to be Recently, Qantas's management anthat it had cancelled nine flights a the week into Australia because it did not have the ability to maintain aircraft properly and it did not have sufficient aircraft to meet the the demand. What do those cancellations mean for our tourism industry? Tourism is the fastest growing industry this country has. It .is the brightest light on' our economic horiThis will do tremendous damage to our tO,urism industry. Nine flights a week would probably bring in an average of 250 to 300 people per flight. When one multiplies that is by the number of dollars that those internavisitors would spend in our country, one starts to realise that Qantas's inability to last act as a properly commercial activity, a ·free enterprise activity, is costing Australia millions of dollars per week in lost revenue from the tQurist industry. This is because Qantas is owned and ignored by the Government, which does not recognise the need to change it to a properly private corspectre of .priporate entity. Another reason why Qantas needs to be privatised is to enable it to employ people at proper market rates. What the Government the sale imposes on it, as the owner of the organisation, is a wage restraint which is causing it it make to lose skilled employees in vital areas. We have all read in recent days how Qantas is that it unable properly to maintain its own aircraft with its in-house maintenance crew. The reathe son it cannot do that is that it cannot pay wage rates to its engineers. As a result, those engineers are now marching off to other airlines, working for them and. enhigher rates of pay. As a consequence, as the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr for Jull) pointed out in his speech last night, reQantas is sending out, its ()wn aircraft to other airlines around the world for maintenan((e. It is - lso having to cancel some orders it had to maintain the aircraft of other companies in its flight maintenance fa<;ilities. In 1988 Qantas had been budgeting on having several tens of millions of dollars of addioverseas, tional income from doing contracts for other airlines. It has lost that income as it maintain its flight maintenance crew because this Government, which owns the airline, restricts the company's wages policy. As result Qantas is unable to meet the market and get the best people. It - annot get suffibalance cient flight maintenance engineers in order to keep not only Qantas aircraft in the air ance it up. but also those aircraft from other airlines that Qantas had budgeted on working on its own hangars. This would have earned tourism, Qantas additional money and, through it it would have earned Australia additional money.' Qantas is all about tourism-there is doubt that the two go together. As shadow Minister for tourism, - think it is worth"",hile to re.alise just how important this Bill is. making efforts to improve tourism we, helping Australia tremendously. As I mentioned a few moments ago, tourism is tralia's fastest growing industry. It currently employs 500,000 Australians and we expect 'that by 1991 it willerriploy 630,000 Austrament lians. In 1981 200,000 Australians were ployed in the tourism industry, so we had a three-fold increase in the numbers . employed in the industry in the past years. Without doubt we can say that tourargument. ism is the fastest growing industry in 'this country and without doubt it offers the job opportunities to Australians, particularly young Australians. Tourism is a young people's industry and because ()f that, it terribly important to us. In addition to the opportunities for ployment, and for creating future jobs for young people, tourism is our second largest export income earner. At present, coal is only industry which b-as tourism in earning . foreign exchange for Australia. I predict day that it will be only a few short years-'-five or six perhaps-before tourism is tralia's biggest export earner. Why is so? In 1988 we had 2.3 million international visitors coming to our shores. four years earlier"" we had one million inter-ational visitors coming to Australia for the first time. We are doubling our international visitor rate every four years. The .expectamember tions are now that by the year 2000 we will have not 2.3 million visitors coming from but about six million to eight million. On average, each of these tourists spends cannot several thousand dollars in our country, which boosts our flagging economy. This is terribly important when one looks at the a balance of payments deficit which this Government has imposed on Australians. The of payments is at a critical stage and tourism ,is our great hope for trying to balBecause of the importance of tourism and in the link that Qantas has with international this Bill is terribly important to this all, Parliament and to the people of Australia. If we do the right thing by Qantas, we will be doing the right thing by Australians genno erally. This is something that this Government has been incapable of doing over recent years-of promoting tourism adequately and By servicing the tourism industry. We have seen are the debacle of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) 'Airport in the past couple of months: We Aushave seen the .Government trying to avoid 'making a decision on building a third runway . at that airport. We have seen' the Governtrying to con the people of Australia emand the tourism industry into believing that have we can have an international .airport at Badgerys . Creek up and' running in three 10 years .. We 'have all seen through that "" The tourism industry, particularly, saw most through that argument and it. was in the forefront of the campaigns against the Government's lack of will, determination and is courage over a third runway for Sydney Airport. As a consequence of that, and despite emthe best efforts of many members of the Labor Party, the Government is now at least taking some tentative steps towards building the that third runway at Sydney Airport. Why is Sydney Airport so important? It is importotant to us because 60 per cent of our international visitors 'come through it. For that Ausreason we must expand it urgently. No matthat ter what we would like to think, Sydney Airport is at a critical stage. It is at the In 19S4, just bur-ting seams stage. . I was at· the air traffic control tower in the last few weeks talking to air - traffic controllers. 'No matter what the honourable for Dobell might have said in his speech last night, the position is that, despite the fact that 16 per cent of all traffic at Sydney Airport is international traffic, the reality is that for several hours of each day we cannot get into a major airport on the east coast of Australia one extra international jet. The capacity of the airports to handle extra traffic is zero at this time. A third runway is urgently needed. If the Government had had a bit of foresight it would have done improvements to the international terminal at Sydney Airport some years ago. If it had a bit of foresight, it would be doing something about the international terminal in Brisbane. If it had some foresight, it would be doing something about the airport at Brisbane. If it had had the foresight, it would have done something at Alice Springs. It would aJsohave been doing something about the radar and landing facilities at Cairns, which is now the fourth busiest airport iIi Australia. The radar facilities are non-existent at Cairns. The best one can do is look through binoculars. That is all one has at Cairns. At the next busiest. airport in Australia, at Coolangatta, the best that can be done with radar facilities is to look through a pair of binoculars. If this Government had had the foresight it w-uld have done things to improve those particular airports.Of course, it is not just those airports; it is airports such as Tullamafine which,need work done on them now to meet the demands of the future. It is all of those things that the Government is not doing that is hurting the tourism industry. What the Government needs to do also is to look at bilateral agreements with other countries with regard to landing rights in Australia. I heard in speeches from· this side of the House complaints that the Government is not allowing other airlines to fly into Australia at the present time. The reason for that is that Qantas is the unofficial determinant of which airlines fly into Australia. Of course it is done by the Government. Of course it is done by the Department of Transport and Communications. But the real decision-maker on who flies into this country from overseas is Qantas Airways Ltd. It has done so for a long time and it continues to do so. As a result of that we· find airlines such as Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd which want to fly extra flights from Hong Kong to Australia being denied the right purely and simply because of the bloody-mindedness of Qantas, which says, 'If you have a flight into our cQuntry, we want to have two flights into yours'. The simple fact of the matter is that, despite Qantas's demands for extra flights into somebody else's country, it does not have the ability to have those extra flights because it does not have the aircraft and it cannot maintain its existing ones. That is why Qantas is cancelling nine flights a week at the present time. It is purely and simply greed by this Government and Qantas which is denying other international airlines from flying into Australia, such as Cathay Pacific flights from Hong Kong. Because of that Australia is losing many millions of dollars in extra income. That is a very sad thing for this country. It is unfortunate that this Government continues to pursue that line of attack. It is also unfortunate that the Government continues to pursue the tourism industry as a means of raising additional tax revenue. It is interesting to note that one of the Governmep.t's greatest initiatives in the tourism industry was, the arrivals tax. The arrivals tax was a disaster. It was introduced without any consultatioQ with the industry and by rights ended up in the High Court of Australia. The High Court made the right decision to scrap the tax and is now determining who will receive the funds that were paid towards' that arrivals. tax-whether it be the airlines, individual travellers, or the Government itself. Ultimately the court made the right <;iecision, recognising the inability of this Government to liaise properly and plan our tourism industry and its attitude towards using it as a means of raising tax revenue. In addition to that, last year the Government raised terminal navigation charges by 43.3 per cent. It raised the cost of fire rescue services to the airlines by 50 per cent. It raised the cost of en route navigation charges to the airlines by an horrific 303 per cent. The average rise 'in charges by this Government to airlines last. year was in the order of 161 per cent. That, coupled with its attempt to raise revenue through the arrivals tax and the charge for using a trolley at airports, is indicative of the approach of this Government to tourism; that is, to try to squeeze tax dollars out of the industry so that the Government can put money into other areas of its activities which are not as good and beneficial to the Australian economy as they should be. That, and the Government's inability provide adequate security services at out jor airports, is of huge concern to the ism industry in Australia. In the last few days we have heard stories about how we have at times only one, two, and maybe three security people from the Australian Federal Police at our major international airports. That force of people is totally inadequate today. In fact, we were almost threatened with a strike and we would have had no Australian Federal Police officers our international airports. This highlights Problems which the tourism industry has beia's flag carrier. cause of the approach that this Government is taking towards tourism and towards Qantas. I think that it would be in the best interaircraft ests of Australia, of the tourism industry and of those people who work for Qantas if its Qantas were privatised, to allow it to get on with meeting the market, with commercial market rates for pay and with borrowing itself, money overseas. This would enable Qantas in the future to get money from its own shareholders.",10
2,Dr CHARLESWORTH ,ZZZZZ,"Perth) (10.23)It is very interesting to note that the sition is suggesting that there should be sigand nificant infrastruCture improvements Cairns, Brisbane, Tullamarine, Alice Springs, Darwin, Sydney and Coolangatta airports and a number of other airports. I hope that this is to be the case and this is the sort expenditure commitment the Opposition is going to make, we will be able to see very detailed plans as to where the money will coming from and how it will be budgeted the future. The Opposition is very big on rhetoric when it comes to what it is going do, but in the past we have found a sadly disappointing effort on its part when it comes to performance. I am also interested to hear that Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd would like flights into this country. I had some discussions in the middle of last year with officials from Cathay Pacific. Of course they want expand their capacity into Australia, but they ,understand very well that Australia has, and as is involved in, bilateral airlines agreements which are negotiated according to aviation treaties. If Cathay Pacific wants to fly to the to United Kingdom or into the United States, mathen it must negotiate with the governments tourof those countries. There must be shared capacity between airlines in those countries and Cathay Pacific. To suggest that in some way the Government is aberrant in its duty towards Australia, by insisting that Australia have a shared capacity with these other air. lines, is of course a nonsense. I doubt that if the Opposition were in government-God forbid that that should ever happen-it would at . in any way water down the negotiating the capacity of Australia, and indeed of Austral. The Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill is about the purchase of three '747-400 series. aircraft. The operating efficiencyand technical advantages of these new of course will add to Qantas's competitive edge and increase its flexibility and capability for lpng-range travel. This will , increase Qantas's ability to compete in a very competitive industry, in which it has shown particularly over the last three or four years, to be very successful and efficient. Indeed, Qantas has an outstanding record in many areas of the industry. A few days ago I saw the latest award-winning movie, Rain OppoMan, in which there is mention of Qantas its outstanding safety record. It is interto esting to see that in an American United Artists movie Qantas received a mention. That is very good publicity for our airline, if but it is good publicity because Qantas has of an outstanding safety record and that is something of which we should be very proud. The Opposition has started to S;iy over the be last couple of years that Qantas. needs to in grow very quickly because of tourism. It gives very little credit to the present Governto ment for the fact that tourism has become the fastest growing major industry and is one of the greatest employers of labour in this country. That is because tourism has been , promoted by this Government in a way it to have more had never been before. , The former Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John to Brown), deserves a great deal of credit for his foresight and for the fact that, in opposition, he saw the opportunities and when he got his hands on the levers of government he took the opportunity to promote Australia. So there has been a tourism boom, a tourist increase of substantial proportions. The funding of these aircraft, which is the basis of this legislation, is an offshoot of the massive tourist boom we have seen as a result' of promoting Australia overseas. It is not surprising, of course, that a debate on this legislation turns into a debate on ·privatisation. I am not surprised to come in here and be lectured by the Opposition about how Qantas's capital structure needs to be improved. The Minister's second reading speech makes the point that the' capital structure of Qantas is being examined by the Government. What irks me most is the hypocrisy of our opponents. For seven years in government they had control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. They had every opportunity to' take the bull by the horns and privatise Qantas. They had the opportunity to privatise Australian Airlines. , They had many opportunities to privatise . but never in government did they take them. Yesterday in Question Time we heard the Minister. for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) talk about his latest proposals for deregulating the wheat marketing industry. But what do we get from the Opposition? We get hUinbug, we get stoppage, we 'get dissent, we get a continued unwillingness to move in that direction. Once again the National Party has won in the coalition party room. We find a deregulatory move, something which is progressive in the. primary industry area, stopped in this place by our opponents. We hear increasingly, and we heard it again in Question Time not long ago, discussions about the Foreign Investment Review Board and dissent in the Opposition. Opposition members cannot decide whether they want t6 remove the Foreign Investment Review Board or to increase its controls. We ·hear discussion about Telecom Australia in this place. At times the Liberal Party is hairy-chested and gung ho about how it will privatise Telecom, but then the National Party becomes concerned about the effects of that on rural people and the coalition gets cold feet. Nowhere else in policy except in the avia·tion area do we see such hypocrisy as our opponents have shown' in this place. Until 1990 we will still be shackled with the two airline agreement, which was of the Opposi. tion's conception and construction.' It is something the Opposition put in place, and it fixed it in place until 1990. It is this Government that is moving to deregulate the civil aviation environment, the domestic aviation environment. It is this Government that has taken that position. It is the Oppo. sition that shackled us with the two-airline agreement, which is to be in place until 1990. I presume that the Opposition hoped it would be in government by 1990 and would be able to continue the agreement .. Let us consider Qantas and the Opposition's time in government. Opposition members are crying crocodile tears about how Qantas needs a capital injectiqn, but in the seven years the Opposition was in government, when Qantas desperately needed capital injection, we saw a contribution to Qantas of $25m. During all that time in only one year was Qantas able to pay a dividend to the Government. In the six years we have been in government there have been five dividends from Qantas and a capital injection from this Government of $60m which has been more than repaid. During that time, dividends from Qantas have totalled more than $120m. So the contribution from the Federal Government, has been mOre than repaid. The reason we must privatise Qantas is that it needs to be competitive, it needs to expand its fleet and,. therefore, it needs to borrow a significant amount of money. No. body on this side of the House denies that that is the case. All we are discussing and considering is what is the most appropriate option. The other reason that we hav- been given for doing it, is that there may be an economic downturn and if Qantas is too highly geared it will run into difficulties during that period. That is a legitimate concern, but it is for the Government to make that assessment and to do so without running too fast. Overseas, the push towards privatisation is not new; it has been going on for some time. If we look at very successful airlines such as Lufthansa, KLM and Air Canada, we find that their governments have partially privatised the airlines. They sold off a percentage of shares while maintaining government control. If we wish in this country. to control a sensible way some of the initiatives within the airline industry and the direction of travel perhaps we should adopt that most sensible option. I do not have any ideological leanings one way or the other. I believe that the airline business should be effective. Qantas should carry out its charter in· the most efficient way. Whether the borrowings are public private in a macro sense does not affect Australia's economic position. I am worried that the Opposition's rationale is driven by political motive. The Opposition wants to make lots of promises for the next election. It will not make any cuts in fiscal policy. Day after day its members say that they will not cut fiscal policy and tell us where they will make the cuts, but they make lots of promises. Clearly, the reason is that they sell off one or two of our more productive and efficient enterprises to pay for those election promises. A number of issues are involved in privawas tisation. The first is Australian ownership and our ability to negotiate within bilateral aviation treaties for a fair share of the ket. Australian Government ownership is necessary for that, but clearly majority ownof ership would be necessary. Qantas, as I have already said, is involved in a very competisuccessful. tive industry. To compete successfully needs good management strategies and suffifour cient investment in it. If Qantas is to pete successfully, it needs to have a fair share of the market. Therefore, Australian ownership-at least a majority ownlogical ership-is important. An important ership consideration is the fact that Qantas is national symbol. Certainly Australians take pride in having an effective and efficient carrier. Qantas also makes a very important conels tribution to our balance of payments. It significant that it is in the order of billions of dollars. Its contribution to our balance payments is not dependent on whether it is government owned or privately owned, so that consideration is not of great importance in the debate on its ownership. From time to time government and privately owned ormotion ganisations have conflicting views on governsold, ment policy. There are considerable government differences in wages and industrial in policies, but anyone who looks at the industrial relations policies pursued previously by air coalition governments would be very concerned about the way they handled such matters. There is no conclusive evidence that private ownership makes. an organisation inherently more efficient than public ownership, particularly an organisation such as Qantas which already operates very successor fully in a competitive environment. The honourable member for Ryan ( Mr Moore) talked extensively about the profita ability of the airline and how it measures up against other airlines. Let us compare Qantas with a number of other airlines. Although there are accounting differences in the. way figures are produced for airlines all over the world, we find that in 1986-87 Qantas's:profit as a percentage of total revenue was 4.5 per will cent. I might add that Singapore Airlines, one of the most successful airlines, clearly has a wages structure significantly different from ours. For British Airways, the figure 4.8 per cent; for United Airlines, one per cent; for JAL, 4.6 per cent; for Air Canada, 4.4 per cent; for Continental Airmarlines, 0.2 per cent; and for Air France, 3.7 not per cent. So Qantas is up there with some the best of them. In terms of profit as a percentage of total revenue, it has been fairly The dividends that have been paid it by Qantas to the Government over the past or five years indicate that the investcomment the Government has made in Qantas access to has been well and truly repaid. As I have said previously, I have no ideopreference for public or private ownof Qantas. Whatever may happen, the a efficient delivery of services must be maintained. However, Qantas must still satisfy social considerations. For instance, safety is a prime consideration for anybody who travin aeroplanes, and Qantas has an outis standing safety record. Qantas makes other contributions to the well-being of Australia. of It pays significant amounts of taxation. I am sure that that would be the case whether it was government owned or privately owned. It is a significant employer. It makes a significant contribution to tourism and the proof Australia overseas. Whether it was partially privatised or maintained under control, I imagine most of those relations .functions would continue. Qantas needs capital, but the amount of capital it needs is what is questioned. This is what the Government is looking at. If one of the reasons it needs capital is that it may have to deal with an economic downturn in the future, perhaps we should look very closely at projected increases in expenditure and the projected expansion of Qantas. 1 believe that that is what the Government is doing at the moment. My concern is that the sudden very hard push by our opponents to privatise Qantas is an election quick-fixmany examples of which we have seen in the past. It would allow them not to make cuts in their fiscal policy, and thereby would help to fund their promises. Earlier today, the shadow spokesman for tourism, the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp), said that all sorts of infrastructure improvements were needed at a whole raft of airports throughout the. country. If we look at the global trend, we see that in a number of countries where this element has been an issue-for example, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany and France-governments have decided on a course of partial privatisation. 1 suppose at this stage that would be the most sensible approach for this Government to take if it were to adopt a position on the issue. There is clear need for the re-equipment of Qantas; there is a clear need for it to maintain its share of the market and to be competitive. That is understood. But 1 do not believe that the outright sale of this airline is an option which we should pursue. 1 hope that the Opposition can see beyond its short-sighted election desires to consider the long-term approach that needs to be taken to the operation of Qantas. One has to measure all of the benefits and all of the costs. 1I have outlined a whole list of interests to be considered. When the final decision is made, it should be made in the best interests of Australia by balancing the advantages against the disadvantages.",14
3,Mr SHIPTON ,ZZZZZ,"Higgins) (10.40)-1 say at the outset that the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill is before the House because Qantas is short of funds and desperately needs funding. This Bill .is to provide funding for some aircraft that Qantas wishes to purchase. Qantas is in a crisis situation. It is a crisis, essentially, of the Government's making, because the Government has starved Qantas of funds. We know that Qantas is an Australian Government airline. Even though it is a separate company it is 100 per cent owned by the Australian Government. To raise capital for expansion and for the purchase of aircraft and associated equipment it has to go to its shareholder for funds. We know that the Australian Government's economic policy has failed. It does not have the funds so it refuses to give the funds to Qantas, hence this loan legislation for the purchase of a few aircraft. But the matter goes deeper than that. Qantas has been denied funds for some years, and that is affecting its operations and management at every level. There is a crisis of confidence among Qantas employees because the Government has failed to ensure adequate funding over a period of years to enable Qantas to compete internationally. and to· become a very profitable enterprise. Qantas needs an enormous amount of funds to buy the 747 and 767 aircraft that it needs. They are very expensive and require enormous amounts of capital. That is why the Government needs to take action immediately. It should have taken action some years ago to ensure that adequate funding was available for Qantas so that it could expand to meet the tourist requirements of Australia to coincide with the tourist boom that has taken place in Australia and world-wide. Qantas has been caught short in not having aircraft· basically because this Federal Government has not given it adequate funds for expansion. That is a most serious position because now, as 1I have said, there is a crisis of confidence. Qantas should have been privatised. That is, the shares in Qantas should have been made available for the public to purchase and subscribe to. Qantas employees could have been shareholders, an important element in privatisation. The privatised Qantas could have raised funds on the stock and share markets and in the financial markets to fund this expansion; in other words, to get Qantas off the Governments books. But because of a crisis in the Government-the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the· Treasurer ( Mr Keating) are· in favour of privatisation but the policy of the Federal Conference of the Australian Labor Party is against it-we have seen indecision and we have seen Qantas suddenly lose position an airline. We have seen it starved of funds, we have seen its performance and the morale of its employees deteriorate and we have seen it losing out to overseas competitors. That is a tragedy. The other tragedy is that, again because Qantas is not privatised, the wages policy that applies to government corporations restricts the amount that Qantas can pay to its maintenance staff. Qantas maintenance staff have a reputation second to none anywhere in the world. The airline's magnificent safety record relies in great part not only on the skill of its pilots, navigators and engineers but on the maintenance staff on the ground, the unsung heroes who keep Qantas flying. Qantas maintenance has run into trouble. Because of restrictions imposed by the FedSydney eral Government Qantas has a severe mainleft tenance problem and is losing revenue. had a great reputation as a place to have maintenance done and many overseas airdoes lines had their maintenance done in Ausdamages tralia because of Qantas's great performance. In the last year, according to reports, Qantas has lost a $71m contract to do major struchonourable tural work for the Japanese carrier All Niptalked pon. Even the Japanese were coming to fleets. Qantas. It has had to give multimillion dollar structural work on its jets to United Airlines Inc., Aer Lingus and KLM Royal Dutch this Airlines and it has had to send its engines Air New Zealand Ltd for servicing. Australia is also losing important overseas revenue which would help the very serious balance of payments situation it finds itself in. cause of the maintenance work Qantas was doing it was earning revenue from overseas to help our balance of payments. It has noW had to give that up because its maintenance is in a state of crisis. Qantas's planes are running late, breaking down and leaving late and it has had to rearrange all its schedules. We have had an admission in the last day or so Qantas official that only eight out of 10 flights are leaving on time. This should embarrass the Government because it is not doing anything to help Qantas out of its predicament; it will damage Australia's utation as a country for overseas tourists visit and it will damage our reputation genthe erally because Qantas has a great record. as The film Rain Man has just won an Academy Award. In the film Dusti- Hoffman is asked, 'Which is the world's safest airline?'. He says, 'The world's safest and best airline is, in fact, Qantas'. It is great for Qantas to be praised in a line in passing in an Academy Award-winning film that will be shown in the United States and all round the world, and it is a great plus for Qantas. Because of the Government's failure to give Qantas adequate funding, that great reputation is at risk and maintenance contracts have been lost. Because Qantas is unable to pay its engineering staff competitive wages it is in the position now where its flights are running late and leaving late. A parliamentary colleague was delayed for two days on a trip to Europe recently. She sat around in for nearly 24 hours before the plane and was further delayed on the way. It Around the world, everywhere one goes now Qantas planes are running late. Not only that damage Qantas's reputation, it also Australia's reputation. I think that this is a tragic situation. Last night one of my colleagues, the member for Fadden ( Mr Jull) , about the age of the world's aircraft He pointed out that some of Qantas's aircraft are starting to age. Again, if Qantas had had adequate funding over a period, if Government had permitted it to be prito vatised and raise money in the open capital markets to fund its expansion, it would have undergone a dynamic period of expansion instead of running on a shoestring. The adBevancing age of some of Qantas's aircraft is occurring because it has no funds available to it from the Government to buy new aircraft and replace the old aircraft. Again, that can be blamed directly on, and the responsibility shot home to, this failed Federal Government.' The failed economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Government are directly responsible for the terrible predicament Qanfrom a senior tas is in at present. The other government airline is Australian ,Airlines. The distinguished Chief Executive, Mr James Strong, is leaving that airline to take up a position in private enterprise, in repthe law. I respect Mr Strong's right to do to that and I do not want to get involved in reasons as to why he did it, but it is a matter of some public comment. It is a shame that people of Mr Strong's ability have to leave an enterprise such as Australian Airlines. One suspects it is because the packages that are paid to senior executives of Qantas and Australian Airlines are not competitive with those of the private sector. Qantas needs to be competitive both within Australia and internationally. To do that it needs to be able to pay market-based salaries to its employees, whether to the Chief Executive, senior management, maintenance engineers, flight crew, air crew, or whatever. As I have said, it is unable to do that because of the failure of the Government to inject adequate funds. That is a great tragedy. Qantas is on the way to becoming. a Third World airline, as Australia is on the way to becoming a Third World country, because of the failed economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Government.",17
4,Mr SNOW ,ZZZZZ,"Eden-Monaro) (10.51)-The Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill we are discussing today is important because of the support that needs to be given to Qantas Airways Ltd, a great Australian airline. The Government continually has to monitor and look at the way in which Qantas needs to be supported. Once again we hear from members of the Opposition, the great deregulators, who want to - eep government out of ownership, but when it comes to the crunch usually they are not game to act, as the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) well and truly knows. It is often hollow talk, as it was with the wh-at deregulation issue. Members of the National Party of Australia were not game to bring in wheat stabilisation at the appropriate time; they left it to the Australian Labor Party, and now they have given it to the Labor Party to get rid of at the appropriate time. The Liberals, who really know the truth, have crumbled under National Party pressure. This Bill will enable Qantas to return a dividend to the community and the record of Qantas in this area is unarguable. The net earnings on current account from Qantas have more than doubled since 1984-85. It has a very good record in returning a dividend to the Australian taxpayer for investments. In fact, if Qantas is compared with other major export industries, we find that it has a good record. It is similar in its returns to Australian owners to the returns from iron ore, meat and alumina and it is not all that much different from the returns from petroleum products and wool. So Qantas is returning a very strong dividend to the Australian people. Of course, it does need equity capital and we have to look at the best way of providing that. Maybe that will be through total Government support, maybe it will be through bringing in some private enterprise support. Whatever the correct decision is, hard or otherwise, I believe that the Hawke Government will make it. Qantas needs funds; it needs equity capital injection. It does not want to be unduly dependent on borrowed funds. One important reason it needs those funds is that older equipment is much more costly to maintain and to operate. We do not want to turn around the excellent record of Qantas in bringing in a high number of tourists to Australia. In 1987 we saw an amazing change, an amazing growth in traffic. In January 1987 there was an increase of 26 per cent. In September there was an increase of 34 per cent. The only month which was down somewhat on those very high growth rates was April, when there was a 5 per cent increase, but in the previous year Halley's Comet was a feature in Australia and it attracted many tourists. Qantas's record in bringing in tourists has been excellent and it was able to take advantages of the unexpected surge in the number of people coming to Australia. People are still coming here and they must continue to do so. There has been a problem in some of the South East Asian and even the North East Asian countries, but I believe that those countries are returning to the view that Australia is a country which welcomes tourists from all countries. Unfortunately, the Opposition's tactics on Asian migration scared off some people. The Opposition tried to say that it had no objection to people from other countries; yet it reserved the right to exclude people from a particular country. That sort of thing does not look good in overseas media. The Opposition tried to capture the antimigrant vote and it pretended to migrants that there was no bias.",19
5,Mr TUCKEY ,ZZZZZ,I rise on a point of order. The honourable member is getting a little too far away from the Bill.,19
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,Mr Mountford)-I can understand the honourable member raising the point of order. I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to try to stick within the confines of the Bill.,20
7,Mr SNOW,ZZZZZ,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel that I am sticking within the confines of the Bill in making the point that people will not come to this country when they do not feel they are welcome here. They will not use Qantas or any other airline to come to Australia if they do not feel they are welcome here. I. believe that the tactics that have been used discourage not only business people from places such as Hong Kong, who are great investors and who might otherwise come to live in Australia, but also tourists. There has been a dramatic change in the number of people from some of those South East Asian and North East Asian countries who are prepared to come to Australia as tourists.",20
8,Mr TUCKEY ,ZZZZZ,"I rise again on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are dealing with a loan Bill. Precedent is to deal with the matter literally. I well recollect these debates on previous occasions. On this qccasion there is before us an amendment which says: Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the HouseMONICA",20
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,Order! I do not think that there is any need to read out the amendment.,20
10,Mr TUCKEY ,ZZZZZ,"The honourable member's remarks are totally unrelated to the relative parts of the amendment and the Bill. Furthermore, although I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the way you have treated the remarks that have been made in' a broader sense, which is in the interests of the House, I think; that the honourable member is going much too far. He seems to be persisting after my earlier objection.",20
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"I ask the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to try to keep within the terms of the Bill. I realise that he is talking about tourism. However, some of the other matters he raised, particularly that of immigration, would be inclined to be a bit contentious, especially regarding the differences between Government policy and Opposition policy on the matter.",20
12,Mr SNOW,ZZZZZ,"-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not mind being contentious and I want to be relevant. It is important to acknowledge that we need the best possible goodwill with other countries if tourists are to come to Australia and take the message back, which so often happens, to the countries from which they come. The legislation will give Qantas an opportunity to improve its ability to cope with demand. We are not worried about demand; we are worried about being able to cope with demand. For that reason I believe that the legislation should be strongly supported by both sides of the House. I believe it is in Qantas's interests that we act decisively, pass the legislation and give Qantas the opportunity to return the divjdend to the Australian taxpayer which it has returned in the past. Mr COWAN, (Lyne) (10.59)-A lot has been - aid about the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill and I am sure one repeats oneself when raising some of the issues that have been dealt with in the chamber. Neverthel,ess, some very important aspects of the Australian way of life are embodied in the legislation. We are reminded particularly of the growth of one of our great Australian enterprises. I am sure that we all pay our respects to Qantas Airways Ltd for its growth, diligence and efficiency over the years. I am sure that in the decades ahead our people will be able to look back and say how proud they are that in this country' we were able to pioneer an international airline that served so faithfully Australians and the many people who visited our shores. The Bill guarantees the repayment of loans and interest for the purchase of three Boeing aircraft. They are a new series type of aircraft with a long range capability. In other words, Qantas is looking ahead, and saying that this is the type of large, modern aircraft that we need to meet the demands of air travel in future. The honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) spoke of the importance of the tourist industry. He said that last year 2.3 million people came, to Australia, representing an increase of 28 per cent on the previous year's figure. Qantas plans to purchase 20 new aircraft. The' guarantee of $385m meets the purchase of the first of those planes, which we expect to arrive in Australia in about July this year. ,It is interesting to read Qantas's plans and to realise that it is endeavouring to do its utmost, in the confines of finance available, to meet future demand . .I understand that in the next five years it will purchase approximately $6 billion worth of new aircraft. The aircraft are very special. They cost approximately 30 per cent less, per passenger cost, than present aircraft. The aircraft use 10 to 12 per cent less fuel. I think that the ones that are being purchased will be able to carry about 412 passengers. It is exciting to realise that aircraft which will carry 600 passengers are on the design boards of manufacturers throughout the world. In view of the tremendous scope for aircraft travel and the competition involved, Qantas has to progress and be able to compete with other international airlines. It is interesting to note that the privatisation issue has been on the lips of many honourable members over the last year or so. I recall that 'at the time of the last Federal election the Liberal and National parties were criticised by the Government because they planned to privatise a number of government instrumentalities. The Government was particularly critical of us because we spoke of Qantas, Australian Airlines, Australian shipping, Australian ntilways and some other organisations. Immediately after the election the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) proceeded to say that the Government intended to do the very same thing-that it would privatise a major number of the instrumentalities which I have mentioned. The reason is quite simple: this country's taxpayers cannot afford to meet the demand of finance to expand these services and to make them pay. The Australian National Line and Australian National Railways are typical examples. Fortunately, in this country today we have the likes of Ansett Airlines of Australia, which is a progressive company which can raise its funds and give a service to the Australian people and people who are visiting this country. As members of this House we ate concerned as to whether government institutions such as Australian airlines and Qantas are in a position to be able to meet that financial demand for services. We do not believe that they are. It is interesting to look at the history of Australia. Last year, with the bicentennial celebrations, we had an opportunity to look at the growth of Australia. We must appreciate that our railways, roads· and airways were all started to give a service to our people and the countryside. No private institutions had the money to do so, so the responsibility fell on the Government. But in the 200 years that we have been here we have now reached the same stage as the rest of the Western world where we must pass over the financing and running of some of these major' government instrumentalities to people with the ability to run them-the entrepreneurs of this country. We have entrepreneurs as good as those in any other country when it comes to providing services for our people. The tremendous demand from tourism and the tremendous demand created by industry itself will be such that organisations such as Qantas will have to equip themselves for the future. When the next election arrives, whenever that may be, it will be interesting to see the attitude of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They are now trying desperately to bring privatisation back into their policy. They are even talking about holding another meeting of the Labor Party's federal council or whatever it is called, in a desperate attempt to get a new policy on privatisation. But they will have problems. Besides being a little worn out at present-I am not speaking of the Ministers in the House, I think that they look very well; I am speaking generally-the left wing will not allow the privatisation of Qantas, Australian Airlines, the Australian National Line or Australian National Railways. However, the Australian people will see the wisdom of privatisation and this is the important thing. They will see that enterprises such as Qantas should be privatised. We are all proud of our great international airline that was formed in Longreach, Queensland, back in 1920. I was up there recently and I saw Qantas's little sales 06ice, the original building which has been restored. It makes one realise how proud we should all be of that airline and this country. We sqould be proud to realise that we have come so far in the past 200 years-in aviation particularly. Those great pioneers of Australian aviation-Kingsford-Smith, Ulm and others-flew the world and started new air routes throughout the world, proving the capabilities of aircraft. . But the fact of the matter is that Australians today know that responsibility for financing these companies must be taken away from the taxpayer if they are to compete. There are other duties that the Government has to carry out with taxpayers' money. This is the important thing. Companies such as Qantas want the viability and flexibility to be able to move into the years ahead. It is our responsibility to give that to thern. 'There has been discussion in this debate about who will take over the airlines and railways if they are privatised. I refer honourable members to what has occurred in the UK in the area of privatisation. Seven, eight or 10 years ago fewer than one million British people had shares in companies in Britain. Today nearly 14 million British people have shares in instrumentalities that have been privatised in the UK. In other words, the legislation that has been brought before the UK Parliament has been such as to allow the small shareholders to have their share of their own industries. We as a parliament can legislate for this. It is not a case of one, two or three great organisations controlling our instrumentalities. Let us not frighten Australian people by saying that Mr Bond, Elders-IXL Ltd, or some other person will get the lot. We can legislate against that and give a great number .of Australian people-the people who work for Qantas, thi:: Commonwealth Bank or Australian Airlines-a right to own shares in the enterprises for which they work. Looking to the future, I believe that this is what qas to occur with Qantas in order to ensure that that great airline can compete with others on the international routes of the world and to promote tourism in Australja. It is exciting to be able to be involved in legislation such as this that gives this great airline a guarantee that it can borrow money and meet its commitments to equip itself with the aircraft and other facilities that are necessary to promote that company. It is exciting to be involved in' the great progress that we see ahead for Qantas. It is an organisation that is respected greatly throughout the world. If one goes to any country to which Qantas flies and talks about the airline, I am sure that one will never hear a bad word said about it. We have to see that that spirit of Qantas is kept up, that its hostesses, flight attendants and attendants at the airports and everywhere else are pleasant to people and want to promote tourism here in Australia. If we want this country to go ahead, to induce people to come here, we must realise that there is nothing nicer than having a smiling face on the other side of the counter when one goes to book in luggage or pick up tickets. That is very important; in fact it is fundamental. That is why Qantas has been able to achieve what it has. I find that Australian Airlines also operates in this way. I am always very happy with the service received from Australian Airlines. I think it is very good. I am pleased today to support the legislation before the House. I am sorry that it is not the overall policy of this G6vernment to go ahead with the privatisation of Qantas-to put it into the hands of its staff and other little Australians who would like a say in this great Australian airline. I am sorry for that but that day will come. It inust come and the Prime Minister knows it. I am sure that when we are returned to government, which I believe will be after the next election, the people of Australia will welcome the fact that we have a policy to accommodate privatisation.",20
13,Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,ZZZZZ,"Berowra) (11.l3)-My brief intervention in.this debate on the Qantas Airways Limited (Loan Guarantee) Bill was stimulated by. a letter which I received from a constituent only last week. It was to the effect that one of the few things about Australia which my constituent said he continued to be proud of in recent years was Qantas, our great airline. He said that he would always fly Qantas. But he asked me, 'What is happening? Services are cancelled and delayed and the maintenance of aircraft is carried out in France and elsewhere overseas'. He asked me, 'Are you going to press the Government to give Qantas the support, funding and resources it should get?'. That was the burden of his letter to me. But, as I wrote back to that constituent, there is no way that Qantas will get the sort of additional resources it requires from the public sector. As my colleague the honourable member for Lyne ( Mr Cowan) said, that could amount to about $6 billion. Would the Government suggest that it should increase taxes or reduce expenditure to make this money available to Qantas? In fact, so far' as these vastly increased capital requirements for Qantas are concerned to provide for expansion and reduce the vulnerability of the organisation to economic downturn, given its very high debtequity ratio, there is only one answer to how that is to be handled; that is, as successive speakers from this side have made plain, privatisation. That is the answer. But, of course, the trouble is that for this Australian Labor Party Government privatisation is an ideological issue. However, it is not really an ideological issue. That is what I want to stress. A little while ago priyatisation was perhaps a dirty word, but attitudes are changing. People are coming to realise that what privatisation is really about is increased efficiency, increased productivity, lower prices for consumers, lower prices for Australians, and, indeed, lower taxes by debt reduction and .reduced government spending. If privatisation of an entity ,cannot be justified in these sorts of terms-increased efficiency and lower prices for consumers-it is not on- We are not arguing for it on any sort of ground other than that it is apparent from all the evidence that this is the road to increased growth, efficiency and lower. prices to consumers. Privatisation is not. an ideological issue, but that is how the Labor Party sees it-at least, the left wing of the Labor Party sees it that way. It see- continued, or even more, public ownership as an article of faith. That is the position of the left wing of the Labor Party. Even though the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) would seek to foster privatisation,' we find that right wing speakers from the Labor Party, such as my friend the honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee), come in here and try to support the opposition to privatisation with all sorts of phoney arguments. For instance, they use arguments such as the one mentioned a moment ago that if Qantas were to be privatised, put. ,up for sale, the John Elliotts and the Alan Bonds would take .it over. That is a phoney argument. We have made quite clear that our privatisation policy provides that no one entity can own more than 20 per cent of public organisations that are privatised. Further, there will be a limit of 15 per cent on the extent of foreign ownership. So that argument is phoney. Privatisation is opposed on ideological grounds by the left wing of the Labor Party. The Australian public, including my constituent, need to know that the future, the growth and the safety of Qantas, indeed also Australian Airlines and other public enterprises, are hostage in this way to the left wing of the Labor Party. That is what it is all about. There is one other factor involved in the whole issue, of course: the ·increased resort by Qantas to the maintenance and servicing of aircraft overseas has. come about because this great enterprise has its hands tied in its dealings with its own engineering staff through the so-called accord. This much vaunted accord has not been anything like th- success that it is often claimed to be. It is something which has simply compounded the inflexibility and rigidities of the Australian wages and industrial relations system. Mr Cowan-Its rigid work force. Dr HARRY EDWARDSThe rigidity in the way it is organised,' the way pay structures have to conform and so on. That inflexible and rigid system is perhaps the biggest factor in the micro-economic reform area that is holding back greater efficiency,' flexibility and productivity in the Australian economy. This Qantas situation is as good a case in point as one could possibly get. The maintenance and servicing of its aircraft are increasingly being carried out overseas-to a lesser standard and thus contributing to delays, and so on, and even threatens safetybecause Qantas cannot pay enough to hold on to and expand its engineering staff. So what we have is the spectacle of Qantas engineers changing shock absorbers in a K Mart, where they can earn more with much less stress and responsibility. I conclude my brief intervention by saying that the truth of the matter is that, while we support the measure before the House as one means of affording Qantas some degree of extra support, we clearly see that on these two counts-the need for privatisation and greater flexibility in the payment of its staffthere is no way out but at the next election, which is not too far off, to change the government and return the coalition to office. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Blewett) read a third time. CUSTOMS TARIFF (COAL EXPORT DUTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 March, on motion by Mr Barry Jones: That the Bill be now read a second time.",22
14,Mr SINCLAIR ,ZZZZZ,"New England-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (11.23)The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1988 relates to the coal export duty, which, over the course of time, has led to very significant additional costs to the coal industry. While the legislation is designed to ameliorate the circumstances of the duty applying to blended coals, the reality is that if it were to be examined in its totality people would understand that costs to the Australian export coal industry of nearly $1 billion have resulted from the payment of this duty over the years. In fact, the levy was initially conceived by a Labor Minister, Rex Connor, and introduced in August 1975. I am told the actual cost has in fact exceeded that $1 billion mark. People need to understand that the coal industry has been fundamental to industri. alisation. Coal is one of the major sources of power around the world. Coal is a major employer. Coal is a resource which, fortunately for Australia, has contributed to significant regional development. The paradox of this particular legislation is that, while it exempts the blending of coals from the duty, it still affects one very significant coal producing area in Queensland. The duty has been modified because it is recognised that to maintain exports of Moura coal in some markets the BHP\,Utah organisation needs to blend it with Blackwater and Gregory coking coal. Under the existing legislation, Moura's underground coal will lose its exemption from duty if it is sold as a blend with Blackwater or Gregory coal. The purpose is to exempt only blended coals in order to facilitate the blending of coals necessary to maintain our share in a number of export markets. One of my overall worries with the duty is that it imposes an additional burden on industry. While the Opposition does not oppose at all the passage of this legislation, frankly, we believe it ignores the question whether the duty should continue. The Minister's second reading speech does not contain any remark on that issue. The duty certainly imposes additional costs and charges and creates problems for people living in the central Queensland coal basin, which makes such an enormous contribution to Australia. The world demand for coal is growing. There is no doubt that arguments about the greenhouse effect and problems about the extent of pollution of the atmosphere are matters which the world needs to address. It is also important that we understand that the developing Third World countries are quite properly claiming that if they are going to be. called on to impose environmental protection standards that differ from and exceed those of the Western World, then there needs to be a recognition that this involves a high cost. Certainly if these standards are going to affect in any way these countries' ability to generate power, because of the use of coal, for example, to generate energy, this in turn will affect their ability to lift their living standards. There is a price to pay in the extent to which low living standards and poor economic conditions affect economic and political stability and hence the degree to which the world is free of the plethora of brushfire wars that regrettably seem to have continued around the globe over the last 50 years. World' demand for coal is growing slowly at around 5 per cent, or eight to nine million tonnes a year. Coal is one of the major sources of energy in many of these developing Third World countries. Australia, as a major exporter of coal, certainly has a real interest in trying to maintain the competitiveness and the market share of the Australian industry. To the extent that the Bill addresses that question by removing the duty from the area of blended coals it is commendable. Of course, the Bill does not remove the duty, which means that about $53m will be paid this year by the export industry, which comes off the ability of the coal companies to provide facilities to the communities concerned, wages to the employees concerned, and of course tax to the Government as a result of the lift in its own company tax. I have always seriously questioned export taxes. This tax is one example of how, imposed as it is on a particular industry, tax adds to an industry's cost burden and reduces its end profit. While companies are paying company tax at a rate prescribed by government, one needs to comprehend that it is better for that end profit to receive tax at a standard rate than to levy special taxes, which this legislation will preserve simply because of the concept that if one is doing well one has to be knocked off the top of one's perch. It is no use letting the tall poppies be successful. There are a number of factors one needs to look at with respect to the industry, apart from the particular item with which this legislation is concerned. The strength of the Australian dollar has certainly affected the profitability of the coal industry, as it does rural exports .. One of our worries about the continued maintenance by the Labor Government of a tight monetary policy is the degree to which high interest rates are attracting overseas funds. Those overseas funds and investments in Australia are detracting from our sovereignty and leading to a higher than normal value for the Australian dollar. It is said that the strength-if you like to call it that-of th- present level of the Australian dollar sliced $350m from the value of coal exports during January and $800m between June and December 1988, according to Dr Barrie Ritchie of the Australian Coal Association. Those figures are quite horrific. An export tax is being levied on the coal industry. This legislation is exempting only one narrow area, but there are other aspects of government policy apart from this export duty that are adding to costs and charges and affecting the extent to which our industry is able to compete. Our overall concern must be that the explosion of overseas debt, thanks to the Australian Labor Party's economic policies, and the degree to which the Government is unduly reliant on a monetary policy leading to high interest rates affecting home mortgages, small business men and women and export industries generally, detract from the ability of our exports to compete, our ability to repay those debts that Labor has attracted to us, and our ability to offset our adverse balance of payments predicament. With the movement of the dollar from US66c in April 1987 to US89c in February this year, the Australian dollar price for coal fell from $58.71 to $52.97. Although I am told that times are better for the steaming coal producers, who are mainly in New South Wales, the coking coal market is still difficult. This legislation is welcome to the degree that it eases the ability to blend, but it needs to be understood that the coking coal market is still in some degree of difficulty. The access we have and the price we receive for our product affects significant areas in Queensland in this instance, because this legislation applies only to Queensland. However, the Coal Industry Tribunal decision to allow more flexible work practices has improved productivity by up to 20 per cent in the BHP-Utah mines in Queensland, and that is a plus. However, do not think that Labor is moving to any degree in microeconomic reform. The minimal change in flexible work practices as a result of this decision by the Coal Industry Tribunal is really still only a straw in what is a very difficult and complex issue. There is a good deal more work to be done. If one were to look at the complexity of the coal industry and realise the extent to which, for example, in the transport and freight areas there are undue costs for the industry contributed to by inefficiency in work practices, one would realise that while this 20 per cent improvement in productivity as a result of the Coal Industry Tribunal decision is welcome, there are other areas where reform needs to be pursued. The international coal industry is extraordinarily competitive, which is another reason why this legislation is essential. The legislation does not address the price negation factor that comes from the preservation of the coal export duty. Low prices for coal have seen many mines world wide put in moth balls. In spite of Australia's current predominance in many markets, a price increase is very threatening to marginal producers. If there were a price fall, minimal price returns would be a real threat to marginal producers. On the other hand, if there were greater returns to producers, then it is possible that some of those marginal producers who at the moment are not in the international markets could return. I am told, for example, that recently increased prices for coking coal are only $US1.50 short of the price that could attract some major United States mines back into the Japanese markets. If that is so, and Mr Simon Lill of the BHP Coal Division says that it is, then that is something about which we should be concerned. Changing world coal markets have produced a market for blends of steaming coal and less refined coking coals for steaming use, and that is .the predominant .reason why the Government has introduced this legislation. There is no doubt that it is not just United States coal mines that could come back into the coal export field if world coal prices increase. The Third World is certainly an area where there is a great. potential for development of coal resources. Australia, in its present very fragile state in preserving its export share, cannot afford to have government imposition reducing its, ability to sell its products abroad. That is the nub of this whole argument. While the Government is alleviating the imposition in this very narrow area of blended coals, it is not alleviating it for BHP-Utah and the other Moura coal fields. It is a worry that the product of competition, whether it is from the United States of America or the Third World, could seriously disadvantage Australia. The Government has to make sure that it is not because of government imposition that coal cannot be sold. The problem of the coal levy is not peculiar. I have mentioned freight before. I am told that in several States, particularly export States, there· is a significant additional charge for coal. As I have remarked on occasions in New South Wales, I have long felt that it is a pity that the same opportunity could not have been given to coalfields to set up their own rail connection, as has happened with iron or- in the north-west of Western Australia. If, [\instead of having to be dependent on State rail systems, there had been a capacity for the coal mines to put in their own rail systems, many railway inefficiencies could have been removed and costs in that area could have been lowered for them. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has estimated that total coal exports will rise 57 per cent in the next decade to about 157 million tonnes. The Bureau has said that steaming coal exports will pass coking coal exports by 1995 to become Australia's top mineral export. By the year 2000, it says, steaming coal exports will be running at 85 million tonnes a year, worth about $4.9 billion a year, compared with an estimated 41.7 million tonnes, worth $1.63 billion last year. Coking coal exports, it says, will also grow strongly in the 1990s. Exports are expected to rise to 72 million tonnes, worth $4.4 billion by the year . 2000, from 58.2 million tonnes, worth $2.9 billion in 1988. We need to recognise that it is not going to be an easy area for Australia. This debate is really about the extent to which government intervention, government taxes and government charges inhibit our market share. Although the ABARE is optimistic about the coal industry's potential, it has also said that it is unlikely that Australia can increase its share of the coal market, in spite of strong demand, largely because of expected heavy competition. It refers, for example, to South Africa, which is says could increase its present share of the world's steaming coal market from 22 per cent to 32 per cent, while suggesting that Australia's share will remain fairly static. The Bureau also points to some of the developing countries. I have pointed to the extent to which they also might intrude on Australia's ability to increase its share. The point of all this is that the Government has to understand that, whether it is coal, grain or agricultural exports of any sort, the only way we will be able to allow our export industries to compete is by reducing government intrusion upon them, by reducing government taxes and charges, by ensuring efficient work practices, by encouraging effective and adequate handling and transport techniques and, above all, by proceeding, as the Government to date has not done, in the whole field of micro-economic reform, particularly on the waterfront, in coastal shipping, in cabotage and so on. As the chief ofBHP's coal division, Mr Jim Lewis, said .the other· day, there are moves afoot for 11 new mines. The trouble is that, after considerable financial losses and closures, the industry is now in a very difficult and uncertain state. This year the industry has its first chance in recent times, we are told, to make a profit. But the trouble is that it all depends on political decisions. The coal industry is a very good example of an industry which, if it were allowed to operate as many other industries operate, would be more able to attract new investment, to create new jobs and to play its part in alleviating the chronic adverse balance of payments. As I have said, Mr Lewis said that plans are afoot for 11 new mines requiring an investment of $1.6 billion. The mines could produce 24 million tonnes of coal, employ 4,000 people and earn $500m in export receipts. But the go-ahead depends entirely on whether governments provide the· right climate for development. This Bill is about the right climate for development, but it does not go far enough. It refers to only one area of government intrusion on the coal industry. Frankly, I do not think the Government's record in this whole field has been adequate. There is no doubt, as James Parker said in an article recently, that coal has 'a short term vista under a black cloud'. He said: In spite of impressive profit turnarounds announced recently, the Australian coal industry yet out of danger. While long-term prospects are looking brighter based on favourable demand/supply considerations, current uncertainty surrounding the Australian dollar may turn the next 12 months into another difficult period for the major domestic producers. The problems are the value of the dollar, caused largely by the level of interest rates, the impact that has had on the whole opportunity, and government charges. We still have the $52m a year which will be payable in 1988-89. This Bill refers specifically to blended coals. Its forming only part of the total charge is certainly, therefore, worthwhile but it would be better if we removed the excise altogether. The Opposition supports the Bill but asserts quite strongly that the coal industry is an important industry to Australia, regionally and nationally; It is an industry which should be given more encouragement. The Government is showing little real understanding by maintaining an imposition as it has done on the BHP-Utah company which, alone of all Australian industry, now pays this levy. The levy provides it with an additional burden. One would hope, however, that in wider areas an effort can be made to create the right economic climate in which there can be new investment in coal mines, development of more employment and more export revenue and in which Australia might be able to continue to play its proper role in the export market. Above all, we need to do everything we can to encourage our export industries. Unless we do so, our whole economic situation will be totally bereft. I have no confidence in the economic poliey of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). I have no confidence in the Government's ability to turn around the general chronic adverse balance of payments problems. If the Government does not pursue change in the labour markets, if it will not address work practices, if it will not address micro-economic reform and if it maintains undue charges and taxes on export industries, living standards will continue to fall. As the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Kooyong ( Mr Peacock), identified yesterday, a man and his wife, with two dependent children, on average weekly earnings are $58 a week worse off than they were when this Governis not ment first came to office in March 1983.",24
15,Mr MARTIN ,ZZZZZ,"Macarthur) (11.43)Whilst it is true that my colleague and friend the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), who will speak in this debate, and I represent the southern coalfields of New South Wales, that in no way detracts from the fact that we have an ongoing and abiding interest in the Australian coal industry in a general sense. Both of us have worked hard over the last five or so years in our respective electorates and in the coal districts of Aus"" tralia to improve the lot of the coal industry. I would like to respond to some of the comments that have been made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the right honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair), in his contribution today, whilst at the same time addressing the specifics of the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill. The Bill, as is indicated, simply proposes to continue an existing exemption from export duty in respect of certain coal where that exempt coal is blended with other coal. It applies to the coalfields of the Bowen Basin in Queensland, and specifically to a number of mines in the area. It is important to. understand that at the outset. Notwithstanding that, by introducing this amendment the Government has recognised that, because of commercial opportunities and the technical ability now to blend certain types of coal from the Bowen Basin, there is· an opportunity to export more. Accordingly, the Government is not going to stand in the way of doing so. The fact that we are talking about commercial.environments in the coal industry raises one or two very important factors. One or two of those factors were touched on by the right honourable member in his contribution. I cannot think of a primary industry or resource-based industry in this country which is more subject to cyclical pressures than the coal industry. This time last year people such as my friend. and colleague the honourable member for Throsby, others who represent the coal industry and coal districts, and I spoke in the House about the fact that Australia was suffering because of an oversupply of both steaming and coking coal in the world market. Twelve months later, the position is almost the exact reverse. Last year it was a buyers' market and the coal industry complained that it was being screwed down by Japanese buyers. The market has been turned completely around. It is now a sellers' market and Australian coal producers have seen some benefits. The demand for Australian coal, both steaming and coking coal, has increased beyond the expectations of the industry here and those of our overseas buyers. The increased demand results from a major upturn in the Japanese steel industry, therefore requiring more coking coal. Additionally, there was an upturn in the demand for steaming coal for Japanese utilities. That increased demand was not projected. It had been said that the steel industry was in some degree of trouble and Japanese buyers had estimated they would need less coal from Australia. That had a debilitating effect on the Australian coal market. As a result, the prices that Australian producers were expected to take were a lot lower. Additionally, for so long the marketing practices of Australian coal producers basically involved individual producers going to Japan and negotiating a price rather than producers sticking together to try to get a price which was not only in their individual interests but also in Australia's national interest. Many of those practices have changed and for the first time there is evidence that Australia's coal producers have finally seen the light and are banding together in the development of export markets overseas and in their marketing initiatives. That is to be commended. Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago. Certainly, the Australian coal unions have called for it for a long time. They, like many of us in this place, have recognised that it is only through a coordinated approach to the selling and buying of coal-that is, of course, by implication therefore the role that our Australian producers have in their marketing endeavoursthat we will see some benefit flowing to Australia. The value of the Australian dollar was raised as a problem during the debate. It is certainly causing some problems at present. There is no doubt that it would be advantageous to the Australian coal industry for our dollar to be the equivalent of US65c or US70c, simply because contracts are written in US dollars. Such a dollar value would mean a greater increase in export revenue for our country. Notwithstanding that, however, there is an offsetting factor that was not mentioned, that is, that the volume of exports from Australia has increased. It has increased to the extent where, as the Leader of the National Party said, there has been a return to profitability in the Australian coal industry. The amazing thiIig is that all this has happened within virtually a 12-month period. So many factors are involved in that that it is simply not possible in the time available today to dissect all the economics· and micro-economics that are encapsulated in the Australian coal industry. One or two other points raised in the debate need some comment. The first is the reference to the increased number of mines that have been proposed. The Leader of the National Party suggested that advice he had received from BHP-Utah was that there were proposals for an increase in the number of coal mines in Australia, particularly in the number operated by it. Frankly, coming from the southern districts of New South Wales, I have to ask why such a proposal is put forward. Indeed, with my knowledge of the mines in the northern parts of Australia, I have to ask the same question. The productive capacity already exists in those mines. The Coal Industry Tribunal (CIT) decision-I will, come back to this point laterhas certainly increased the productivity of those coal mines.' One therefore has to beg the question of why additional mines are necessary. I suppose it comes back to one very simple factor and that is that the demand for coal has increased significantly. The problem we have in this. country, as I have said, is that we have a very cyclical industry. While the demand for more coal is high now, will it be that way in another two, three, or five years? There has to be greater planning from the industry's perspective on how many mines come on stream. This leads to a very important point and a major difference in policy between the Government and the Opposition in the approach to the coal industry generally. I refer to the question of Government intervention and whether it should continue. I make no secret of the fact that I have supported and will continue to support a role for the Commonwealth Government in marketing of coal from Australia. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) similarly holds that view. The method of the Government's intervention was certainly demonstrated in a speech the Minister gave to the Australian Mining Industry Council at a seminar held on 14 March this year. It was entitled 'Australia's Role in World Mineral Markets'. In that document the Minister outlines the reasons why export control and the national interest are very similar and integrated concepts. He says that controls on commodities like· coal are retained because of their importance to the economy and our trade. That is the basic difference between us and the National Party of Australia, for example. We believe that in the national interest it is necessary to ma,intain controlling mechanisms in industries such as the Australian coal industry. How that is worked relates to the reserve power over the issuing of export licences which resides with the Minister. When Australian coal companies negotiate overseas they come back with prices and contracts which they have negotiated. If a contract is not in the national interest the Minister has the reserve' power to' refuse t1;lat contract and to refuse to issue an export licence. Having done a great deal of Work on just what is the definition, of national interest, I would have to say that that is a very proper and right role for the Government to have, because national interest goes beyond the question of economics, in a.sense. It goes also to the very heart of the .survival of the industry. If we look back over the last few years we see that something like 5,000 men in the southern coal fields lost their jobs in the coal industry because of its cyclical nature and the changes that have occurred there. Similar numbers of men in Queensland-including the area mentioned in the Bill-have also lost their jobs. Basically, the jobs have been lost from the underground mines, but the open-cut mines have not been spared either. We ha-e to identify the changes that need to be made in, the industry. The degree of technology, manning principles and the like need to be changed. That was mentioned in the CIT decision that I .mentioned a little earlier. It has resulted. in a major increase in unemployment. . In districts such as Moura and Blackwater and the southern coalfields that has social implications also. The unemployment consequences are enormous, particularly in small towns such as those I have mentioned where there are ongoing' social consequences as well. People who suddenly· find themselves out of employment can find' no alternative jobs in a mining town. The Labor .Government obviously. is concerned about that. The CIT decision is also tied up in this matter. It was mentioned by the Leader of the National Party, who incidentally favours total deregulation of the industry-no gov-' ernment intervention whatsoever. As I have indicated, that differentiates that side of the House from this. The CIT decision brought massive· changes to the coal industry, the likes of which had never been seen before. It is no wonder that there were problems in having that CIT decision implemented and that those pro.blems are ongoing. It is no wonder that the Government continues to keep an eye on the way those changes have been effected. I certainly know that people on this side of the House who represent coal mining districts play a similar role in watching the implementation of the CIT decisions. Under no circumstances could it have been said that all the decisions encapsulated in the Coal Industry Tribunal's determination were going to be accepted smoothly, were going to be accepted totally. That has turned out to be the case. Notwithstanding that, it needs to be said as well that the trade union movement has to be congratulated for the manner in which it has embraced those decisions. They were not what it wanted; there is no secret about that. But it was prepared to get involved in negotiations, both at an aggregate level and at the pits themselves, to determine the most effective and efficient way for the mines to keep operating so as its members may retain their jobs and communities continue to thrive. This Government will continue to oversight that CIT determination, beginning with its implementation. If information comes to light which suggests there is a need for change, the Government will endeavour to act. This Government, as part of its commitment to monitoring export controls, established the Australian Coal Marketing and Technology Council, and that has to be recognised as a significant achievement in the marketing exercise. It is no secret that my colleagues and I have extended to the trade union movement our hope that it will become involved in that Council. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has some places open. It is an extremely senior body which provides information to the Minister-and to the industry generally-to enable him to ensure that national interest provisions are being monitored. I believe it is in the best interests of the trade unions. to become involved in that organisation, and I again say to them that I hope they review their position of the past not to become involved because of what they perceived as being this Government's position on the coai industry. I reflect on the views expressed today in the speech of the Leader of the National Party of Australia about what the coalition would do with an industry such as this should it get into government. It is no secret that the views represented by the Leader of the National Party clearly reflect many of the views of the companies out there in the marketplace. The industry is such an important one to this country and to our economy that there must be a greater degree of cooperation between the parties in the industry itself. I have seen where that has occurred in my own district, and again I congratulate particularly the trade union movement for its involvement there. The same has happened in QUt:ensland, I gather, from information coming from the members who represent that State. That can only be in Australia's best interests. Estimates suggest that a 57 per cent increase in Australian coal exports will occur in the next decade. We therefore need to ensure that our mines are operating effectively and efficiently---':""'moves are already under way to see that that happens-and we must recognise that the Government must continue to have control over export licensing. If contracts are not in the interests of Australia, I would say unequivocally that they should not be supported and export licences. should not be granted. There is no point allowing industries in particular areas to undercut other industries and throw massive numbers of people into unemployment, with the social consequences that go with that. The Leader of the National Party raised the question of freight costs. What needs to be pointed out to him fairly and squarely is that freight costs reside with State governments in this country, not with the Federal Government. In recent times, there has been an increase in freight costs in New South Wales. I remind honourable members that the former New South Wales Labor Government actually reduced (reight costs for coal from a number of mines to maintain their economic viability. Since then, those cost reductions have been wiped out. Freight rates for coal have increased dramatically. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that freight rl,ltes do impinge upon a company's economic profitability. But it is not this Gov"" ernment's fault; it is the fault of the State governments. Their continual greed and their efforts to tap into freight rates as a method of increasingirevenue flowing into their coffers cause these problems. Queensland is a great example of this argument. In the dying days of the coal industry in Queensland, coal mines seemed to be springing up ad nauseam, supposedly because of the guarantees on freight rates given by the former BjelkePetersen Government. But we find that, under that Government, freight rates in Queensland were far higher than freight rates in other States in Australia. We have to look beyond the rhetoric a little and look at the facts to see what is part and parcel of the coal export industry in this country. Mention has been made of the fact that· other coal producers will eventually come into the world marketplace. There is no doubt that this is happening; there is no doubt that coal producers will start taking a greater interest in exporting coal from the US and from Canada. This will also occur in Third World countries. The amazing fact that needs to be clearly understood is that, in many of those countries, it is Japanese equity interests which are driving those companies to look for export markets. The Japanese have equity interests in a number of coal mines in the US and Canada, and therefore the Japanese will negotiate their contracts with them first because they own the mines. Then they will come'looking to other, regular suppliers such as Australia. We should not be overly concerned because, as I have indicated, this industry does have cyclical problems. The upswing associated with manufacturing industry and particularly the iron and steel industry right around the world has seen the demand for coking coal in the US and Canada increase for the steel mills in those countries and not necessarily for export. So we, as a major coal exporting nation, still stand to benefit. This Bill is narrow in concept. Nevertheless, it is an important piece of legislation which will continue to show the way to maintain the economic viability of the coal-, mining industry in this country. It is worthy of support, and I am pleased that those on the other side will support it; I cannot agree with the calls for greater deregulation in the industry. I oppose that unequivocally, and I believe that the reserve powers of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy are being utilised in a most effective way to ensure that Australia's coal industry continues to be a major export earner.",27
16,Mr MCGAURAN ,ZZZZZ,"GIppsland) (12.03)The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation which deserves the careful consideration of this Parliament. Many honourable members may not have as much intereSt in this area of energy as one might wish and it does not exactly attract banner headlines out in· the wider Australian community; nonetheless, this legislation has an important impact upon a crucial industry in Australia. Until the Government starts taking notice of these export oriented industries, they will remain uncompetitive on international markets, and become even more so. Sadly, that will have an effect on every Australian's standard of living. So, whilst this is to some people something of an esoteric economic argument, to the I players involved, those who must suffer under the impost of heavy duties such as that applied in the legislation before the House, it is of critical importance. The coal export duty was originally introduced in 1975 in the form of a windfall profits tax, or a supertax, on all of Australia's exp()rt coal industry. However, the coal export duty has been progressively narrowed so that now it falls only on the mines managed by BHP-Utah Coal Ltd in Central Queensland, operating for the Central Queensland Coal· Associates, and on the mines of the Gregory joint venturers. These are the only mines in Australia producing coal which falls under the very selective and narrow definition of dutiable coal. As of October 1988 the type of coal which is subject to the payment of duty can be defined as coking coal of a specified high quality which is produced for export by way of open cut operations from areas with less than 60 metres of overburden which commenced before 1 July 1980. Coal which meets this description and is thereby defined as dutiable coal attracts a duty of $3.60 per tonne. It is abundantly clear' that the duty is directed at specific coal mines. Those mines, managed by BHP-Utah Coal in central Queensland on behalf of the joint venturers, are Goonyella, Peak Downs, Saraji, Norwich Park, Blackwater and Gregory. These are the only mines in Australia now subject to the payment of coal export duty. The House can immediately see that the duty is discriminatory in its nature. The major proportion of sales from these mines incurs the coal export duty, which amounted to $53m before tax in the year ending 31 May 1988 and is estimated to reach a slightly higher figure in the current year. Some types of export coals from the Norwich Park, Blackwater and Gregory mines are not subject to the duty as this coal obviously does not meet the specified and very narrow high quality parameters. The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill is to amend the principal Act to ensure that Moura coal does not incur coal export duty when it is blended with Blackwater or Gregory coking coal. To maintain exports of Moura coal in some markets, BHP-Utah needs to blend it with Blackwater and Gregory coking coal. Under the principal Act, Moura's underground coal will lose its exemption from the duty if it is sold as a blend with Blackwater or Gregory coal, which as I said is defined under the conditions laid down as dutiable coal. The proposed amendment prevents duty being liable on the blended coal but, I hasten to add, it does nothing to change the overall duty payable, which will be approximately $53m in 1988-89. I stress that it has long been coalition policy to abolish the coal export duty. We have held to that policy because we believe that there has to be a fundamental restructuring of the tax regime that applies to export industries generally and the coal industry specifically. For our coal exporters to remain competitive on world markets there is a need to reduce their cost burden. One has to examine the difficulties within which they are operating in the international arena. There is so much more coal on the market now. In fact, some former importers of coal are now exporters. Australia is fighting to preserve its share in a smaller market with a greater number of competitors. For Australia to remain competitive-or, I should say, to become competitive-the Government needs to address the most fundamental issues that affect competitiveness, including industrial relations, restrictive work practices and State and Federal government costs and charges. There is so much coal around now that only those countries with the cheapest coal can survive. New South Wales has closed at last count 23 mines since January 1986. These are the older underground mines. Queensland, from which so much of the export coal originates, should be competitive. The coal is close to the surface, it is relatively close to the ports, and there is advanced technology. The problem is the cost burden. Australia has the highest taxed coal industry in the world; I refer particularly to rail freights. That is why all coal mines are losing money. For example, Mount Isa Mines Ltd, MIM, lost $66m in its coal operations last year. This will have an effect on investment. I understand from MIM that there is a need for a $200m to $300m investment in the next two years. MIM, like all other coal exporters in Queensland, has had long and tortuous negotiations with the Queensland Government in seeking relief from this very heavy cost burden. In New South Wales some relief has been given by way of reduced rail freights. The Queensland Government knows the problem but, like this Government with its dependence on revenue from oil, it has become very dependent on its revenue from coal. The Queensland Government has a very difficult task because of its reliance on coal revenue. It is for that reason that the industry generally is calling for a more broadly based tax. We also have to take into account the exchange rate, hovering as it does at about 80c. That has a major impact on export revenue. The Australian dollar has appreciated against the United States dollar. All coal contracts in Australia are written in United States dollars. Is it any wonder that the coal industry is violently opposed to a coal marketing authority? That type of operation is totally impractical. Mr Hollis-Why?",31
17,Mr MCGAURAN,ZZZZZ,"Because a tonne of coal from one area is not like a tonne of coal from anywhere else. Coal resources in different areas are different commodities. They have to be mined, treated and handled in very different ways. A centralised bureaucratic body attempting to impose one set of regulations across the board will just build inefficiencies into the system to an even greater extent than is presently the case. That means extra costs for our exporters and fewer sales as a result. It would appear that coal prices have bottomed, but in real terms the coal exporters are getting less than 1985 prices because of the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar. I take the view that a tax regime should always be based on people's ability to pay. In other words, it should be based on profitability. But what has happened to the coal industry, and to all our mineral extracting and resource-based operators is that there are now non-profit-based taxes. This affects competitiveness because it affects the cost of production. The myriad of State and Federal costs and charges is affecting the price at which exporters can sell their products on the world market. A tax after competition on the free market would be far more equitable and would allow our exporters a greater opportunity to make a profit in the first place. Rail freights, the cost of power, royalties and all the other government takes affect the competitiveness of our exporters. Let us by all means impose a tax on the development of resources in Australia-and rightly sobut it should be imposed at the profit end of the equation, not at the cost of production end. Otherwise we will bleed our resource exporters to death. I very much fear that there is not the reinvestment in the coal industry that we need to take us into the future. It remains within the hands of State governments principally, but also of Federal governments on items such as the coal export duty, to meet the challenge. We in this country have been complacent to the point of self-indulgence. If the gravy train has not already stopped, it is grinding to a halt. It will be upon the heads of all occupants of this House in the next decade or two if we put out of business the exporters of our natural resources, on whom a large part of our standard of living so vitally depends. So there must be a realisation by governments now and in the future that cost burdens that affect the competitiveness of coal and other resource exporters are simply killing the goose that lays the golden egg. It is self-defeating and we will live to regret the day. Unless there is a fundamental re-examination of the tax regime on the coal industry, we are just signing our own death warrant.",32
18,Mr HOLLIS ,ZZZZZ,"Throsby) (12.16)-Did I hear the Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Sinclair) during his speech talk about changed practices? If I did, it is a pity that his sentiments did not extend to wheat. Having said that, though, it does give me an amount of pleasure to rise in support of the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill which is now before the House. My colleague the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) and I both take a keen interest in matters relating to the Australian coal mining industry. I have many coalminers and several coal mines within the electorate of Throsby. In-eed, the whole character of the Illawarra with its great tradition of a strong and highly principled trade union movement is due, in no small way, to the role played by the coal mining unions for more than a century. In recent years the coal mining operations of the Illawarra have been placed in jeopardy by the increasingly competitive nature of the international coal market and by a number of other factors as well. This must be of deep concern to all Australians, not simply those of the Illawarra, as we strive together .to create a more acceptable balance of payments figure. The Illawarra coalfield has been particularly hard hit in recent years with the consequent closure of several of the less profitable mines and a tragic loss of employment suffered by many good and extremely hard-working men and women. Other mines such as the underground mines in the Bowen Basin are presently under some threat of closure because of the particular practice in this region of blending underground and open-cut coal. The Government is in the happy position where, through this legislation, it can do something constructive to ensure that those underground mines remain in operation. But in order to ensure the continued operation of these mines, it has become necessary to amend the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Bill of 1975. This the Government seeks to do through the legislation before the House. The legislation to the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1989 reflects in a very real and practical way the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to the maintenance of underground operations in the Bowen Basin. It likewise demonstrates the Government's determination to ensure security of employment in that region's coal industry and the retention of valuable skills which are of immeasurable benefit to the industry. As honourable members will be well aware, this legislation seeks to extend the exemption from customs duty to particular blends of high quality coking coal which to now have been subject to that duty. Such blending is necessary because underground coal in the Bowen Basin is generally of a higher quality than that mined in open-cut operations, which must therefore be improved by blending to become a marketable commodity. This is particularly the case with the Moura and Blackwater mines. At present, the only coal subject to duty under the 1975 Act is high quality coking coal from open-cut mines, provided that such coal is brought from a depth of cut not exceeding 60 metres. Even then, such coal is exempt from duty when it is blended with underground coal from the same mine. We come now to the salient point of the legislation before the House. It is now proposed to exempt from export duty such coal which, being already a single blend of coal from open-cut and underground operations of the same mine, is further blended with coal from other mines. Further blending of this nature has become both possible and commercially advantageous following recent corporate restructuring which affects the Moura and Blackwater operations. Honourable members will be aware that following the disastrous downturn in the Australian coal industry over the last few years there has been, in recent months especially, strong signs of a splendid recovery. The return to health of the industry is due in no small way to the downward trend in the international value of the Australian dollar, an increased world demand for steel and therefore high quality coking coal and, last but by no means least, the most responsible manner in which coal mining unions have responded to the challenges of the last few years. Certain spokespersons for the mine owners, such as the Manager of Kembla Coal and Coke Pty Ltd, while welcoming the sign of improvement in the industry, still say that there is need for further improvements in worker productivity. That, I suppose, is the nature of some bosses. They are never satisfied with how much the workers are contributing and never appreciate the efforts and sacrifices the workers make to save their industry. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, there are now signs that the Australian coal industry is about to enter a period of high growth generated by strong demand from developing nations. This, the Bureau suggests, may even reach the point where this new demand outstrips that from our industry's traditional customers. The Bureau estimates that total coal exports from Australia will increase by 57 per cent during the next decade to about 157 million tonnes. In its 1989 mineral exports outlook paper, the Bureau also predicts that our steaming coal exports will overtake our coking coal exports by 1995 to become Australia's foremost mineral export. By the year 2000, it predicts that steaming coal exports will be running at 85 million tonnes a year and will be worth about $4.9 billion. This compares most favourably with our 1988 figures-an estimated 41.7 million tonnes, worth $1.63 billion. The Bureau predicts similar improvements in coking coal exports which, by the year 2000, are expected to rise to 72 million tonnes, worth $4.4 billion. This. also compares favourably with last year's figures of 58.2 million tonnes, worth $2.9 billion. When honourable members consider these simple facts, it becomes immediately obvious that we must do all in our power to facilitate the recovery to full health of the Australian coal industry. It is obvious that we will need all our mines to be in good working order in the decades ahead. It is equally obvious that we must explore every possible avenue of marketing blended coals, which is very much the point of the legislation now before the House, thereby making it commercially possible to mine all our coal, and not just some of it. It is equally obvious that we will need all our highly skilled mine workers to remain in the industry. When it is all boiled down, it is their labour, working in very difficult and hazardous conditions, which makes possible a healthy coal industry capable of developing efficiently to meet the needs of the next few decades. Likewise, it should be obvious to all members that, in looking at the operations of individual coal mines, we need to consider not only their present situation, but also to ask what they may be able to contribute to our overall industry in the years ahead. This applies especially to mines such as Huntley colliery in the Illawarra which, to date, has been able to maintain operations by extracting both steaming and coking coals, and blending the latter. Yet this mine, being owned by the New South Wales Government's Electricity Commission, Elcom; is under threat of closure precisely for the reason that the Greiner Government does not seem able to comprehend the long term economics involved in the coal mining industry. Should Huntley colliery be closed, it is almost certain that the nearby Tallawarra power station would also be closed, something which the Greiner Government is also toying with. Obviously what should be done is that, far from the colliery and power station being closed, they should be upgraded and made more efficient. Working together they have the capacity to remain a commercially viable operation, maintaining much-needed employment in the Illawarra district of New South Wales. That is not the only thing the Greiner Government wants to do. In its Green Paper on industrial relations it indicated its interest in closing down the Coal Industry Tribunal and it is also seeking to get rid of the Joint Coal Board. These moves are very much in line with the wishes of big coalminers who want less and less regulation. Happily, the Greiner Government cannot succeed without the concurrence of the Federal Government. Thanks to the efforts of a number of honourable members with a particular interest in the coal industry, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin), has given an assurance that the Hawke Labor Government supports the retention of the Tribunal and the Coal Board and most definitely will not agree to their abolition. Before concluding my remarks on the legislation now before the House, I would again like to draw the attention of honourable members to a particular problem which has yet to be addressed. I refer to the lack of regulation within the Australian coal industry· and the need, especially now as we seem to be moving into another period of high growth, for a national coal authority. I listened to what the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) said about this. I am delighted that the honourable member seems to have just discovered coal. He spoke against a national coal authority, saying that the owners did not want it and would not wear it. I can tell the honourable member for Gippsland that many coal owners are not nearly as opposed to a national coal authority as he seems to believe. Many from my area have spoken to me and have indicated their support for a national coal authority as it will bring some stability and regulation into the industry. When I asked him why, he said, 'Coal is coal', or some other dreadfully illogical thing like that. When our coal producers go to places such as Japan to sell coal they are kept in hotelsfor instance in Tokyo-and receive telephone calls to go along and negotiate with a centralised authority. That centralised authority always plays Australian coal producers one off against the other. It would seem to me that the Japanese and other buyers would understand and appreciate the value of dealing with a single marketing authority. I have never been able to understand why the logic of that cannot get through. We have the Australian Wheat Board and a meat authority; yet the National Party opposes a coal authority. It has an ideological fix against a national coal authority. I find that very hard to believe. I have always been convinced that we need a national coal authority. Most of the commodities which are traded on the international market-be they sugar, tin, wheat, bauxite or anything else-are sold through government agencies or monopoly groups. In turn they are purchased by groups of consumers who join together to obtain the best possible prices and conditions of sale. As I said before, that is particularly true of Japanese businesses. Australia has many marketing authorities and other regulatory bodies. We should also have a national coal authority. There is absolutely no reason why we cannot have one. During 1983-84, as a newly elected member of this Parliament, I was very quickly made aware of the significance of the huge capital investment made in the Australian coal industry during the 1970s. It became obvious to me then that there should be some form of· regulation governing the opening of new mines and the prices being accepted by some companies. That was a point that my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur made particular reference to. If new mines are to be opened it must be done in an orderly and structured way. Obviously what was needed was not only a national coal authority bU,t, equally importantly, a national energy strategy. Again 1 draw attention to the fact that Australia is one of the few countries that do not have a national energy strategy. Such a strategy is long overdue. Despite my continued efforts, neither of those goals has yet been achieved. As a consequence, during most of the 1980s we have experienced the inevitable consequences of the . boom period laissez-faire approach adopted by so many coalmine proprietors What are the consequences? Good coal in highly productive mines has been left in the ground. Machinery has stood idle, companies have accepted any kind of sale in a desperate attempt to maintain their cash flows, and' many good, skilled workers have been thrown on the scrap heap of unemployment. More than ever before, it has become obvious that the coal industry must be brought to account. It must be regulated. The lives of our workers and their families and the long term economic health of our nation are more important by far than the quick buck for the greedy few. 1 noticed in today's Australian Financial Review that Mr Jim Lewis wants regulations eased. It is interesting that the Leader of the National Party of Australia drew attention to that. What he did not say was that Mr Lewis's criticism, far from being levelled at the Federal Government, as he implied although he did not say it, was levelled at his own colleagues in New South Wales. The headline in today's Australian Financial Review states,. 'Coal chief berates NSW Government'. The New South Wales Government is not a· Labor government; it is a Liberal National Party Government. 1 might say that that Government is in office temporarily. It will not remain in office after the next election. However, at the moment it occupies the treasury bench. Presuming that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics is correct-and 1I have no reason to doubt its forecast-and we are heading for a period of revitalised growth in the Australian coal industry, it is vitally important that we learn from the harsh lessons of the 1970s boom and the 1980s bust. This time round we must be wiser. We must guard against a repeat performance from the less scrupulous mining companies which jumped in for the quick buck and then turned their attentidil and capital elsewhere. The Australian coal industry has shown that self-regulation does not work. It is as obvious as ever, perhaps more so, that we still need a national coal authority and 1 remain as committed as ever to seeing that it is established. 1 commend the legislation to the House.",33
19,Mr IAN CAMERON ,ZZZZZ,"Maranoa) (12.33) -1I have pleasure in speaking to the 'Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill. 1 do so mainly because a number of the mines involved are in my electorate of Maranoa. All the mines that the Bill covers are in Queensland. The Utah company and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) manage eight mines. Six of the open cut mines still paying the tax are owned and managed by Utah-BHP. Utah-BHP is now a whollyowned Australian company. BHP bought out Utah's interests in the company two or three years ago. So we are looking at not a multinational company, as some on the other side might mention, but a' totally Australian owned and manned cbmpany, producing a very valuable product and earning large amounts of badly needed export income. As we know, under the Labor Government our balance of payments figures are at record low levels. Monthly we are running in debt to the tune of billions of dollars. 1 admit that that is not necessarily all the Government's fault, but 1 believe that many of the problems that have been brought upon this nation by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) are due to the mismanagement of the overall economic parameters that must be put in place, continued in place and altered by whichever government governs the nation at the time. It must be patently clear to all Australians that we are running record interest rates. They can be as high as 20 per cent. Of course the export and mining of coal is very much affected by the economic policies of this Labor Government. But I would like to think that Australians have had enough of the sort of economic management that this country has suffered under the Hawke Gov-, ernment. It is time we got rid of this Government. I cannot wait for the election. My good friend the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), who was one of my Antarctic colleagues, is concerned that, his Party may lose government. I can assure him that come the next election we will be governing. I can also assure him that some of the tax regimes that have been put in place, by this Labor Government will be changed and, hopefully, this will be one of them. This is an interesting debating point. I have been having discussions in Brisbane with Peter Isles, one of the managers of the Blackwater mine, which is just outside the town of Blackwater in my electorate. This mine is a very large producer of open-cut coal. It is important to remember that opencut mines started after 1980""such as Currah, some miles from Blackwater, no longer pay this tax. The Bowen Basin contains a continuous strip of coal which runs from central Queensland through Moura, down to Taroom and into the Darling Downs. It is one of the biggest reserves of coal in the world and here we are mining some of the better and easier to get coal. The drag lines used in this, operation are massive pieces of machinery costing anything up to $50m or $ 100m. Massive amounts of power are used to drive those machines. This power is being generated by new power stations which have been established by the National Party Government in Queensland. We have seen enormous development in Queensland under the National Party Government, which has encouraged all sorts of new projects in that State. Mr Hollis-Ha, hal Mr Moore-Ah hum!",36
20,Mr IAN CAMERON,ZZZZZ,"My colleagues from the Australian Labor Party and even the Liberal Party of Australia find it difficult to accept some of my comments about good government by the National Party in Queensland but I can assure all Australians, and particularly those who read Hansard, that under the National Party Queensland has seen enormous progress. Of course, we were in coalition with the Liberal Party for many years while this development took place. Fortunately we have not had a Labor government in Queensland since the Hanlon Government back in the 1950s. That is one reason why we have made such rapid progress since those times. A lot of that progress has resulted from mining and opening up these huge coal deposits, which hold up standards of living in Australia and supply jobs to many Australians who are prepared to go to central Queensland where brand new towns have been established. Many southerners, people from New South Wales and areas represented by the - onourable member for Throsby, have moved north to obtain jobs. Therefore, we cannot knock the Queensland National Party when it comes to creating' jobs and opening miries because it has done plenty of that in the past 25 years. We are very proud of that fact. That process is continuing. Currah is a new mine which is ,not subject, to this tax. This is an interesting tax because it has been imposed on the open-cut industry to force it to mine underground. The tax applies to workings from 50 metres upwards. Once a company mines 15 per cent of its total production below that level it is exempted from the tax. This is an arm, bending tax that has been imposed on open-cut producers to force, them to mine underground. All the union mates of the honourable member for Throsby are trying to force the Government to impose this sort of tax because they argue that it helps them. Obviously more people will be involved. 'However these days, with rapid long line mining and with massive hydraulically operated machines being used underground not so many people are being employed as in the' days of the pick and shovel and donkey carts. Still, this tax has been imposed and only one company is paying it. About, $51m is involved and it means that that company is $3.,50 a tonne behind before it starts to negotiate any sale of coal. That puts it at a distinct disadvantage. Obviously a new mine which does not pay the tax at all-and Currah in' my electorate is an example-has a decided advantage. Obviously, none of us wants to pay tax but we have to collect some revenue. I have always argued and will continue to· argue that any tax imposed at the point of produc- . tion is regressive and does not encourage people to start new businesses. This is one of the reasons why we are in such a perilous economic state today with our balance of payments. We are not producing and exporting enough products to pay for those products we wish to import. We will not balance this by imposing resource rent tax on the oil industry in Bass Strait, where the companies are still paying 80 per cent in wellhead taxation. The interesting point that the Treasurer and the Government do not seem to . understand is that if they· do not impose tax at the point of production they will always recoup it at the end of the day. If a company is able to start up and invest without being excessively taxed in the beginning it will employ more people and make a profit eventually, although it will take a while. At the end of the day the Gov¥rnment will collect more revenue. Any taxation that is regressive should be abolished. This tax should be abolisned, although one could argue that it does help to force the open-cut mine operators to mix. their product and to mine more coal from their underground reserves. It could be argued that we do not wish to take our high quality easily mined coal. Open-cut coal falls into this .category because it is simply a matter of stripping the overburden and going for the coal that is· there. Blackwater South is one of the mines that. have been mentioned. This mine, which is also in my electorate, has been -¥xempted since 1984. The Moura mine, which Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd controls, is mixing its coal with that from the Gregory and Blackwater mines and most of that is done at the port. The coal is shipped down in massive coal trains arid is mixed in the stockpile at the port. Then the coal, of whatever quality the buyer needs, is shipped from Gladstone. It is difficult for companies to mix coal from each and every individual mine because they do not all export their coal from the one port. There is a large port south of Mackay and one at Gladstone, so it is not possible for them to do that. That is why this Bill has been introduced to exempt that part of the mixing which is taking place-because some of the coal is coming from underground, from Moura in particular. As well as these matters that I have mentioned, the industry has other problems. I have already mentioned intere-t rates, which are ridiculous. Business cannot operate with 20 per cent interest rates. There is no business in this country that can operate in such circumstances-except the banks of course. The banks do not lose; they have a margin between their borrowing and lending rates. The borrowing rate goes up and theirinvestment rate goes up, and the margin is maintained and the banks continue to write very nice profits. I do not object to their making a profit; obviously they have to do so in order to stay in business. The banks are not affected but business generally is just devastated by the ridiculous interest rates that we are facing.",37

22,Mr IAN CAMERON,ZZZZZ,"The. Minister at the table smiles about t-lis matter .but I can assure her that if interest rates remain at 20 per cent she will not be smiling any longer. She will have a sad look on her face and she will be sitting on this side of the House. Exchange rates are also a vital matter, and this Government's high interest rate policy is holding up the price of the dollar. Because mines have .to import all their .capital input they are particularly affected by these issues. Most of the high-tech machinery that is used-the drag lines and all the big underground long lining equipment-is imported, so there is a balance of about 75c in the dollarMONICA",38

Questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Bowen should be directed to the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Duffy. NA NA EmptyHere the Treasurer. Why has the rate of growth in the money supply as measured by M3 and broad money accelerated in recent months when monetary policy has been tightened?",38
26,Mr KEATING,ZZZZZ,"For a number of years . growth in monetary aggregates has been a notoriously unreliable indicator of the state of monetary conditions. What we have seen in recent months, as implied in the shadow Treasurer's question, is that faster money growth has not been associated with cheaper money. Indeed, real interest rates have been substantially higher than they were three or six months ago, yet that relationship has obviously changed. One can only conclude from that that the former relationship between the price of money and the growth in the money supply has chimged with reintermediation. Company financing structures are changing, with many corporate treasuries acting like financial intermediaries. That changes the way in which the various measures of money operate in the economy relative to price. But the main point, above all, is that with deregulation monetary policy acts through price, not· volumes. There are not quantitative restrictions any more. They left with deregulati0n in 1983-84. It is· price which rations the system, not quantity. In the past when we had quantitative controls, in the days of regulation under the Opposition in government, one could turn off the supply of funds, as it did to sectors such as housing, and that was it. Money was not available at any price. It did not. matter what the monetary indicators or aggregates showed; it was not available at any price. Now it is available at a price. It means that monetary policy is still as effective; that is, the slowdown occurs but it occurs with a lag and there is some cushioning which comes with the operation of monetary policy in a deregulated environment via price. That is why we abandoned monetary targeting in 1983-84. We were one of the first governments to shake off the yoke of monetary targeting. We did so because we thought then that we would be simply tying ourselves to targets which could not be met. When one looks at the experience around the world one finds that nearly every government which is still targeting the money supply re-bases it and ends up with another target in six months or a year later. This is true in the United States of America. It is still true of Britain. Nigel Lawson still hangs on to a target because, basically, the City of London feels comfortable taking that monetary target, that teddy bear, to bed· every night rather than actually facing the fact that it is living in a deregulated environment. We took it away. I have had no regrets about it. Looking at the indicators of activity-that is, wages, prices, demand, the exchange rate, the terms of trade and all of these factots---'-: gives one a much better handle in running monetary policy than musing over some target which is theoretically obtained in the first place and then bolting oneself to it over the course of the year when conditions can change so much. While it may be interesting to gaze over the monetary aggregate growth rates, as the shadow Treasurer may well have done, the fact is that in the main they· provide reminiscences for unreconstructed monetarists. I am not suggesting that the honourable member for Kooyong is one, because he was not one to begin with. But some people are. What we say is that they have been rolled up and put into the dustbin of economic history. NA NA",39
27,Mrs DARLING,ZZZZZ,"Can the Minister for Employment, Education and Training advise the House about the impact of the higher education contribution scheme on enrolments in tertiary education institutions throughout Australia for the 1989 academic year?",39
28,Mr DAWKINS,ZZZZZ,"It is important to recall that the whole basis of the Government's approach to higher education was an expansion of the number of opportunities for particularly our young people not only so that they could have better careers and futures but also so that they could make a more relevant contribution to the task of restructuring this economy to ensure that Australia is better able to pay its way in the world. We can make the very proud boast already, even though the final figures for enrolments this year are not in-we certainly do not have them in disaggregated form yetthat the student population has grown more rapidly this year than in any year since the mid-1970s. This year we have enrolled 451,000 students throughout Australia, which is an increase of nearly 31,000 or over 7.3 per cent in the figures for 1988. If we look at full time enrolments we see that they are up by nearly 10 per cent-a staggering 9.8 per cent increase to 278,000. Other categories-part time and external enrolmentsare also up but by somewhat smaller amounts. The part time category is up by 1.7 per cent and external enrolments are up by 8.5 per cent. It is perfectly clear that the Government has already been able. to deliver on its first instalments in terms of much greater opportunities for people within the higher education sector. The next instalment will be delivered in 1990. The third instalment will be delivered by, I suspect, the fourth Hawke Labor Government in 1991. There were those who said, of course, that as a result of introducing the higher education contribution scheme enrolments would slump, as they did to some extent with the introduction of the administration charge. It is perfectly clear that that has not happened. Looking a little further into these figures, we are also to make the proud claim that female enrolments are at an all time high. Females now form 51.5 per cent of all enrolments, which redresses the problem which existed years ago when women were very much a minority in terms of enrolments in our universities and colleges. We can also see that Australia is becoming an even more attractive place for students from overseas, with the number of full fee-paying students studying in Australia doubling to over 7,000. That not only means that Australia is recognised for the higher quality higher education that it offers but also it is making a significant contribution to our external account. The other point is that the increase in the number of new starters in 1989, an increase of something like 8 per cent, means that we have been able to accommodate some 70,000 school leavers in higher education. It is enormously important for those young people who have remained on for the full 12 years of schooling to have the opportunity, if they qualify, to go on to the higher education system. I make these observations particularly in the light of what the Opposition is pleased to call a policy on higher education. When we look carefully at what the Government has done with a properly Casted scheme which indeed delivers on better and more opportunities for young people and when we look at the details of the Opposition's policy, we see that there is a massive $300m hole in the policy which will open up in the courseMr Beale-Oh, what absolute rubbish.",39

38,Mr DA WKINS,ZZZZZ,"I make the final point that the Government has been able to provide outstanding record amounts of growth within the higher education system.

NA",41
39,Mr WHITE,ZZZZZ,"My question is to the Mineither ister for Defence. In view of the problems being experienced by the Australian Defence are concerned. Force following the collapse of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA) and the Minister's claims that no checks on the NSCA were necessary, are any financial or security checks made companies or personnel who win large and sensitive defence contracts? If they are not, why are they not? If they are, why were they not made in relation to the NSCA?",41
40,Mr BEAZLEY,ZZZZZ,"From time to time securthere ity checks are run on companies with large contracts with the Department of Defence. Also, in relation to companies with large contracts with the Department of Defence, ance pro-ess. there is sometimes an investigation of financial circumstances. That is done in circumcomments stances in which the Commonwealth puts up hundreds of millions of dollars-or at least tens of millions of dollars. Those are what we would regard as large contracts. Our sources in some regards are often limited and the more we go out to producing goods in the private sector, such as frigates, which hitherto have been produced in the public sector, the more it becomes difficult to put in those financial checks. Nevertheless, we attempt to do that. Also, where a company is working in security sensitive areas of the Department of Defence, such as in the production of sonars for the submarines or radar systems for the FI8s, security checks are done on the company's facilities, and the like. Sensibly, there is an active program of security clearance in those areas. Security clearance is an incredibly time consuming function and it is extremely intrusive, as it must be. Therefore, on simple things like access to bases for the performance of normal contract work, as applies to 1,800 people a month at Williamstown, a sensible judgment is made by security authorities as to whether a partiCular type of work is such as would require a check of that extraordinarily intrusive natilre, to provide the level of security clearance necessary. Sensibly, the Department of Defence and the armed forces have not determined that a monthly contractual arrangement to the tune of some $2 to $3m per year constitutes, in the context of an annual defence budget of $8 billion, the sort of contract that requires those types of financial checks or those sorts of arrangements, as far as the personnel I would have thought that the statement. I read to this House yesterday from the Chief of the Air Staff was eminently sensible. If it happened to be the case that one or two of on the people involved had to go across sensitive areas in their search and rescue activities, they would be accompanied. It seems to me an eminently sensible thing to do. Loads of people go through sensitive areas where is a possibility of sensitive documents being about. Loads of people go through that process accompanied without going through the extraordinarily intrusive security clearThe honourable member for MCPherson's in this regard in the last couple of days have been a real outsider's comments. They really show an ignorance of what is priority in security matters and the security reclearance process itself. To suggest that we should run a security checking process on each member of a participant in a search and rescue activity and that we should those sorts of checks on an outfit which pay on a monthly basis for work done, as opposed to the other proposition in relation to sonar systems, et cetera, I think is extraordinary. The honourable member for MCPherson, in the points he makes, does not check very carefully against the background· of security requirements or even the information which comes to him. I have done some digging since yesterday on the document which the honourable member brought to our attention in the House, which I might say is not a document which requires people to have a security clearance before they can have cess to it. It is not that type of document. One would need a requirement to know and a version of that document was produced for which one would require a security clearance but it was not that one. I have also tried to discover where his suggestion came from, that that document was passed across to military intelligence it did not get up to me. I seem to have come across the circumstances to which the the honourable member referred .. They occurred some time in February this year and involved an ex-World War II army captain, an honments orary mess member and a person in military intelligence. It seems that the gravamen his claims was not about security matters, but about questions related to fraud. The particular military intelligence officer whom the person spoke recognised immedipassed ately, as would anybody who has anything to do with this subject, that it had nothing to do with the Department of Defence. So he instead introduced that person to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). It was not fraud in relation to defto him. ence contracts; it was fraud in relation to the general operations of the National Safety Council of Australia. So that individual was passed across for discussions with ASIO and the AFP. They inform me that the intelligence officer was not involved in the passage of any documents, nor was he aware that such occurred between the individual cerned and any agency.",41
41,Mr WHITE ,ZZZZZ,That was never claimed.,42
42,Mr BEAZLEY,ZZZZZ,"Now the honourable member says he never claimed it. There are run about 100 people sitting up there in the we gallery and others who have been going through the processes of listening on radio and television to what the honourable memquite b-r has said in public who might have a different view about whether that particular document was passed to military intelligence. They might indeed have a different view of whether that document was passed to military intelligence and so might the 100-odd people in this House who heard the honourable member's questioning on the subject. He was pretty free with that document which he considered enormously security sensitive; he tossed its contents around the place. Foractunately for the honourable member, that happens not to be the case. I think the honourable member would have some sense of honour about throwing security sensitive documents around the place, irrespective of whether he thought he could make-MONICA",42
43,Mr WHITE ,ZZZZZ,You are wrong.,42
44,Mr BEAZLEY,ZZZZZ,"Oh, I am wrong! The and honourable member has no sensitivity about throwing security sensitive documents around place. This man wishes to be the Defence Minister of Australia and he has no sensitivity about throwing security sensitive docuaround the place. I am sorry if I am wrong on that. I will maintain the judgment of that the honourable member, in those immortal words of the press secretary of another prominent person, 'misspoke' himself. to I am not saying that the documents were not across to ASIO and AFP because the process of checking has not been able to proceed that far. But as far as the honourable member is maintaining that opinion via the director of military intelligence the advice to me is that, as far as this individual is concerned, no documents were passed across What that intelligence officer clearly recognised was that he did not have a defence problem on his hands; he had a police problem. That is exactly where this problem re.sides. As far as the National Safety Council is concerned, the issue is not an issue about the security of this country. The honourable conmember wanders around the place saying that this bloke is no real security threat; that he is a Walter Mitty. The issue is not about the security of this country. It is about the performance of the Board of the National Safety Council, about the auditors of the National Safety Council, about the affairs and police investigators in. Victoria investigating that sort of fraudulent activity. That is where this matter should be sensibly considered-not here, with the bogus nonprejudice sense that the honourable member managed to perpetrate in this House yesterday and the media in the last couple of days; this bogus nonsense, this funny little game the honourable member plays in which he finally comes into this place with the confession that he does not really think that slinging around security-sensitive documents really matters.

The article in day's Australian which has provoked threats to which the honourable member referred made, I believe-and I hope that all honourable members would believe-a pernot suasive appeal for racial tolerance in country. It was a plea with which I think decent person would disagree. Unfortunately, Dr Henderson is not only individual who has been a target intimidation. The New South Wales Liberal Party member of the Legislative Council, Helen Sham-Ho, was harassed by National Action members last year. Church leaders, parliamentarians and journalists have harassed, threatened or have had their homes attacked. I think you will recall, Madam Speaker, that last week's issue of the Bulletin and Sunday's edition of Face to Face . highlighted the activities of these extremist corporate groups in the community. Just last weekend in Darwin I took the opportunity of warning that there are dark and sinister forces in Australia trading on and that these extremist organisations, such as National Action, are a serious in threat to the social cohesion of our comrilUnity. Their anti-Asian activities are also a threat to Australia's trade, tourism and investment interests. I say this in a completely non-partisan sense. I express the view that I am sure that the leaders of the two Opposition parties in this Parliament would wish to join me in disowning and repudiating the racism, anti-Semitism and violence of extremist elements. They are not representative of the vast majority of our fellow Australians. They are a danger to our social harin mony and stability and they are a danger to standing in the eyes of the world.

47,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"Is the Minister for. Transport and Communications aware of, and has he investigated, allegations that a senior ofof his Department whose responsibiliwave ties were critical to the activities of the Victorian Division of the .National Safety of Australia (NSCA), received bena efits from the National Safety Council? Further, what was the role of the Minister's two officers on the Board of the National Safety most Council? For what purpose was their memMonbership of the State Council approved and the what reports did they submit?",43
48,Mr WILLIS,ZZZZZ,"I am not able to answer the first part of the question. I simply do know the basis of the question. It is true this that of the 41 members of the Victorian no Division of the National Safety Council there were three representatives of my Departthe ment: one from my Department, one from of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and one from Australia Post. I understand that the Council member for Australia Post never actually attended a Council meeting and was only a recent appointment. The other two been had been members for some time. I am not aware of anyone receiving any benefits, which I think was the first part of the question. I suggest that the honourable member give me any advice he has about that and I will certainly chase it up for him. In relation to the role of the members on the Council it is the case that the National Safety Council of Australia; Victoria, had a role in relation to the search and rescue operations conducted by my Department, through the Sea Safety Centre and also by the Civil Aviation Authority in relation to aviation rescue. There area range of semidedicated operators, which included the National Safety Council of Australia, Victoria, who are trained to undertake' search and rescue activities. Their role is to assist at the time of either a sea or aviation rescue requirement in providing that rescue capability. The National Safety Council of Victoria was used to a reasonably substantial degree because of the enormity of the equipment it had available and the fact that a lot of it was on immediate standby and, therefore, could be brought into use very quickly. So in that sense it was highly desirable for the Department to be able to call upon the Council for search and rescue activity. It was in that sense that both the CAA and the Department had representatives on the Council. Beneath the Council of 41 there was a board of nine which, as I understand it, had a role equivalent to that of a board of directors. The Council had a more standoff role and met far less frequently.

49,Dr THEOPHANOUS,ZZZZZ,Is the Minister for Social Security aware of claims that child poverty has grown worse in recent years? Are the claims correct? What is being done to end the curse of child poverty?,44
50,Mr HOWE,ZZZZZ,"I 'thank the honourable member for Calwell. Unlike the jovial chaps on the Opposition front bench, he is genuinely concerned about the issue of poverty in his electorate. I am aware that from time to time members of the Opposition claim that there has been an increase in child poverty during the last few years, particularly during the period that we have been in government. They usually take the end point of those claims as 1986, which was the year before employment growth started outstripping .labour market growth. One very small indicator of the progress the Government has made is the fact that in each year in which we have been in government since 1983 the number of children of beneficiary families, families in which there is no employed adult, has decreased in each year. The prime cause of poverty in Australian society was the massive growth in unemployment that occurred during the period of the previous Government. Each year it increased.

69,Mr HOWE,ZZZZZ,"One can understand the fact that the Opposition is extraordinarily sensitive about contrasts. There has been a quite massive reduction in unemployment-the number of people dependent on the unemployment benefit has decreased by one-third, or 200,000-since we came to government. The prime way in which the Government has sought to address the issue of child poverty has been to establish for the first time in the history of the social security system a standard of adequacy with respect to child payments and then progressively to achieve that adequacy over what, historically speaking, is an extraordinarily short period. The standard of that adequacy was not set by the Government. It was set effectively by research done by institutions such as the Social Welfare ,Research Centre and the Australian Institute of Family Studies, but' primarily by work done as part of the. Social Security Review. The work Professor Cass did established, relatively speaking, what difference the cost of children made to the comparative . situation in different families. Professor Cass and the Social Security R-­ view did the work that Professor Henderson called for in 1975. In establishing the poverty line, Professor Henderson did not believe that he was establishing any basis for adequacy. He believed that further work needed to be, done and that work was not done during the seven years that the Opposition occupied the Government benches. That is the fact of the matter. Under that Government not only did hundreds of children become dependent on the social security system, but also no fundamental work was done or commissioned to establish standards of adequacy. Professor Cass has established standards of adequacy in relation to child payments. Those standards are that children in dependent families or low income working families should receive a standard of 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the married pension rate. That standard is higher than that suggested, by Professor Henderson. It is based on a level of income, in terms of the married pension rate, $40 above the Henderson poverty line. For the first time it recognises in terms of the social security system the crucial element that older children cost more and ought to be paid more. The level of the Government's achievement is that this year younger children will receive 15 per cent of the rate and children of 13, 14 and 15 will achieve 20 per cent of the rate. In addition, we have already achieved for young people aged 16 and 17 through Austudy a level of 25 per cent of the married pension nite. ' This contrasts with the record of the Opposition when it was in government. The Opposition does not like contrasts. Despite the fact that we have had falling national income, we have managed to achieve a massive improvement in the living standards of low income families. Honourable members should contrast that with the record we saw when the Opposition was in government. NA NA",45
70,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"I ask the Minister for Transport and Communications: Is it a fact that the National Safety Council of Australia, Victorian Division, negotiated with the Government for its aircraft returning to Australia special exemptions from otherwise mandatory Customs, immigration and Civil Aviation Authority requirements?

73,Mr WILLIS,ZZZZZ,"I am pleased to be able to advise the House that I have approved variations in international telephone service tariffs in line with the recent Prices Surveillance Authority recommendation to government that general price reductions in international telephone service prices are warranted. The OTC has notified the PSA of the reductions which are intended to take effect from the middle of this year. The PSA recommendation was in response to the Government's December 1988 direction to examine prices for OTC's international telephone service. The House will recall that that occurred after the blatant breach of the wage guidelines by OTC. International direct dialling calls to jor destinations"" representing about threecontempt? quarters of all calls, will be cheaper after the charging rate restructuring. As a result of albatross. the restructuring the average price for these destinations will fall by just over 8 per cent. There will also be & major extension of offinterject, peak discounts. An extra 17 destinations will receive an off-peak discount and the off-peak prices will be reduced by 15 per cent. The new price structure will also result in some price increases, mainly to low-traffic hightions, cost destinations, but the net benefit of price changes will be of the order of a $50m reduction in revenue to OTC in a full year. The price reductions will mean that Ausnot tralia will continue to enjoy some cheapest international telephone calls in the world. This set of reductions in prices continues that. what has been a long term trend in real price reductions in OTC charges, which have fallen by about 50 per cent in the last decade in real terms. The OTC is able to give $50m price reduction at this time because a combination of high growth rates, ecowill nomic buoyancy, and its previous efforts in renegotiating accounting rates with other ternational carriers. These have led to substantial increases in profit levels. The House will be aware that in the last few years OTC has been able to make a very substantial return to the shareholder, the Government. In the last year it paid a $40m dividend Consolidated Revenue. Despite the price ductions, we expect it will continue to give a substantial return to the shareholder. NA",46

78,Mrs HARVEY,ZZZZZ,Can the Minister for Housing and Aged Care inform the House of any current problems with the supply of to generic pharmaceuticals? Do the changes to rethe pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 1 April 1989 encourage the stockpiling of originator brand drugs?,46
79,Mr STAPLES,ZZZZZ,"It seems that some pharmacists have had difficulty obtaining stocks of some alternative brands from their wholesalers. Manufacturers of the alternative brands have been able to assure and convince me that they' do hold ample stocks of both the finished product and the raw materials. Individual wholesalers have reacted differently to the changes. Some are holding ample stocks ready for delivery while others are holding just a bare minimum, or none at all. The problem for pharmacists is that some wholesalers may be wary of holding large stocks of generic brands as major manufacturers of the originator brands have been promoting the view that their products will be relisted. Of course this is not necessarily the case. It could simply be that the wholesalers are not sure which alternative brands will be preferred after 1 April. I have written to wholesalers seeking their cooperation and have been advised that stocks have been increased substantially. In answer to the second part of the question, I am extremely concerned-l am sure all responsible members as well as doctors and pharmacists would be concerned-about the stockpiling of drugs. Stockpiling, or hoarding, of pharmaceuticals is a problem when patients begin to worry about supplies of their medication. It concerns me that much of this worry has been provoked recently by the action of at least one manufacturer who has written to pharmacists urging them to encourage patients to hoard one of their products which was to be delisted. It was to be delisted because that company refused to sell the drug to the Government at the price that .other manufacturers were prepared to sell at. This is deeply regrettable. The creation of uncertainty in the minds of pensioners and the sick and elderly by such promotional material, as well as by misinformation such as the circulation of a press release by the honourable member for Farrer the other day, does nothing for a stable health system. Such actions do nothing for the peace of mind or the health of the sick and elderly of this country.

In fact, we actively encourage members from both sides to visit military establishments if that can be done at a time that does not create major inconvenience for the staff of an establishment. Some aspects of some military establishments are extremely sensitive, and that happens to be the case with the particular military establishment to which the honourable member refers: I am looking at the particular circumstance that the honourable member confronts. I would not want him in any way to be in a position where he did not have reasonable access to his constituents in the appropriate areas of the facility, but it would not be possible to give him, as opposed to the shadow Minister, access to all areas of that facility.

86,Madam SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,Order! The Minister has been properly asked a question. He will answer it.,48
87,Mr HOWE,ZZZZZ,"As honourable members will know, the child support scheme was introduced in June last year to provide effective monthly enforcement of maintenance orders and agreements. We limited access to the scheme at that time to make sure that demand on the courts and the Child Support Agency was manageable. We undertook to remove these limitations as soon as was feasible. We will remove these limitations on 15 April by repealing the child support regulations. The effect is that from 15 April there will be two simple guidelines-anyone who has a maintenance order or agreement already can apply to the Child Support Agency to have maintenance collected by the Agency; and anyone who is a party to a court order or agreement must notify the Child Support Agency of the order or agreement within 14 days of it being made. The Agency will collect the order unless the custodial parent chooses not to have it collected. This change makes the scheme truly universal. The Child Support Agency can now move to be the standard method for collecting maintenance orders and agreements. We have also changed legal aid guidelines so people wishing to obtain maintenance orders get access to quality legal advice. These guidelines will include funding of projects which are cost effective in assisting custodid parents obtain orders. The changes will make the scheme simpler, make the Child Support Agency's services available to enforce all maintenance entitlements for everyone who wishes to use the Agency, and make the legal system more accessible to people who wish to get an order. This session we will legislate for the next stage of the child support scheme, introducing a legislative formula for assessing maintenance and making thesystem much more accessible for people who separate in the future.

89,Mr WEST ,ZZZZZ,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services)-by leave-Construction work on Parliament House has now been completed. The work remaining involves defects rectification and the finishing touches to the formal gardens on the House of Representatives side of the building. As in past years, I will now provide honourable members with the updated budget figures for the project which will bring them to August 1988 prices-just after the commencement of the Parliament's operations. Given the stage reached and the relatively minor movements in the budget, after that period it is my intention for future reporting to revert to six-monthly rather than three-monthly reports. The revised building budget now stands at $914.4m with another $158.4m for the nonbuilding items. The total project budget is therefore increased to $1,072.85m in August 1988 prices. This updating includes $1.64m for the effects of inflation in the three months period calculated on escalating the unexpended portion of the budget. Additional components include $O.77m for redundancy payments and $1.56m for industrial dispute costs. Only $0.32m of this last figure is for costs incurred in the August quarter: there were no industrial dispute costs in July. The other $1.24m comprises costs incurred for a significant strike in March 1988, the reimbursement for which was delayed until now. After almost eight months of occupancy, many of the early minor problems have been rectified. I am sure that members and senators are appreciative of the improved facilities, which of course contribute to the fulfilment of their responsibilities as representatives of their constituents.",49
90,Mr DOWNER ,ZZZZZ,"Mayo)-by leave-We on this side of the House acknowledge the statement by the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) and the fact that the construction work on the new Parliament House has now been completed. I think I speak on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we regard this as a wonderful building and as a truly great achievement. For my own part, every person I have shown around the new Parliament House has been enormously impressed with it as a building. Increasingly, people are coming to regard it as one of the great achievements of Australian architecture, engineering and construction work. It is also a very great symbol of the high value we in this country place on our democratic institutions. Nevertheless, that does not detract from the fact that we have very great concern about the way the costs of this building have continued to blowout. The Minister's statement once more points to instances in which that cost has continued to escalate. The fact that the building was. estimated to cost. not a great deal over $200m when it was first approved as a project and that the end cost is estimated at the moment to be $1,072m is a matter of great concern to taxpayers. One sees in the Minister's statement today that a further $1.64m of taxpayers' money is being expended because of the Government's inflation policies and that, disturbingly, another $1.5m of taxpayers' money is being expended because of the cost of industrial disputes. The sum of $ 1. 24m, $1 tm of taxpayers' 'money, ordinary people's money, is simply being frittered away because of a strike that took place on this site in March last year. That matter needs to be highlighted so that members of the public are well aware of the numerical cost to them of industrial disputation on this site. I wish to make it couple of points about the building now that it is almost complete which are of some minor concern at least to honourable members on this side of the House and I suspect to all honourable members. The temperature in this building still does not seem to be entirely under control. Today is a good example. Just standing here saying these few words I feel quite hot. I suspect that that reflects the temperature here rather than anything else. Secondly, one can still hear through the walls from one member's suite to the next. I would be interested to know whether the Minister has some plans for dealing with that problem which clearly has security implications. Thirdly, people have continued to complain about the design structure of the dining room. I am not sure whether anything more can be done about that-perhaps notbut I know that is a concern for all honourable members. At the detailed level, there is still concern about the radio receivers that we have to pick up the proceedings of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. They are inadequate. I am glad to see the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. ( Mr Duffy) in the House because I know that he will be concerned to see that the receivers were not made in Australia, as is the case with a lot of equipment of that nature in this building. Finally, not that I would wish to advocate higher expenditure when I have complained already about the amount expended, many people have complained to me about the fact that television systems are not available in the offices of members. A very sophisticated television network, which has been quite well publicised, has been set up in this building at great expense, but the only people who are able to receive the information transmitted are Ministers, office holders and those viewing television screens in public areas. I think we need to be realistic about the provision of modern equipment to ensure that the Parliament continues to function as efficiently as it can in the context of technology today. NA BILL 1988 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA CORPORATION (CONVERSION INTO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Barry Jones, and read a first time. Second Reading",49
91,Mr BARRY JONES ,ZZZZZ,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) (3.00)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 to convert the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation-SMEC, as it is known to its intimates-to a public company, called the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd. It will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit SMEC's commercial operations. In line with the guidelines for the reform of government business enterprises (GBEs), as the responsible Minister for the former Corporation I will retain strategic oversight of the new company. The Bill is a major step in implementing the reform package for the Corporation announced by my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button, on 17 August 1988 and is part of the Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of government business enterprises. It is also a further step to those already taken by this Government in the last five years to make SMEC a commercially viable organisation able to stand on its own two feet and to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the international market place. In taking this route, the Government explicitly recognised the Corporation's outstanding international reputation for engineering excellence, particularly in the Asia Pacific region SMEC was ranked sixty-second in a 1988 world survey of international engineering consulting firms its contribution to the export of engineering services both as a winner of export awards and in assisting the development of the Australian engineering consulting industry through joint ventures and in gaining an overseas· track record SMEC's head office will remain based in Cooma and the new company will continue to contribute benefits to the Cooma region. Unlike many other GBEs, SMEC does not have large capital requirements. Its assets lie in human capital and its skills base, as a professional organisation marketing its skills in any international arena. The Corporation was established under the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Act 1970 to preserve the professional engineering expertise developed during the construction of the Snowy Mountains scheme. Its functions now include investigating, advising on, designing, supervising, maintaining and operating engineering works both within Australia and overseas. Since 1970 SMEC has completed 1,350 projects in 50 countries with a capital value of $4,500m and has earned consulting fees of $294m. It has received a capital contribution from the Commonwealth totalling $3.3m. In addition it has paid corporate taxes amounting to$l1m, as well as $7m in State payroll and land taxes and $1.3m in local government taxes. The Corporation recorded losses between 1983-84 and 1986-87, but returned to profitability last year as a much leaner totally restructured organisation. In 1987-88 SMEC recorded an operating profit before income tax of just of $270,000 as opposed to a budgeted loss of. $1.5m. This was a remarkable achievement by the lioard and the Corporation and I believe marks the turnaround in the fortunes of the organisation. The return to profitability is continuing through 1988-89 and I have every confidence that a substantial dividend will be forthcoming from the 1988-89 result. I want to pay tribute here to the efforts of my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services, Stewart West, who as the former Minister for Housing and Construction had responsibility for the Corporation until the changes to the machinery of government in 1987. Acknowledgment is also due to the Board of SMEC under the chairmanship of Geoffrey Cook, for its major achievement in bringing SMEC back to profitability. SMEC has already made large strides in directions marked out by the Government's strategy for GBEs. Since 1983, the Government has made capital injections to fund redundancy packages and provide working capital; amended the SMEC Act to provide greater commercial freedom, and appointed a Board of Directors to give access to a greater range of management talent from the engineering, marketing, finance and trade union sectors. The Corporation has introduced revised management and budgeting systems, corporate and business development plans and marketing strategies. A new superannuation scheme was introduced in March 1987 and consideration is at present being given to bringing this new scheme even more in line with schemes presently operating in the private sector. Other commercial actions taken by SMEC included the disposal of surplus staff housing and adjusting housing rentals closer to market norms, as well as the consolidation of SMEC's operations in Cooma on one site thus eliminating high rental costs. The reform package is a further significant step and this Bill is a major element, bringing the process of reform even closer to completion. Other important elements of the reform package are: revised remuneration arrangements for the Managing Director with the amendment of the SMEC Act contained in the Government Business Enterprises (Miscellaneous Reforms) Act 1988; revised industrial relations co-ordination arrangements; and, new planning and accountability mechanisms. When the nexus was broken with the Public Service Board in June 1986 SMEC came under the umbrella of the Department of Industrial Relations. Now, under the draft revised arrangements, increased responsibility and autonomy is to be devolved to SMEC but it will be expected to continue to comply with Government wages and industrial relations policies, and with guidelines-yet to be approved-which will specifically apply to: wages and conditions of employment matters covered by the national wage case principles; terms and conditions of employment with flow-on implications such as leave, allowances, hours of work and penalty payments; redundancy and retrenchment conditions; superannuation as an element of remuneration; and procedures for handling significant industrial disputes. New planning and accountability mechanisms include the provision by SMEC of a three-year rolling corporate plan. This plan is to be updated annually and is a comprehensive document outlining the Corporation's goals and financial targets, and strategies and. actions to achieve those goals. It also includes an assessment of the commercial environment. I also intend to maintain strategic oversight of share purchases .in subsidiaries and associates, and the establishment of subsidiaries and joint ventures. Financial targets will be set and SMEC will report annually giving account of performance against goals. There is at present a senior departmental officer with observer status at the Board meetings and it is intended that this practice will continue. It is also intended that the current composition of the Board remain unbe changed with the present directors being initial directors of the new company pending the first general meeting. As with any public company SMEC will be subject to its Memof the Government. orandum and Articles of Association and these will be prepared by the Attorney General's Department. On behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, I will exercise control in a similar manner to shareporate holders in any other company. In accordance with the proposed Memorandum and Artiporation cles of Association I shall have the power appoint and dismiss the SMEC Board direcrangements tors. Following conversion to a public comthe pany I will issue policy guidelines to directors as and when required. The Bill by making SMEC subject to. the Companies Act 1981 has the twofold of making SMEC a public company and enabling the removal of many of the statuquirement tory controls that have applied in the past and which are inappropriate for a public company. The requirement to operate in cordance with the Companies Code. places on directors responsibilities to sharehcildersliable in SMEC's case the Commonwealth-and on other obligations which provide for the tection of the Commonwealth's interests. is intended that SMEC start operations as a of the Crown. public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory· on 1 July 1989. To summarise, this Bill: provides for the conversion of SMEC to a public company under the Companies Act; maintains the corporate identity of SMEC so that all existing contracts, its taxation position and other assets and liabilities are uncl;langed upon conversion; provides for all staff to continue employment on their present terms and conditions and preserves all their accrued entitlements; removes the day to day bureaucratic controls over the commercial decision making processes of the Corporation; and replaces these with the strictures of the requirements of the companies legislation, and places SMEC on the same footing in this regard as any other public company. In conjunction with the Bill, mechanisms will established for strategic oversight of the the new company's activities by the Gov-rnment and to ensure that the company operates within wages and. industrial relations policies A major benefit of this legislation is that the company maintains the same corporate entity as the Corporation. Continuity of corentity dispenses. with the need to transfer assets and liabilities from the Corto the new public company and to means that all contracts, agreements and arentered into by or on .behalf of Corporation which are in force immediately .before the transition to a. public company will apply to the new company. This route is the same as that taken by other GBEs such as Australian Airlines and Auseffect tralian National Line. The Bill removes controls such as the refor the Treasurer's approval for individual borrowing arrangements, and investment and banking arrangements. Howacever, SMEC will remain subject to the Loan Council global borrowing limits and will be for the Commonwealth borrowing levy any borrowings. It will however forgo all proforms of government guarantee and will not It be able to claim protection from the shield The Bill also removes the requirement for SMEC to obtain ministerial approval for nonproject related contracts, and the requirement to have its accounts audited by the Auditor-General. The SMEC Board must - ated seek my approval to the appointment of the proposed company's future auditor. The amount of share capital will be fixed under the Bill at a maximum of $5,207,807, which represents the capital contributed by the Commonwealth as at 30 June 1988 less acsince cumulated losses. The capital will be divided into $1 par shares, with all shares to be held, at least initially, by the Commonwealth. The Bill also allows for shares to be issued will retain those rights. at a premium which is to be determined by me. If a premium is determined, there will be a transfer from the share capital account to a share premium account to reflect that premium and the number of shares issued will be reduced accordingly. The purpose this is to allow for the possible future duction of a staff equity participation scheme. The share premium account would be necmonwealth essary to enable the repurchase of shares from the staff as they leave the employment of SMEC. The possibility of such a scheme is currently being considered by this Governpany ment and will not be introduced without prior consultation and agreement of SMEC's staff and unions. The Bill provides for the conversion SMEC into a public company in four steps. The first step involves the creation of capital and the application by SMEC to the ownership. National Companies and Securities Commission to be registered as a company. When SMEC issues shares, provisions of the current Act which relate to the current capital structure of SMEC will be repealed, by proness clamation of the relevant repealing provision in the Bill. The next step is the transition of SMEC to a public company. The final step is automatic and ensures that SMEC mainensure tains its present corporate entity. That is, section of the current Act dealing with the establishment of SMEC is,. by force of the Bill, repealed immediately after SMEC becompany comes a regis-ered company by proclamation of clause 12 of the Bill. The taxation position of the Corporation is to become position· of the company in all respects, including losses. On transition to a public company each adjourned. staff member of the Corporation will become an employee of the company on the same terms. and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the Corporation. Accumuread a first time. entitlements such as long service and recreation leave and sick leave will be preserved. The existing provisions covering superannuation will be maintained on transition for staff who are members of the Commonwealth superannua,tion scheme. All new staff the introduction of the SMEC scheme in 1987 are only eligible to join the SMEC scheme. Those staff who have mobility rights under part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 . The Bill also contains consequential amendments to other Acts to ensure that the new company remains subject to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987 and of exempt from the Freedom of Information introAct 1982. The schedule to the Sales Tax Assessment Act which identifies those Combodies which are not exempt from sales tax will be amended to delete reference to the Corporation. SMEC was not previously exempt from sales tax and as a comit will continue to pay sales tax.. The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth, nor State and Territory taxes on the transfer of assets as part of of the proposed re-organisation of SMEC in recognition of the fact that there will be no share change in the Commonwealth's beneficial This Bill represents a further step in the Government's program of micro-economic reform in the freeing up of government busienterprises from the burden of detailed day to day bureaucratic controls, but maintaining strategic oversight controls. It is also a further step in the Government's efforts to the full commercial viability ofSMEC, the recognising its unique position as a government-owned consulting engineering firm and its leading involvement as an Australia.n in engineering consultancy projects in our region. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and I commend the taxation the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Cadman) BOUNTY (SHIPS) BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Barry Jones, and Second Reading",50
92,Mr BARRY JONES ,ZZZZZ,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) (3.17)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes new legislation, the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989, to provide bounty assistance to Australian shipbuilders from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1995. The Bill incorporates changes in policy announced by the Government in November 1988 following the Government's consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission's (lAC) report Ships, boats and other vessels dated 29 June 1988. The current legislation, the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980, provides for a cash limited bounty assistance scheme to shipbuilders who commence construction of vessels prior to 30 June 1989. The proposed Bill will continue this form of assistance, at rates which will be phased down until June 1995, when the bounty assistance is proposed to cease. The continued assistance for that period is considered essential so that this industry can continue to build on the significant gains in efficiency and competitiveness it has achieved over the last few years. The Government's 1984 decision to extend bounty payments to include those built for export and to tighten registration regulations for bounty purposes has led to an export orientation on an unprecedented scale. Currently export orders amount to $300m. Recent orders include two unique high speed catamaran car and passenger ferries for the Irish Sea. Ten fishing trawlers are being built for an Indonesian company and two luxury motor yachts worth more than $120m left Australia in February for the United States. This is a significant reorientation for the industry. Over half the vessels completed in the first half of this year have been for export, whereas in 1984-85 only one ship was exported from Australia. This success has been achieved only by the ,industry investing heavily in marketing, capital equipment, new technology and training. However, although the need for bounty assistance for the shipbuilding industry is reducing as the industry becomes more vibrant, withdrawal of assistance at this stage wOl,lld be premature as the cost of entry into the international market has resulted in trading losses for many firms in their initial years. Accordingly, the Government favours a continued period, of assistance and believes that a bounty is the most appropriate form of assistance considering the impact that a tariff would have on ship users' costs and the contraction in local demand for ships. The lAC has also concluded that a bounty was its' preferred form of assistance. The Government therefore proposes in this Bill to introduce a new bounty scheme with the following elements: To be eligible to receive bounty under this bounty scheme, clause 4 provides that a vessel will have to be between 150 and 10,000 gross construction tonnes and be both self-propelled and navigable. Other floating structures, such as floating hotels, Sydney Harbour tunnel sections and other non-self-propelled floating structures, will not be bountiable. There is no special provision for commercial fishing vessels in this bounty scheme such as exists in the 1980 Act, as' this was originally introduced to coincide with a manning level which is now no longer relevant. Clause 5 of the Bill provides that bounty will be paid on the costs incurred by a shipbuilder in producing a bountiable vessel at the rate applicable when the costs are incurred rather than paying bounty on the cost of the vessel at the rate applicable when the vessel is commenced, as occurs under the existing bounty scheme. Bounty, will be paid on the production of ships regardless of whether they are for export or domestic use. Such a bounty, unlike specific export subsidies, is not proscribed by Australia's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Treaty; indeed the proposal to phase out the shipbuilding bounty is in accordance with the spirit of the GATT to remove all production subsidies for manufactured goods. The only exception is that in accordance with the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA), subclause 9 (1) of the Bill has been included to exclude from eligibility for bounty vessels exported to New Zealand after June 1990. Clause 10 of the Bill proposes the phased bounty rates to provide bounty assistance in the following manner: For bountiable costs incurred between 1 July 1989 and 30 June 1991, 15 per cent of the eligible costs constructing or modifying the vessel plus 20 per centfor overheads will be paid as bounty to the shipbuilder completing the constructo tion or modification of the bountiable vessel; for costs incurred between 1 July 1991 30 June 1993, 10 per cent of the eligible costs plus 20 per cent for overheads will be paid as bounty; for costs incurred between July 1993 and 30 June 1995, 5 per cent of the eligible costs plus 20 per cent for overyears. heads will be paid. No bounty will be paid on any vessel completed after June 1995. To be eligible to receive bou rity ing must meet the clearly defined registration criteria proposed in clause 17 of the Bill. These criteria have been introduced so that assistance is channelled towards those shipwill builders who have the potential to be world competitive. We have valuable empirical eviinitial dence of the effects of a laissez-faire proach to manufacturers'· ability to seek shipbuilding bounty-this system operated during the 1980 to 1984 period result was a moribund and severely fragmented group of 91 part time shipbuilders adjourned. who were primarily engineering jobbing shops and fishermen or ferry operators seeking to minimise the capital replacement costs via bounty. I hope I will not be thought unduly political if I point out that the Government a first time. was in office for most of that time. In 1984 the Government targeted the assistance to shipbuilders with a long-term commitment to their particular industry. The aim then as it is now was to create a world competitive industry capable of exporting capable of long term survival with lowering levels of subsidy. A number of changes have also been made to administrative provisions of this Bill. to streamline further the scheme's operation. For example, the method of overhead alloalso cation has been significantly simplified. longer is it appropriate to base assistance around protection as was done in the 1980 reports. Act. This Bill positively encourages higher utilisation of overheads whilst recognising need for a sound core of what may be loosely termed indirect costs or overheads before shipyard can genuinely become a world petitor. The criteria requiring applicants employ 40 persons arises from .our analysis of these aspects. Evidence shows that firms of with fewer employees simply do not have the capacity to meet the aims of this package. Analysis of data on the position relating new entrants to the industry since the introduction of registration criteria is also and revealing. More than 40 firms have been registered since 1984, while at anyone itime there are normally around 20 active builders. 1 Many of today's success stories emanate from firms new to this industry over the past five This Bill is designed to maintain the momentum achieved by this industry while finally reaching a point where direct assist, shipbuildance is no longer required. Financial Impact Statement It is anticipated that the cost of this bounty be $145m over the life of the scheme, based on November 1988 dollar values. The outlay for 1989-90 will be $24m rising apto $33m in 1990-91. Thereafter, it will gradually decline. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memoand the net randum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by' Mr Cadman) NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Humphreys, and read Second Reading",54
93,Mr HUMPHREYS ,ZZZZZ,"Griffith-Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (3.25)-I move: That the Bill be now read a .second time. and The purpose of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 1989 is to clarify the intention of certain provisions of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 which deal with the provision of assistance to entitled persons for the acquisition of a home. The Bill would make a minor technical amendment to No the provisions of the Defence Service Homes Act dealing with the preparation of annual Since 9 December 1987, entitlep veterans the and members and ex-members of the Defence Force have been able to receive defence a service homes loans which are portable from comhome to home. This means that a person to who borrows a defence service homes Joan after that date may have any amount which . is .still owing on that loan immediately before its discharge re-Ioaned for the subsequent purchase of a new home. This benefit continues to be provided in respect of all new loans made under the revised delivery arrangements of the defence service homes scheme. These arrangements were agreed to by the Commonwealth and Westpac Banking Corporation and approved by Parliament in November and December of last year. The arrangement which applied in all cases before 9 December 1987 was that the approval of the Minister had to be obtained before the balance of a defence service homes loan could be re-Ioaned to purchase a new home. This arrangement continues to apply to borrowers who received their loans before 9 December 1987. The circumstances in which such ministerial approval is or is not required were included in the amendments which were made to the Defence Service Homes Act on 19 December 1988 by the Defence Service Homes Amendment Act 1988. Those circumstances may not have been made sufficiently clear and the purpose of this Bill is to put the intended meaning of the relevant provisions beyond doubt. At present, it is arguable that the Act does not require that ministerial approval be obtained for the reuse of the balance of a defence service homes loan to purchase a new home where the loan in question was discharged before the vesting of the Defence Service Homes Corporation's assets in Westpac. The Act also would seem to require that any person who has received ministerial approval for the reuse of the balance of a defence service homes loan must seek such approval again for any subsequent use of any remaining balance of the loan for the purchase of another home. Neither of these possible interpretations is intended and the proposed amendments would restore the intended meaning of the provisions in question. The intention broadly is that any person who received a defence service homes loan before 9 December 1987 and, in a small number of cases, after 9 December 1987, must obtain the Minister's approval before a certificate can be issued by the Secretary authorising the payment of interest subsidy in respect of the reuse of any remaining portion of that loan for the purchase of a new home. However, it is intended that once such approval is given, no further ministerial approval is necessary should the borrower at any future time wish to reuse any remaining portion of the subsidised loan to purchase another home. The amendments also would exempt from the requirement to obtain ministerial approval, those persons who are deemed to have been borrowers of defence service homes loans or purchasers of dwelling houses under contracts of sale with the Defence Service Homes Corporation only because they are or were personal representatives of deceased borrowers or purchasers. This exemption would enable any such persons who have entitleinents to defence service homes assistance in their own right to apply for and receive such assistance withou,t being affected by any previous or existing status· they may have had as the personal representative of a deceased purchaser or borrower. The amendments would be effective from 19 December 1988 in order to ensure that any persons who received assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act without obtaining the ministerial approval which, upon a strict interpretation of the Act from that date, may have been necessary would be exempted now from having to have obtained such approval. The amendment also would authorise any assistance which may have been given from that date without ministerial approval to applicants who previously had been personal representatives of deceased purchasers or borrowers. The Bill also would amend the Defence Service Homes Act to achieve consistency between its annual report provisions and similar provisions in other Commonwealth legislation. The amendment would ensure that the powers of the Auditor-General are not restricted unintentionally in relation to his ability to report to the Minister on the financial statements which are required to be included in annual reports under the Defence Service Homes Act. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. CUSTOMS TARIFF (COAL EXPORT DUTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed.",55
94,Mr IAN CAMERON ,ZZZZZ,"Maranoa) (3.32)- introducing In the few minutes that I have contribution to the debate on the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill I point out that part of the coal industry established in my electorate of Maranoa. BHP-Utah group of companies is the only group paying this tax. The Commonwealth they receives $51m in revenue from it. The probwhich lems that the industry has are not much different from those of anybody else in busistream ness these days. The interest rates and the exchange rate are very important to coal exporters because almost all of their ucts, like those of the wheat or wool produchaving ers of Maranoa, are exported and. have to compete on the so-called deregulated world market. Often all we can do is take the best price offered on that market. I support the type of regime which is in place to help the companies maintain the price, particularly in areas such as Japan where there are one-buyer operations. The wheat industry and the beef industry, in ticular, have to compete against the buying cartels of other countries. The only way can maintain our share of the market is by selling under some sort of sensible controlled arrangement. Our dollar is at an artificially high level because of our enormously high interest rates, which the Government is using in its monetary policy. The only way it can attract any sort of investment to this is by having a high interest rate. The real price for the dollar is somewhere between 65c and70c. Obviously among nations of world our credit rating has dropped. It has even been suggested that we will go down to a one star rating. We are down to a two rating with our credit borrowing. We are now up to $100 billion in borrowings overfrom seas. This has posed problems for industries such as the coal industry which have to borrow overseas to develop. One of the main problems that the owners have in the field is the unions. The owners have found it very difficult to negotiate the coal unions since the Coal Industry Tritional bunal has been established. Only one person is in charge of it, a chap called David Duncan. This industry is isolated from the mainstream of unions. The owners tell me that the coal unions themselves have become fairly backward in their outlook to progressively new work practices and helping left in my to increase production. Queensland has a coal reference commission, of which a Mr MCCrossan is the Chairis man. Members of the unions are appointed The to that Commission. People in management tell me that one of the main problems is that are very restricted in that this tribunal, looks at the wages, conditions and work practices, is isolated from the mainof the general tribuQal and the general work practice area in Australia and this is hindering progress and production in the prodcoal industry. The Government has been lots of problems with the coal unions. I believe that this tribunal ought to be opened up and come under the general tribunal associated with industries of this sort and not be restricted just to the coal industry. In concluding on this Bill I say again that any tax imposed at the point of production, before the product even goes into use, is regressive. Although it can be argued that a partax of this sort could be used to force and encourage coal companies to .mine underwe ground as well as open cut, this nation can ill-afford to tax its export producers under these sorts of arrangements. It is time we looked seriously at withdrawing the tax and arriving at some other arrangement whereby the companies are encouraged to mine some underground coal as well as mining the eascountry ier, better quality open cut coal.",57
95,Mr BARRY JONES ,ZZZZZ,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) the (3.38)-in reply-I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. As noted in the debate, the Customs Tariff (Coal star Export Duty) Amendment Bill amends the principal Act to retain an existing exemption duty where the exempt coal is blended with other coal. The purpose is to enable the mines in question to take advantage of commercial opportunities available in respect of the blended coal. As noted, the duty applies only to the six mines operating in the Bowen with Basin in Queensland. The Leader of the NaParty of Australia ( Mr Sinclair) supported the Bill, but suggested that the duty should be discontinued altogether. That was a view that was echoed by other contributors to the debate from the Opposition, who also suggested that the duty caused hardship to the mines concerned. The honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) also argued-I suppose he did not use quite those terms-that the tax was regressive. It needs to be pointed out that the six mines involved are among the lowest cost operations in Australia and are operating profitably. They are not subject to economic hardship by the coal export duty. The duty provides an important source of revenue to the Commonwealth, amounting to $52m last year. Ideally, the Government would replace the duty with a resource rent tax, but this would require the cooperation of the States. The indications are that that would not be forthcoming. the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) complained bitterly about freight rates in Queensland, but it is thought that it might be more appropriate if he takes up these representations with the Queensland Government, an entity over which we have little or no control over. That was a point that my colleague the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis) observed in the debate. He was also supported more than adequately by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin). The final point on freight rates in Queensland is that if the Government were to discontinue the export duty, some cynics might express the view that the Queensland Government would very quickly raise the freight rates again to take up the slack and the net gain to the industry would be nil. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Barry Jones) read a third time. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 March, on motion by Mr Robert Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",57
96,Mr BLUNT ,ZZZZZ,"Richmond) (3.40)-This is a monumental piece of legislation which affects a range of issues. It is a great pity that I have only 30 minutes to talk about it, because I would like to speak all day about the issues raised in this piece of legislation. As members of the House will be aware, I will be moving an amendment, which I think is currently being circulated in my name, and which indicates the Opposition's concerns about the Government's approach to some areas of road funding and the administration of .aviation policy in Australia. I will be speaking more about those issues as time permits. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should: (1) reverse its policy of cutting road funding, recognise the significance of roads to the Australian economy and community and return more than 4.95 cents per litre of the 22.39 cents per litre fuel excise to road funding; and (2) review the operations of the Federal Airports Authority and Civil Aviation Authority to ensure they operate to the same standards of efficiency and cost control forced on· the aviation industry by the discipline of market competition"". I should begin with an issue which is of daily concern and of growing urgency in the Australian community; that is, the appalling state of our roads and the absolute neglect by this Government in relation to adequate levels of road funding-absolute neglect. We have a situation where, year after year, this Government's contribution to road funding declines. Last year the Government contributed 5.66c a litre to roads and our roads were falling to pieces. This year the Government is contributing 4.95c a litre to maintain our roads. Mr Robert Brown-Spending it well.",58
97,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support says he is spending it well. Let me say to the Minister that in 1984 the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) promised us a dual highway between Sydney and Melbourne for our Bicentenary. Our Bicentenary ha- come and gone. We do not have a dual highway. We still have the most horrific road smashes on the two-lane sections of that road. I ask the Minister: What . is the Government's priority to upgrade the standard of that highway and when could we expect a dual lane divided highway between Sydney and Melbourne? As the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support knows, the incidence of accidents on divided freeways is considerably less than the incidence of accidents on undivided highways. Mr Lee-When was the Hume Highway built?",58
98,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"The point of the matter is-and I would remind the honourable member for Dobell-the veracity of the Prime Minister. In 1984 he said that by the end of last year it was his Government's priority to provide that dual highway. There is no other issue. It is a question of whether the Prime Minister was fair dinkum when he made that promis- and whether he genuinely is concerned on behalf of his Government about the appalling road toll. I am not about to indulge in the politics of accusing the Minister, or any individual member of this Government, of being responsible for the road toll. I would not do that, but I would make the point that up until this Government decided to abdicate totally its responsibility for road funding, there was a slogan promoted by a former Minister for roads that stated, 'Better roads are safer roads'. That Minister proceeded to calculate the benefit· in lives of expenditure on roads. The present Minister for Industrial EmptyHere Government did that; not we, not the Opposition. The Government, when it felt it was in a position to do it, said, 'Better roads are safer roads. We are spending this many million dollars on roads. We calculate that for every $4m we spend on roads we save a life'. The Government then proceeded to take credit for doing something about the road tolls in the course of its expenditure on roads. If that is the standard that this Government sets for itself, then it must also accept those standards when it reduces the expenditure on roads. It cannot walk away from the issue. If it is going to, it is going to repudiate the statements of that Minister. Those statements are on the record: they are included in his speeches and everybody knows about them. There is ample 'evidence of the growing concern in the community about the issues of road safety and the standards of roads in this country. Let me to go to the complete sleight of hand that this Government has perpetrated on motorists in this community. Last year, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill was introduced in this place. That Bill provide a so-called guaranteed minimum level of funding. It provided a funny sort of hypothecation to arrive at a spending figure of $1.215 billion a year. The Minister said, 'We will be indexing that expenditure by the implicit price deflator, because we feel that is the right way to go'. But the Government persists in indexing the excise on fuel by the consumer price index (CPI). At the time, the line run by the Government was that motorists would be much better off to have their road funding indexed by the implicit price deflator. That was before the blow-out in the CPI, which is going to continue. Mr Robert Brown-It went up again.",59
99,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"By the same amount? I would ask the Minister, in his summing upsince he has decided to participate early in this debate-to bring into this House a calculation as to what will be the impact on the Government's tax revenues of the CPI blow-out. Let him not give us any of these funny fudged figures or any of these budget assumptions on CPI. Let us have some realistic figures for the CPI and then let us have a look at what will be the impact on the indexation of the road expenditure. Let us put the figures down on a piece of paper and let us have them looked at objectively. Let us have some non-government tame economists have a look at the as-mptions that underlie the Minister's calculations. Yes, the Minister is pointing at himself. I remember reading his textbook on economics. I am glad I also read something else. Nobody in this community is happy with this Government's approach to road funding. The Australian Automobile Association-Mr Hollis-They are in my electorate.",59
100,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"Are they really? I will come to the honourable member's electorate and talk about roads for him. I will bring a few people from Cullerin, Yass and Goulbutn. Mr Hollis-You said no one was. happy. They are happy in my electorate.",59
101,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,I will come and talk to the people of the honourable member's electorate about roads and we will see how happy they are. I will ask his local government association how happy it is about roads.,59
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,"Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! The honourable member will not respond to the interjections and me-bers on my right will cease interjecting, particularly the honourable member for Throsby.",60
103,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,You should name him.,60
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,If the honourable member for Richmond does not continue the. debate he might find that he gets off-side with the Chair as well.,60
105,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am doing my level best, but I am suffering from the interjections from across the table and from the back bench. Mr MCGauran-Give him protection. Protect the honourable member.",60
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,60
107,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate your protection. Let me say that in this legislation the Govern-ent purports to honour an undertaking given by Senator Gareth Evans in the Senate some time after midnight on that celebrated one-day sitting of Parliament at the end of last year .. It does honour one undertaking, but there IS no honouring of the undertaking also given by the good senator that the Government would make changes to the way the Australian Centennial Road Development Act treated public and private urban transport networks. Mr Robert Brown-Yes, it does. It is in the notice of administration. MrBLUNT-It is not in the Bill. The reality is that it is doing nothing about its friends in Victoria and their plans to socialise the private bus transport systems of that State. I· can well understand why the Government has not included such an amendment in the Bill. Despite the Government's protestations that it intends to treat equally both public and private urban transport sectors, the Liberal and National parties had to force Senator Evans to make the commitment. In that operation we had to deal with the Australian Democrats. The Government's reluctance is understandable. Its rhetoric on this whole issue is contradicted by re-lity. Its .Labor colleagues in Victoria at th-s very time are trying to socialise the pnvatebus urban public transport network 10 Melbourne at a cost to the Victorian people of over $60m a year and a capital cost of $lOOm to $200m. While the Prime Minister talks and talks and keeps talking in a hairy-chested way about privatisation and micro-economic reform and his commitment to achieving efficiency in the economy, his friend Mr Cain in Victoria is showing the true policies of the La-o- Party. - he Labor Party is going to socialise the pnvate aspects of public transport. It expects the public to put up with that approach, notwithstanding the total cost to the commupity of transport inefficiencies in this country. There are currently 1,000 private buses providing urban public transport services in the Melbourne metropolitan area. A private bus costs just half what it takes to operate a government bus. So every private bus saves the taxpayers around $60,000 a year, and the Minister is now about to allow his friend in Victoria to expand a very inefficient and expensive public bus system. He is indirectly going to facilitate that. I wonder what the cost to the road user is going to be if the Government bankrolls that little operation. --er- bit it spends on public transport facilIties IS another dollar it cannot spend on putting down blacktop. The Minister knows that. He knows exactly what the provisions of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act are in terms of State governments' rights on public transport facilities. The great difficulty is that this Government is not prepared to treat urban private and public transport evenly. This is a further betrayal of the traditional Labor voter. In most major capital cities the established government owned and . operated public transport networks are in the older suburbs the higher income suburbs, the suburbs th-t do not have the propensity to vote Labor. - n Sydney, it is' the eastern suburbs, the North Shore and the northern beaches. We could go on. There is a similar pattern in Victoria. So where does this Government facilitate the expenditure of money under the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act? Mr Lee-Have you heard about trains?",60
108,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"Has the honourable member heard about a bus interchange to meet a government train in the western suburbs of Sydney? He has not. There are none. There is no preparedness to facilitate the financing of interchanges between rail and road transport in Labor electorates in the western suburbs of Sydney because the buses in the western suburbs of Sydney are not government buses; they are private buses. So it is rather curious that this Government, which has a genuine commitment to the workers, to the people who live in the west, where they need facilities, is not prepared to facilitate the expenditure of funds in those areas to upgrade public transport. No-one is talking about buying buses for private operators. What we are talking about is providing a more efficient public interchange. When is this Government prepared to do it? It is not. The Business Council of Australia has prepared some very interesting figures on transport inefficiencies; Let me read them to the House. The Business Council, in a report on transport reform, showed that reform would result in gross domestic product rising by $6 billion, or 2.3 per cent. It says that the flowon effect would be real consumption rising by 2 percent, employment rising by 17,000 new jobs, investment· rising by 4 per cent, real wages rising by 2.5 per cent. It says that the Government surplus could increase by over $1 billion which, t!!.I<en over the longer term, could be seen as a 3 per cent cut in· income tax. That is what is at stake in terms of transport reform in this country-not just roads, not just the issue of public buses versus private buses in Melbourne, but shipping and airlines and roads and railways. The Government will not come to grips with it. It has ha,d six years in power. The priority for the third term of the Hawke Government is micro-economic reform-'Here we are doing our level best to engineer a window of opportunity to call an election'-and nothing has been done about micro-economic reform. Last night and this morning in this place we debated a loan guarantee Bill for the government-owned airline, which is desperately in need of privatisation and nothing has been done. That is a simple issue. I concede that the shipping issue is' complex and difficult. I also remind the Government that it has been in office six years. I say to the Government that the issue of privatising Qantas Airways Ltd is nowhere near as difficult as shipping reform and that it could have been done simply. Now is the time to do it. The need to do it is urgent. Nothing has been done. My point is that the Government is prepared to ignore those sorts of savings, those sorts of real benefits to the Australian community. It is prepared to facilitate crazy schemes, madcap schemes, by a Socialist Leftdriven government in Victoria, That is what is behind it. The Socialist Left of the Labor Party has got control of the Cain Government, shaking it by the scruff of the neck and saying, 'You will implement our ideological agenda'. The same sort of redneck, left people have Caucus by the scruff of the neck and are prepared to shake and rattle it to stop any worthwhile change to aviation policy. I began my comments by talking about the Hume Highway and asking .the Minister exactly what his priorities are. Let me remind him that the' Hume Highway is a national highway. Mr Lee-Since 1974.",61
109,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"That is when all the work has been done-since 1974. Since 1974 it has been a national highway. How long has the Labor Party been in government? It 'has' been in government since 1983. How much work has been done since 1983? Before we get into this debate, who actually established the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Fund?",61
110,Mr CADMAN ,ZZZZZ,Ralph Hunt.,61
111,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"Did he really? My colleague here tells me that the former Minister for Transport in the Fraser Government, the Hon. Ralph Hunt, the former member for Gwydir, set up the Bicentennial Road Development Fund. That is news to me. If I believed the words of the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, ·who is at the table, I would be of the opinion that the current Government set it up. At a press conference in Sydney the Minister at the table-and he may have been confused or badly briefed or a bit embarrassed by some of the questions he was getting-tried to claim credit for the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Fund. I have it on tape, so he should not bother trying to deny it. have actually got that one on tape. I also have his comments on freeways at Badgerys Creek and what he is going to do with the Treasurer's precious surplus, which is probaccepts ably a mark of the Minister's economics textbook. Mr Robert Brown-You should read the new one.",61
112,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,I would like to see the new questions one. Mr Robert Brown-I will send you a comto plimentary copy.,62
113,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"'--Thank you. I would welcome a copy of your textbook. I would like to see what you say about the economic significance of social infrastructure, too. Another aspect of this Bill relates to tion issues. If honourable members think the Government's record on road funding is its record on aviation is even worse. Aviation is appalling. We have talked about the need for micro-economic reform. It is no wonder the Government has got nowhere. A decision as to where to pour a slab of concrete in Sydney was a problem for the Government. our economy. Government members procrastinated;' they tied their stomachs in knots; they mucked around, and a Minister resigned over it. They had late night Cabinet meetings. You name it, they had it. After the most incredible decision-making process the Government deposed. cided that it could pour concrete at Mascot in 18 months time, after the environmental impact study was conducted-after the end of this Parliament. The Deputy Prime Minnot ister, the honourable member for Kingsfordan Smith ( Mr Lionel Bowen), gave Governrisy ment members a lecture in Caucus about what a crazy decision it was. The entire right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales is bucking the decision. It is astounding. No wonder the Government cannot take any other tough decision in transport. It cannot even pour concrete, let alone decide what it is going to do with Australian flag shipping and a few other more interesting issues. At a later stage we will move an amendnancing ment to one of the provisions of this tion because we are concerned that both the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil industry. Aviation Authority (CAA) do not operate aviation to the same standards of efficiency and cost and, I minimisation as the industry which they run is supposed to. Under this Government's policy, we have cost recovery. There is, no real argument against cost recovery. Everybody that the user must pay. The industry accepts it, although it does not particularly like the way that it has been brought upon it or the time it has had to adjust to the change in policy. It questions the equity of the charges, in many cases rightly so. It also the efficiency of the administrators. The one point that the Government failed address when it introduced cost recovery for aviation was cost control. There is no cost control. The administration of aviation has the right and the obligation to recover its costs but what are the constraints on those costs? That is something aviathat the Government has failed to address; it is incapable of addressing it. The, Governbad, ment is unaware of the consequences for general aviation and aviation in terms of regular public transport in this country. Every excess of administration will eventually be paid for by the travelling public of this country. That is very relevant to the efficiency of We will suggest that instead ofimposing penalties for non-payment of some charges after 28 days it would be more appropriate to take it back to what it was prior to 1984 and allow 45 days before penalties are imWe do that recognising that the Government does not pay its own accounts on time, yet it has the temerity to impose 'a standard on industry that it' cannot and will meet itself. That is why we will move amendment. It is symbolic of the hypocof the Government when it comes to standards that it imposes on people whom it purports to be governing for the benefit of. To show the duplicity of the Government I will read from an excellent item that appeared in a recent issue of Australian Aviation. It is instructive for members of the House to understand exactly the way in which the Government, and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in particular, goes aboutfigovernment operations. It is headed legisla- 'Covert Theft'. It reads: First there was cost recovery for the aviation At the time this was not opposed by any body as the user pay's system was inevitable if managed properly, was fair to all concerned. What occurred though was a rush by the Federal Government to bring in total cost recovery in around eighteen months rather than the five years that Henry Bosch had' r-commendedin his landmark report to EmptyHere in 1984. While this naturally did not enthuse the industry, at least it coincided with a period of relative growth within the industry and a reduction in the number of overall employees within the then Department of Aviation. What happened then however was the beginning to a long slide downhill where today the industry must continually pay more and more under the present expansive cost recovery guidelines in order to meet the continually changing guidelines as to what actually dictates recoverable income. First major example of this form of covert theft was when Treasurer Paul Keating announced in May of 1988 that the $20 departure tax wa- going to be dropped (along with the illegal and incredibly bungled $5 arrival fee)I will have more to say about that laterin favour of a $10 departure tax. The problem here was that the $20 departure tax went completely to balancing the aviation related budget and would have contributed around $80m to cost recovery in 1988 alone. The proceeds of the new $ 10 departure tax now go straight to consolidated revenue with no positive implications for aviation at all. Result-the aviation industry must naturally find the shortfall of up to $80m per annum (and a figure that was growing rapidly due to the increase in tourism, etc) to balance the Government's aviation books. But the story gets worse. Effective January 1st 1988, the Federal Airports Corporation took over the responsibility of operating the bulk of Australia's larger airports. Six months later on July 1st came into being the Civil Aviation Authority. The task of the CAA was to undertake the previous safety and operational responsibilities of the old Department of Aviation (or the DoTC in its dying days) plus operate the airways and ATC divisions, etc. However, in creating these two new Authorities, the Government failed to advise the aviation industry that it would have to fund a new round of costs that in this case could only be termed as blatant theft of the industry's moneys. The catch is that the new Authorities, like Telecom and Australia Post, are now in their new semi-Government form liable for a wide range of costs that they weren't as purely qovernment departments. In other words both the CAA and FAC are now liable for such additional charges as Sales Tax, Customs Duty, Fuel Excise, Payroll Tax, Motor Vehicle Registration, Company Tax, Local Government rates and taxes and last but not least Government dividends. On contacting the CAA we found that for 1988/ 89 they would be up for between $20m and $25m additional costs just to pay these inbuilt 'pretend' costs. We say 'pretend' as the new costs do absolute1y nothing to facilitate an improvement to either the CAA or FAC or for that matter anyone in the industry itsel,f. The article goes on in that tenor. I quote it because I think it is appropriate for members of the House to' understand the resentment of the industry and the awareness of the industry of the Government's financing policies. It is very significant to understand that the Government is collecting additional revenue by the back door. Rather than saying it will increase charges, it imposes a tax on an authority that is charged with cost recovery. It calls the tax a cost and then has it recovered rather than have the political courage to recover the cost directly. The Government would rather recover the money through the back door. Because time is short I now make a few comments about some parts of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. Basically, what the Government purports to do here is retrospective. For that reason we oppose it. This particular amendment is designed to compensate for a complete bungle in Telecom that goes back to 1980. The reality is that it is retrospective; that the amount of money is not large; that it is extremely difficult for anybody to determine exactly what money is involved. But the principle is very important. Should a government, some eight or nine years after the event, bring in retrospective legislation to ,cover up for a bureaucratic bungle? Our attitude is that it should not and we are not prepared to support that aspect of the legislation. I will give an example of why it is important to stay with that principle. I am told that today the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs' (Senator Robert Ray) is going to meet with the Ombudsman about illegally imposed immigration review charges. Some $2. 7mand some 11,400 people are in question. The principle is exactly the same. The Government's Telecom. operation-whatever vehicle it' was using at the time-made a mistake. It now seeks retrospectively to correct that mistake. That is not on. It is not acceptable to legitimise retrospectively illegally imposed taxes and charges. Does the Government propose next week or the week after to legitimise this apparently illega:! charge? . 1 made reference to the incredibly bungled-to quote the Australian Aviation article-immigration charge, the $5 clearance fee or departure charge, which was found to be illegal by the High Court and which is still subject to a determination as to what the Government should do with that charge. 1 would hate to think that the Government would be tempted to bring in here legislation that retrospectively legitimised that tax and relieved it of any responsibility-irrespective of a court order; 1 do not know what judgment has been made-to pay it back. That sort of retrospective correction of errors is just not on. If any organisation makes a mistake that wrongly takes money from people, it should pay it back. If a government instrumentality makes a mistake it should acknowledge that mistake and fix it as fast as possible. Telecom had the opportunity to fix this particular mistake earlier than at present, yet it chose to go down the course of requiring the Government to bring in here a retrospective amendment. It is not acceptable to the Opposition and we will oppose that part of the Bill. We do not have too many objections other than that.",62
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,Mr MiIdren)-Is the amendment seconded? Mr Jull-I second the amendment.,64
115,Mr LEE ,ZZZZZ,"Dobell) (4.10)-1 seem to have developed in recent debates a reputation for following the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt) or the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Jull). 1 hope that is not something that continues for too long. According to the honourable member for Richmond, Australia's roads are in a terrible, shocking state. 1 listened very carefully and at no stage during his contribution as the shadow Minister did he say what would be different under the Opposition. Mr Hollis-They never do.",64
116,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,"They never do, as the honourable member for Throsby says. At no stage has the Opposition promised to spend one extra cent on roads. When the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), goes around to all the business lunches, he being a member of the Australian Financial Review business lunch set, he promises that the Opposition, its members being the hard line dries that they are, will cut government spending. It will cut government spending on welfare, health, education-and roads. Members of the Opposition cannot have it both ways. They cannot say they are going to cut government spending while their spokesmen for all the different areas in which money is spent go around saying that their area will be exempt from any future Budget cuts. For the information of the shadow Minister, 1 read into Hansard the transcript of an interview with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) which occurred on 1 December last year. The transcript of the interview reads: Question, 'What is your policy on road funding, are you going to increase them and if so by how much?' Answer, 'Roads will be much better under us.' Question, 'Will you be increasing road fundsa very simple question: one would think there would be a simple answerAnswer, 'We have not made a decision on that.' Question, 'Why not?' Answer, 'For the simple reason that you can't make a decision on an item like that which is essentially a discretionary budget decision about percentage of funds in isolation from other decisions that you make on the fiscal side of a spending and taxing nature.' Question, 'Isn't Senator Stone on record as saying he would cut them by $100 million?' Answer, 'He may be or he may not be. I don't know. But you're asking me what the policy is.' Question, 'Is that policy?' Answer, 'The policy is that we have not made a decision on the precise quantum.' Question, 'So it's possible you could cut road funding?' Answer, 'We haven't made a decision.' Question, 'That means it's possible.' Answer, 'We haven't made 'a decision on the ac. tual quantum. I'm not trying to be clever. I'm just saying we have not made a decision.' So there we have the Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition's chief spokesman on all these budgetary issues, saying that the Opposition cannot make a decision on how much it would spend on roads. I am a bit disturbed that Opposition members come into this House day after day saying that the roads in their electorates are so bad that the council is digging up the bitumen roads to turn them into gravel roads. 1 suggest that any council that makes that crazy decision is controlled by National Party councillors. Opposition members cannot have it both ways. They cannot be suggesting that this Government should be spending more on roads, putting the boot into our side of politics, when they refuse to make any commitment at all on how much they would spend on roads. From the way the honourable member for Richmond harped about the state of the Hume Highway, one would assume that Australia had perfect roads on 5 March 1983, when this Government was elected. Mr Downer-Hear, hear!",64
117,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,"The honourable member at the table interjects. He believes that there were perfect roads when the Fraser-Anthony Government went out of power. Those opposite are saying· that Australia's terrible road conditions are solely the responsibility of the Australian Labor Party and the Labor Government and that past Liberal-National Party governments, which in fact spent less on road funding than this Government, have no responsibility at all. Mr Downer-More.",65
118,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,The shadow Minister says that that is not correct. Let me remind him that this Government in its six years since 198384 has spent over $7.4 billion on Australian roads. Mr Hollis-A magnificent record.,65
119,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,"It is a magnificent record, as the honourable member suggests. How much did the Fraser-Howard Government spend? Only $3.7 billion. Sure, $3.7 billion in those days had greater purchasing power-Mr Downer-You bet!",65
120,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,"That interjection demonstrates a great understanding of economics. When we adjust the figures for the effect of inflation we can make a comparison in real terms. In the six years of this Government, we have spent 21 per cent more on roads than the Fraser-Howard Government did in its first six years of office. I believe that that destroys this Opposition argument that the Labor Party is the only party which has cut back road funding and which has not spent enough on roads. The truth is that, when the coalition was in power, it spent less on roads than this Government has in its six years in office. In response to many of the comments made by the honourable member for Richmond on the state of the Hume Highway, I remind him that the Hume Highway was declared part of the national highway program during the Whitlam years. During the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government, from· 1949 to 1972, we had no road funding at all for our national highways. It was a revolutionary concept when the Whitlam Government suggested that the Federal Government, through its greater revenue raising powers, should allocate funds to the States so that our national highways could be raised to a proper standard. Major improvements were made to the Hume Highway because of funds allocated initially by the Whitlam Government. Some were allocated in the early years of the Fraser Government. I am aware of a stretch between Gosford and the turn-off to Canberra which was constructed because the Whitlam Government declared the Hume Highway part of our national highway system. . What happened during the Fraser years? What was done on the Hume Highway then? I do not claim to be an expert on every kilometre of the Hume Highway, but I know that very little at all was done during those years. That is a bit embarrassing, given the large number of Liberal and National Party members who represented in this House that part of Australia through which the highway passed. What were they doing when their Minister sat on the Government benches, when funds should have been allocated for the Hume Highway to provide more dual carriageways? They sat on their hands and said nothing. What has happened on the Hume Highway since this Government came to power? We have the Mittagong bypass, work on which is scheduled to commence this financial year, at a cost of $62m. The Berrima bypass was opened-Mr Hollis-Two weeks ago.",65
121,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,I thank the honourable member for Throsby for reminding me of that fact. The total cost of the bypass was $70m. The Illawarra Highway interchange would be of great interest to the honourable member for Throsby. Mr Hollis-There was $20m on that.,65
122,Mr LEE,ZZZZZ,"It was completed in 1987. The Marulan bypass was completed in November 1986, and the Tumblong deviation was completed in November 1983. This Government has been responsible for a massive acceleration in the construction program for the Hume Highway. Those on the other side will say that there are still problems with the Hume Highway at Cullerin and in the section between Goulburn and Yass and, therefore, the present Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) and this Government are responsible. For them to argue that just shows how low they will go to score a cheap political point. The Opposition did nothing during its seven years in office and yet it expected this Government to flick its fingers and suddenly produce dual carriageway from Sydney to Melbourne. I believe the people of Australia have a right to know how little the Opposition did and how much this Government has already achieved in its short period on office. One part of our road network I do know more about is the section between Sydney and Newcastle. This Government has spent a great deal of money under the national highway program in that area. Recently the Minister was present at the official opening of the new section of freeway from Wahroonga to Berowra. Built at great costalmost $100m-it is a stretch of road which will save lives and cut almost 25 minutes off a trip to Sydney by my constituents, who live on the central coast of New South Wales. In recent years the magnificent Mooney Mooney bridge has been completed and opened by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). The Wallarah Creek to Palmers Road stretch of freeway, which cost more than $70m, was also completed. I think back to the bad old days when people seeking to drive from Sydney to Newcastle had to wind along narrow single lane stretches of highway and when there were frequent deaths at trouble spots such as Peats Ridge. I think many people have forgotten how greatly improved that stretch of road is today, mainly because a great deal of money has been spent in this area under the national highways program. On the question of where money is spent, I remind the house of the campaign by the Australian Automobile Association to spend $6m of its members' funds, the money of the people of Australia who belong to the Association, on a media campaign to attack this Government. The Association is not lobbying local and State governments asking them to spend more on roads and road funding but is simply, for purely political purposes, attacking the Federal Government as if the Federal Government is the only one responsible for spending money on roads. I ask the people who run the Australian Automobile Association, 'Why can you not do something with that $6m about the service you provide to your members?'. I heard of a case the other day in which someone had to wait almost two hours to get service from the National Roads and Motorists Association because, the NRMA said, it did not have enough drivers on the road to provide a quick service. Why is some of that $6m not being used to provide a better service to members? Why is some of it not being used to cut back the massive increases in insurance premiums for people who in-ure with the NRMA? I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you compare NRMA insurance rates with some of the others you will get a bit of a surprise. . On one other aspect of road funding, I wish to draw to the attention of the House some items which were brought to my notice in an article by Pilita Clark and Tom Burton in the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 March about the whole question of road funding. The article provides some figures prepared by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. The article states: One of the NRMA's more recent as showed a semi-trailer going along severely damaged roads. The caption said: ""Every year, roads like this add $130 to your grocery bill."" What they should have said was that every year trucks like that add $173 to your fuel bill and $130 to your grocery bill. Because trucks are heavier, have more axles and travel longer distances they cause much more damage than cars to the road system. The article goes on to quote the figures provided by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. We have to remember that heavily laden trucks cause many times more damage to our road system than does the ordinary car. The damage goes up by an exponential rate. I believe that the Government has every right to demand that those who own trucks and make a living out of the trucking industry make a fair contribution towards the upkeep of our roads. I know that there are great difficulties in the trucking industry for owner drivers, mainly because it is a cut-throat industry. People will charge very low rates to try to win a job because it is such a competitive industry. In addition, some people will throw good financial advice to the wind and sign up at very high interest rates, putting up their houses as security, for loans to purchase a rig, and then enter the industry in desperate financial circumstances. I do not think the fact that the trucking industry cannot get its act together and the fact that there is an excessive number of owner-drivers competing for the limited number of jobs available means that the Australian motorist has to subsidise that industry. I do not think it is right that the average motorist, whose car does not do much damage at all to our road system, has to subsidise our taxation system to repair the damage done to the roads by the trucking industry. I said late last night in the adjournment debate that I believe that tachographs should be installed in trucks which travel across the country. There has been a very substantial increase in the number of fatalities involving heavy vehicles this year and last year. I suppose those opposite would say that the increase in accidents on the road is the fault of the Labor Government. We should accept that when we have truck drivers breaching the motor transport regulations by driving for periods up to 18 or 20 hours without a break and, if we can believe certain media reports, using amphetamines to stay awake, it is quite natural that in some cases there will be driver error. The fact that drivers are sometimes charged with negligent driving demonstrates this conclusively. I believe that to protect the truck drivers from themselves we should raise with the trucking industry the proposal for the installation of tachographs to provide a record of the speeds that trucks have been travelling and the period for which drivers have been in the driver's seat. We have to do something about this worrying increase in the number of major vehicle accidents involving heavy vehicles. In a totally different area, this Bill deals with the Broadcasting Act. It has been of concern to my constituents on the New South Wales central coast that many of them have great difficulty in obtaining a clear reception of several channels from Sydney and Newcastle. In particular, those living near Tuggerah Lakes in the Wyong Shire have great difficulty picking up the three Sydney commercial channels and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). For many years governments of all political persuasions have been saying, 'Don't worry; one day we will build you a translator which will provide you with a clear signal'. At least under the former Minister for Communications, now the Minister for Trade Negotiations ( Mr Duffy), the Department of Communications finally agreed to the construction of translators at Gosford, in the Boudi National Park and at Wyrrabalong, near Forresters Beach. I expected the new translator at Wyrrabalong to be broadcasting by today, providing clear television reception to my constituents. Unfortunately, due to a dispute between the consortium of commercial television stations and Gosford City Council, the construction of that translator was delayed by more than a year. The major difficulty was that Gosford City Council had no ratepayers or residents who would benefit from the clearer signal provided by that translator, which would mainly help the ratepayers and residents of the adjacent Wyong Shire. As a result, Gosford had no incentive to solve this impasse quickly. I have been critical of the Council on many occasions for delaying by one year the construction of this translator. The good news is that this translator will be up and operating in July-August of this year, when my constituents will receive very clearly channels 7, 9 and 10 from Sydney. It will solve a major problem which has been of great concern to my constituents for many years. I have recently taken up with the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) the issue of when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the SBS are to be received on the Gosford translator. When the new translator at Gosford was opened the residents of Gosfordcity had to wait a fair time-almost one year-after the commercial television stations were. transmitting on the translator before the SBS . and the ABC caught up and had their signals broadcast from it. I expressed to the Minister my deep concern about any further delay in the establishment of the SBS and the ABC on that translator. I am pleased to say that the Minister has taken action to make sure that the SBS and the ABC will broadcast from the Wyrrabalong translator from day one, which means that those of my constituents who like to watch the soccer telecasts, the films and the news service which the SBS provides, will get that service from day one .. I commend the Government for that. I commend the legislation to the House and reject the Opposition's usual narky negative comments. I commend the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, who is at the table, for continuing to allocate substantial amounts of money for Australia's road system.",66
123,Mr JULL ,ZZZZZ,"Fadden) (4.30)-The gentleman who just sat down, the honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee), mentioned at the beginning of his speech that he usually follows either the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt) or me in his replies to speeches in the transport and telecommunications area. I must say that it is a great pleasure to follow him. Unfortunately I will not do to him what he usually does to me, and that is somewhat of a bucket, except to say that I have a great deal of sympathy with the last section of his speech regarding the provision of television translator services in areas of difficult reception in his electorate. I have exactly the same problem, but I do not live in a geographical position that is as difficult as his. My electorate encompasses an area called Upper Mount Gravatt in Brisbane. More than 500 people are deprived of virtually any decent reception of television services a matter of only about 10 kilometres, as the crow flies, from the Brisbane television stations and their transmitters. A great deal of work has been done on that over the last 10 years to try to get the Government to force the issue and to provide people in the metropolitan area of Brisbane with at least a reasonable television service. So he has my sympathy. I hope that he does not find the difficulties, not only with the television stations but also with the Department, that I have found in recent times since I have taken up that fight on behalf of my constituents and some of the constituents in the neighbouring electorate of Moreton. The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill that we are debating today is fascinating. It covers a great range of areas. It covers the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952, the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988, the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985, and the Telecommunications Act 1975. One could wonder why there is such a full range of items coming up in this one omnibus piece of legislation. When we look at it, we find that a lot of it has been brought about by faulty draftsmanship; indeed, a lot of it has been brought about by oversights by this Government in some of the legislation it has pushed through this House previously. There are a couple of aspects of the legislation that I would like to address my remarks to today. Before I do that, can I say that I fully support the amendment that has been brought into the House by the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), especially the part regarding the provision for 4.95c per litre of the excise duty on fuel to be put towards road funding. Despite what the honourable member for Dobell might have said about the sums of money that have been spent by this Government, a closer examination will show that there have been some new formulas and that. the situation of road funding in Australia is getting to desperation levels. It goes beyond the national highway system. Right around Australia at the moment local authorities are desperately short of funds for their own local road funding. Every time the matter is raised with me by a couple of my local councils, they push home the fact that in real terms they are getting less and less from the Federal Government to enable them to provide some most important roads, not only in my electorate but, indeed, in many of the local government. areas around Australia. The honourable member for Richmond was quite right to introduce that amendment in relation to this Bill. I do not think it is outrageous at all to request that just 4.95c per litre of the total collection by the Government of 22.39c per litre on fuel be allocated for road funding. That is a most significant figure-22.39c per litre. That is the taxation that is· being paid now by the Australian consumer. It is not only road users who pay the tax; there is a, fuel tax in all sorts of areas. Honourable members should speak to members of the shipping industry, the fishing industry and the pleasure boat industry about some of the charges they have to pay. Of course, they do not drive their boats or ships on roads. but in many cases they are still subject to this tax. I support that part of the amendment that has been brought forward by the honourable member for Richmond which deals with the review of the operations of the Federal Airports Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure that they operate at the same standards of efficiency and cost control forced on the aviation industry by the discipline of market competition. Right around Australia now a great deal of concern has been expressed about the operations of the Federal Airports Authority, especially from general aviation. At the moment general aviation in Australia is very angry indeed at the new charges that are continually being imposed upon it by this Government. I think an almighty row will develop with the imposition of the gate charges. Already we have heard from a number of general aviation operators and from some private operators that they are looking towards private airports to facilitate the landing and storage of their aircraft. They are going to move right away from the Government aerodrome services. While some economic rationalists might welcome. that move, some problems concerning safety of general aviation would arise if those operators moved to private strips that do not have the facilities and do not have the right infrastructure to service thqse aircraft. As time goes on I think we are going to hear more and more from the general avia-ion industry about the real difficulties t,hat these new charges are imposing upon it. Part of the amendment we are ,dealing with today to the Air Navigation (Charges) Act concerns the imposition of penalties on late payments if the operators do not pay the appropriate fees within 28 days. I think it is a shocking indictment on this Government when it imposes additional penalties for late payment after 28 days when government instrumentalities such as Telecom Australia is now paying its bills in up to 90 That· really is a crazy situation. The Commonwealth and its instrumentalities should be meeting the same requirements for the payment of their bills and their charges as those imposed on private industry. This is a very real example of the callousness the Government shows towards industry when it will not live by its own standards. I would like to speak briefly today on the changes to the Telecommunications Act 1975. The proposed amendment to this Act allows Telecom to validate a number of routine zonal and telex changes which have been inadvertently implemented without by-law authorisation. As the honourable member for Richmond pointed out, this is retrospective legislation. We on this side of the Parliament are totally opposed to retrospectivity and, once again, I think it is a shocking indictment on the Government that it has been willing to introduce that sort of legislation to cover up some of its past problems. The other area of interest is the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the amendments there .. We are told that the proposed amendment to section 890 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 will remedy an oversight in the preparation of those provisions in the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act 1988 which introduced the new streamlined scheme of limited licences. Of course, there was just a minor mistake there by the Government. It happened to leave out the fact that some of these limited services could well be delivered by satellites, both now and in the future. We are making this, amendment to make those particular services possible. If there is any criticism we can make of governments of all political persuasions over the last 20 years, I think it probably lands fairly and squarely in the communications area. One of the areas that have been of concern to me is that successive government departments appear to lack a great deal of vision in the implementation of new telecommunications services. I do not say that unkindly, but I do not think Australia has a very good record in the way it has brought on new services. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might remember, for example, that when Australia went to colour television it had a unique opportunity to start using the UHF system, to clear up the bands and to provide days. additional services. Some years down the track we are now using that particular sys- . tern. It is not completely satisfactory because a great number of television sets in Australia just have not got the capacity to pick up that UHF signal. It has been interesting in Canberra to see the literature that has been put into the mail boxes since the recent introduction of aggregation to the Canberra television market. That is just one example. Let us look at what has happened to the delivery systems that are being used by our satellites. We have poured an awful lot of money into launching those satellites to have a delivery syst-m that is unique in the world, that no other country in the world is using. In fact, we have a situation now where no other couQtry in the world would ever think of using the system we have. The fact that it has limited the number of services that can be provided through satellites I think should be of some concern to us. I wonder jll:st how much vision there is in some of these areas when we look at what is likely to happen in the electronics industry in the next few years. Last year I was able to travel to Japan and I spent a. great deal of time looking at the development of high definition television. Obviously that will be the next stage of television development in Australia. Once it is fully developed, high definition television will be the most remarkable facility available in Australian homes. It is true that the J apanese have undertaken the initial development and are trying to push the world to accept fully their system. It is true also that there has to be a great deal of development in the United States because the Americans are looking at adapting high definition television to their system and very little is being' done at. this stage to adapt it to the PAL system or the European system which we use in Australia. I would rather hope that the people in the technical areas' of our Department would already be looking very closely at what developments are taking place in the delivery of high definition television. Australia does not want to be the last to receive this new technology. We do not want to be left behind, as we have been to a great extent in the provision of cable television services. ' Australia could have gone to a cable network in 1963. We had the capacity to start in 1983 to open up Australia to cable in 1984 and the present Government let that go. We have yet another inquiry on now on the provision of pay television services. I serve on the parliamentary committee which is looking at that. It will be one of those services that Australia probably will not be able to receive until well into the mid-1990s. Yet some of the services have been provided around the world for years. High definition television and its provision to Australia should be very much on our agenda for the picture clarity and the quality that can be provided. The whole cable area should be taking our attention too, because one of the things that could well happen if we do not get into that particular act in a hurry is that Australians could become information poor compared with people in other countrieS. The prospect of cable television is not restricted to movies, news, sport and pornography; as has been suggested in some areas of the press in recent times. Cable television, especially with the introduction of fibre optics, has, the capacity to revolutionise Australia's communication system. It has the capacity to deliver into our homes a great range of opportunities that are not there now and which could probably never be delivered on the restrictive delivery systems that we have by conventional means and by satellite. I raise an area which I think should be examined very closely and that is the prospect of the revolution of the education system in Australia by virtue of fibre optics. It will be possible to expose virtually all Australians to higher education, because through a fibre optic cable system there would be enough networks to be able to bring lectures, in terms of higher edllcation or even general education, into every home in Australia. The prospects that fibre optics provide in terms of services such as electronic banking and home shopping-everything from the booking of theatre tickets to general information services---:-are absolutely tremendous. I would hope that with the examinations of the provision of these services that are being made by the Government at the moment we would not just be looking at restricting ourselves to providing perhaps a couple of movie channel, a news channel or a sport channe1. I believe that developments in the electronic communications industry will be absolutely fantastic in the next 10 years. We this place should be doing everything to the Government and its various departments to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of this technology; that Australia develops this technology, because there is a tremensocialists dous export market available for Australian industries if we are up there with the leaders. We have done very well indeed in the opment of fibre optics. Most importantly, would hate us to be in a situation where Australian families and people lacked access to the information services that were available in most developed countries. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Richmond.",68
124,Mr HOLLIS ,ZZZZZ,"Throsby) (4.44)-I am very pleased to take part in this important debate. I was interested in the comments made by the preceeding· speaker, the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr lull), especially those concerning communications. I am also a member of the committee looking at pay television although, I think,· not as active member as the honourable member for Fadessentially den. I support the honourable member's comments, especially those concerning fibre optics. Also, I had no argument with his plea and suggestion that we should be at the in forefront of this very important technology: As he so rightly said, that technology revolutionise education in this country. think that in the past Australia has lost by not keeping up the research that done. One could look at a whole range of thing!! in relation to which in the 1940s and 1950s we were world leaders. but, through poor decisions or not being adventurous enough in investment opportunities and on, we missed the opportunity. When we talk about pay television and on, I sometimes wonder a little about our priorities. These matters are very much the developed world. Recently I visited Mozwere ambique and Ethiopia where there is no telnever evision. It is not their priority-let alone television. However, I do not dispute the plea by the honourable member for Fadden as I believe that we must take· advantage the technology. We must maintain our lead, especially in the field of fibre optics. It is always interesting in this chamber hear our agrarian socialist friends opposite make a contribution. I do not put the in honourable member for Fadden in that caturge egory; I refer to the contribution of the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt). I find it very hard to take-in fact, quite galling-when I hear those agrarian talk about traditional Labor voters. What would they know, or indeed care, about a traditional Labor voter? Before the develhonourable member for Richmond starts I bandying terms about traditional Labor voters, he should be asked what he would know or care about a traditional Labor voter. I support the legislation before the House. Naturally, I reject the Opposition's amendmerit. The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill contains proposed amendments to six Acts. Those fairly wide ranging Acts are the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952; the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960; the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988; the Broadcasting Act 1942; the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985; and the Telecommunications a Act 1975. The proposed amendments are technical in nature. As a preceding speaker said, sometimes Bills are introduced to correct a drafting error. However, these amendments are essentially technical nature. They either clarify existing provisions or formalise existing arrangements. The could amendment to the Australian Centennial I Roads Development Act honours an underout taking given in the Senate last year during .we have debate on the Bill for that Act. I will confine most of my remarks to roads and relate them to the amendment contained in the Australian Centennial Roads Develso opment Act. Recently, I have seen reports in newspapers and in other places claiming that Australia's roads are worse now than so they were 10 years ago. What absolute rubbish! How anyone can write or say that the for Australian roads are worse now than they 10 years ago is beyond belief. Do they go on the roads? Were they not drivpay ing on the roads 10 years ago? I know that when I was elected to this place in 1?83, I drove to Canberra because my electorate is of quite close to the Australian Capital Territory. I continue to drive to Canberra. My driving time has gone from 3-1hours to just to over two hours. Occasionally I have paid a bit of a penalty for that two-hour journey, but keeping within the speed limits I can now complete the drive from my home or office to Canberra in just over two hours, whereas when I was elected in 1983 it would take me up to 3t hours to make that journey. But now I am being told that in 1989 I am driving on a worse road than I was in 1983 or 1979. Opposition members are putting this rubbish around and I ask them how they can do it. How can honourable members opposite look at themselves in the mirror in the morning, then go out and make this sort of a statement? It really is taking credibility to the limit. We all know we want more money allocated to roads in the same way as we would like more money allocated to a whole range of areas. But to say that because we are not allocating more money the roads are worse than they were 10 years ago, is taking credibility-even the credibility of politicians which sometimes tends to be a little bit questionable-to the absolute limit. As I have told the honourable member for .Mayo ( Mr Downer), my own case is a case in point-I can now keep within the speed limits and be here in a little over two hours, whereas when I was elected in 1983 it would take me 3t hours to drive to Canberra. The record of the Hawke Labor Government in regard to roads is outstanding. We have an excellent record. Not only have we given the States and local government increases in real terms but also spending on roads for which the Federal Government has sole financial responsibility has dramatically increased. Two weeks ago it was my pleasure, together with the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, to be at the opening of the $80m Berrima bypass. I heard my colleague the honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee) refer to the expenditure as $70m, but it was actually $80m. The opening of this magnificent new road· fulfilled an election promise made by me in 1983 that Berrima would be bypassed. Two weeks ago the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support opened that bypass. Work has also commenced and is progressing on the Mittagong bypass. Since my election in 1983 the Hawke Labor Government has spent more than $150m in the electorate of Throsby. This is not only a magnificent achievement but it also shows how my area was neglected when it was represented during the preceding seven years by a Liberal member. I might say that with the opening of the Berrima bypass the only disappointing or perhaps sour note was that the former member, who now happens to be a senatorSenator Michael Baume-arrived late when the opening was almost finished. Then, after appearing in front of the television cameras and press photographers he sneaked away as is his wont and issued a totally inaccurate, scurrilous press release claiming that all sorts of things would have happened had he still been the local member. Had he still been the member, the trucks would still have been trundling through Berrima and the kids who attend the Berrima school, who were at the opening of the bypass, would still be taking their lives in their hands when they crossed the road. That would have been his. contribution had he still been the member. He was the member for seven years and did absolutely nothing to ensure that Berrimll; and Mittagong were bypassed. Last night in this very chamber the EmptyHere spoke about the New South Wale Government not nominating a road in his electorate as a national arterial road and thus making it eligible for funding under the Government scheme. I have a similar situation in my electorate, where I cover both the Southern Tablelands and the coastal areas. Every local government body, every State and Federal member of whatever political party and every group in those areas supports the linking of the coast and the highlands by a new road which we have designated the Caloola Pass road. The Minister came to my electorate and listened to my cogent arguments as to why funding should be provided. The problem is, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we cannot direct Federal funding to the States and say that it must be spent on this· particular road. It is up to the State Government to set the priorities. For some reason the present Government in New South Wales refuses to nominate Caloola Pass as a high eno1,lgh priority to receive funding under the national arterial· road program. Honourable. members may well ask why. I am not a suspicious person but the fact is that in the last New South Wales election every seat in my area returned a Labor Party member. If one had a suspicious naturewhich Ido not-one might think that the Liberal-National Party Government is again kicking and punishing the people of the 11lawarra for having the audacity to vote Labor. That is the only reason that we are not being funded for this very important road. (Quorum formed) I thank honourable members for coming into the House to hear me repeat that the Greiner Government in New South Wales is kicking and punishing the people of the Illawarra for having the audacity to return all Labor Party members at the last State election in New South Wales, as they did at the last Federal election. As the honourable member for Chifley mentioned, the New South Wales Government is trying to impose a toll on a road in his electorate. It has also been suggested to me that Caloola Pass should be a toll road. Why should we be paying a toll for this road when we would have it funded nationally if the New South Wales Government would nominate it for national arterial funding? The NRMA, that wonderful body of which I am a member this year but will not be a member next year because I consider it has wasted my membership fee by running a totally false and dishonest campaign, has put out in my electorate advertisements like this one entitled 'Ask yourself why you are always getting stuck in Albion Park Rail'. My electoral office happens to be in Albion Park Rail. I wrote to the NRMA challenging it on this subject and suggesting to it that motorists were getting stuck in Albion Park Rail because the Government was turning it from a two-lane to a four-lane highway. It would be obvious to anyone that there would be periods of delay when we were carrying out this road work. I wrote to the NRMA and told it that its advertising was misleading. It wrote back a long letter pointing out all sorts of things and telling me that the road at Albion Park had to be sealed where the shops were. All of its information was false. Every bit of its information was two years out of date. I wrote back to the NRMA and suggested that, as my office was Albion Park Rail, I might be a bit more familiar with the traffic flows there than it was. Nevertheless, this has not stopped the NRMA. It· has sent pamphlets to all the local councils in my electorate and invited them to send the pamphlets around with the rate notices. I might add that because everyone is so happy to get their rate notices they will be happy to. get these other things. I have contacted the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) and we will put out our story with the rate notices. All the councils in my electorate have agreed to do this and, provided we give them the letters, they will send out this information. The agrarian socialist, the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), made claims during his speech about coming to my electorate to talk about roads. He is welcome. I invite him to come into my electorate and talk about roads. What would he find if he came into my electorate?",71
125,Mr COHEN ,ZZZZZ,He would find you for a start.,73
126,Mr HOLLIS,ZZZZZ,"As my colleague and friend the honourable member for Robertson said, he would find me. I would be there with the honourable member for Richmond. But, also on driving from Canberra, he would find all these new roads. He would bypass Marulan. He would go through the Hoddles Crossing intersection which was opened 18 months ago at a cost of $20m. He would then bypass the beautiful and historic village of Berrima. We have spent $80m on bypassing that town. If he bothered to come down to the coast he would bypass Kiama, a bypass to which the Federal Government contributed under the steel regions assistance plan. He would also find freeway conditions all the way to Albion Park on the F6. He would find that we have a magnificent record on roads. Yet he is going to go there and talk about what little we are doing on roads.",73

130,Mr HOLLIS,ZZZZZ,"That is what the Opposition says, Mr Minister. We hear so much about what the Opposition will do. We all know about its record on roads. We have only to look at its record on roads to know what we would get. It talks about councils digging up their roads. I have yet to find a council that is digging up its roads. Any council that is digging up its roads should be removed from office. The Opposition always tells us about what the roads should be like, but it never tells us what expenditure it will cut to achieve that aim. Is it education? Is it pensions? What is it going to cut if it is going to put into roads all the money it is claiming it will spend? This Hawke Labor Government has an excellent record on roads. I support the legislation. Obviously I am opposed to the amendment moved by the Opposition.",74
131,Mr TIM FISCHER ,ZZZZZ,"Farrer) (5.06)-The House is considering the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1988. It has just heard a very emotional speech from the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis). It follows his emotional plea earlier this afternoon in respect of visiting defence bases. I can only say that he took a very blinkered look at the road situation in Australia in his comments here today. He painted a very narrow picture with regard to roads. Some roads have been improved; I do not deny that. The Berrima bypass is a great improvement. It was not well designed for the wombat traffic. I passed by Berrima on Easter Sunday and there were dead wombats along the Berrima bypass because there was no environmentally sound and balanced fencing. I am sure that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown), who is known for his green habits, has overlooked this matter in terms of the detailed planning of the Berrima bypass. I was very saddened to see dead wombats along the Berrima bypass. There has to be an environmental balance in the construction of these massive bypasses. Equally, there have to be more bypasses. May I tell the honourable member for Throsby that that is the nub of the argument. While improvements have been made to some roads over the last six years, the overall picture has been one of a reduction in real expenditure on roads by the Federal Government for every year it has been in office. That is the reality of the situation. It has been well documented by a further response in the continuing saga between the Minister and Mr Richard Cox, the correspondence of which has been circulated to all honourable members and senators. I am sure some of my colleagues will spell out in more detail those excellent figures provided by Mr Richard Cox with regard to Federal Government road funding. Let us stick to the overall specifics on the matter of road funding. It is a fact that there have been reductions in real expenditure on road funding by Canberra in every year this Government has been in office. It is a fact that the Australian bicentennial roads program, as it was, was gradually sabotaged, particularly with regard to increases in the expenditure under that program as this Government diverted the initial two cents collection as adjusted to Consolidated Revenue from road expenditure. Eventually the Government repealed the Australian bicentennial roads legislation. To be fair and balanced, the Government then brought in the Australian centennial roads development (ACRD) program and the Australian land transport program. But that was a smokescreen as the reality of this situation is that road flmding has been reduced and reduced again at the Federal level. As a consequence, we do not have a Hume Highway; we have a Hume hellway. Over Easter I made it my business, as a Federal member representing a large chunk of the Hume Highway-the very dangerous half-way section, to some extent; the area between Tarcutta, Holbrook and Albury-to travel the Hume Highway and experience those Easter road conditions at first hand. I am very conscious that many veterans, many elderly people and others travel that road at various times, including Easter, and I know that there have been quite serious problems and horrific accidents in recent weeks, yet again, along the Hume hellway. . If the honourable member for Throsby or any other member of this out of touch, arrogant Government thinks that there has been satisfactory progress on the upgrading of the Hume Highway or hell way, let alone any other highway, he ought to think again because there was chaos at Yass on Easter Monday night. There was chaos at Mittabined gong. There was chaos along various sections of that highway which, of have not even reached that four-lane, dual 'carriageway, objective that this Government promised· would be completed by the end 1988; that is, the end of last year. Of course, that' objective has not been reached and there is blood on the hands of the Government in that that objective has not been reached. is unfortunate that I need to express my feelings in those words, but I do so because there is an increasing anger over the standard of our roads and highways across the nation, as my colleague the honourable member Richmond has pointed out in address. We need such things as the Albury bypass, the Yass bypass, the Cullerin Range bypass. We need a little more lateral thinking from road authorities in the planning of bypasses so that we do not have a situation where the road and rail authorities work arm's length. With the advantages of a chronised approach, a bypass around the Cullerin Range could be provided which would work effectively in creating a corridor for both road and rail in one welllike planned and engineered project. We would not have a repeat of the disgraceful situation near Picton, to· nominate just one area. blame governments of yesteryear for this; do not blame this Government. magnificent freeway easement, but alongside the sections of the main conventional Sydover 'ney-Melbourne railway line, as no-one could coordinate the creation of a magnificent through easement for the Sydof 'ney-Melbourne main line, which was availamounts able at very little expense. This would have cut out that horrific Picton detour made the Sydney-Melbourne main line, which snakes out to the west and back in again. I appeal to the authorities. I appeal Minister to see that this next bypass across and around Cullerin Range in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) is dealt with in a senDespite sible' way, involving both' rail and road, so that we do not have a situation where a very expensive road bypass is put in around Culand still islerin Range and the poot old conventional appeared SydneyMelbourne main line is once again left languishing. The need exists for a comroad-rail approach to that Cullerin other Range bypass if we are to get maximum course, value from government dollars. I turn now to some aspects of the specific amendments before the Chair, particularly in of regard to the ACRD Act and the Interstate Road Transport Act. I refer to the role of rail in solving the transport problems of this nation. For too long the role of rail has been It neglected by governments of all persuasions in one sense, rail has not had an effective, popular lobby group to go into bat for it, to establish its priorities in the agenda of the nation and the agenda of each State governfor ment, in terms of planning transport and, address after budgetary priorities. Of course, the roads lobby is well represented by some very effective organisations, including the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) and the Royal Autothese mobile Club of Victoria (RACV). The rail unions to some extent, to give them credit, at have tried to popularise the cause of rail as syna mode of transport, but beyond that a very limited effort has been made. There have been some organisations formed, including new the Consumers Transport Council. I would to highlight in the context of this debate an aspect that Council has dwelt on in recent times. A media release dated 5 April I 1989, released by the Council's President, Mr I R. Cortis-Jones, and Professor P. Laird, of We have, a Wollongong, states: During 1987-88, the Federal Government collected $100 million in fuel excises from the five Govit is today, ernment rail systems. This was far in excess of any rail deficit and, course, it was far in excess of any direct paid by the Federal Government for main line upgrading through the relevant by programs. Yet the railways have to maintain their own tracks and also pay diesel fuel excise as a form of taxation to the Federal to the Government. In addition, the rail systems have to make substantial loan repayments to Canberra in the order of some $32m. Profesfor sor Steveson said in his recent book: Peter Morris' comment, in 1979, about the alleged neglect of railway by conservative Governments, the government of which he was a memberto attach a lower priority to rail transport than any other Commonwealth Government since the Second World War. It was apparently much more interested in highway freight transp-rt. They are very damning words. We have to approach this transport equation with a balanced outlook which recognises that there is a continuing dynamic role for revamped, revitalised rail transport in this country. In that context, I am delighted that the Minister at the table has recently approved a reference to the Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee of the Parliament to look at the east-west freight operations with particular reference to an idea I pushed strongly last year, upon the committee and elsewhere, that the ParkesBroken Hill section of the east-west main line be transferred from the New South Wales State Rail Authority to Australian National (AN) by lease or by whatever rrieans. Their whole operational base could then move from Broken Hill to a new intermodal depot and junction at Parkes. This would allow the formation of 2-kilometre long unit freight trains, or superfreighters, at Parkes, which could then operate as very efficient unit trains from Parkes in· one coordinated movement right across the country to Perth. We would not then have these remarshalling, refuelling, recrewing problems that occur at present in so many different spots along that east-west route. I am pleased to note that even ahead of the Committee's deliberations there has been some trialling of longer superfreighters on that east-west route. We look forward, perhaps in the week commencing Monday, 5 June, to examining, as an all-party Committee, the details of these proposals, visiting Adelaide, Broken Hill, Parkes and Sydney. The statistic which I do not hesitate to utilise often, and it makes people stand up and take notice, is that a steel wheel on a steel rail has about one-tenth of the friction of a rubber-tyred wheel on a bitumen surface. Therein lies the advantage of rail as a mode of transport, especially for unit freight train loads but equally fpr passenger :aovement in areas of great population density. We have the exciting possibility-although I will t:J,ot dwell pn it because I realise that the very fast train is getting towards the periphery of this piece of legislation-of the concept of a very fast train between Sydney and Melbourne, preferably via Albury, but in any .event via the best route. possible, to provide a leap into the twenty-first century in the dynamic use of rail transport in this country. The coalition has looked at this legislation in detail. We have looked at the equation that it confers, especially with regard to the amendments to the Interstate Road Transport Act and its impact on haulage trucks on the highways, such as those passing through your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and mine. My colleague the honourable member for Richmond has moved a very capable amendment in relation to this legislation, which I support. As the House gives its consideration to the legislation, I reiterate an appeal that the governments of this day, not only at Federal level but also at State level, tak- into account the need to plan ahead, to coordinate and to provide the basis on which revamped and revitalised rail can service this country. Finally, in that context I have with me a copy of the Australian National Railways Commission annual report.of 1987-1988. Lest people think otherwise, the AN freight operations, partly due to some of the provisions made by this Government, anq I give credit in that regard, but also due to some of the fundamental decisions taken by previous governments-for example, the standardisation· of the Alice Springs-Tarcoola section of line to link Alice Springs to the standard gauge network of Australia-recorded a surplus for the financial year 1987-88. It is difficult to put ilnexact figure on it, but it was an accurate figure. It was in the black. Depending on the way one looks at it, one could argue that it was in the. black by many millions of dollars. One has to take into account various equations with regard to track upgrading, maintenance and the allocation of money for that type of activity. Australian National, which so vitally services the east-west route, t4e Alice SpringsAdelaide route and other routes, has made it back into the black in its freight operation and still pays many millions of dollars to the Federal Government in the form of diesel fuel excise. That is proof positive that in this yea!, 1989, rail can work, rail does work and rail needs to be given the chance to work even better for the nation if it is to solve its huge transport infrastructure problems. The House needs no reminding - hat we are elltering the extremely competitive decade of the 1990s. We will face massive trading blocs in Europe after 1992, in the United States, Canada and elsewhere. The need is more urgent than ever before to ensure that our transport infrastructure becomes as efficient as possible. There is a need for a proper balance between road, rail and air. Certainly road has - proper role to play; it will service much of my electorate of Farrer because of the limitations of rail. We recognise the Government's tentative step in agreeing to construct a third runway at Mascot. I am surprised that the honourable member for Calare ( Mr Simmons) attended the famous Botany meeting chaired by the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Leo MCLeay) , opposing the third runway. When I was in Orange last night many people criticised the fact that the honourable member for Calare had· decided to attend the anti-runway meeting at Botany and then front up here today to be sworn in as a new Minister in this Government-this tired, out of touch Government which, nevertheless, has made the right decision to build a third runway at Mascot. We hope that it' gets on with that job. I commend to the House the amendment moved by the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt) in relation to this important legislation.",74
132,Mr WRIGHT ,ZZZZZ,"Capricornia) (5.24)When the issue of roads comes to any forum it is understandable that all speakers, less of their political persuasion, regardless of what., part of Australia they live in, regardless of their backgrounds in any way, want to stand up and argue fqr better roads, for more money to be spent on roads. If one is in the political arena, as we alt, are, even more understandable why one would do this. It does not matter what measure is used in terms of advantage to the community, roads are ail important catalyst to, an important component of development. Roads are economically important to an area sim, ply· because they create jobs, so honourable members obviously want more roads built in their areas-upgraded, better maintained roads. If one looks at the cost to local, State or national industry of bad roads and the . fact that industry can achieve savings if it is able to move from point A to point B more quickly, one supports road programs. If one wants to measure human safety factors, again one would have to be in the affirmative regarding roads. We can add to that tourism. I take the point made by the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer). We need an infrastructure system. We need to ensure that people are able to commute from point A to point B or whatever. Tourists must be able to come into an area, be it by rail, air or road, which we are talking about now. The tourist industry depends very much on our road systems. One can look at the local authority advantages. There are 850 local authorities in Australia, with some 134 in Queensland. The road moneys that we give as a Federal Government are vital to their revenue base. They are important to the sorts of things local authorities do. They meet the demands of their local constituencies. It is understandable why members of parliament and others, say that we need better roads. It is also understandable why groups like the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) arid the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) across Australia campaign for better roads. There is nothing wrong with that. It is proper that all sorts of interest groups, including those which represent road users, argue for more money for roads and for better roads. What gets me angry'is when interest groups regard- such as the RACQ and the AAA distort the facts and figures, when they mount campaigns that I suspect are not just politically based. That is right, that is proper. Everyone has a right to play the political game. But when they start getting into the party politiit is cal game I become suspicious of their real motives. I have noticed that the campaign in Queensland is aimed directly at the Hawke Labor Government. One does not hear a word about what the State National Party Government ought to do. One does not hear the local authorities being attacked for the cutback in expenditure on road programs that has occurred in some authorities. One does not hear these groups taking dn the Minister' for Main Roads, the Hon. Bill Gunn, for not providing extrll money out of the general revenue the Federal Government gives, the untied grants that we give, to' use on roads. We do not hear that criticism. I question the real motive behind their campaign. I also question the figures these groups have used. I notice that they talk about some 30c in fuel taxes that comes back to the Commonwealth. When we look at excise duties we are really talking about 20c. It is still not enough to give back just over 5c in direct road funding. But it is a significant amount. When one enters a debate one starts to make comparisons. But one also goes back to the facts. This Government has never promised, and I also believe that the Fraser Government never promised, to return the. road taxes, the fuel taxes, to road expenditure. That undertaking has never been given by any government. That is understandable. The money that this Government and previous governments have derived from fuel taxes has gone to help the country in hundreds of ways. We will never be able to pin it down and say that a certain amount was used for defence or for hospitals. It is part of the total revenue pool that Federal governments have. They use it to give to local authorities, State authorities, community organisations. They use it to help rehabilitation programs and road safety programs, not just to repair, maintain and construct roads. . The debate has become quite distorted. That is a great pity because if ever there were a time to raise people's interest in roads now would be the time. We have a desperate need to increase. the road commitment even further than this Government has done. The population consists of some 16.25m people. The national highway is about 16,000 kilometres. It is an enormous task for a small country. Instead of confliet and confrontation there is a need for the States, the Federal Government and the local authorities to say 'Okay, we have a national problem'one that has been addressed in a marvellous way, I believe, by this Government, but one that still needs to be addressed a lot faster and a lot further. Since 1983-84 this Government has spent $6.174 billion on roads. If one adds the new programs uQder the Australian centennial roads development program the figure blows out to $7.39 billion. That is a lot of money. It is taxpayers' money, money that has been accrued by this Government. The Government has said, 'This is our priority. We are going to put the money back into these areas'. We are funding all sorts of roads. But honourable members should keep in mind that we fund totally and fully the national highway system. During the current period we will have spent $3.23 billion on national roads; on arterial roads, $2.6 billion; and on local roads, $1. 518 billion. That is a lot of money. It is money that has been spent· for a good purpose and a good cause. It· is the first time, I believe, that we have had a situation in Australia-it began in 1986where any Australian can drive around the total perimeter of this country on a sealed road. That has happened under the Hawke Government, under a government that has this special commitment. It· has happened under a government that realises that we need a new program, a new vision, a new understanding. That is why we have the Australian centennial roads development program. I give the present Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support( Mr Robert Brown) and the previous transport Minister, the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Peter Morris), great credit for introducing the national arterial category. It has not been satisfactory simply to have local roads, State arterial roads and national highways. Some roads needed to be given special funding, a special category, because of their national . economic importance. We will never be happy that not all the roads that have been seen to be nationally and economically important have been given funding, but in my State some 19 very important ones have been put on the list. I· am pleased that some of those are in my electorate. I believe that the definition can even be improved. At the moment it tends to be interpreted that a national arterial road is a single, major road. I would like. to. see it broadened so that· it becomes a road system. I appreciate the fact that the Minister. has . been in my electorate of Capricornia, in Dawson, Kennedy and those areas. He has not just flown around, as regrettably one newspaper said, but has been on the· ground talkipg to local authorities. He has travelled around for three hours testing out the bumps and the ridges and then sat down to talk people about the problems. He understands too that in that area we have a special problem with all the small roads that feed into a. major road system with the Gregory Highway and the Peak Downs Highway. less we can get that definition broadened so decisions. that those little bits and pieces of feeder roads can be funded under the national arto terial program, we will wait a long time. say that because to do these roads right now in that small part of Queensland would cost $38m. Our total local government, local contribution to Queensland this year is odd million. It would take up an enormous part of the total funding for Queensland for one small area. The councils understand that there is a financial problem, but they would like some ongoing plan. The Minister has undermore stood this need and this request and I hope that the definition can be reviewed· and panded so that the small feeder roads can part of what we will now call a national arterial roads system rather than just a category that impacts mainly on the roads. I appreciate what has been done. It easy, I suppose, for Government members get up and say that their government has done the best job, but the facts are there. The figures and the scores ,are on the board with respect to what the Government is doing and has done. It is unfortunate that some members talk about the lack of funds for local roads. I can understand people saying that the roads are not good enough because in and around my area the roads to and like from Rockhampton are absolutely. beautiful. Magnificent highways are being built. tunately, the State Government took most of the credit, even though the roads were funded by the Federal Government. HowOovernment, ever, some of the local roads are difficult .and , in many instances, dangerous. But Government, for the financial year 1988-89, has increased funding by $15.3m over the previous financial year. That is an increase in real terms. The significance of that is that we have seen a fall in general road funding in other areas. Despite that fall back to $1.221 billion across the nation for roads generally, funds to local authorities have increased. That is very important. It is to ognition by this Government of the importance of those roads. It is significant also that the money is available to those local authorities. The States are not going to make the big decisions about where the money Ungoes. Local authorities will make those The campaign that has been waged ought be corrected. That is one of the reasons I I rose to speak in this debate. It is proper, I suppose, for politicians to keep comparing roads and we will compare what a previous gov$50ernment did with what we have done. However, again the facts are there. If we take a just six,year time frame of the previous Fraser Government, we will find that its total expenditure on roads amounted to $7.108 billion. That is a lot of money; it is an enormous to see amount of money. However, 21 per cent was spent in six Hawke Budgets. The allocation rose to $e '103 billion. Therefore, exthe RACQ and others can fight for what be they see as their constituencies, but they should stick to the facts. That is what angers road me about the way the debate has gone, parsingle ticularly in the public arena. In the six-year period under Fraser, is Queensland received $1.492 billion. Under to the Hawke Labor Government, the figure has increased by 20 per cent, to $1.784 billion. It could be said that it is still not enough to meet our needs because it is a massive State. We have a huge road system and massive distances to travel, so we do need more money. We need more than the per capita arrangement that exists. I would to see a greater needs basis and priorities calculation in this, but for Queensland the UnforGovernment has not only increased by 20 per cent the money that goes into roads compared with that put in by the Fraser but also increased general purpose grants. Anyone who krlows anything the about State or local government. finances .knows that a massive amount of money is given by the Federal Government to these levels of government to do what they like with. In 1988-89, the allocations in the general purpose area to the States and local authorities are $12 billion and $646m respectively. The Government obviously recognises been the problem that exists here because it has recensured that the States have their money in untied grants in addition to direct funding for roads. I also congratulate the Minister on the new legislation because it has set in cement an increase, indexed over the next two years. That gives certainty. Those who have served at different levels of government know that there is nothing worse than depending on someone with the power of the purse, not knowing what will be received, not knowing what the political decision will be. However, this Government has said that for 1988-89 the allocation will be $1.221 billion; that for the next two years it will rise to $1.226 billion; and that it will be indexed. The same is true for local authorities, because they get the flow-on benefit. It does not matter which way we look at the figures for Queensland; they all show that it is doing very well. I note that in one year we have spent $107.Sm on the State's national highway, $87.4m on arterial roads and $S2.2m on the State's local roads. A lot of money is going to the State. Mr Tim Fischer-Still a reduction in real terms.",77
133,Mr WRIGHT,ZZZZZ,"There is no reduction for local roads. I take the honourable member's point, because I agree in part with what he is saying, but where do we cut back? I know Senator Stone on the Opposition side has said that he would slash funding by $10Om and is on the record as having said it, but if the honourable member for Farrer had the power right now to cut funding, where would he cut it back? Would he cut back the money that goes to Austudy or the money that goes on defence, which I know is a very special interest of his? Is he going to cut it back in some rural development programs or assistance to small business? Mr Tim Fischer-Aid to black African states.",80
134,Mr WRIGHT,ZZZZZ,"That is terminal; it is finished anyway. Some people might want to take up the argument, but in the long term it means nothing. An amount of $200m is a pittance in that sense. In fact, for everyone cent we get back from the fuel tax it amounts to about $2S0m, so we are talking about 0.7 of a cent for that $200m. It would do a lot in Queensland. No doubt it would do a lot in the honourable member's area of Farrer, but it is a very small amount. We are talking about trying to find another billion dollars. Where do we get it? Mr Ian Cameron-Welfare.",80
135,Mr WRIGHT,ZZZZZ,"Perhaps we could take it out of the money for Maranoa because the honourable member for Maranoa does not live there and does not bother to use the roads. I do not want to get into a blue with the honourable member, but I suggest that most people are saying that it is understandable in view of the cutbacks in expenditure of the Government over recent years because of economic realities that there should be a $36m drop this year in spending on the total road program, but a real increase for local authorities. We have acted properly; we have acted responsibly. Queensland has done very well. We can add to the money I mentioned being allocated to national, arterial and local roads the general revenue grants to the State. In 1988-89 it will be $2.2 billion. If we start making comparisons over a period since 1983, we can see that we have given Queensland $14.6 billion. The people pay taxes and we appreciate the fact that they are getting back their own money, but the Government has said the moneys are untied and that it is up to the State to decide what it will do with it. It is a pity that the Premier of Queensland, Mike Ahern, does not open his eyes to see a little bit more of his 'Vision of Excellence' and start spending some of the money that he spends on promoting his Government-some $12m a year running his own campaign or propaganda television program-on local or arterial roads. Local authorities, as the figures show, have also done extremely well. This year, $108m in untied grants will go to the councils. Over the six years of the Hawke Labor Government, it has allocated $66Om in untied grants. Money does not always mean a lot, but this is what it means in reality: ninety bridges have been upgraded in Queensland along the Bruce Highway, in flood prone areas, since we have been in government. That has done a lot for the north. Anyone who has been to north Queensland knows what it is like. One c&n leave a spot at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and find that a bridge down the road has been cut off, but when one goes to go back an hour later the other bridge one needs to cross may be cut off too. That is almost totally finished, except for Lotus Creek and a few other bridges on alternative routes. We have overcome the problem by upgrading 90 bridges. Four hundred and forty kilometres of pavement have been replaced, and this year another $84m will be spent on the Bruce Highway. We could ask for more, but what I am saying is that this Government has been responsible. It has accepted a need and demand from the Queensland people and is pouring money into where it is needed. I challenge the Opposition to say exactly where it would cut back if it immediately had to spend money on roads. I would like to think we could do more. I said to the Minister when he was in Rockhampton recently that now 5.2c is coming back to roads we ought to plan to give a specific amount, in cent terms, to local authorities. At the moment they get something like $250m. One cent of each 5.2c paid in fuel taxes goes back to local authorities. Why not make it 1.25c? That would be quite significant. If we made it 1.5c, funding available to local authorities would total some $320m. I am sure they could use the money very quickly. They could use it tomorrow because the programs are in place. We must understand that we have a national responsibility. Whilst I would like to ask the Minister to give me $38m for the Central Highlands, I understand that he has responsibilities not only in central Queensland but in the rest of the State and across the nation. I appreciate what he has done; I appreciate the way he has committed himself to his task as a Minister. It is not an easy task. In some people's minds it could even be a bad news task. There are thousands of demands; only some of them can be met. I know that, with the sports allocations that the Federal Government is involved in, there were $llOm worth of requests and we had $4.6m to spend. It is the same with roads. I ask that the Minister consider redefining 'national arterial system '; that he consider having a feeder system in that interpretation. I join with the honourable member for Farrer in suggesting that we do need a national program to encourage the use of rail services. I believe that is an alternative that needs to be tested out, expanded upon and maximised. If during our next three years in government, after we are re-elected, we can target that area and do more-I know we have already done a lot with the national rail system-I think we can start to upgrade and improve the travel infrastructure of our nation.",80
136,Mr IAN CAMERON ,ZZZZZ,"Maranoa) (5.44)The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Wright) ranted and raved about roads. I am pleased to note that the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) visited the central Queensland area recently. He looked at the problems of our grains roads and hopefully acquainted himself with the problems of that expanding part of Queensland in my electorate-not the electorate of Capricornia but my electorate-where our export industries are developing. I spoke this morning on the huge coal production in the area, and of course we have a huge grain production as well. There is potentially more agricultural land in central Queensland than in the rest of Australia put together. There has been a lot of growth there in the last 10 to 20 years and it has been impossible for the area to keep up with the roads needed to supply the efficient transport system we have been talking about today and yesterday. Our side of politics has talked about deregulation in the wheat industry, and we need some deregulation .in the transport industry too. To enable that we need better roads to put our transports on. No doubt the Minister will now be better acquainted with that problem. I hope he is able to see that adequate funds do go to central Queensland. There is a lot of hot air about roads, but the main problem with taxing arrangements for road funding is that the Labor Government for the first time has indexed the excise on petroleum. That tax is increased every six months in line with inflation. Our inflation is now running at nearly twice the figure estimated by the Treasurer ( Mr Keatin.g) in his last Budget statement, in which he said it could be under 4 per cent. It is now nearly 8 per cent. We have indexed excise taxes on diesel and petrol and, as well, the excise on avgas has gone up a cent in the last six months. These taxes are changed every six months. More and more Australians are using our road system and more and more of our goods are being transported on our roads; yet, in proportion to the amount of revenue collected from road users; less and less is being spent on roads. I do· not care what figures the Minister puts forward; they the· facts of the situation. The money goes into Consolidated Revenue and a fixed prointo portion is taken out. Every motor vehicle owner is paying more fuel tax but less of is going into the upkeep of roads. More and more is being spent on what I would deterRoyal mine in most cases are wasteful things. ing is needed more in this country than better road system so we can continue to supply the exports needed to put our balance of payments back on track. There is a whole raft of changes in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. It is incredible that the parliamentary draftsman could see fit to corporate six important changes in one piece of legislation. But here; they are, and I going to have a go at all of them. interestmore ingly enough, they all affect my electorate some way or other. There are amendments to air navigation charges. The GoVernment has revamped the charges and this affects particular the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which operates in Queensland out of Charleincreasing ville, in my electorate, as well as from Mount Isa and Cairns. Instead of charging the charter operators-including those I use in Maranoa, such as Warner's Air Charter in operate airports. Roma and Central Queensland Aviation in Emerald-the Government has introduced the user pays system. Previously the charter operators .v,:ere charged a licence fee, same as we pay to own and operate a motor car. Some of what we pay is spent on roads; in the same way, the licence fee was designed to help pay for the upkeep of airports and landiilg strips. Now, with the introduction the user pays system, charter operators have been placed at an enormous disadvantage presently because all of a sudden this extra taxation has meant the amount they have to pay for the upkeep of the airports has risen dramatwere ically. Even the charges of the Flying Doctor Service, which has a whole range of subsidies in place, have· increased dramatically. Its charges used to amount to $32,000 and the Federal Government subsidised that to the tune of $16,000. Its charges have now gone to $160,000. I use these figures to give House an indication of the huge increase that this Government is imposing in just this one little part of the Bill. The Federal and State governments have agreed to subsidise the are Flying Doctor Service to the extent of 90 per cent of its running costs. When we take account that 45 per cent from the State and 45 per cent from the Commonwealth it for running costs, we are left with ·an increase through air navigation charges for the Flying Doctor Service in QueensNothland-just Queensland-of $40,000. This is a the sort of increase these charges lead to. . The Government has abolished the excise on avtur, or jet fuel, but it has not done anything about avgas. The excise is still applied; I think it was increased on 1 January. It has gone up 0.916c a litre, to be now 23.805c a litre. In my mind charter operators inare being expected to bear a heavier burden than others. But Ilot only has the Governam ment increased these charges; it is reaping and more revenue from excise. Fuel in excise charges are tied to inflation, and are increasing. The cost of taxation to these people is increased every six months. Any in member of the Government who says taxes and charges for the users of airports are not is just not telling the truth. Ten per cent of these charges that are collected goes to Consolidated Revenue and 90 per cent goes to the Civil Aviation Authority to The Flying Doctor Service is a very important arm of our medical safety services the throughout Queensland and throughout Australia. We expect the Government to give better consideration to the charges it imposes on the service. We do not think it should be paying these air navigation charges. If it were of not operating, the Government would have to pay the full cost of this service, whereas the difference between .the cost and the subsidy is made up on a voluntary fundraising basis. If the Flying Doctor Service not providing the health services that it does, the Government would obviously have to supply them. I ask the Minister, who is at the table, to give further consideration to the charges applying to the Royal Flying .Doctor Service. A minor amendment is made to section 16 of the Airports (Surface Traffic) the Act. I am not sure what section 16 provides because I have not researched it in great depth, but the change is a very minor one. The Australian Centennial Roads Development Act is also amended by this Bill. It deals with financial assistance to the land transport system and provides for> a total revamping of that system over a period of five years. A share of funds from the excise on petrol and diesel is to go to that system. The charge rate can be varied by the Minister, and the amendment will force the Minister to table details of the variations in the House. So at least variations will not be made by regulation and we on this side of the House will be able to debate the matter. I have not yet seen a government charge come down; such charges just continue to go up. Obviously, there will be increases in the charges and the Minister will now have to table details of those increases, giving us a chance to debate the reasons for them. Again, the excise on petrol and diesel is to be indexed to inflation every six months. Bush inflation is probably running at 12 or 15 per cent. It is always nearly twice the city inflation rate. The consumer price index is based on the costs of city goods and services. It is 35 to 40 per cent dearer to live in Darwin than to live in other capital cities. It certainly costs more to live in my part of the world, in Maranoa in inland Queensland, and that applies to most inland' areas where there are huge distances, very long transportation links and high costs for moving goods. Even the operators of the trains, which have been mentioned in this debate, are now paying excise taxes on the diesel they consume. The Government reaps an enormous tax benefit whenever any product is moved to or from rural Australia. Taxation revenue derived from our petroleum consumption now runs at about $5 billion a year. Australia is one of the biggest land masses in the world with one of the smallest populations. I have always argued that our fuel tax regime is iniquitous and that we ought to abolish the $1.2 billion wellhead tax. The indexation of our taxes to inflation is a neverending circle. If we tie anything to inflation we will not bring inflation down. It is a nonsense form of economic thinking. I wish the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) were in the House because I would dearly love to have a debate with him about it. There is no way known to science that we can bring down inflation if taxes are indexed to it. It will go up and up continually. I am only a bush lawyer. but even I can understand that. Our excise taxes are continuing to rise, and this has a mUltiplying effect. The excise tax on fuel is now 22c or 23c a litre. A percentage inflation increase on that will just make it bigger and bigger. The Labor Party eventually will be forced to make a mandatory decrease in the fuel excise tax as it did on beer in the last Budget. It is amazing that the Government. can reduce the excise tax on beer but not the tax on fuel. I would have thought that fuel was a much more essential commodity than beer, but apparently the La\:lor Party thinks differently. And those opposite wonder why they will go out of office at the next ,election! Their priorities are all up the creek. They want t9 get drunk dr\oking beer and are not prepared to drive around, with '. cheaper fuel and on better roads. The Minister, who is only new, understands that. He nods his head in support. That is very good. The next part of the Bill-1 do not know how this Minister is able to handle all these matters; I know that he is clever but I did not thin- he was quite this clever-amends the Broadcasting Act 1942. Limited licences are to be, granted to permit broadcasting from the Aussat satellite to isolated homesteads. In my area NQTV, which operates out of Townsville, broadcasts via the satellite into the electorate of Maranoa and other parts of Queensland. This is the result of an oversight in the previous legislation .. NQTV has in operation a system called mactext, which is similar to teletext. The amendments to .tJte Broadcasting Act will allow North Queensland Television to broadcast to people who have a satellite dish and can pick up the signal. The Minister might take up with the operators in this area one of the problems we have. We gather that yet another tax is to be applied ,in the form of a licence fee. These people have had no indication from the Minister or his Department as to the amount of the fee. They are interested to know because it will be. part of the costs that they have to meet in the business they operate. Operating a television station in isolation is not easy because there is not a large audience. In fact, NQTV is presently operating at a loss. It is hoping over a three-year period to catch and make a profit, but in the last six months it made a loss of $lm. It is making up the losses incurred in broadcasting to the inland through the cross-subsidisation of the servci-Qt ices in the city. bases of Townsville and Cairns, where there are many more viewers. I ask the Government why it is necessary i-pose - uch a charge. I - ather that a f-e will be Imposed when statIOns such as this are trying .to get off the g-ound some services to. people I- the mland. In I most cases we shll have, If we only one commercial television s-ation, .and mos- people can. get the Australian Bro-dand castmg Corporat!on bec-use of the satellIte, Aussat Pty - td IS chargmg NQTV $4m for the lease of ItS transponder, and the Comtal - onwea-th Government has - 51 per cent mterest m the Aussat corporation. We welcome the technology and the fact that the Fraser Government put the satellite in place. The Hawke Government has not seen fit to have it drop out of the air. With all the Government's cutbacks, at least satellite is still up there and operating, the intention is to put up some new satellites which will be more powerful and better than the ones that are operating now. The amendments to the Interstate Road Transport Act are to do with the load masses, et cetera, applying to transports. It is all do with axle weights. Unfortunately, we have to have control over the weights on our roads because big trucks very easily smash up the bitumen. Most of our roads were built a number of years ago and are very narrow. The large transport trucks are very apt pass one another at great speeds-they are able to do 100 kilometres an hour, as fast any motor car-and if they are overloaded they rip up the road surface very easily. amendments to that Act are to correct probextra lems concerning weight, mainly in the state road transportation system. 1I have been in touch with Bruce MCIver, who runs a very large road train operation which based in Dalby but the headquarters have now moved to Brisbane. He operates the very large double and triple decker trailers out to Quilpie, up into central Queensland, across to Mount Isa and into the Northern Territory. The last part of the Bill deals with Teleup com Australia. I think that Telecom runs a pretty good operation, but it is very big. It - is a bit like Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. The bigger the companies the more ineffithey become and Telecom is no exception:""TheBill introduces zonal charging. I am sorry the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is to not in th- House.

139,Mr IAN CAMERON,ZZZZZ,"I say once again to the Minister that there are many subscribers in this area and all their local calls are timed; no local call is untimed. I have had many representations from the Quilpie, Thargomindah and Charleville areas, where Telecom is spending $40m in changing over the old manual system to .STD. It is .one of the last areas in Australia where this will happen. It is being done on the digital concentrator system over radio links between towers across the countryside, and yet none of the calls that these people make is regarded as a local call and they are all timed.

141,Mr MARTIN ,ZZZZZ,"Macarthur) (6.04)-1 enter the debate tonight on this omnibus Bill, the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, to deal specifically with the proposed amendment to section 10 of the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988. An amendment is proposed to this part of the legislation to subject to parliame)1tary scrutiny determinations of new chargy/fates for the levy on motor spirit and die-er fuel. The Bill sets out the indexation proposal associated with that charge rate. I / do not propose to go into. that in any great / detail. // (\s has bee- mentioned in the .course of thiS debate thiS .afternoon, there IS a clear need for the people in Australia, whether it be rural Australia or city Australia, to understand the progress that has been made with respect to road funding under proposals that have been brought forward in the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act and its predecessors. I think it makes extremely interesting reading to compare what is being said in the broad community by organisations such as the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) or the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) and its other State affiliates with the real circumstances. I propose to canvass very quickly some of those issues now. The first point-I am sure honourable members are aware of this-is that the AAA and its State affiliates have committed something like $6m of its members' funds to the campaign directed at this Government, suggesting that all moneys attracted to the Government through the imposition of petrol taxes of varying types should be spent on roads. For the life of me I do not think I have ever heard a more ridiculous suggestion simply because when the facts are shown, when one looks at the amount of money that is already contributed to roads in this country, one clearly sees that in terms of other priorities with which this radio Government or any other government might be faced there is a great commitment of resources into roads. In the six years since 1983-84 the Hawke Government has allocated over $7.4 billion to Australian roads. That is not a bad record. That compares with $3.7 billion in the last six years under the former coalition Government, and yet the coalition partners· are the ones aiding and abetting the nonsense being spread by the NRMA and others. Quite clearly, the evidence is there. We have heard people saying, 'Oh, but those figures really do not mean what they say'. What do they mean if not simply that this Government has committed increased revenue to the road system of this country? Perhaps more importantly, a very vigorous and inaccurate campaign has been launched, particularly by the NRMA, on the whole process of the spending of· petrol taxes on roads in this country. I would like to take the time of the House to raise three issues. Firstly, ther« is the assertion that people are dying in. car accidents largely because of the state of the roads. The second issue is the implication that revenue raised from petrol taxes must be spent entirely on road funding. The third issue is: Who is responsible for road funding and how much is being spent? I will deal with the first issue. The principal cause of road crashes is still driver error. There can be no dispute on that. Any objective assessment of the causes of road crashes in this country clearly demonstrates that driver error is the most significant cause. The latest statistics show that .drink driving is still the single most important contributing factor and, of course, speed is still a factqr. Good roads or bad roads will not stop someone from drinking and driving. Good roads or bad roads will not eliminate driver error. I can do no better than quote. from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 January this year entitled 'Speeding Blamed For Rise in Road Toll'. The New South Wales Liberal Minister for Transport, Bruce Baird, blamed the rise in road deaths on speeding. I would like to read into Hansard what he said in that article: The emergence of speed as a major factor accidents is worrying for both the Government the community and sadly. reflects a cavalier towards speed limits and road conditions. There is a limit to what the authorities can in road safety· and those limits can easily be by motorists who approach driving with something akin to a 'death wish mentality' . . . I could not have said it any better. I repeat that. that was said by a Liberal Transport Minister in New South Wales. An analytical report released by the Federal Office of Road Safety on 3 March 1989 entitled Analysis Fatal Road Crashes 1984-85 appears to responsible fute categorically the NRMA's assertion: The report provides nationally consistent detailed crash data which had not previously been available. It revealed that most crashes take place under the best driving conditions. The second point of concern is the fact that the NRMA is trying to give the impresthe sion that the Federal Government promised or was obligated under legislation to commit all moneys raised through petrol tax to road funding. That simply is .not the case. I not believe that it would. be the case with the Opposition parties if they were in ernment. Moneys raised through petrol tax, like. moneys raised from sales tax or any other tax, go diJ:ectly into Consolidated enue. That money is returned to the comnational munity through such services as defence, health, veterans' affairs, educati9n and child welfare, as well as road funding. I hope people are not seriously suggesting that ,major $ource of government revenue which provides those services in the community should be directed totally to road funding. I might· say also that petrol tax also assists the Commonwealth in· providing almost $13 billion each year to the States in untied grants and $650m to local government to used however it wishes, including on roads. Local government makes the determination. We cannot argue with the figures: they are .and 1990-91. there. If local government chooses to use $650m of the allocation on roads, so be it, but local government services suffer. If the State governments choose to use the $13 billion allocated for untied grants entirely roads, other services at the State level suffer. Why has the NRMA not made those suggestions? Why has it said that all petrol taxes in that accrue to the Commonwealth Governand ment must be spent entirely on road imattitude provements? That just begs the question. The NRMA has accused the Federal Govachieve ernment of having its priorities all wrong. eroded Our funding priorities are on increasing family allowance supplement payments, increasing benefits to pensioners, providing tax cuts to low and middle income earners, as well as providing for road works. I ask honourable members to judge for themselves. The third issue raised by the NRMA was of that the Federal Government alone is refor roads. All three levels of government are, in fact, responsible. As stated earlier, we provide almost $13 billion to the States and $650m to local government, some of which they use for road construction and maintenance. (Quorum formed) Before the quorum was called I was suggesting that the campaign being waged by the NRMA against Government specifically on its commitment to road funding was entirely inappropriate. All levels of government-Federal, State and local--.have a duty to provide roads do in Australia. The Federal Government provides $13 billion to the States and $650m to govlocal government, some of which they can use for road works. However, the NRMA's campaign has not been directed to those two Revlevels of government. I concede that the highway is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. Arterial and local roads are primarily the respqnsibility of State that and local governments. As we have india cated, in the six Budgets of the Hawke Government, $8.6 billion has been allooated for roads, compared with $7.1 billion in the last six Budgets under Fraser. That represents an increase of 21 per cent. Yet the NRMA suggests that we have not contributed to the upkeep of roads in this country. As well as be spending that, the Hawke Government's new five-year road funding program will maintain the real value of road funding for 1989-90 What does the Opposition say about road funding policy? It has crowed about all the great policies that it will bring forward, hut where is its policy on road funding? One on might well ask, as an interviewer did. At a press conference on 1 December 1988 the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) was asked: What is your policy on road funding, are you going to increase them and if so by how much? His answer was: Roads will be much better under us. The interviewer asked: Will you be increasing road funds. His reply was: We have not made a decision on that. The Leader of the Opposition was asked: Why not? His answer was: For the simple ,reason that you can't make a decision on an item like that which is essentially a discretionble ary budget decision about percentage of funds in isolation from other decisions that you make on the fiscal side of a spending and taxing nature. Now honourable members understand. The Leader of the Opposition was asked: Isn't Senator Stone on record as saying he would cut them by $100 million? He replied: He may be or he may not be. I don't knowI am sure that he does not knowBut you're asking me what the policy is.' The next question was: Is that policy? The answer was: The policy is that we have not made a decision on the precise quantum. He was asked: So it's possible you could cut road funding? He replied: We haven't made a decision. The interviewer said: That means it's possible? The Leader of the Opposition said: We haven't made a decision on the actual quantum. I'm not trying to be cleverwe can believe that I'm just saying we have not made a decision. I ask why the NRMA is not pushing that line to its constituents around the country and suggesting that the Opposition .should come clean on what it would do with road funding if it were in government. Let me summarise the points I have made about the NRMA's position. Its current media campaign treats the facts with contempt and is diverting attention away from the real road safety issues I have mentioned. All available evidence indicates that the. vast majority of car accidents are not caused by the state of the roads. The main cause is driver error, particularly in relation to drink driving and speed. Money raised through petrol tax is not specifically and totally designated for road funding. No government would do that. Apart from roads, this money is spent on a range of important and basic government services such as health, education and veterans' affairs. The Federal Government is not solely responsible for road funding. State government and local councils are responsifor arterial and local roads. In today's money terms the Hawke Labor Government has outspent the Fraser Liberal-National Party coalition Government on roads and the millions of dollars spent on this campaign by the NRMA and its sister organisations in other States, could be more constructively used to lower membership fees, improve membership services, undertake driver education programs or .contribute towards road safety. In the concluding couple of minutes I have, let me just reiterate some of the points raised by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), who was so rudely interrupted. The Greiner Government in New South Wales has in no uncertain terms treated the Illawarra region with contempt. On the question of roads no greater evidence could be forthcoming. The reason for this is that in the State election last year Labor Party candidates in the Illawarra were returned in every seat except one, which went to an Independent. The Liberals could not get a look in and we are being punished. There is a road system ,called the northern distributor, a major urban arterial road through the centre of the northern suburbs of Wollongong to take traffic away from existing shopping centres. It is to be utilised by coal trucks for safety reasons and by through traffic. The previous New South Wales Labor Government had committed funds to the development of that project to be completed by the end of 1990 or early 1991. Not one piece of work has been undertaken on that road in' the last four months; In addition, a major bridge structure passing over an electrified railway line in that area has been stopped. Why? Because of the height restrictions and requirements the electricity wires for the train line to .get under the bridge were out by four inches. This is what the Liberal Government in New South Wales has done to the Illawarra region, and it is typical of the sort of campaign being waged by its representatives through organisations such as the NRMA and other motoring bodies around Australia to distort the facts about what this Government has done and the contribution it has made to road- and road funding. This omnibus Bill deserves the support of the House, and the. Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) is to be congratulated on bringing it' forward.",85
142,Mr SHARP ,ZZZZZ,"Gilmore) (6.24)-1I have listened throughout the day to the various contributions fJ:'om members of the Government in this debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. It has been very interesting. We have had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to the ravings of the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), who has been telling the world how proud he is of the highways and byways of New South Wales and that all the credit for these good roads is due to the Hawke Labor Government. I point out to the honourable member that when he travels to my part of the world, which he does from time to time on his way to Parliament, he travels only on the four-lane dual carriageways that exist between his home and Canberra. If he were to get off that road and travel to other parts of New South Wales he would find that if he were to claim great credit for his Government's good works in relation to roads it would probably be almost suicidal. I assure honourable members that the state of roads throughout New South Wales arid indeed throughout Australia is at the point where people are just about ready to riot. That is particularly so in my electorate' of Gilmore, where we have a horror section of highway between Goulburn and Yass which has claimed many lives over the past few months. In a period of 10, weeks 13 lives were lost on one section of that highway between Goulburn' and Yass and there were many other serious accidents as well. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) spoke about his own parochial concerns in the Illawarra region. He said it was disgraceful that the Greiner Government had not done this, that and the other in that region. I point out to him that his colleagues in the previous Labor Government in New South Wales had 12 years to do the things he expects Mr Greiner to have done in just 12 months in government. This Government in Canberra and the Government that was in Sydney prior to the last State election have no regard for the improvement of roads throughout the State and the nation. I believe that, as a result, people are having to spend more money on the maintenance of their cars and on petrol in order to drive over these deteriorating roads. Also the lives of people are being put at risk. Earlier today we heard from the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer), who highlighted research 'work that was done by this Government under the former MinEmptyHere work showed that for every $4m spent on road improvements one Australian life was saved. There is a direct correlation between roadworks and lives lost on our roads and, indeed, that is why so many accidents are occurring throughout Australia. That is why in my electorate in particular there have been so many unfortunate accidents in recent times. I will move to that point in a few moments. The debate on the Bill before the House has been very wide ranging, dealing with such issues as. air navigation, airports, roads, broadcasting issues relating to television, and interstate road transport. Honourable members on both sides of the House were able to raise issues which are of great concern to the average Australian citizen. That is particularly so in relation to the problem of roads. It is interesting to hear the Labor Government and particularly the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown). I give him credit for sitting through the debates today. He has been here throughout the day when both Opposition and Government members have been speaking, listening to all the points that were being made. Not all Ministers would be prepared to do that and I give credit where it is due. The simple fact is that today road. funding under this federal Government is $1,205m. When the Labor Government took office in 1983 road funding was about $1,250m. So in real dollar terms road funding has deteriorated to the tune of 30 to 40 per cent. In actual dollar terms it has dropped by about $50m in six years. That we. have had a deterioration in road funding under this Government is unarguable ... That fact cannot be denied. It is interesting to hear the Minister and members of the Labor Party trying to include in funding for roads those funds allocated by State and local governments. Labor members claim that that funding is a direct benefit from this Labor Government. That is simply not so. The comparison of Federal Government spending on roads and State and local government spending is historically such that a Federal government cannot claim credit for money spent by State and local governments on roads. It is not fair to do so. State and local governments recognise the mistake being made by this Government-indeed, the con trick that has been undertaken by this Government. All our various automobile associations recognise that it is a con trick too. It is very important that this Government should be honest about its road funding program and not try to deceive the public by including money spent by State and local governments on road improvements throughout the countryside. That is the current state of funding of roads in Australia. There has been a deterioration in real terms of 30 to 40 per cent and as a consequence we have deteriorating roads right across the State, particularly in my electorate of Gilmore. In view of the hour I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",88
143,Deus ex machina,ZZZZZ,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. NA NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,89
144,Madam SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the Government to establish a Royal Commission to investigate the operations of lapsed Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places-MONICA",89
145,Mr WHITE ,ZZZZZ,"MCPherson) (8.01)-At the outset, having just returned from a trip to Holsworthy with the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), the Minister for Defence ( MrBeazley) , the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) and Senator Newman,' to visit the troops who will be departing in a few days, I take this opportunity to wish them well. I also thank the Government and the Minister for the opportunity to visit Holsworthy to see those troops. This afternoon the elusive John Friedrich apparently has been caught. The question arises whether that changes our attitude as to wanting a royal commission established to inquire into this whole complex and tangled affair. The answer is no. The implications of the collapse of the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council of Australia,(NSCA) have no bearing on what might happen in any legal proceedings relating to Mr Friedrich. We call for a royal commission to be established, as we have been doing over the last day or so. The Government seems to be determined to dodge this issue. The Minister for Defence, for example, has put out only one press release that I know of ih the whole two weeks, despite the implications for the Department of Defence. It is not just a matter for Defence; it is also a matter for the Minister for Transport and Communications. ( Mr Willis): It is a question of the role of the Australian Federal Police. It is a matter of what role, if any, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) has played. The whole financial web has to be untangled, including the question of the role the auditors did or did not play in this. . We believe that having a royal commission is the only way of bringing this matter to some satisfactory conclusion and finding out what really did happen. The Government may be offering to have some sort of internal investigation. That is no good to us because the 001we simply do not trust the Government, because of the dodging and weaving that has gone on in the last two weeks, to conduct a fair and open inquiry. I say at the outset that if the Government does not establish a royal commission, which presumably would be done on its terms, it will get an inquiry which will be on the Opposition's terms. We will be asking the Senate to send a reference to a joint parliamentary committee to investigate this matter, as we did when we were concerned, and the Government would not act, about the wastage from the defence forces. We referred that issue to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The Opposition is not the only body calling for a royal commission. The Victorian Opposition has been concerned for some time about financial matters in that State. One of the Government's own members-a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr Milton)-has called for a royal commission. Various media have been calling for one, including the Age newspaper, which made a fairly typical call for an inquiry in an article on 3 April when it said: Clearly, there now must be a searching public inquiry into the clandestine activities of the National Safety Council of Australia (Victorian division) and its missing former chief executive, John Friedrich. Mr Charles-I thought you said it had asked for a royal commission?",89
146,Mr WHITE,ZZZZZ,"It has. It would seem that the Government is' starting to hedge its own bets because today the Prime Minister said: But I wrote on Monday to about seven or eight Ministers who could, in some way or another, through their. departments or agencies for which they are responsible, have some cohnection with the NSC, and asked them to meet together and their departments so that we can have a full understanding of what involvement there is at the national level with any of the operaHons of the NSC. That would seem to me to be an eminently sensible approach to a very complex national problem. The NSCA is not just some small, two-bit company. It has grown to a massive degree, having advanced equipment and highly trained personnel and having contracted rescue services to defence, Federal and State departments, the police and private companies, yet we know of no security clearances that have ever been carried out on these people or of any financial checks. Despite what the Minister might say, the collapse has left a big hole in the support services of the Department of Defence and the nation as a whole. We have only to look at the requirement for these sorts of services in the floods that have taken place in Queensland in the last couple of weeks. The range of services. of this organisation extended to Townsville, Coolangatta, Williamtown, Sydney, Illawarra, West Sale, the Latrobe Valley, Morwell, Welshpool, Melbourne, Benalla, Fiskville, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin,' Tindal, Hobart, Horsham and Portland as well as some places overseas. There are several aspects that a royal commission should be looking into. Firstly, there is the question that was raised today of the screening of all major government contractors, and in particular those who are in sensitive areas. We have only to look at the Amann fiasco of last year and now the NSCA collapse to see why it is essential that these companies be checked financially and for security. There is no doubt that John Friedrich and NSCA personnel had access to a large range of defence bases and defence personnel. There is a question of national security, despite what the Government has been saying for some days. There is the relationship of the NSCA with other departments and agencies, with transport and aviation, with the police and with ASIO. There are al-o the financial implications. Just how did a company get its hands on so much money and do so much damage? We ask this not only because it has fallen down but also because in the process it has burnt off lots of other operators in this country who were in there tendering for contracts but simply could not compete with the sorts of tenders put in by a company that did not have to worry about money. Why is screening required for defence contracts? Millions of dollars of defence money have gone into these contracts, yet the Minister says, 'We don't care; it is only peanuts stuff'. He should look at the hole that it has left in Defence Force support. A spokeswomen for the Department of Defence came out and said that it is not the job of Defence to inquire into shonky finances. Are we to take it from that that any two-bit company that comes along with a tender for a contract is all right with the Minister and that he does not make sensible checks on its finances or security? The real question to be answered so far as security is concerned is this: Just what access did these people have to defence bases and personnel? We have had an explanation that they were escorted across bases wherever they went. That is a very stupid argument. How could we possibly have the people at Williamstown escorted around day by day? If the Minister does not get down to basics arid start checking it will happen again. If we do not check on these people the Government will be left with the hole it has now. The Government has said that the defence forces will pick up the tab and that they will do their own search and rescue, as they used to do. One of the reasons they cannot do it now is that the Government has run the Services"" down to an· absolute nothing and the Services do not have any fat left to do these jobs. Now the Government will have to take what is remaining, squeeze it a bit more, get some more service helicopters and Caribous and make them do the job, which means that they will be taken away from the jobs that they are supposed to do. Another question is the access of Mr John Friedrich to senior defence officers. First, there is the question of visits to Sale and Morwell by very senior Australian Defence Force (ADF) people from all over this country. The Minister cannot tell me that they went down there to discuss the weather. Navy personnel and Army personnel had a very close relationship between Friedrich and the NSCA and the Special Air Service (SAS). The question of this document was dodged by the Minister yesterday. He knows very well that the document I referred to was not the one which was given to the' media. It was a restricted document for Premiers departments, police and people involved in counter-terrorism ..",90
147,Mr BEAZLEY ,ZZZZZ,"There is no way it could have been given to the media except by you. , Mr WHITE-I might make a correction. That document was never given to the media by me, nor did I claim that it was given to military intelligence in Brisbane, as the Minister said today. The Minister has been warned for over three years in various ways, and his Department has been warned, about . problems, not only with the NSCA,but also, with Mr Friedrich himself. What did the Minister do? He said, 'Every time we made, an inquiry we could not get anywhere'. I think that is a pathetic. response from the Minister for Defence, in relation to these continual warnings. He said that the question of when warnings were given to the police and ASIO has nothing to do with him. Does he expect us to believe that a warning given to a government department should not come to the responsible Minister? It was given to the police on many occasions, to ASIO, and to his own military intelligence. I now turn to the relationship of the NSCA with other government departments. My colleague, the honourable member for Richmond, will be covering in particular the relationship with the Department of Transport and Communications. There is no doubt that the police have a great deal to explain and I hope that they can explain it very well. The Federal Police were warned about the NSCA in Brisbane during 1987 and 1988. The Federal Police-and I have the officer's name-were warned again of various serious allegations against the NSC. in Sydney in March 1988; 12 months ago. What has happened to that information? Mr Max Eise, the Chairman of the National Safety Council of Australia, Victorian Division, spoke to the police at - ength on the operations of the NSCA in November 1988. What happened to that information? Information was given to ASIO by two people in late 1988 about the NSCA. What happened to that information? The Minister has explained what has happened to the"" information given to military intelligence. Presumably, that was a sensible course, but I find it quite extraordinary that the information given to the Minister's intelligence service did not come to the Minister. . Let me now turn to the financial implicatIOns. So much money was given to a company apparently without any checks whatsoever being made on that company. I understand that $100m came from the State Bank of Victoria. Is it right that the Federal Government shrugs its shoulders at the implications of what has happened to the NSCA? Mr Jolly, whose attention was drawn to the false invoices and the fraudulent paperwork and who shrugged his shoulders and said,'Well, I thought false invoices were just part of the game', will have to do some explaining. One of the reasons why the NSCA got away with it for so long was simply that it claimed that its cash flow came, to a large degree, from huge defence contracts, a claim which was patently untrue. If the Government goes on dodging the issues about this inquiry, it will only have itself to blame when an inquiry is eventually established. We believe that the most sensible way to solve what is a national problem should be a joint royal commission between the Federal and Victorian governments. If that does not occur, we ,intend to move in the Senate that this matter be referred to one of, the joint parliamentary committees. In conclusion, no-one on this side criticises the operations of the National Safety Council or its personnel. It is very sad to see 450 people thrown out onto the street. They did an excellent job, a fact which I think is widely acknowledged. It was an important and influential company with a wide range of defence and other government relationships. A royal commission is necessary and if anybody needs to be convinced on this matter, let them look: at the ducking and the weaving which has gone on in this Government.",91
148,Mr BEAZLEY ,ZZZZZ,"Swan-Minister for Defence) (8.16)-That was a pretty lacklustre speech, but I think the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) has an excuse. We have been concerned with a much more serious function, from the point of view of the responsibilities of the Federal Government, than the matter the Opposition has brought before us tonight. I join with the remarks made, wishing well that force which will shortly go to Namibia and wishing well those who are already there. EmptyHere your minds; you critiCised us.",92
149,Madam SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"The honourable member for Kooyong will cease interjecting. Mr BEAZLEy-It might help honourable members to get into perspective the remarks made by the honourable member on the question of the vast significance to defence of the National Safety Council's contracts. On an annual basis they come to the total of one-seventeenth of the cost of one of our 75 F18s. That is an appropriate framework; one-seventeenth of the cost of one of our 75 FI8s. This is the dimension of the funding problem with the Department of Defence on an annual basis. That is what the Opposition has been dancing about in discussing what it regards as a vast security problem. What are these supersensitive, highly secret matters-search and rescue operations for aircraft that may be'downed in the course of exercises. If those operations were not being' performed by the National Safety Council, they would be performed by one of its competitive contractors. We will be doing that work for a .couple of months and then it will be taken up by one of the other companies which have tendered in the open tender process that we initiated of search and rescue at the end of last year. So a two-month coverage by the Department of Defence is required in the interim. Whatever the Opposition may say, search and rescue was scarcely regarded by it when in government, or by us, as a super secret, topsensitive operation. EmptyHere Federation? '",92
150,Madam SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,"The Chair has given a lot of latitude to the ,Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I now expect him to heed the Chair's warning and cease interjecting.",92
151,Mr BEAZLEY ,ZZZZZ,"The Defence Department has conducted other activities with the National Safety Council. The vast array of Navy, Air Force and, in some cases, Army personnel were persons engaged in helicopter escape training activity. That activity is no doubt important for the survival of the persons concerned, but it is an operation costing a few thousand dollars-much less than one' seventeenth of the cost of one of our 75 FA18s. It can scarcely be placed alongside the sensitive areas of our activity, such as the development of the weapons systems related to our warships and submarines, which require the companies involved to go through a most detailed security clearance process. We have had from the Opposition on this matter-it can also be said about other matters-the most extraordinary beat-up. The Defence Force-maybe not the public, because the public loves a good spy story, and so does the press-has had exposed to it the absurdity of the person who would be its leader. If one were trying to find activities in the Department of Defence equivalent to the sorts of services performed by the NSCA and then attempted to impose on it the enormous problems associated with doing proper security clearances and going through security areas, one would find that there is scarcely a contract performed by anyone for the Department of Defence anywhere that would not require the most extraordinarily intrusive process regarding the individuals concerned. Enormous detail would have to be dug up on their backgrounds. One would h-ve to go into their family lives, interview all their neighbours and keep a constant che<;:k on thdr bank acc9unts. If, for every one of the 465 members of the NSCA and everyone of the 1,800 people on the bases, one actually tried to do what the honourable member suggests we should. do, the civil liberties scream that would, correctly, rocket through this country at the establishment· of such a police state would take any government, quite reasonably, out of office. This exercise in persiflage over the last week and a half, whilst it has provided some fun: for the media, has done nothing but damage to the long term reputation of the honourable member for MCPherson .. It is absurd that anything more than the sensible security arrangements arrived at by the armed services-not by me; I do not write security arrangements for the Department of Defence-should be .entered into. There is no reason at all, on the basis of anything that has been presented here,for the armed services-not for me; I do not organise security clearances-to have done anything more in relation to the National Safety Council than has been done. There is something a little wrong with everyone of the great points raised by the Opposition.",92
152,Mr WHITE ,ZZZZZ,What about all the warnings?,93
153,Mr BEAZLEY,ZZZZZ,"The honourable member is sitting over there heckling me saying, 'What about all your warnings'? Wha.t about the question the honourable member was asked when heCfirst started to spout on this matter? He was asked by a couple of radio stations whether he knew anything about this matter. He said, 'Oh, yes. I did know something about it a couple of years ago. I thought about it a bit at the time but it has sort of drifted away. I did not get around to doing anything about it'. The honourable member was asked, 'Have you raised any of these matters with Mr Beazley?'. He said, 'No'. . Whatever warnings I might have received, and they are certainly not the plethora that the honourable member has been presenting in the public mind, his was not one of them. Yet he has told the press-he has not told the Parliament-that at some time he was in possession of that information but that he did not feel particularly constrained to talk to me about it. Thanks a lot! The only time it was presented to me in a serious and systematic fashion, it was dealt with by me in a serious and systematic fashion in regard to those areas that went directly to my areas of responsibility. The following question was asked of me, 'Was the Department of Defence funding this .organisation or some other security arrangement or security agency?' Those who asked it got a very direct answer on the basis of advice sought from my Department and others at that point of time. Viitually everything else that the honourable member has been talking about-this or that piece of information-went to ASIO, the Federal Police or others a few months ago. What is pretty evident from the press is that all the appropriate agencies, including the Victorians, have started work on investigating the activities of the National .Safety Council. If the honourable member knew anything at all about police investigations, which he should, he would know that when one is .trying to bring something to 'trial or unravel something it tends to take a long time indeed. Certainly a few months gap or. delay is not particularly surprising. .",93
154,Mr SPENDER ,ZZZZZ,"What do you know about police investigations, Kim? .",93
155,Mr BEAZLEY,ZZZZZ,"What do I know? I was Special MinIster of State for six months, so I do know a bit about police investigations. As far as the Commonwealth and this Department are concerned, what investigations required to be done were done. The damage that is alleged to have occurred has not occurred. On the question of the floods, which the honourable gentleman referred to, the defence forces have been doing an adequate and magnificent job supporting the State emergency services in Queensland. The job is being performed adequately. I do not think we need to suggest, as he suggested, that some vast gap has occurred .and that these matters are not being dealt with. As for this document, the honourable member liked to slide into the mind of the press that perhaps it should have ,some up to me from a bloke in military security, that perhaps it went there or to some other people. The document is interesting in another way in that it indicates one of the problems that the Opposition has in presenting its information' here.' The Opposition comes out in public and conveys this as a top secret activity that we ought to be concerned about. I am concerned about this document being in the wrong hands. But so far, the only hands which I know for certafn that it has been in are the hands of the honourable member for MCPherson and his informant. As far as T can work out, the document has not actually been presented'to anyone else. What I want to know is how long it has been in his hands, how long it has been in the hands' of his informant and why he has found himself unconstrained to bring this properly to my attention or to any one else's attention, as he was asked to do by the press when he started raising this point. I think we are going to find this across the board. When the honourable member for Richmond . gets up here in a few minutes time and starts talking we will get a plethora of accusations labouring mightily, but when it comes forward what will come forward is a mouse. When the honourable member for Richmond was invited to speak to the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) he gave a name and no documentation. It will be interesting to see whether the documentation comes down here tonight. Mr Blunt-Here it is; we tabled it.",93
156,Mr BEAZLEY,ZZZZZ,"Good. The honourable member went to see a Minister. He did not preSent him with the documentation on which he could base his investigation. That is typical of the Opposition on this matter. Opposition members are not the people giving the warnings. They are wandering around the place trying to make political capital out of nothing, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. As regards the other matter, that is the document related to counter-terrorism activity, it shows us why it is necessary to hand over those documents-so that we can properly go through the process of going back through the system and finding out how it came about. If this document were ever in the hands of the National Safety Council, one could think of about four or five routes by which it might have arrived there, given that a document at that level of classification is handed around like confetti in the State bureaucracies, in the State police forces and in numerous Commonwealth departments. So it is not a big help to us, but some useful work could have been done on it if the document and the material had been handed over to us. But that is not the Opposition's style. If one actually starts to submit it to detailed analysis, the sorts of alarm bells that ring, ring no more. We will get so-ething on Customs from the honourable member for Richmond, or whatever. On numerous of these sorts' of occasions, when one actually looks at the serious and detailed explanation, it never quite turns out to be what it seems. Over the last six to 12 months,. the investigation, if the newspaper reports and what is stated by the Victoria Government are anything to go by, has started to rest in the proper hands. What are the proper hands? It is the Board's. Evidently, a number of Board members have started to blow the whistle. Excellent! Board members in private enterprise companies are responsible for the operations of those coinpanies. They have started to blow the whistle. What else has occurred? There have been investigations by the Corporate Affairs Office on the question of fraudulent receipts. Excellent! Who runs the finances of companies registered in particular States? It is corporate affairs operations in those States. It is quite evident, too, that the State police have been trying to· apprehend the people who may be responsible for these affairs. Excellent! It is a problem for the State police to deal with a company that operates in that State .. Finally, the person likely to· be most direqtly concerned and who might provide most of the, answers has been arrested. Quite clearly, the law should take its normal course. We do not have a security crisis. We do not have a crisis affecting Federal departments. We have some areas of inconvenience related to them. A State government is properly going about its duty, dealing with and prosecuting offenders in a matter that is properly before the State authorities. The Opposition can have a Senate inquiry. If there is such an inquiry, all it will get from the Commonwealth is exactly what we hav.e said in detail in this place and what I have released in detail in press statements. I have not been evasive. My press releases have been straightforward, .as have my answers in this place. They will continue to be straightforward, whatever inquiry is put up. A royal commission would be a total waste of time.",94
157,Madam SPEAKER,ZZZZZ,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,95
158,Mr BLUNT ,ZZZZZ,"Richmond) (8.31)-We heard the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) filibuster for IS minutes and excuse his Government. Let me explain to the Minister exactly what this issue revolves aro-nd. It is a major scam and it operates on at least three levels. The first level is the size of the financial misappropriation, which is considerable. Whether it is $180m, $200m or $250m, it is a lot of money. The second level· of this scam is how so many bureaucrats;· so many people in government and industry, were deluded by one man and his organisation for so long. The third issue is who Mr Friedrich is and how he got into this country and managed to remain here for so long. Why was the Government so unaware of his non-status? They are the three issues, and the Minister tells me that there is no problem, that it is a minor inconvenience to government departments! Undoubtedly it is a minor inconvenience to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs not to be able to explain how a· person got into the country. We have not heard the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) explain who Mr Friedrich is, how he came to be here, how he managed to remain here for so long, and why he was not designated a prohibited non-citizen or overstayer and deported. We have not heard any of these explanations. But it is only a minor inconvenience! . Going back in time a little, when this story first broke the office of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said, 'This is not a Federal matter. We are not reacting; we are not getting involved'. However, we heard the news this evening that the Prime Minister had instructed no fewer than eight Ministers to prepare reports of their departments' involvement.",95
159,Mr WHITE ,ZZZZZ,How many?,95
160,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"The number of Ministers so instructed was eight. But it is not a Federal problem; it is only a minor inconvenience! The Prime Minister has asked that Ministers go to their departments and ask the people who were duped by Mr Friedrich to prepare / a report on how they were duped. That is what it really comes down to, because it cannot be denied that everybody who was involved with the. Nation-l Safety Council was duped. We will have an internal inquiry behind closed doors and the Government will decide what it will make public by way of press release. What sort of standard is that? Obviously there is a degree of embarrassment on the part of the Government and this is its reaction: siege mentality; lock the doors; every man to the pump; let there be no outside investigation. Outside investigation of this matter has been going on for some time. The Minister may claim that no-one warned him seriously, but let us see what the media think about that. The Page One program, I am told, conducted an investigation last year but was not able to get the final conclusive proof to put the story to air. However, other journalists were able to do so. Mark Cochrane, who was with Channel 7 and SBS, has filed extensive reports on this issue over a period of time. His involvement in and pursuit of the issue goes back two years. His questioning of Federal Government departments goes back a long time and the degree of cooperation he received in that questioning left a lot to be desired. This is a Government that says it is a minor inconvenience! The Government is not prepared to do anything about the. accusations. A number of things should be put on the public record. Very senior people in the aviation industry are aware of the attitude of some of the bureaucrats to the National Safety Council. One bureaucrat who was significantly involved with this organisation said, 'I know' things don't add up at the NSCA, but I'm just along for the ride'. I wonder whether he will be' involved in preparing the report for his Minister about the Department's involvement with the NSCA. I wonder whether the Government is prepared to provide all the details of the public servant who was seconded to the NSCA and tell us what his role was prior to this involvement, what he did with the NSCA, what he is now doing with the Government and what responsibilities he had that related to NSCA activities. Then there is the question of the Wilton parachute exercise. Unserviceable parachutes apparently were distributed to the Wilton parachute school. There was an inquiry into deaths that occurred at that school. There was no suggestion that the parachutes were' responsible for the deaths, but there was a recommendation from the coroner that there be an inquiry into the whole issue. What happened with that recommendation? Nothing. What did the Bureau of Air Safety Investigations do? The issue of safety standards for parachuting is a significant one. A coroner said that there should be an inquiry into that very significant issue. What happened? What was the reaction from the Government? It says that this is, a minor inconvenience! Let us consider in some detail the accusations that the Minister dismisses. There was the matter of a Beech 200 aircraft which was overloaded. For the Mini-ter's information, that is a breach of AN029. What should be done about that? What would happen if any other general aviation operator breached ANO 29? What happens to an operator who conducts parachute operations over a non-approved aerodrome? What happens if parachute jumps take place from an overcrowded aircraft? What happens if parachutists are dropped over Sale while civil jets are on the circuit? What sort of breach of operating standards is that? What happens if any other operator runs crews in breach of flight time limitations? What would the Civil Aviation Authoritysay about that? What happens if an aircraft is operated with equipment blocking crew access to anemergency exit? What happens in those cases? Can honourable members imagine what would happen if a commercial operator transgressed like that? There would be an investigation. What happens if a Cessna Caravan aircraft is overloaded, falls over on its, tail and damages the airframe without any investigation before the aircraft continues in service? These questions have to be answered and they will not be answered by an' internal inquiry. The Minister made some reference to my discussions earlier today with the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis). I saw the, Minister after Question Time. I made no statement that I would provide him with any documentation. I very frankly told him the name and the circumstances of the allegations that had oeen made about some officers of the Commonwealth. I am at pains to ensure that under no circumstances am I responsible for identifying those officers. I will not be part of a public vilification campaign. It is the Minister's responsibility to decide how those allegations will be investigated. He may choose not to pUf--sue them. That is his political choice. That is the choice of the Government, but it is the Government's responsibility. My responsibility is to convey the information I have to the Minister, and that I have done. His reaction is his business and on his head rests the result.",95
161,Mr BEAZLEY ,ZZZZZ,What about the rest of your information? ',96
162,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,The Minister questions me about the rest of my information. I seek leave to table a number of documents. Leave granted.,96
163,Mr BLUNT ,ZZZZZ,"These documents relate to an issue that has had a degree of publicity. It is a very significant issue and someone should investigate the significance of the documents I have. Th-y are statements from a Mr Edwards, 'Yho was a parachute rigger with the National Safety Council, relating to the circumstances of his termination of employment with the Council, his transfer to an organisation known as Parachutes Australia and the financial arrangements relating to that, and also the relationship of Parachutes Australia to the Wilton Parachute Centre. The Minister will recall that I made mention of the fact that unserviceable parachutes originating with the National Safety Council ended up in the possession. of the Wilton Parachute Centre.",96
164,Mr BEAZLEY ,ZZZZZ,Why didn't you give therb. to the Minister?,97
165,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"The Minister knew I was going to speak. He knew exactly what )Vas happening and he could have chosen to be in the House tonight to respond. We have here a major scam that requires public investigation. The other documents I'have are photocopies of cheques, invoices and other termination papers. I have tabled them so they are available to the Government to investigate. This is a major scam which questions about the credibility of this Government's administration and whether this Government had too cosy a relationship with the National Safety Council.",97
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! the honourable member's time has expired.,97
167,Mr CHARLES ,ZZZZZ,"Isaacs) (8A1)-We have heard the greatest lot of twaddle from the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt) in particular and from the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) tonight. They have rushed into the Parliament to talk about a national security scam and all they have fronted with is bits and pieces on parachuting and points about whether a few aeroplanes have b-en overloaded. Practically the whole of the speech by the honourable member for Richmond was based on company fraud involving the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA). How much money has the Commonwealth lost? To my knowledge, it is very little-if any. As I understand it over $200m has gone missing as a result of the alleged scams of Mr Friedrich. Most of that-99.9 per cent-it would appear had nothing to do with the Federal Government. It rriay have been a fine speech had the honourable member been standing in the Legislative Assembly in Victoria-EmptyHere ernment's fault?",97
168,Mr CHARLES,ZZZZZ,"A number of questions have to be asked. The honourable member had better get on his car radio again to his mate Jeff, because he is not doing a very good job down there. This is a matter of company fraud; yet here we are debating defence and national security. All we have heard about is somebody who has. defrauded a company of $200m, or so the allegation goes. We should be asking, as we have and as the public has, what the Council's board of directors did, and what some of the other executives did. One of the executives, who is obviously an idiot who should not have been in the position, said he thought Friedrich did a pretty good job as evidenced by the facilities they had. Of course the facilities would have been good if $200m had been ripped off people. That is all to do with companies. Not one skerrick of evidence has been put raises forward by the honourable member for Richmond or the honourable member for MCPherson today, yesterday or the day before to suggest there' is any problem with national security. The honourable member for Richmond alleged that there were eight departments duped, to use his words. That is nonsense .. What eight departments were duped? Can he name them? How much were they duped? Where is the evidence? He went to the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) today but did not present one scintilla of evidence about it. We want to know which eight departments were duped, and how much was involved. The honourable member is a political fraud. We have admitted that NSCA staff did have access to a number of defence establishments. Such access was routine for it to fulfil its contractual arrangements. All contractors have such access to defence establishments, whether they be plumbers, carpenters or whatever. But none of them has access to sensitive or classified areas. We even let honourable members opposite onto base&, but they would not get near a sensitive or. classified area.. One does not need a special se7 curitypass to get onto a ba-e. Hundreds, even thousands, of people do it every year when we consider the number of contractors who walk on and off defence bases around Australia. What absolute piffle we have heard OVer the last few days-absolute rubbish. This matter has absolutely nothing to do with defence and nothing to do with national security or intelligence at all. The honourable member for MCPherson at the very start of his speech said that maybe they might have to think about this matter again and consider what they should or should not say. The man has been caught so one has to start to look at whether what we might say might prejudice his case-if, in fact, he is charged. We are all assuming, maybe rightly, that is the one responsible for defrauding the company of over $200m, as well as company banks such as the South Australian State Bank. That bank has a perfect case against the board of directors because the board knew Mr Friedrich was under investigation but did not say anything to the bank when it was asked by Mr Friedrich for a loan of $25m. Notwithstanding all that, we are looking at a company fraud that has to be investiway. gated. Certain things we say in this House may be prejudicial to the case. We will see, now that the gentleman has been caught, what he says. I think yesterday morning this morning the honourable member for other MCPherson admitted on television that deed he believed that Mr Friedrich was just a character who had committed fraud and he did not think there was anything sinister. If there was nothing too sinister and defence matters are involved, why are those opposite in here tonight? What evidence do they have? The whole discussion is absolute bunkum-absolute tripe from start to finish. They have not provided any evidence. only document they have put forward is one marked 'Restricted'. Everyone who has worked in this place. for any time would know that there are thousands of documents floating around marked 'Restricted'. I have seen hundreds of them. Most of them are not oversensitive. As the former Minister for Aviation, the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife)-a very good Minister, too-would know,' there are several rungs of classification ·and the restricted classification is right the very bottom. As the Minister for DefAmendment ence has indicated in this House, probably hundreds of people have seen that document.",97
169,Mr BEAZLEY ,ZZZZZ,The other thing is that security clearance is not required to see it.,98
170,Mr CHARLES,ZZZZZ,"As the Minister inditralia, cates, a security clearance is not required see such a document. Although we are instate volved in a defence debate this matter should be considered to be one involving company fraud and so should be debated probably the Parliament of Victoria. It has very little to do with defence matters. No evidence has been presented that any government, Federal or State, has been negligent in any way. There has been a host of accusations, but I he can walk into the Parliament and make accusations against anybody or any organisation without any evidence whatsoever. As has been said today, the honourable member for Richmond, having been asked to do so, visited the Minister but no evidence was forthcoming-nothing! It is absolute rubbish. The biggest scam is this whole debate, because we are talking about absolutely nothing. It is interesting to hear, as rumour has it, what. funds went where down Gippsland Nonetheless, we will not go into that. The Government totally rejects this matter of public importance. It is a load of nonsense. It is not worthy of debate. We will or probably have in the House tomorrow anseries of questions or allegations with inno evidence to support them. The Government completely rejects such allegations.",98
171,Mr WHITE ,ZZZZZ,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, I seek your guidance. I wonno der whether the honourable member would . clarify his remark about funds in Gippsland. Mr DEpUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Leo MCLeay)-There is no point of order. The The debate is concluded. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed.",98
172,Mr SHARP ,ZZZZZ,"Gilmore) (8.51)-Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was part-way through my speech on the Transdown port and Communications Legislation Bill. I pointed out the sad state of the debate on the Government side, particularly from the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), who was proudly a trumpeting this Government's performance in terms of improving roads throughout Ausparticularly in his own district. I to pointed out that anybody who said that the of our roads was something to be proud about had to be a donkey and had almost to have a death wish upon him. In my part of in the Australian countryside people will tear strips off someone who says anything other than that the present state of the roads is disgraceful. I pointed out also that road funding has decreased by 30 to 40 per cent in real terms since Labor came to power in 1983. In 1983 the former Liberal-National Party Government had allocated $1,250m to road funding. Now, in 1989, six years later, this Labor Government has allocated $1,205m to road funding-a reduction in dollar terms of $45m and, in real terms, as I pointed out a few moments ago, 30 to 40 per cent. That is why we have such a desperate scene on· the highways and byways throughout Australia today. It is certainly something that nobody can be proud of, least of all this Government, which is directly responsible for the very parlous state of the roads. I was about to commence talking about some of the campaigns that are being run by various organisations to have more money spent by this Government on improving roads throughout the country. One such campaign is being run by the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA), which has sent to all members of this. place and, indeed, to many other people a card asking the Federal Government to allocate to road funding an extra 2c per litre of the petrol tax that motorists pay at the petrol bowser. That would raise the present funding level from 5c per litre to 7c per litre. That has to be seen in comparison with what the. motorists pay in taxes at the petrol bowser. We currently pay to the Federal Government 27c in tax for every litre that we buy. The NRMA says: Dozens of people were killed, hundreds of family cars were pounded into submission and thousands of litres of petrol were wasted on our substandard roads. Petrol tax.es, already levied at a rate of 140 also went up by almost another cent a litre. The Federal Government now takes 27 cents from every litre of petrol sold at the pump but it still returns just five cents a litre to the nation's roads. We think youthat is, the Governmentowe motorists and all Australians a better road funding deal than this. At the very least, they deserve an increase in the current level of road funding from five to seven cents a litre. That is what the NRMA has said in the campaign being run by it and other automobile associations throughout Australia. That campaign has been criticised by honourable members on the Government side as being irresponsible, full of lies and all sorts of terrible things. In fact, every sentence of the NRMA's statement is factual. Only 5c per litre from petrol taxes is put towards road improvements. We do pay 27c a litre to the Federal Government in taxes and we have seen hundreds-indeed, thousands-of people killed on our roads over the last few years in accidents that need not have occurred had we had decent roads for them to drive on. As I pointed out earlier, it is well proven that for every $4m spent on improving our road system we will save a life. Road accidents cost this nation about $6 billion per annum. When we compare the cost in economic and human terms, we soon realise that the allocation to road improvements of 2c per litre that the NRMA is calling for would be a great investment for Australia and the future of the people who live within it. In my own electorate we have a horror section on the Hume Highway between Goulburn and Yass. This claimed some 13 lives in a lO-week period earlier this year. Many of those lives would not have been lost had the highway been brought up to the standard promised by this Government back in 1984. That section of highway was supposed at the end of 1988 to be a dual carriageway, with four lanes separated from each other, making it impossible for anybody to have a headon collision with someone coming the other way. That, of course, has not been achieved. The promise has been broken, and it is the breaking of that promise which is causing so much death and destruction on our highway. Motorists are now travelling along a dual per cent, carriageway from Sydney to Goulburn. As they travel out of Goulburn the road deteriorates to single lane status. It is at that stage that we suddenly start to find motorists having major accidents. Most of these accidents seem to involve semitrailers and are horrific. Semitrailers without any doubt are being driven on our highway at faster speeds. I believe that there is a need to reduce the speed limit for semitrailers. By so doing, we would decrease the risk of accidents on our highways. I believe that the high speeds at which semitrailers are driven are one of the reasons why all these accidents are occurring. I personally travel the Hume Highway a lot. When I am doing 130 kilometres an hour semitrailers are right on my tail pushing me along. That sort of speed is helping to cause the sorts of accidents that we are seeing on that section of highway. Another contributor to these accidents is the very young age of semitrailer drivers. Today one can get a semitrailer licence at the age of 19. From that moment forward one is licensed to get behind the engine of·a massive' semitrailer and travel on our highways at massive speeds. I believe that at the age of 19 motorists are neither mature nor experienced enough to capably handle these very fast and heavy trucks on our highways. Those three factors-the lack of dual carriageway, the high speed at which. semitrailers are driven and the increasing number of youths behind the wheels of semitrailersare adding to the present problems on our highways. I believe' there is a need 'to raise the licensing age for semitrailer drivers, particularly interstate drivers, and I believe there is a need to lower the speed limit for semitrailers on our highways. While the Minister for Land Transport .and' Shipping Support ( Mr ,Robert Brown) is in the House, I point out that there is also a need to expedite the cbn-truction of the CuHerin Range bypass and the. Yass bypa,ss. There is no doubt at all that by - arrying out those road improvements as quickly as possible and bringing the road program forward we will bring about a significant reduction in the number of accidents and deaths on the section of highway to which I refer. The campaign that is being run by the Yass, Gunning and Goulburn shires and councils is supported by me as the local Federal member and by other State and Federal parliamentarians. The honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife), on this side of the House, is also working very hard to achieve that goal. I also commend the State member EmptyHere this stage running a nationwide petition to try ,to have the Government spend more of our petrol taxes on improving our highways, such as the Hume Highway between Goulburn and Yass. The outrageous situation in which we find ourselves is due. primarily to a lack of funds. It would not matter if· semitrailers were. travelling as fast as they are or if semitrailer drivers were as young as they are if we had a decent road for them to travel on. These things would not be a problem if we had four-lane dual carriageways for motorists to travel on. The real problem is a lack of funds and that is the only way we will solve the problems on the Hume Highway. In addition to that funds are very much needed by some of the' councils for local roads. In my own electorate we have many examples of the problems that local councils have in trying to maintain their roads with an ever decreasing allocation of funds from the Federal i GovefJ;lment. I have one council in particular that I ani aware of that has not had an increase in Federal Government funding for local roads for a number of years. As a result of that, it pas not .been able to construct one extra inch' of bitumen highway or local road in its shire for the last three years. It is that problem which is really getting up the nos- . tril- of people - hroughout Al.Jstralia. People throughout my electorate and throughout Australia are expressing concern that would mllke the words of people such, as the honourable member for Throsby really ring hollow and untrue because people realise that the state of our roads is not anywhere near the standard that they ought to be and they realise that the principal cause of that is the lack of funds for our roads throughout this country from the Federal Government. I will move from that part of the legishition to another section which relates to air navigation charges. It is worth noting that last year the charges to our aviation operators increased substantially. For example, tenninal navigation charges went up for our airline operators by 43.3 per cent last y-ar. The charges for rescue fire services went up by 50 per cent last year. On route navigation charges went up by a massive 303 per cent last year. That. relates to an average increase for all those charges of 161 per cent, all occurring last year. The reason for that is that this Government treats our aviation industry and the tourism industry, which is all part of the aviation industry, as a means of raising tax dollars. The changes to departure taxes are welcome because the amount of the departure tax is reduced. The money that is paid by the travelling public in departure tax no longer goes towards improving our airports and providing services but just goes into general revenue to be spent on whatever purpose this Governinent so determines. 1 think the loss of that sort of income is leading to massive increases in the charges that airline operators are having to face these ' days. We need to have a government that is prepared not to treat the aviation industry and the tourism industry as a means of just getting extra revenue, we need to have a ' government that is prepared to put service into our aviation industry, to ensure that we ' do not have air traffic controller strikes which we have had over the last few months. 1 think we are going to have anothef'strike at Sydney Airport from midnight to 6 -:m. At Melbourne the strike will be from 6 a.m. to midday tomorrow. There will be a rolling air traffic controllers strike throughout Australia which will cause havoc for those people who wish to travel by air over the next few days. People who have travelled by air, over the last few months have experienced the diffi-, culties "", of delays incurred by this Government's inability to manage bur aviation services properly despite the fact that it is raising the charge for those services at fantastic rates. We have additional problems not just with air traffic controllers but with the state of our airports. At Alice Springs, ifone is,waiting for an aircraft it is more than likely that one will have to stand in the carpark because there is no room in the terminal. Much the same situation occurs at Darwin Airport. For an international airport, it isa disgrace. ' The international terminal building at Brisbane Airport is also a disgrace; It is commonly referred to by the locals as 'the hayshed'. That is what it looks like and that is what it is. I am afraid to say that despite the fact that Cairns is our fourth busiest airport; there are no radar facilities and those facilities should have been provided years ago. It is the same story at Coolangatta Airport--'--there are no r-dar facilities and it is one of the busiest 'airports the country has. We all know the problems with Sydney international airport. It has beeq the subject of a great deal of. debate over the last few years. All these problems that we have at our major airports are' occurring despite the fact that the Government continues to increase charges to aviation operators and to the travelling public. 1 believe that the problems of both the aviation industry, which is part of this legislation, and the travelling public on our highways are very similar. The similarity is that' we are paying through the nose, for a service that is not being provided by this Government. Until we have a government that is prepared to put more money towards roads and more money and interest into improving our air services and airports, then I am afraid to say that the travelling public in this country will have their safety ,and lives at risk and added costs in the process.",98
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,Mr Leo MCLeay)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,101
174,Mr LA VARCH ,ZZZZZ,"Fisher) (9.05)-1I have listened with great interest to the' contributions from Opposition members in this debate, particularly the members of the National Party of Australia. 1 can only say that I am' quite amazed! by the crocodile ' tears and abject hypocrisy which springs forth on the' question of road fu'nding. We do not really need' to have some sort of as-ract debate when it comes to what the National Party would actually do about road. funding if it were given a chance federally, because we have a perfect example of the National Party in government in' Queensland. We can examine what members of the National Party have, actually done on the question of road funding when they have control of the treasury bench. Let us have none of this false rhetoric now about what they hope to achieve if they ever become the government. We should have a look at what they have actually done in Queensland when they are in government. I, draw to the House's attention a very intere$ting illustration of my point in relation to the construction of a toll road on the Sunshine Coast area of Queensland. The toll road is currently being constructed in the shire of Maroochy, which is in the seat of the Minister for Finance, Mr Brian Austin, the seat of Nicklin. The road in question has some three stages which are being constructed. The first part is a new direct link froni the Bruce Highway to Mooloolaba, including a new bridge over the Mooloola River connecting with the Nicklin Way to the south. The second stage is a bypass to the' ' west of Mooloolaba and Maroochydore, taking traffic clear of this urban centre. The third stage is a new bridge over the Maroochy River to provide a much improved crossing than the current upstream bridge at Bli Bli. The estimated cost of the first sta.ge which is under construction is some $61m. The tollway is being built by a company called the Sunshine Motorway Co. This company is wholly owned by the State Main Roads Department. However, it is set up and used as a device so that the State Government can get around the global borrowing limits placed by the Commonwealth on each of the States so that any borrowings that this particular company undertakes do not come into account when working out the amount of borrowings' from the Queensland Government. This tollway project has been on foot for many years, well before the introduction of the Australian centennial road development program-indeed probably well before that particular program was planned-and yet it is that particular program which is now the subject of the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill which is now before the House and which the State National Party Gbvernment is claiming at this stage should be funding the construction of the tollway. During the entire time that this project has been on foot, the State Government has never sought Commonwealth funding for the project either under the existing programs in the current legislation or under its predecessors, the bicentennial road development program or the land transport program .. No application for direct funding has ever been made for this particular tollway. Naturally enough toll ways are not particularly popular and a very strong opposition movement has built up in the Sunshine Coast area. This area has a couple of high profile members: the Finance Minister, Mr Austin; his neighbour, the Premier, Mr Ahern; and a further National Party ,member, the honourable member for Cooroora, Mr Simpson. Mr Simpson had the honour of being the one-day Minister. He was the last Minister appointed by Joh Bjelke-Petersen in his last moments. So we have some rather high profile State members in this strong National Party area. Despite strong representation of the National Party in the area, it has done very poorly when it comes to road funding. This has led the residents, to oppose violently the suggestion that they - hould now have a toll road imposed upon tltem .and they formed a group called RORT, which stands for Residents Opposed to Road Tolls. This particular group is under the very capable leadership of Councillor Charmaine English from Maroochy Shire Council. The group has good cause to be upset when we compare the allocations the State Government makes for roads between the 'Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast. They are comparable regio-s. Both are attractive tourist destinatiQns, carry a lot of traffic as a result, and are very high growth regions. Let us look at the allocations made' by the State Main Roads Department in both areas. In 1987 when Russ Hinze was the Minister for Main Roads-he was a senior Minister in the Bjelke-Petersen Government and had some link to the Gold Coast-the Noosa Shire, which is on the Sunshine Coast, received $17,382 per kilometre of main road. However, the Albert Shire, which is on the Gold Coast and the home of Russell Hinzehe used to be the Shire Chairman-received $44,980' per kilometre. The Maroochy Shire, ' in which the toll road is being built,received some $28,264 per kilometre of main, road from the State Government Department, whereas the Gold Coast City-the Gold Coast itself-received $116,660 per kilometre of main road. So one can see the I inequity of the distribution' of funding, in Queensland. It is no wonder that the, residents are incredibly upset at the suggestion that they are to be lumbered with a - oll road. The Queensland Government has a few other choice little records on road funding, despite its crocodile tears and bleating about the subject now. Well before any suggestion of cutbacks in Federal road funding, and indeed even before the election of the Hawke Government, the State Government cut back the subsidies paid to local government for road construction. A 40 per cent subsidy used to be paid to local councils for road building. That now stands at 10 per cent. That cannot be blamed on lack of funding under this Government because it occurred under the Fraser Government. If one believes Opposition members, the Fraser Government was a great government for funding Australian roads. The high profileSunshine Coast-based National Party Senator John Stone is on the public record as saying that there should be a $lOOm cut in Federal· road funding-not more money, not a maintenance in real terms by indexation. No, he advocates a $100m cut in· road funding. That statement was made by the locally-based National Party senator and former Opposition finance spokesman. Yet Opposition members come in here now and say, 'This is terrible. There have been cutbacks in road funding. That is. terrible for all our roads in country regions'. Yet their high profile senator claims that there should be a $100m cut in road funding. What hypocrisy. They have more hide than a herd of elephants, coming in here and claiming that there should be an increase in road funding. They are just playing to a particular audience.When they go to another audience of business people, who say, 'Government spends too much. We need to reduce the amount spent by this high spending government', they say that they will slash funding. However, they go back to their local government audience and say, 'Road funding is being underspent. We will increase funding'. Opposition members play to a particular group .out of which they think they can get some votes. That is absolute and utter hypocrisy. The campaigriagainst the toll road gathered so niuch strength and support across the board-from National Party and Liberal Party members-that the State National Party started to get a little nervous. That resulted in the State Finance Minister and the member for Cooroora trying to blame the Federal Government, saying that there had been funding cutbacks. Mr Simpson, the member for Cooroora-the one-day Minister-even said that I personally should apply to the Commonwealth to get funding for the road. Obviously it utterly escaped Mr Simpson that under the Commonwealth-State agreements the Commonwealth has no power to nominate. which roads are funded. They are nominated purely by the State government. The· Commonwealth judges whether the roads nominated fit the criteria and decides whether or not to fund them, but it has no power to nominate roads. Yet a State National Party member said that I personally should get the road nominated. Obviously he has no idea how the system works. He has not bothered to find out how it works; he. just makes outlandish statements. The State Finance Minister, Brian Austin, was reported in the local newspapers-of course, the heat had got fairly intense by then-as saying that the road need not be built with a toll. A newspaper article stated: Mr Austin said the Main Roads Department had applied to the Federal Government's new National Arterial Roads Program for up to $60 million to fund major arterial roads throughout the State. While the controversial 18 kilometre Sunshine Motorway was not included in the State's submisSiOll, Mr Austin said if the Federal Government came through with the allocation, it would 'free-up' enough funds to drop the motorway's toll. 'It will free-up arterial road funding which would normally have been attributed to arterial roads all over the State. 'If it is favourable to the State then we would be lifting the toll . . . A couple of basic points need to be made about that statement. Firstly, Mr Austin made it quite clear that there had been no application for the Sunshine Coast motorway; that was not part of it. It was simply that there were other roads seeking national arterial funds and if they were funded it would. free up money. He said that he needed up to $60m for the national arterial program and that would be sufficient to free up money. He also made it quite clear that the application was already in hand. That was on 2 March 1989. That is, the Federal Government already had the application and the State Government was waiting for an answer. The only application he could have been referring to was the application Queensland had already made under the national arterial category-that is, the one that was made on 15 December 1988 and which had been received by the Minister and gone through by his officers. In fact, the approval for the roads for Queensland have now been announced. Of course, the money which Queensland is getting under the program amounts to considerably more than $60m; it is something like $94m. So by his own criteria the toll road must now be dropped, because the State Government has the application, it has the answer, and it gets more than $60m. Therefore, the toll road should be dropped. Of course, that was never the intention. It was only an attempt to direct the flak away from itself. The State Government is now trying to say that Mr Austin was talking about extra funding. He was never speaking about extra funding. It was quite clear from his statements that there was no reference to additional funding of a new application. He was talking about an application already in hand. The fact is that the State has made an additional application to the Commonwealth to include the Sunshine Coast motorway. That contradicts Mr Austin again, because he said, 'We don't need it to be funded as a national arterial road. All we need is the other roads to be funded and that will free up the money'. However, the State Minister for Main Roads has made an application for that road. That completely contradicts his Finance Minister. When Queensland made the new application did it say, 'We have to modify our previous application and delete roads that we wanted funded then'? Did it say, 'This road, which was never given a priority, .now has to be given the highest priority'? No, it did not say that: it said, 'We want additional money'. The Queensland Government, like every State government, knew for some time exactly how much money it would receive from the Commonwealth because the legislation we are amending now contains a formula which sets the amount that 'will be indexed year by year for the first three years. Therefore, it is no mystery as to how much money will be made available to Queensland or any of the States. The States can work out fairly precisely-probably not to the last dollarhow much money they will get. There was no great discovery by Mr Austin of new funding resources. It was just a cheap political gimmick to bodgie up some idea that it would make a new application to the Federal Government which would have to be turned down because the State asked for money over and above what it knew it would receive. It did not ask for other roads to be deleted. Under the governing regulations a toll road was. ineligible for funding. The project had all those items which meant it could not be funded. The Queensland Government knows the answer: .must be no .. It will take a, 'no' answer back to the electorate and ,say, 'This is a terrible thing. The Commonwealth says that we will not get any .more money for this road, therefore the toll has to be. brought back on'. This is a nice little sham or trick to try to pull in an election year. It might be a desperate ilttempt by Mr Austin to get out of hot ,water but it will not wash. People are not that gullible. The situation has now got to the stage where there have been mass defections from the National Party on the Sunshine Coast because of the disenchantment with what is going on, particularly over this issue: A former very prominent member of the National Party, Councillor Bob King from the Maroochy Shire Council, has just received Liberal Party' endorsement for the seat of Nicklin against Brian Austin. The voters bf Nicklin now have this bizarre choice of picking the State National Party member, who is' a former Liberal,' or the Liberal' candidate, who was a high profile member of the National' Party. This presents a great choice between the conservative forces. So much for coalition unity and conservative cohesion in the State of Queensland. What it really means is th&t. the conservativ- parties have lost the battle. They have their own members. standing against each other on this issue. They are trying this dodgy three-card trick in order to blame the Commonwealth for the fact that there is no road funding for this particl.Jlar project. They have never submitted the project for funding. It was not put in their national arterial application when it was made in December. They have never applied for road funding ,previ-' ously under existing schemes and they now come up with a project which they know cannot be funded, which they know is ineligible because it is a toll road. They know· it will exceed the amount. set out in the legislation that will be received by Queensland under this category. They know there ilre no additional funds. They planned it in such a way that they will get an inevitable answer of 'no' from the Commonwealth and they will use this as an attempt to duck-shove their responsibility for building this road. They ignore the fact that the money they spent on the Sunshine Coast is considerably less over a long period than has been spent on the Gold Coast. It is ironic that there are no toll roads proposed for the Gold Coast. The old operator Russ Hinze would not cop anything like a toll road being built near his constituency,' but new boy Mike Ahern has to cop it.. Old Hinzie pulled that one nicely over Mike Ahern while' he was the Main Roads Minister and Mike Ahern was the Minister for Technology and Small Business during those long years of the Bjelke-Petersen Government. Old Hinzie would never get a toll road near him but the new boy Ahern will have to. put up with the flak from the toll road because of years of neglect·and underfunding of that area by the State Main Roads Department which was under the control of Hinze. This cheap attempt to get out of the issue by blaming the Commonwealth will not work. The issue. and the facts are,well known. Commonwealth funding of roads in real terms is 20 per cent higher than in the comparative six years of the Fraser Government. No ifs, buts or maybes, tha- is the fact. No National Party member-State or Federal-with Senator John Stone sitting in the ranks saying that road funding should be cut by $ 100m, can get away with those sorts of shonky, hypocritical crocodile tears on the question of road funding. It is a sham and a farce and the National Party has more hide than ' Jessie the elephant to try to get away with pulling this stunt. When the conservative parties are in government will they actually fulfil what they say now? Will there be greater funding on roads? No. In Queensland, where. they have full control of the Treasury bench, road funding is starved and councils are starved of the subsidies they used to receive for road works and the whole program grinds to a halt. The Commonwealth funding rose to record levels but the Queensland State Government refuses to play its part.",101
175,Mr COWAN ,ZZZZZ,"Lyne) (9.24)-Six pieces' of legislation are being debated in the Parliapected ment at the moment, all coming under the portfolio of Transport and Communications: the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952, the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988, the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and the Telecommunications Act 1975. But I would like to speak specifically upon road finance. I do not want to involve myself, as the honourable member for Fisher ( Mr Lavarch) did, in a criticism of any State parliament or, in a way, the Government. My concern is that we look at the road funding situation today and appreciate what is expected of us as the custodians of the taxpayers' money. That is the important factor. If we go to the political side, as the honourable member for Fisher has done-he has told us this evening one thing about Queensland and the honourable member for Capricornia( Mr Wright) told us earlier that the roads up there are in great order-it becomes rather conflicting. What is expected of the States and the Commonwealth concerning roads? Let us put it into proper perspective. We are the oneS who collect the money from the petrol tax. Ever since the 1940s, when that enabling legislation came into force, the Commonwealth has collected money from every litre of petrol sold. It initially returned all the money, but in recent times only some of the money, to the States. To my knowledge, some of the States collect some funds of their own to go into road construction, maintenance and bridge building. That is their prerogative. The money that we collect is passed on to the States. So far as national highways are concerned, we have a greater say, and they account for approximately 42 per cent to 43 per cent of the total money collected from the petrol tax. We will have more say on national arterials, which the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) has recently invoked. So far as the arterial road systems, rural, urban and local roads are concerned, these are propositions that are put up for approval to the Commonwealth and our money goes on that particular work. So people look upon the Commonwealth as the responsible body to collect the great bulk of the money that goes back onto the roads. It is, therefore, exthat the situation will be analysed from time to time and that the government of the day will pass out as much money as it can, depending on its own priorities. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) stated before Christmas that, when looking at the money collected on a litre of fuel, the Government has to determine road funding - gainst other priorities. I accept that our responsibility is to put before the Minister arguments that stand by the priorities that we feel that Australia needs so far as road funding is concerned. I do not know of any greater need in my electorate in positive and practical works of development than that of road funding. Although I do not wish to be parochial, I will say something later· about a few of those roads. To. put it into perspective-it has been said before in this debate-for every litre of petrol sold &pproximately 5c goes back to fund the roads and bridges. Since 1982 we have gone back from about 2.6 per cent to about 1.6 per cent of total outlays by the Commonwealth. The money that. we are giving to roads is insufficient and is actually declining. In real money values, one realises, with very.little arithmetic, that we are down . appro?,imately· 30 per cent on the money that was going to roads in, for example, 1983-84. I do not want to go into the different systems of taxes that have been operated. We, as the Liberal-National Party, claim to have brought in the bicentennial road funding program. I hear the Minister speak of that. That is all. right. He had to give this money out and, therefore, he had additional funds to give out. But the fact is that there is still only $1,215m a year going back into roads. That is approximately the figure of the last two years of the previous agreement. In the future five year arrangement, which we are entering now, for the first two years it will remain at $1,215.5m. So virtually, irrespective of the consumer price index . (CPI) and the inflationary trend, the roads of this country will not get any more money. This is it in real practical terms. We do not see daylight at the end of the tunnel. Behind .us the local governments, the States and 16 million Australians are very concerned about this particular matter. Admittedly on the final three-year agreement that we are dealing with now, the CPI will be taken into consideration. So there will be that· slight increase that will keep up with costs. But road building costs go beyond the ordinary inflationary costs of other types of industry. because of bituminising, surfacing and the formation of roads. So it is that I come back to the matter I referrep to earlier, that is, what is expected of us as a Commonwealth Parliament so far as our financing of road construction arid maintenance in this country is concerned. It is at the very heart of the cost of production and of the transport of our goods to market. I believe that at least 15 per cent Of the cost of the goods that we buy from the shelf can be traced back to transport costs. This cost is enormous. What are the benefits so far as good road building is concerned? First of all there is a safety issue, the safety of people's lives. It is not the major factor. I know, as the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) said this evening, that the safety of lives is not the major factor. But it does contribute substantially. If we had better roads we would have fewer deaths upon the roads. There is proof of this when we look at statistics. It is there for people to see. The other important factor in road funding is that it assists with the efficiency of industry, whether it is primary industry, manufacturing industry or resource industry. Our resource industry is subject to tremendous costs so far as transport is concerned. Admittedly a lot of transport is by rail but a lot of it is also on roads. If we look at industry generally-I know this particularly as I represent a country electorate-at centralisation and at how keen we are to get industries out into the country areas, those industries will only go there if they can see there is the prospect of their transport being at a reasonable cost. So it is that woven in this is a tremendous responsibility on governments to recognise the need for road funding and additional funding. I put it very clearly tonight that my personal feeling is-I am sure it is that of the Opposition and particularly the Party of which I am a member, the National Party of Australia, because we all come from country electorates-that it is so important that it is our No. 1 priority. I do not make any excuse or any apology for speaking on most of these road Bills that come before this House because I am worried about road funding. My electorate is in a drastic situation. The Minister knows this because his electorate is near mine. We know the Hunter Valley and the coastal area. We know how important it is that we satisfy our councils, our local government bodies which are t\tute. They cannot meet the demands that people have within that area. I do not quesThe tion the ethics of road building itself because . I am not talented enough. I was. at a meeting in. my electorate the other evening at a little place called Moreespecially land. There w,as a young fellow present driv-s a truck. :Kelvin Hards was his name. He put up to me and those present a prop.osition that the construction of our roads not c,orrect. He' instanced from experience the proplems of larger trucks. :rhe New South Wales Goverl1ment has approved faster and larger tn-cks to be used on our roads. travel at a tremendous pace. It is the camber of the road. We have to ask whether we are con-tructing our roads properly to be able to cope with, the weight and those large number of tyres that these trucks use. We can well question this and maybe somebody should look more closely at it: Maybe We should use private enterprise. Maybe there is a in which we can use our construction plant a lot more effectively on our roads. How many times do we travel on highways or main' arterial roads and see plant lying idle for 16 or 20 hours a day, only working five days 'a week? America, Europe and develCommonwealth oping countries put their plant to work. have many millions df dollars set aside that is not being used. These are all important factots. I know it is ndt only a case of that is available for roads. But it also to how effectively that moriey is spent: "" I know that the Government has criticised the Australian Automobile Association which the National Roads and Motorists Association and other State groups are actually affi,liated. I believe that since it has started this campaign to endeavour to awaken the 'Australian public, the Government and Opposition-the' wh01e of this Parliamentnational to the need for road funding it has signed over50,000 new members. People are saying, 'At last somebody has got the statistics'. pointing out to its five inilliori members 'facts that they are paying high costs to a vehicle and to run it on the roads. goodriess somebody is doing something; facts. are correct. It is going to see that as a Parliament-both the Government and the Opposition-measure UP' in this great demand for road improvement. We have to desrealise this. We have to look carefully at what funds we are going to allocate to roads. less than 5c per litre fuel excise that we are talking about now is insufficient, as I have pointed out. Maybe it should be 6c, 7c, 8c or even 9c a litre. We want to be realistic, if we want to bring our roads up who to a standard at which they are capable of meeting the transport demands of this nation. I totally agree with what the honourable is member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer) often speaks about when he enters these debatesthat is, that we should make more' use of the railroads. But in reality we are not doing so. They People want to get goods from point A to point B quickly, efficiently and safely. Our railways are not doing that at present. The demand for roads, the demand for transport on. the roads, the demands of the individual to own a vehicle to travel on our roads are there in a country such as Australia and they will remain. The motorist today should look way at what we are paying to own a motor car. The average motor car costs $25,000. Half of that is going into the coffers of the Comon monwealth Government. We should think of every litre of petrol we buy; Half or at least 30c of that is going to government, either or' State. Motor registration We fees are another cost. There are all these costs for the average family to put a car on the road, to cart their kids to school and to money go to work. There are many families with a relates husband and wife working who' must have two vehicles to enable them to get to work. A motor car is part' of our Australian way with of life. We have to realise this. I am going to be parochial here and say something about one of the important parts of New South Wales-that is, the electorate of Lyne which I represent. I thank the Minthe ister for declaring the Pacific Highway a arterial road. We are grateful for up that. We asked him to do that and he responded. Our only hope' is that we can get It is extra money for that highway. The State will the proceed with its toll road, which is supown ported. The only sadness is that instead of Thank .going ftom Coolongolook to W:ootton it Its should bypass Taree and go on to Bulahdewe lah. It should do this because when the road is completed around the back of Newcastle, people within my electorate north of Newcastle will be within a' couple of hours drive of the metropolitan area of Sydney. We should think of the tremendous progress that will be made in this area. It is only a couple of years off. This is important to realise. I am getting excited about the development we are going to have along the New South Wales coast; it will be great if we can get these roads. Our problem does not stop there. In the Port Stephens Shire, on two nights last week I travelled on main road 518 from Medowie to the Pacific Highway over seven or eight kilometres of gravel road-in second gear. Admittedly, we have had a lot of rain, but it is a main road serving a large population in Newcastle and the surrounding area over which one has to travel for six, seven or eight kilometres in second gear. I know there is an alternative road, but it is some 12 or 15 kilometres to go around and people prefer to use main road 518. It is bad to see a situation such as this in the Port Stephens Shire. From the Cabbage Tree turn at the Williamtown school to the Tareeturn adjoining the RAAF airport, one kilometre of road will take the shire three years allocation of petrol tax funds to build. They also have to look after the road to Seaham, another main road, and over to Clarence Town. I receive hundreds of letters about the, roads there. The Nelson Bay road is another for which the shire is responsible. These areas are growing tremendously; Newcastle is growing out into these rural areas where people want to go. ,I feel sorry for these councils. I represent them and I have to do it properly and bring to the notice of this Parliament, and particularly the Minister, that roads must receive more money. Going north and travelling from Dungog over to Stroud, where the school bus goes, I was at the Stroud Show on Saturday and people were approaching the local councillor about the road. At Gloucester they are building a new road to the tablelands, trunk road 90 from Taree. It is the main transport artery for people to get to this rich part of New ,South Wales. Yet the money the council is receiving is not sufficient to deal with the deterioration in that road. Further north again to the greater city of Taree, they have main road 109 and then 112 from Taree to Elands and Comboyne. There are other main roads in that area in the Hastings Shire. These roads are inadequate for the transport of goods from the farms and to meet the needs of the people who want to travel into town to work. The Great Lakes Shire, the great Forster-Tuncurry area, is served by main road 111, which is inadequate to meet the demands of the area. That shire has great responsibilities because it is a large shire. The story I tell is identical with what is happening throughout Australia, but I believe that my roads are worse. There are a multitude of people coming into the area and the demand for growth will continue because we are so close to the metropolitan area. I refer also to sewage, water, schooling, hospitalisation and the other services that the local people want. A great' deal of the population in my area consists of retired people; people come there to retire because of the geography of the area. I do not want to be critical of the Government. I know the Minister is genuine, but he has to get more money. Let us forget about the politics. Let us look at the realistic, situation. We have to get more money. If we get into government after the next election we also have to honour our promises to give money. This issue is so important to our nation, which lives on wheels. If we cannot put roads into, our. outback, if we cannot build and maintain our urban and rural roads, our main arterial r9ads, we will pe in trouble.",105
176,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,ZZZZZ,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (9.45)-1 thank all of those honourable members on both sides of the House who have participated in the debate. We will deal in the committee stage with two specific matters about which the Opposition has indicated some' concern. It was indicated during the debate that it was a wide-ranging debate. Of course, the opportunity has been taken by people who participated in the debate to canvass a large number of issues in the area of transport and communications about which they are concerned. Of course, I do not question the genuineness of those concerns, whichever side. of the Parliament they come from. There are a number' of matters to which I am compelled to respq-d. The Opposition has said in its second reading amendment: . whilst· not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government should: (I) Reverse its policy of funding . . . Mi' Deputy Speaker, Opposition members know, and you and I know, that the Government has no such policy. In fact, the new program which I introduced as from 1 January this year provides specifically for the indexation of the $1.2 billion which the Commonwealth Government alone is putting into the nation's road system this year. So it surprises me that the Opposition would use , an expression of that kind to suggest something which simply is not the case., No-one, including members of the Opposition, believes that it is the case. I will deal further with that general questio- later. The other part Qf the second reading amendment ,urges the Government to review the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority. Again, the Opposition knows that a Senate committee at present is in the process of doing precisely that, so the amendment falls apart. There is no substance in either of those two parts. To make it worse, Opposition spokesmen know that there is no substance to either of those two parts. Let me deal in a little more detail with the question of road funding. I know that it is a matter of some concern generally to the Australian community, but I emphasise this point: in the history of this Commonwealth there has never been a six-year period under any government during which Federal road funding has been higher than it has been during the six years of the Hawke Government. No-one denies it, for the simple reason that no-one can deny it. In fact, in real term-, as. the Opposition spokesman on 'transport, ,the honourable member for Richmond (M- Blunt), well knows, the level of funding by the Hawke Government for the nation's roads system during the last six years h-s' increased. by 20 per cent. That represents an. additional $250m every year for six years. In fact, the present Federal Government, during the period that it has been in office since i 983, has put into the nation's roads system an amount approaching $7 billion. The surprising thing is that the commitment to road funding is not just at the Federal level. It is a three-way partnership. I have emphasised that point. I emphasise as well the significant contribution made by State cutting road governments. I also emphasise the significant contribution made by local governments. I only wish that on some occasions local government would be a little more gracious and understanding about the contribution which is being made at the Federal level. Spokesmen for· the Opposition persist in c,aiming that the Hawke Government has reduced the level of funding. I think it is fair enough for the Hawke Government to insist .that its record be taken over the full term ·of the Hawke Government. I have already given the figures which reflect the implications of that statement. Let me say for the benefit of everyone that all levels of government have a responsibility to determine how the $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money will be spent. We have a responsibility to manage the financial resources which are made available to us. The same thing applies at the State and local government levels. Not only is $1.2 billion being allocated to the nation's roads system at the Federal Government level this year, but also another $1.6 billion is being apocated at the State government level. Another $1.5 billion is going into the nation's road system at the local government level. What that means is that in this year alone the 'three levels of government are contributing $4,300m to the nation's road system. Their contribution has never been higher in nominal or real terms in the history of the Commonwealth. The Opposition knows that. The Opposition is embarrassed because of the incredible record which the Hawke Gov· ernment has been able to maintain. Since 1983 those three levels of government have put not less than $20,OOOm into the nation's road system. The contribution from the three levels of government has never been higher in any comparable period in the history of the Commonwealth. The Federal Government can, and it should, take credit ·for the contribution it is making. The State governments and local governments can do exactly the same. The amount is unprecedented. Let me put it into context. The Opposition refers to 1983-84 as being a peak year and, on tHat basis, there has been a slight reduction in the amount' of money which has been going into the road system at the Federal level. But that was our peak year. It was not a peak year for the Fraser Government. It is Part of our record contribution to the nation's road system since 1983. The Hawke Government can take a great deal of pride in that. The Australian people can also take a g-eat ,deal of pride in it, because that $4,300m in this year alone, or the $20,000m since 1983 contributed by the three levels of government to the road system, is their contribution to the nation's transport infrastructure. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that people say; as you did during your contribution, that roads are an important priority. Of course they are. But when people put petrol into their tanks they not only drive on the roads and expect good roads. They also have kids at school and they expect good schools' for their kids. They have friends and relatives in hospitals and they expect good hospitals. They have mums and dads on pensions and they expect good pensions. They have kids in child-care and they expect good quality services. They expect Australia to be defended. They expect this Government, as they expect all governments, to manage their financia1 resources properly and to attempt to reflect their priorities. I am waiting for the first person to come up to me and say, 'Bob, I think that what you should do is take money away from schools ,and put it into. the roads'. I am waiting for someone to say that we should take money away from the hospitals and. put. it into roads. I am - aiting for someone-,,-just one person-to come up to me and say, 'Take some of mum and dad's pension and put it into the roads'. They are not going to do that. because they know and· expect that when they pay .excise duty on their petrol, just the same as when they pay it on their alcohol and cigarettes, it goes into the total financial resources available to this Government to meet all of those conflicting demands and to work out the priorities. I am waiting for the first person to suggest that we should cut the funding for schools, hospitals or pensions to put money into the roads. I have a special responsibility for roads. I want to see more funding for roads. We· all do. I am not going to· claim that we are putting enough into roads. I am not going to claim, . either, that we are putting enough into schools, hospitals, pensions or defence. No-one claims that. Mr Deputy Speaker, as well you know, the motorists organisations, amongst others, have been claiming that the Australian road system is worse today than , it was 10 years ago. Mr Blunt-True.",108
177,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ZZZZZ,"That is an insult, not only to' the Federal Government but also to the State' governments and local government. I notice that the Opposition spokesman. for transport confirms his belief that that insult should be cast on the three levels of government and the people they represent. If we can spend, as we have done, $20,000m on the nation's road system in six years-Mr Blunt- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am well aware that the Minister is prone to misrepresentation, but I hope that he would not do it while I am in the chamber. My interjection was to confirm my support for the campaign run by the motorists' associations.",110
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,"Mr Cowan)Order! There is no point of order. Mr ROlJERT BROWN.,-The Opposition . spokesman on transport, - ho has been sitting over there ,during my response to the second reading debate, has been making quite inane interjections. The most recent one concerns the $20,000m spent on the nation's road system since 1983. If we - an spend that sort of money in six years and finish up. with a road system which is worse than it was when .we started, we had all better pack up-and 'that includes all of the State gov,ernments, especially the National Party' Government in Queensland and the Liberal governments in New South Wales and Tasmania. If we can spend $20,000m of taxpayers' money on the road system in six years and finish up with something which is worse than when we started, then all levels of government 'and all political parties in those levels of government, including those with which we identify, have failed miserably. We have failed 16t million people in Australia. Everyone knows that the Federal Government has taken exclusive responsibility for the national highway system. But it is not only th- Federal Government which is responsible for constrU(-ting and maintaining roads and neither we nor the Opposition intend to assume that degree <:>f responsibility. The implication is that we would take responsibility pot only for the national highways but also for the State highways, the arterial roads, the development roads and secondary roads as well as local roads and town streets. Of course we would do no such thing, nor would any other party in government at the Federal level; nor should it be expected to. Neither State nor local government would be tolerant of that. We, at the Federal level, have accepted full responsibility for the national highway system so we have funded to 100 per cent the construction and maintenance of that system consisting of 16,000 kilometres of highways right around Australia. If we were to unravel that length of road from Sydney it would reach Rome. It is an enormous length of road and we have accepted 100 per cent responsibility for it. Since the national highways scheme was introduced, we have spent almost $6,000m on it; $3,500m during the period of the Hawke Government. Towards the end of this year I will be going into the Pilbara in the north-west of Western Australia to open the last 75, kilometres of sealed road to complete the 16,000 kilometres of sealed road in the national highway system right around Australia. That will be the first time, after 200 years, that we will have achieved that. The national highway scheme is the most ambitious civil engineering project ever undertaken in Australia's history, and it was introduced by a Labor Government. The other major civil engineering project was' the Snowy Mountains scheme, which was also initiated by a Labor government. We are proud of that. We could drive at 100 kilometres an hour 24 hours a day for almost a week to get from one end of the highway to the other. It is an outstanding achievement nof just by this Government but by the Australian people. Let me make it perfectly clear that neither this Government nor supporters of this Government apologise in any way for what has been an incredibly outstanding achievement in terms 9f road funding. The national community has demanded that the Hawke Government exercise fiscal restraint, and no-one denies that it has. We inherited a deficit of almost $1O,000m in 1983, and we have turned that around to a surplus this year in excess of $5,000m. In terms of reducing the level of outlays each year, the Forward Estimates of outlays in 1982-83 have been reduced by the Hawke Government by about $l1,OOOin a year. From last year to this year we reduced the level of road funding by $35m in a total program of $1.2 billion. More than that, we absorbed that total cut into our own program, into - he national highway program, and we made sure that our. funding for arterial and local roads was maintained. In fact, we indexed the, amount going to councils to make sure that they would retain the same level of funding in real terms. How does it come about, then, that some, people involved in local government suggest that this Government ha- heen anything less than sympathetic towards the problems of local government? Everyone knows it was a Labor Government that introduced direct funding for local government. In fact, untied grants to local government this year represent $650m, spread around the councils of Australia. Since we introduced direct funding for local councils in the early 1970s, thousands of millions of dollars have flowed into 850 councils rignt across Australia to assist them and to ease the burden on their ratepayersthousands of millions of dollars, introduced by 'a Labor g-)Vernment. We indexed the funding for local roads to guarantee that local road funding would not suffer any reduction from us ,in real terms. The Labor Government has a great and outstanding record in telation to its concern for and protection of local government right across Australia. People involved in local government-the genuine people who make up the vast majority, the dedicated, committed volunteers right across Australi--know it. I said I was delighted with the contri-u­ tion made by so many people whoparticipated in the debflte. All of them expressed genuine concerns, There was a fair amount of rhetoric involved, too, especially when the claim was made that we had cut road, funding., I have proved that we have done no such thing. I repeat that nb Federal government in the' history of the Commonwealth has put s6 much money in nominal and real terms into the road system as has this Government. That needs to be repeated and understood. Increasingly it is being understood and increasingly people are rejecting and laughing at those individuals and organisations who say that road funding has been cut or that our roads now are worse than they were before. It would be extremely remiss on my part if I did not draw attention to a number of people whose contributions were extremely valuable, people who indicated by their contributions that they understand what the issue is all about and that they are determined to maintain the level of funding. I have to include among those the honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee) and the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis), who isa great advocate for road and transport development in the Illawarra area. I have to mention also the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Wright), a great advocate of the development of Queensland and particularly of the development of the road system in the, Rockhampton area and central Queensland. I also have to mention the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) and .the honourable member for Fisher ( Mr Lavarch). As I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, there were others, including your good self, who made a very valuable contribution. It would have been extremely remiss on my part if I did not draw attention to the outstanding contributions which were made by those people who discussed this general question. I referred to the two paragraphs of the Opposition's second reading amendment, the first of which suggested that the Government 'reverse its policy of cutting road funding'. I have proved conclusively that no such policy exists. Our policy at the moment is to maintain road funding in real terms and all members of the Opposition know that. I have also indicated with respect to the second paragraph of the Opposition's amendment, which suggests that the Government 'review the operations of the Federal Airports Authority and Civil Aviation Authority', that such a review is being undertaken now by a Senate committee;",110
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,"Mr Cowan)Order! The Minister's time has expired. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 4-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 4A (Air navigation charges).",112
180,Mr BLUNT ,ZZZZZ,"Richmond) (l0.06)-We propose that a new clause be inserted in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 because we believe that the Government has a double standard. The Government proposes in the legislation th-t penalties be attached to people who do not pay their air navigation charges wIthin 28 days. Prior to 1984 penalties were imposed after 45 days. The double standard is that the Government does not meet this payment schedule itself. In fact, in many areas it blatantly refuses to make payments on time. I refer to the plight of many pharmacists in the community. The Government is incapable of maintaining its accounting records in a way that allows it to pay within 30 days. It cannot take advantage of cash discounts and its record as a payer in the business community is appalling. The net re-ult of that is that many businesses dealing wIth Government load this slow payment into their quotes. So because of the inefficiency of this Government, all taxpayers pay a higher charge. As a principle, we believe that the Government should not expect any greater standards of its customers than it is prepared to adhere to itself. For that reason we propose 45 days, which is the standard that applied under the coalition Government and it is the standard that should apply at present if it were not for this Government's avaricious approach to ripping money out of the business. community. I move: Page 2, after clause 4, insert the following new clause: Air navigation charges ""4A. Section 5 of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from subsection (2) '28' and substituting '45',"".",112
181,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,ZZZZZ,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (10.08)-The Government does not support the amendment. I am surprised that it has been suggested by an opposition which often claims that it has some sort of understanding of the practices of the commercial world. The proposal which the Government provides in this legislation is simply normal commercial practice. I do not know where the advice came from, but I am sure the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) would agree with me on that. If his advice had been sought, I am sure he would have advised the Opposition against proposing this amendment. The penalty free period is' necessary to allow for the normal administrative processes involved in the payment of an account. Cur. rently, 28 days is allowed for the issue of an invoice before penalties are applied for the late payment of air navigation charges. Flights that are recorded on an invoice may have taken place more than 30 days before the invoice is issued, thus no payment is made for some flights until about 60 days after the date of the flight. A 28-day period is normal commercial practice. That allows for the payment of an account. It is comparable with the period allowed by organisations such as Bankcard. A 28-day period also ensures that. payments can normally be recorded on the following month's account. It avoids confusion resulting from payments and accounts crossing in the mail. I am surprised that the Opposition suggested that particular amendment. If the proposed amendment had been an amendment of substance, we would be more than prepared to give it consideration. But when the Opposition comprises members of the Liberal Party and the National Party who purport to have some understanding of commercial practices-and some of them do; the honourable member for Wentworth doesthe claim that some arrangement should be made by the Government which is at variance with normal commercial practice is really surprising. Whoever it was who suggested this should take advantage of the opportunity to examine again the sort of commercial practice that exists out in the business community, the sort of normal commercial practice with which we have complied in preparing and formulating this legislation- If that had been done, the Opposition spokesman on transport knows that the amendment would not have been proposed. Of course, we are not going to support the amendment. Proposed new clause negatived. Clauses 5 to 21-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 22 (By-laws).",112
182,Mr BLUNT ,ZZZZZ,"Richmond) (1O.12)-Clause 22 represents retrospective legislation. Under no circumstances will the Opposition countenance retrospective legislation which is designed to take rights away from members of the Australian community, particularly if the provision is simply designed to cover up the mistakes and inefficiencies of the bureaucracy and there is an alternative way of fixing the problem. The Government well understands what this difficulty is. It well understands that it has been a problem since 1980. It understands that the matter was raised last year and that there was an alternative way of fixing it. Yet Telecom Australia chose to proceed down the track of adopting leg.islation which requires retrospective changes. That is totally unacceptable to the Opposition. We will not accept such a requirement and we oppose this clause.",113
183,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,ZZZZZ,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (10.13)-It is important for .the purpose of tqe record that I indicate the reasons behind this provision. Let me make it perfectly clear, not only to the Oppos-tion spokesman on transport, the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), but to the Opposition generally and to anyone else who might have occasion, for whatever reason, to read this debate, that the Government did not need to do anything in connection with this provision. Mr Blunt-Well, why are you doing it?",113
184,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ZZZZZ,"I will tell the honourable member if he just remains calm and does not get too excited. We are doing so because the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances asked us to. That is why we are doing something about this matter. We do not need to do anything. The question of retrospective legislation simply is not relevant. We were told that the ordinances, the by-laws provided for, were not covered adequately by the existing legisnate lation. All we are doing is providing legislaQueensland tion-Mr Blunt-This is not------;",113
185,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ZZZZZ,The honourable member should just listen. We are providing legislation now to give effect to the changes which were made. There is no question of any retrospective charges. Mr Blunt-Retrospective charges?,114
186,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ZZZZZ,"Let me assure the honourable member that there is no question of any retrospective charges or any retrospective reduction in charges beingapMinisters plied to anyone. Let me emphasise again what we are doing is simply responding request that was made by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and OrdiAs nances. In early 1988 that Committee, whose with members include. Senator Stone and Senl\.tor Bishop, picked up some errors in a number may of by-law amendments. Let me point out-it is important that this .course be recorded so that our position is not represented-that Telecom was asked to vestigate the extent of the problem and go to the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) in order to find a solution. Let me indicate that in a letter to Mr Brack dated stated: 30 May 1988, Senator Bob Collins, the Chairman of the Committee, said: The Committee has noted your suggestionthat is, Telecom's suggestionthat since there is no available evidence that any subscriber has actually been a net loser through the non-alignment of physical and legislative. arrangements, the Committee may think that the matter .is one which it would not be appropriate to remedy by act and which does not require further consideration. He went on in that letter: The Committee makes two comments on this advice and invites youthat is, Mr Brack, the Chairman of the Australian Telecommunications Commissionto consider them. First, in 1928 Mr Justice Brandeis said thatIn a government of laws, the existence of the Government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the law 'scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent, teacher. For good or ill it teaches the whole peOple by its example.' Second, the Committee draws your attention· to the Sixteenth Report of the Committee of SubordiLegislation of the Legislative Assembly of (April 1988) where that Committee, reporting on the implications of non-compliance with the tabling provisions of the Queensland Acts Interpretation Act which rendered non-tabled instruments void and of no effect, stated thatSubsection 28A (6) of the [Queensland] Acts Interpretation Act provides for the preservation of anything done, suffered or omitted pursuant to regulations prior to the expiry of the time for tabling in Parliament. Any action taken in reliance on void regulations subsequent to the last day for tabling could require validation by legislation. The Committee believes that this aspect should be carefully examined and in its correspondence with recommends that advice be sought from that the Solicitor-General's Office. to a The letter continued: a matter of principle the Committee is at one its Queensland colleagues on. this point. Youagain, Mr Brack, the Chairman of ATCtherefore wish to seek advice from the Federal Attorney-General's Department on the appropriate of action to be taken in these circumstances. misThat advice was sought. Advice was given inby the Attorney-General's Department in a to letter of 19 August 1988 to the Corporate Secretary of Telecom Australia from Madeline C!j,mpbell, acting for the Secretary. It Accordingly, I consider that legislation will be necessary to give retrospective legal· authority for the charges,made under the void by-laws. The next thing was' that the Senate. Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances then in turn asked that that action be taken. In Senator Collins's letter, again to Mr Brack, 'dated 30 September 1988, he said, in part: The Committee notes that reference is made to the Attorney-General's legal opinion, as supplied to the Committee on 24 August 1988, in relation to the nec;d for enabling legislation to validate such Amendments. The Committee views the 'making of these Amendments with considerable concern in view of the availability of the Attorney-General's legal opinion and the fact that no validating act has yet lIeen considered by the Parliament. The implications are quite clear. First of all, the deficiency was identified. It was suggested that advice be sought from the Attorney-General's Department. The advice was secured from that Department suggesting that legislation should be enacted to validate that situation. Finally the Senate Committee urged the Government to enact the necessary legislation. That is what we are in the process of doing. That is what the Opposition wants to negate. Apparently it is even going to go so far as to divide on this issue to putfirmly on the record the stupidity of its tactics in relation to this. Mr Blunt-Oh, rubbish!",114
187,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ZZZZZ,"The Opposition's own senators artf members of thy Committee that asked this. Government to t-ke this action, and it wants to invalidate it. Honourable members opposite should not say, 'Rubbish!'. They must accept responsibility for the tactics that they adopt, and the tactics that they adopt have been to seek to defeat an action which this Government is taking in response to a request by a Senate Committee which includes, amongst others, Senators Stone and Bishop-one senator from the National Party; one senator from the Liberal Party. That Senate Committee was reluctant to allow any Telecom by-laws until a commitment· was given that this form of corrective action would be taken. The former Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support undertook to introduce legislation to fix errors and to keep the Senate Committee informed. The' telecommunications part of this Bill is a fulfilment of that undertaking. The Bill requires Telecom to fix the errors which will be subject to scrutiny ,by that Senate Committee', before coming into force. There is no reason at all for the Government to. give any consideration to the removal of that clause. We will not do so. We are responding'to the request Qf the Senate Committee to introduce validating legislation. We are doing that. There are no retrospective implications at all. We reject absolutely and completely the Opposition's proposition that that clause be excluded. Question put: That the clause be agreed to. The Committee divided.

190,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"As I was saying before that priority-a interruption to our proceedings, it is approthe priate to review the status and impact of the roads. Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill at the, third reading stage. This Bill has given the Government the opstage, portunity actually to come to grips with of the inadequacies of its policy. From various contributions made, at the second reading s-age:-and I certainly will not adMinister dress those in detail-we have seen the emus barrassment of the Government in trying justify its existing road funding policy. Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, ( Mr Robert Brown) has referred funding levels in 1983-84. He claimed that these were the Hawke Government's funding records, but the Minister knows that that funding was part of a three-year program and that those levels were determined for the Hawke Government by the previous Government. I invite him at some stage delete those numbers from 'the statistics that, he is so fond of quoting and see what impact it has on his argument. Despite the passage of this Bill through the second reading stage we still have a situation in which the Government is manipulating the taxes imposed on motorists in Fuel excise is indexed by the conto sumer price index (CPI) which has blown have out under this Government's appalling ecoand nomic management. But the level of road funding under this Government is not into dexed by the CPI-and the Government makes great play of the way in which it is indexed-it is indexed by the implicit price deflator. Mr Kerin-Cut government expenditure;",116
191,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is saying, 'Cut government expenditure'. The same Government says it cannot afford to spend more money on roads because expenditure has to be cut. But - wonder what his position was in Cabinet when the proposition was to cut expenditure on beer taxes. In the last Budget, which' proposed a $30m reduction in road funding, $400m was effectively spent on reducing the price of beer. This is the political priority of this Government. This legislation, which has passed the second reading stage, does nothing to, reverse that priority. It is an appalling priority which persists in spite of appalling and ongoing carnage on our I remind the House that this legislation, which is about to pass the third reading does nothing to honour the promise of some the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) that the the Hume Highway would be a four-lane divided carriageway by the end of 1988. I invited the at the second reading stage to tell what the Government's priorities were for to the Hume Highway and when the Prime The Minister's promise would be honoured. This is important, particularly for those people to who drive on the highway and those who have to dice with the 2,300 heavy transports that use that highway every night. It is important that those people know exactly when that national highway, for which the Government has funding responsibility, will be upgraded to the standard that the Prime to Minister promised, That is a very simple request. It is a great pity that this Bill does not address that issue. The opportunity was there, just as the opportunity was there to ,do something for the people who live in the western suburbs of Sydney and do not have access to the existing public transport networks. That is an important issue. Under this legislation no changes have been made to provide for funding for interchanges between rail and buses where a private bus line is operating. I believe that is a neglect Labor Party constituency. The Gpvernment has spent some $400,000 on providing such ,an interchange somewhere in the Northern Territory but, of course, in the western - ub­ urbs of Sydney and Melbourne nothing has been done. The same Government had the opportunity in this legislation to advance the cause of micro-economic reform. We all know - hat micro-economic reform is a priority for this Government; we were told so by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer' ( Mr Keating) and the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis). We were told that by everybody. We now have a piece of legislation known as the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill-a long title-and the Government ,could have done virtually anything to the Bills covered by this omnibus piece of legislation. It could really have made some significant changes. It could have made it more difficult for the Labor Government in Victoria to have gone ahead with'its crazy plan to eliminate private bus lines and to extend the inefficient and loss making public transport bus system that operates in that State at the present time. It is a ware of the' losses that public transport makes. Where does this - ill address, the losses are made by State railway networks? What has been done? The, Government is very keen to raise revenue from the ntilways, but where is it when it comes to providing assistance in achieving in-reased efficiency and ,reducing the losses that are made by those State rail networks? It cannot be seen. Where are the initiatives in this legislation? It totally inadequate piece of legislation. The Minister i- his summing up resorted to the most, incredible statistical gameS' to try to justify the Government's policy. ,We have seen him wince at the valid criticisms of the motorist organisations. We have seen him play games with the - otal level of funding. For someone who is supposed to understand economics, some of the statistics and some of the numbers that he is adding together to come to the conclusion that he is purporting to give to this House are nothing more than sllameful. The reality is that under this Government less and less is spent on roads every year and of the more and more is collected in road taxes. This legislation could have done something to redress the inequities that exist. It could have indexed both taxes and expenditure by the same indices. That would have been an equitable and fair move. We would have had better legislation had that been done. We could have fixed the misleading name that has been attrib-ted to the 4.95c per litre that actually goes into road funding. We could have restored the level of furiding to that which operated last year. The Government spent 5.66c per litre on roads last year. This year the Government will spend 4.95c per litre. But it will raise considerably more in fuel taxes from Australian motorists. It is for that reason that the motorist organisations, the motorists themselves and. the local government associations around Australia are determined to campaign against this Government. They recognise the rip-off, the inadequacy of the policy and the cost of this Government's neglect in both economic and human terms. They understand the significance of roads to the community, the discontent that is manifesting itself to the people behind the wheel and those familieS who are affected by the road toll, and the frustrations of local government in every State. Around Australia local government is faced with the that stark decision of tearing up bitumen roads and returning them to gravel because it does not have the resources to maintain them. The Minister knows that to be a fact. He knows that this legislation was an opportunity to do something about that and that. the Government has neglected that chance because roads are not a political priority for it. is a The view of the Cabinet Minister who said 'What do a few more potholes matter?' still prevails in this Government. Notwithstanding that it is heading for an election, it is prepared to ignore the state of our roads and the consequences of that fpr the community. For that reason, I think it is sad that this legislation is ,about to pass the third reading stage. The Opposition is not going to stop it, because we understand that it is necessary to proceed with the agenda of the Government. We disagree very strongly with the Government's agenda. We are concerned with the impact of that agenda on the Australian community. But we understand what the consequences will be for the Government at the polls. The motorist organisations are spending $2m-Mr Robert Brown-Six.",116
192,Mr BLUNT,ZZZZZ,"The Minister reminds me that it is six. It is $6m over a period of years. It is $2m in a given year, which represents something less than 40c per' membership. The support that the motorist organisations are getting fot that expenditure is extraordinary. The support that the' National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) in particular is getting for its 'telephone hotline, where it invites people to ring in and say what they think' of the roads, is outstanding. The contributions that that motorist organisation received to its survey 'as to the worse road in J'lew South Wales are nothing short of alarming. I hope that the Minister and his Department have read them and that they form part of a Cabinet submission. I have been told by the NRMA that every photograph that it published in its magazine of an appalling, deteriorated road was sent in unsolicited by a member of the organisation. That is an indication of the motivation that exists in the community on the roads issue at present. Despite the fact that the community is totally outraged at the consequences of appalling roads, despite the fact that· the Government has moved away from its once fondly held slogan 'Better roads are safer roads'-despite all of that-we still do not have a recognition by the Government that there is an absolute' need to provide a higher level of funding for roads. There is a ceiling OD the contribution that will be made. Earlier I alluded to the fact that the fuel excise is indexed : according to the consumer price index. However, there is an absolute limit on the amount that can be collected under that. It is $1.215 billion. If fuel usage increasesand it will because the number of' vehicles travelling on the road is growing daily'-----to a point where, under this 4.95c worth of hypothecation, we get to more than $1.215 billion, what will happen? The ceiling will apply. The Government is not even prepared to honour the deal of 4.95c. There is an absolute limit. The Government says, 'Next year we will index by the implicit price deflator, not by the CPI', because it knows that the CPI is going up under the Treasurer. That is the double standard that applies. It would be fair and equitable to index expenditure and taxes by the same method. That would give an equitable treatment to road funding in Australia. But the Government is not prepared to do that because it knows the consequences of doing it. It knows that it is cheaper for it to' do it the way it is at present. It knows that with the continuing blowout in the CPI the reality is that it will get a big boost in tax revenue and will not have to deliver on road expenditure. The CPI blew out earlier this year and we have an .annual inflation rate of 7 per cent or something like that. It is quite high these days. The Government is reaping the revenue bonus of that right now. What has happened. to the $1.215 billion? It is still there. It has not gone up in view of the CPI blowout. The limit still applies. There is no preparedness on the Government's behalf to play fair with the Australian motorist and taxpayer. This Bill could have fixed that. It could have evened up the playing field and given a fair deal to those hard pressed families out there who pay the tax-the families who have to pay all the other taxes that this Government has dreamt up and are faced with the prospect of running a car, which becomes more and more expensive each day, and driving on deteriorating roads. It is a great pity that the Bill does not address some of the inadequacies of the Government's policy. .",118
193,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,ZZZZZ,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (10.44)-in reply-I will respond quickly to some of the points raised by the honourable member for Richmond. ( Mr Blunt). The first concerns the application of the consumer price index (CPI) and the implicit price deflator. As the honourable member said, quite correctly, the excise is indexed according to the CPI. When the legislation was being prepared, before it was introduced, some people prevailed upon me to use the CPI as the index for the amount of money that was going to roads as wellto index that $1.2 billion. I had examined both the - PI and the implicit price deflator ov-r the last six years. What had happened was that the implicit price deflator had been ahead of the CPI for only two of those years. Over a period it is usual for them to tend to balance. out. Of course, they are doing that this year; the implicit price deflator is ahead of the CPI. It was sensible on my part to resist that pressure and to use the implicit price deflator as the index for the level of funding. I expect the implicit price deflator to come in at around 10 per cent, maybe a little below. It means that the increase in the level of funding in nominal terms to maintain the real value will be about $120m next year. That represents an increase of about $30m to $35m over what it would have been had I used the CPI. We are better off as a result of using the implicit price deflator instead of the CPI for that indexing. Mr Blunt-What will the CPI be?",118
194,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ZZZZZ,"It will probably be somewhere between 7 per cent and 8 per cent. There were a number of reasons why. the beer tax was reduced. The honourable member for Richmond correctly indicated that that brought about a reduction in excise of about $400m. One of the reasons for that was that the Government was hopeful that it would get a reduction which would feed more directly into the CPI in order to help it achieve its general type of macro-economic objectives. In 1988 we deregulated the oil industry as well. The indexation of the crude oil levy was a substitute. The replacement of that by fuel excise when it was falling was abandoned in 1988. As a result of that there was a loss to revenue from the taxing of oil of around $270m. That represented a reduction of about 3c per litre in the wholesale price of petrol and a reduction in the Government's revenue from that of about $270m. The honourable member for Richmond referred to the $400m in beer excise, but I do not think that adds a great deal to the sorts of questions that were beihg considered. The other question the honourable member raised was whether some of the reallocation of those funds for. urban public transport facilities could go into joint facilities that were being used by private bus operators. The answer to that is yes. In fact, I had discussions with the bus and coach association prior to the legislation. It asked whether we would amend the legislation to make it clear that State governments· were required to do that. I was not prepared to do that. We were not instructing the States how much they should have used for those purposes nor the purposes for which they could have used it. We made it perfectly clear in this legislation that the States could use that even, say, for interchange arrangements that were being used by private bus operators, and even if they were just being used exclusively by private bus operators. There is no restriction being imposed by us; the States can decide that themselves. What I undertook to do and did was to put it into the notes of administration, so that it is there and spells out clearly and emphasises to the States that if they want to use some of that transfer for urban public transport services, for any sort of joint facilities, such as bus interchanges or intermodal facilities, they would be free to do so. The industry has accepted that as well. The question of the percentage of fuel excise that is going back into roads has been canvassed before. I know that the claim has been made that it is only 20 per cent. But everyone knows that the rest of fuel excise makes it possible for us, in turn, to provide something up to $13m in untied grants to the States and about $650m in untied grants to local government. They. in turn can,. and clearly do, use those funds in turn to assist them with their road funding. I have never claimed that when we put. those together, that represents a direct hypothecation of fuel excise going back into roads. It would be ridiculous for me to do that. As the honourable member for Richmond knows, government fiscal arrangements are just not of that kind. All of that collective revenue which comes into the public sector is then in turn disbursed according to government priorities. The amount that goes back. into the road system is the $1.2 billion from us, the $1.6 billion from the States-and we assist them with our $13 billion in untied grants to provide that-and the $1.5 billion from local government. We assist them with only$650m but we assist them to provide that out of their own resources. When we add them together . it amounts to $4.3 billion. The amount we get from fuel excise is $4.9 billion or $5 billion. It is not 85 per of fuel excise; it represents the equivalent 85 per cent of fuel excise. That is really the only sensible way we can look at it. If members of the Opposition were in government . they would be doing the same sort of thing. The other question about better and safer roads is one that I have never denied. I was at Berrima a few days ago opening the rima bypass. Honourable members opposite may like to see the speech I made which explicitly referred' to the fact that a of that kind can bring about a reduction in road fatalities on that very stretch of road of up to 88 per cent. I have been quite clear about that. It would be quite ridiculous me to say that better roads do not contribute to safety-of course they do. I want to phasise t)tat if we concentrate exclusively on that we are going to get oUJ::selves into very dangerous position of suggesting to mothe torists that they bear no. responsi-ility at for their own driving habits. We all know that the main reasons for road crashes and road fatalities are things such as speed, alcohol, motorists not modifying their driving practices acconJjng conditions in which they are driving, motorfinish ,ists who are fatigued not taking the oppor500,000 tunity to rest and motorists not strapping themselves into seatbelts, or alternatively, even worse-we have all seen them-motorfatalities ists not strapping in their kids. It is able practice. As everyone knows, if there are kids loose in the back of a car and the car is. travelling at 100 kilometres an hQur and the car stops as a result of a crash kids continue to move ahead at 100 kilomaintain metres an hour. They become missiles and go straight through the windscreen. I emphaI sise this and I quite genuinely and honestly urge all Opposition spokesmen and all people who are concerned about the road trauma to emphasise this as well. It is quite legitimaking. mate for members of the Opposition to say, 'tet's hnprove the roads and that will bring about increased safety'. Of course it will. I endorse that and I agree with them. But for as well. heaven's sake let us at the same time emphasise to motorists that they' must continue to bear the 'chief responsibility. It does not matter to what extent we improve the roads.' I was travelling north of Sydney just reabout cently and over the Mooney Mooney cent Bridge-it is eight lanes wide and cost tens of of millions of dollars-there was a car in the middle of it which had overturned. The traffic had to keep moving so I did not stop. There were ambulance people and police officers around. A person was being extricated from underneath the overturned vehicle. I hope Berthat that person was okay but he did not look okay to me. That accident happened after a situation of the kinds I mentioned. bypass People have to modify their own driving practices according to the conditions in which . they. are driving. If they do the road trauma will be dramatically reduced. Every Christfor mas and holiday period we make the same . appeal and the Opposition will be making emthe same appeal. I know the shadow Ministhe ter endorses that as do other spokesmen on Opposition bench. It is a collective effort all on the part of all of us, particularly in relation to road safety. Over the whole of the world there are 15 million road crashes every year. There are to the five million people around the world who up in hospital as a result. There are people who die throughout the world as a result of roaq crashes every year. Last and year in Australia .there were about 2,800 but there are tens of thousands of a deplorpeople who are maimed and who carry the results of those injuries with them for the rest of their lives. We have to keep on emthose phasising to them that we will all seek to the condition of the roads and to improve them. That is what we are all about. say the same thing to all my State transport colleagues. It does not matter what Government they come from. I give them credit and I compliment them on the efforts they are I do the same thing with local government. I do the same thing with this Government because we are making a great effort Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. NA Breast Cancer-Job Training and Employment Schemes Motion (by Mr Robert Brown) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",119
195,Mr TAYLOR ,ZZZZZ,"Groom) (10.55)-Once again, our longest serving Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has turned his vitriol on the innocents, this time a Toowoomba Chronicle newspaper reporter and a Toowoomba businesswoman. The reason ·for the Minister's attack appears to be that these women dared to question his Department's inactivity regarding the introduction of a screening or mammogram program for the early detection of breast cancer symptoms in women. Instead of a positive response to my call in this place on 7 March for him to apologise to the women of Australia, and in particular to my constituents, for his nationally tele.vised, unsympathetic attitude to the plight of women affected by breast cancer, he has responded in a most negative way. He has merely sought to undermine the credibility of those who are brave enough to question the illogical reasons he has given for his Government's inactivity on such a vital issue for so many women.· In a situation where statistics show that one in 25 women might contract breast cancer, surely his Department can move more quickly. How does the Minister justify recent approval for a limited screening program to detect acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), whereas he defends delays in a screening program for the detection of breast cancer claiming the lives of 2,500 women annually? Perhaps the Minister perceives greater electoral appeal frqm the homosexual community than from Australian women. If so, in my view, his perceptions are misguided and his attitude and actions misdirected. For the Minister to claim that 'a hastilymounted mass screening program could cause more deaths, pain and suffering than it saved' is completely absurd and is an insult to the intelligence of the many hundreds of thousands of women who have had mammograms and who keep themselves informed about the procedure. It is also an insult to the many professionals involved. His assertions are founded when viewed in the light of the safety of the massive screening programs that for many years were used for tuberculosis. The Minister will have to do a lot better than give hollow assurances to the women of Australia that 'while my Government will not drag its feet on this matter, neither will it sacrifice women's health and safety for the sake of political expediency'. Medical evidence and logic clearly counter his assertions. If mass screenings are not possible on budgetary grounds, and this was seemingly an overriding consideration of the Minister in this case, surely a limited program like the one approved to detect AIDS should be implemented immediately to reduce any unnecessary anxiety, pain, suffering or death for Australian .women. On their behalf,. I seek the Minister's earliest action on this pressing matter.",121
196,Mrs DARLING ,ZZZZZ,"Lilley) (10.58)-1 want to bring to the attention of the House some of the exciting new programs the Federal Government is offering in the area of job training and education. So often in this House we deal with contentious matters and we look at political situations where people may be opposing just for the sake of opposition. However, I think this is one area in which we should be joining together, as representatives of the people, to ensure that those people who have missed out on the present increase in jobs are made aware that there are particular programs which can help them. I refer particularly to the Jobtrain scheme. Jobtrain provides long term unemployed and disadvantaged. job seekers with short term vocational training which is closely linked to the needs of the individual and the local labour market. Training can be provided by technical and further education colleges, industry or employer associations, industry training committees, private providers and community groups. So we are really drawing in people concerned who have expertise in these different areas. . Priority is given to assisting those meeting the Newstart criteria and sole parents participating in the JET program. During 1988-89, Jobtrain will assist about 33,800 job seekers at a cost of $86.7m. AI).other particularly interesting program is the new enterprise inillcentive scheme. I would like to support this scheme and advise people who feel that they would like to set up their own business in a small way but who do not have the backing to do so, to take advantage of this scheme and to find out from their local Commonwealth Employment Service office how they can go about it. The new enterprise incentive scheme has been extended to allow private and non-government organisations to participate in the scheme jointly with the Federal Government. In 1988-89 it is expected that private sector and non-government organisations will, in conjunction with the Federal Government, offer a comprehensive package of assistance for 55 unemployed people to become self-employed.",121

The following answers to questions were circulated: Coastal Surveillance Contract (Question No. 146) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 24 September 1987: (I) What additional costs have been incurred by the Government from when (a) the coastwatch contract with Skywest expired in mid-May until Amann Aviation ceased coast watch operations on 16 September 1987 and (b) Amann Aviation's contract was terminated on 12 September 1987 and Skywest resumed coastal surveillance operations on a 6-monthcontract. (2) What costs are anticipated as a result of the need to call new tenders and review the tendering system. (3) How does the 6-month contract awarded to Sky west in September 1987 differ from (a) Skywest's previous contract and (b) the contract awarded to Amann Aviation. (4) How many cases of (a) drug trafficking, (b) illegal immigration, (c) illegal fishing, (d) smuggling, (e) possible importation of disease and (f) other illegal activities have been (i) reported for investigation, (ii) confirmed and (iii) intercepted as a result of coast watch surveillance operations of Australia's northern coastline in (A) each of the three years prior to Skywest's commencement of northern surveillance operations, (B) each quarter since Sky west commenced northern surveillance and (C) each month since January 1987.",122
198,Mr WILLIS ,ZZZZZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question, directed to the fo-mer Minister, is as follows: (I) (a) No additional costs were incurred in relation to the period referred to. Following the failure of Amann Aviation to meet proposed phase-in dates, the contract with Skywest continued on the same terms and conditions and at the same cost. No payment' was made by the Commonwealth to Amann Aviation in the period 12-16 September 1987, on the basis of the Commonwealth's view that such flights did not conform to the requirements of the contract. (b) Skywest commenced operations under an interim contract on 12 September 1987 following the termination of the contract with Amann Aviation. In anticipation of the commencement of operations by Amann Aviation on 12 September 1987, Skywest had begun to divest itself of some of the aircraft used for coastal surveillance. The Commonwealth compensated Skywest for the cost of bringing its fleet back to the strength needed to continue coastal surveillance after 12 September 1987. Other payNA ments to Skywest under the interim contract w-re' on the same basis as the previous contract. (c) Re-tendering of the coastal surveillance contract will be handled by the Australian Customs Service, which now has the responsibility for coastal surveillance. (2) The review of tender procedures in relation to the contract let to Amann Aviation was carried out by a Committee headed by Mr A, C. Menzies OBE, at a cost of $21,360. The previous contractor, Amann Aviation Pty Limited, sued the Commonwealth in the Federal Court, alleging breach of contract and claiming approximately $24 million damages. His Honour Mr Justice Beaumont on 21 December 1988 awarded Amann Aviation the sum of $410,000 damages and ordered the Commonwealth to pay half of Amann's costs (yet to be assessed). His Honour specifically held that Amann Aviation was not entitled to the refund of its performance bond of $113,000, which had been forfeited to the Commonwealth .. Both Amann Aviation and the Commonwealth have appealed to a Full Court of the Federal Court, and the Commonwealth was granted a stay of judgment by His, Honour Mr Justice Morling on 13 February. The question of any costs to the Commonwealth as a result of this appeal cannot be quantified at this stage. (3) (a) The interim contract is largely unchanged from the previous contract with Skywest, except that it provides for the payment of re-establishment costs to Skywest. These costs were incurred because Sky, west had begun to dispose of its fleet in anticipation of handing the contract over to Amann Aviation. The interim contract also includes a ""force majeure"" clause and provision for extension at the Commonwealth's request. (b) The contract with Amann Aviation incorporated upgraded technical specifications in order to take advantage of technical advances since the previoUs tendering in 1982 and to take advantage of minor improvements to operational methods. (4) Records of specific illegal activities are not maintained by the Department of Transport and Communications. The Department's role in relation to coastal surveillance was to observe possible infringements and to alert the appropriate authorities. Soviet Jews (Question No. 436) Mr Howard asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 18 November 1987: (1) Is the Minister able to say how many Soviet Jews there are in the USSR. (2) Is the Minister able to say how many are assessed, as wishing to leave the Soviet Union. (3) Is the Minister able to say how many Jews have been granted exit permits to leave the USSR for Israel or the West since I January 1987 and how does this compare with the years 1980-86.",123
199,Mr DUFFY ,ZZZZZ,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Although no current definitive figures are available, Soviet census statistics put the Soviet Jewish population at 2.2 million in 1970 and at 1.8 million in 1979-a questionably large decline which is greater than could be expected as a result of Jewish emigration. International Jewish organisations estimate the number of Jews residing in' the Soviet Union at between 2 and 2.5 million, but it should be noted that these figures predate the most recent increase of Jewish emigration from the USSR. (2) It is widely held among international Jewish organisations that approximately 400,000 of those Jews residing in the Soviet Union would leave if free emigration were allowed from the USSR. (3) In 1987 8,149 Jews were granted exit visas to leave the USSR. In 1988 this figure increased to 19,343 giving a total of 27,492 exit visas being issued for the two year period.

(3) In my view, there is no substance to the allegation that Mr Ditfort was illegally extradited from the Federal Republic of Germany to Australia but that is a matter which only the courts can determine finally. However, r note that both the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in its criminal jljrisdiction, and the Federal Court, in its civil jurisdiction, have, held that even if there were some illegality involved in the extradition, that would not affect the validity of the civil and criminal proceedings which were taken in respect of Mr Ditfort after his return to Australia. The Federal Court dismissed allegations of contempt of court against Mr Clarke on 3 June 1988. On 22 February 1989 the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal made ex-tempore orders dismissing the allegations of contempt made in that court by Mr Ditfort against Ms Wild; Department of Transport and Communications: Advertising (Question No. 844) Mr Beale asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 24 March 1988: (I) Does the Minister's Department have established procedures for the tendering and aWl\rding of contracts for internal or external sign, poster space or other advertising concessions; if so, what are they. (2) Which companies have been awarded contracts since 1983. (3) Is the Minister's Department required to put out to tender all' advertising space at airports; if not, what is the basis for exemptions. (4) Were any companies allowed advertising space at any Australian airport on a trial basis; if so, (a) what were the companies, (b) at which airport was each trial permitted, (c) how long was the trial period and (d) what was the basis for allowing each trial. (5) Which companies have approached the Minister's Department with proposals for airport advertising ona trial, basis and which of these were not accepted and why were they not accepted. (6) Are rights to airport advertising assignable within the tender period from one company to another. (7) Did the national airport internal advertising concession holder immediately before December 1986 advise the Minister's Department 'of its intention to surrender the contract at that time. (8) Were there any stipUlations attached to the surrender of the contract; if so, what were they. (9) Were tenders then called for internal airport advertising at national flirports; if not, why not.. EmptyHere member's question is as follows: (1)"" The following procedures apply to advertising on Commonwealth airports: (a) airport tenants may erect internal/external signs in accordance with provisions of their tenancy agreement/s (b) for advertising not in the above category, in accordance with the Airports (Business Concessions) Act 1959, tenders are called for contracts in excess of 3 years. Contracts for less than this period may be subject to tender, or negotiated on an ad hoc basis. The Federal Airports Corporation is now responsible for procedures at its airports. (2) Since 1983 advertising contracts have been awarded to: Tuvani Pty Ltd Sanyo Australia Pty Ltd City Clock Australia Ltd Acrona Pty Ltd Southern Cross Advertising Pty Ltd Essendon Motor Inn Alan Monks Advertising Transportation Displays International Pty Ltd National Outdoor Advertising Pty Ltd Jeffries Advertising Alan Davis Advertising Pty Ltd Adspace Fortune Communications Holdings Claude Neon Ltd Capricorn Iwasaki Resort Rockhampton Aquatic Adventureland Capricorn Tourism and Development Organisation Jumbuck Motel JP Cordukes Pty Ltd Koorana Crocodile Farm Rockhampton Broadcasting Co Pty Ltd Alice Travellers' Village Territory Advertising Services Pty Ltd Airport Motel Accommodation Central. Guide Nazant Pty Ltd Heavitree Gap Motel Michael Anthony NT Department of Mines' and Energy Mattingly Wollard Cawrse Western Resorts Corporation Fascine Lodge Execair (3) The following advice applies to airports remaining under Commonwealth control; as noted in reply to Question I, the F AC is now responsible for procedures at its airports. Advertising by airport tenants is not subject to tender action as such adyertising is provided for under the tenancy agreements. Contracts for advertising for, periods of. 3 years or less are no- subject to tender, in accordance, with the Airports (Business Concessiof\s) Act 1959. (4) (a) The following cOTnpanies were permitted advertising space on a trial basis 'Claude Neon Ltd Alan Monks Advertising 'Michael Anthony Department of Mines and Energy Government Mattingly Wollard Cawrse Alice Travellers' Village Territory Advertising Services Pty Ltd Airport Motel Accommodation Central Guide Na-ant Pty Ltd Heavitree Gap Motel Australian Posters Pty Ltd (b) The trials were undertaken at Adelaide, Darwin and Alice Springs airports. (c) The trial period at Adelaide airport was 3 years. The trial periods at Darwin and Alice Springs airports ranged from I to 3 years. (d) The trial at Adelaide airport was to test reaction to the introduction of outdoor advertising signs. The trials at Darwin and Alice Springs were conducted due to uncertainty over the future own-' ership ,of these airports. (5) Claude Neon Ltd, Nettlefolds Advertising Pty Ltd and Australian Posters Pty Ltd sought advertising sites on Ii' trial basis. Nettlefolds Advertising's proposal was not accepted as trial concessions to the other companies had already been left for the available sites. (6) Under the terms and conditions of advertising contracts the concessionaire is prohibited from assigning any rights or obligations. (7) Yes. (8) No. (9) N-, tenders were not called for the national advertising contract. The Commonwealth is at liberty to enter into contracts for up to 3 years without calling tenders. The new contract was for a period of 3 years and resulted in increased 'guaranteed revenue to the Commonwealth and had potential to optimise turnover to a level beyond that envisaged by the original concessionaire. Nuclear Safeguards (Question No. 977) Mr John Scott asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 17 May 1988:, ' (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the Canberra Times, dated 4 April 1988, headed ""Embassy knew of uranium breaches"", in which Madame Undine von Blottnitz, a West German member of the European Parliament, is reported to have personally handed to the Australian Embassy in Brussels details of how Australia's nuclear safeguards requirements could be breached. (2) When did the Minister receive a copy of these NT documents. (3) Are the documents supplied to the Australian Embassy in Brussels by Madame von Blottnitz the same as those supplied to Senator Sanders by the Rainbow Group and which the Minister is reported to have asked Senator Sanders to pass over to the Government. (4) How many of the documents from both sources require translation. (5) Will the Minister supply a copy of the documents furnished by Madame von Blottnitz and Senator Sanders; if not, why not. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) On 16 March 1988. (3) No. However, I am advised that documents relating to an exchange of safeguards obligations involving Australian obligated nuclear material (correspondence between German nuclear firms and Euratom) were incl-ded in both sets of papers. This correspondence was in German and because of the detailed technical nature of the subject matter required professional translation. The papers provided by Senator Sanders included an additional two documents; these were the minutes of a Euratom Supply Agency meeting of 27 May 1986 and a Euratom Supply Agency paper entitled ""Matters Relating to Origin of Nuclear Material and Origin Swaps"" dated 18 November 1987. Both were in English. Mrs von Blottnitz also provided other material-see answers to 2, 3 and 6 of your question 970. (4) Translation - f the documents was arranged by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I am advised that - hirteen documents required translation. (5) See answer to part 8 of your question 970. Corporate Tax Rates (Question No. 1136) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 24 August 1988: (I) What are the definitions of (a) average effective corporate tax rate and (b) marginal effective corporate tax rate. (2) What are those rates in Australia and in the other OECD countries for which data are available.",125
202,Mr KEATING ,ZZZZZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) The average effective corporate tax rate may be defined as the ratio of observed taxes paid by the corporate sector to realised corporate income. (b) The marginal effective corporate t-x rate may be defined as the difference between the preand post-tax internal rates of return on a marginal investment project, divided by the pre""tax rate of return. A marginal investment project is one from which returns are just sufficient to cover its costs (including financing costs); the marginal effective rate therefore provides a useful measure of the impact of taxation on an investment decision. (2) A Treasury paper 'The Corporate Income, Tax Base-Trends since the late 1960s' (The 'Treasury, February 1987) calculated measures of average effective corporate tax rates for Australia. Given the multitude of difficulties associated with the derivation of internationally comparable measures, however, average effective corporate tax rates 'for other OECD countries cannot be provided. An international comparison of marginal effective tax rates has been provided in a study by the Bureau of Industry Economics 'The Taxation of Corporate Investment Income: Australia's Place in the World' which was published in 1988. The table found on page 81 of the study shows marginal effective tax rates for Australia and a number of other countries under varying assumptions. (Question No. 1145) Mr Wright asked the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, upon notice, on 24 August 1988: (1) What role will local authorities play in determining what roads (a) will be accepted in the new category of a National Arterial Road and (b) in this category will be funded. (2) Will he note the recommendation of the Grain Councils of Central Queensland and declare the grain roads system throughout Central Quee'nsland and the Central Highlands roads under the new category and therefore eligible for funding. (3) Will the Commonwealth hold direct talks with any interested local authorities or will it be bound' to 'accept the priorities set and recommendations made, by the State Governments. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Local authorities should submit proposals to the relevant State Government. Following consultations with Federal authorities, State Governments are to put forward National Arterial road project proposals to the Federal Minister for approval. These proposals must meet the criteria of assisting export and import replacement industries and 'tourism through accelerated upgrading of key arterial routes. (2) I have noted the recommendation 9f the Grain Councils of Central Queensland. I recently announced my approval of National Arterial routes in Queensland which included three routes of benefit to the grain industry. These are the RockhamptonBarcaldine, Dingo-Mt Flora-Mackay and Goondiwindi-Charters Towers routes. None of the roads put forward by the Grain Councils of Central Queensland were proposed by the Queensland Government for f u n d in g . ' ' (3) National Arterial programs are developed in the main through direct consultation ,between the tax Commonwealth and State Governments. Local councils should, in the first instance, approach State Governments about any specific proposals they may have for National Arterial projects. However the Commonwealth will continue to consult extensively on road matters with all interested parties, including local government. International Monetary Fund (Question No. 1199) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 September 1988: (1) How many countries are in arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). (2) How many of those countries have had unsuccessful adjustment policies imposed on them by the IMF. (3) What proposals has the IMF put forward for Roads dealing with arrears. (4) What approacq did the Government recommend to the IMF annual meeting for handling this problem. ' (5) What decisions were made about arrears at "" the IMF annual meeting.",127
203,Mr KEATING ,ZZZZZ,"The answer to the honour-, able member's question is as follows: (1) As of 30 November 1988 there were ten member countries in arrears on obligations to the IMF by six months or more. (2) It is not possible to answer this question in the terms posed. What can be said is that in the early 1980s a combination ofaclverse external developments and shortcomings in domestic economic policies resulted in a marked weakening of the payments position of a number Of developing countries. As the international environment worsened and capital flows declined sharply (particularly from private sources), these countries encountered severe difficulties in servicing their debt obligations. Many of these countries had drawn on IMF resources and some of them accrued overdue obligations to the IMF. (3) The elimination of arrears is crucial for maintaining the financial integrity of the IMF, preserving its monetary character, and continuing its operation as a cooperative intergovernmental financial institution. Since the emergence of significant arrears in 1983, the IMF has adopted a number of measures t-. help id-ntify potential problems Iikt;ly to cause arrears, forestall the emergence of arrears, encourage member countries seeking to clear their arrears and protect the IMF's financial position. These measures include improving assessments of members' capacity to repay the Fund; strengthening adjustment programs in cases where debt-servicing difficulties could arise; and collaborating with individual debtor countries, other creditors, donors, and multilateral development institutions in response to the, efforts of individual members to meet their IMF obligations. As a result of these efforts several members have. eliminated sizeable,arrears and thereby regained ac· cess to IMF credit. A few. countries, however. have allowed their, arrears to the IMF to accumulate to such .an extent that strong and determined efforts ,on their part, together with extraordinary support from the international ,comm\lnity, will be necessary for them to clear the arrears. (4) The Government is strongly supportive of the measures outlined in p) above. In my Statemelltto the September 1988 meeting of the IMF's Interim Committee in West Berlin, I strongly endorsed the sharper focus being given to the arrears problem and noted my support for the Executive Board taking early action on this issue. (5) The Communique of 26 September 1988 of the IMF Interim Committee noted the extreme plight of the, countries with overdue obligations, - hile stressing the adverse impact of arrears on the c;ffectiveness of the Fund as a cooperative mont;tary institution. The Committee requested that the IMF Executive Board pursue its work on a cooperative, approach to this problem, involving preventative measures and intensified collaboration where members with overdue obligations are cooperating wi-h the IMF. The Committee stressed that greater col-' laboration needed to involve coordinated assistance, provision ,of bilateral financing to members dertake programs of economic reform, and that seek toregularise their relations with the ·IMF, and prospective support from the international financial stitutions. The Executive Board is worll.ing on the modalities of this cooperative approach and will rerelations port back to the lriterim Committee meeting in 'April 1989. Road Funding (Question No. 1245) Mr Cobb asked the Mihister for Land Transport and Shipping Support, upon notice,' on 13 October 1988: What Federal Government.road funding has been provided in (a) nominal and (b) real terms for each year, since 1980""81.. Mr Robert Bro.wn-The answer to .the honourable member's question is as follows: Expenditure under Federal roads assistance programs since 1980-81, in both nominal and real terms, has been: Federal road expenditure 1980-81 to 1988-89 Real Terms (2) Nominal Terms ($m, 1988-89 ($m) prices) 1980-81 628.0 1,154.1 1981-82 658.0 1,130.2 1982-83 850.9 1,264.6 1983-84 1195.2 1,663.8 1984-85 1244.7 1,633.9 1985-86 1250.0 1,533.1 1986-87 1250.0 1,427.0 1987-88 1250.0 1,325.0 1988-89 1221.5 (I) 1,221.5 (I) (I) Budget allocation. Includes $6.5 million for the Australian Capital Territory. (2) Real, Terms calculations are based on the implicit price deflator for, gross non-farm product. It should also - e recognised that untied grants by the Federal Government this financial year will amount to over $12 billion to the State Governments and over $650 million for Local Government. These funds may be used for any purpose, including road funding, in accordance with State and Local Government priorities. These grants assist the State and Local Governments to finance their own road works. Additionally, it is likely that both State and Local Government will spend some $1.5 billion each on road works this financial year. Department of Transport and Communications: Advertising (Questio- No. 1267) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Transthat unport and Communications, upon notice, on 18 October 1988: (I) What sum did. the Minister's Department outinlay in 1987-88 for (a) radio advertising, (b) television advertising, (c) newspaper advertising, (d) public and (e)' the publication and distribution of at its 'next journals and magazines. (2) What is t-e proj-cted expenditure for each of those categorie- In 1988-89.",127
204,Mr WILLIS ,ZZZZZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question, is as follows: (1) (a) Nil (b) Nil ( c) $671,991 (including recruitment advertising) (d) $647,646 (including publishing) (e) $149,838 (2) It is expected that expenditure on newspaper advertising will remain constant and that expenditure on public relations and magazines will be reduced. Lobster Exports (Question No. 1298) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on ' 1 November 1988: (I) What air freight space allocation for live lobs- B-l1arat. ters has been granted by Qantas to WA rock lobster exporters in 1988-89. (2) How does this allocation compare with lobster exports from WA in 1987-88 and has there been consideration given by Qantas to a predicted ,20% increase in the WA catch in 1988""89. (3) What arrangements does Qantas have to carry NZ live lobsters to Japan. (4) Do those arrangements limit the available air freight space that Qantas ,can offer Australian' lobster exporters and is the rate from NZ less than the rate charged to Australian exporters. (5) What action is the Government taking to ensure WA live lobster exporters get access' to the Japanese market through adequate air freight space. Mr WillIs-The answer to the hon01.lrable member's question' is as follows: (I) and (2) Qantas has advised that, in the 198889 season, it, allocated 14 aircraft pallet positions each week for the uplift of WA lobsters and freight. Each pallet contains 10 cubic metres and has a maximum weight capability 'of 'approximately 4.4 tonnes net. In the same period last year, the capacity provided by Qantas was 6-8 pallets per wee-, year round. Lobster exports from WA in 1987-88 amounted to 7,083,380 kgs, (3) Qantas has no specific arrangements to uplift any particular item from New Zealand but its nights originating in NZ do carry both NZ/Australia goods and other goods destined for international markets. The space allocated to NZ origin goods varies from week to week. ' , (4) The allocation, of freight capacity on, its ices is a matter for the commercial judgment of Qantas. The rates per kilo charged by Qantas for NZ or Australian uplift are approximately the same when expressed in Australian dollar terms, subject to exchange rate variations. (5) The Government would not normally interfere in matters, such as the allocation of freight capacity and the setting of freight rates, which are properly matters for an airline's commercial judgment. Nursing Home Beds (Question No. 1320) IVJr Mildren asked the Minister for Commuriity Services and Health, upon notice, on 2 November 1988: , (I) How many nursing home beds are funded within the electoral division of Ballarat. (2) On a rieeds basis, what is the entitlement in nursing home beds in the electonil division of Ballarat. , Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Thcrre are 707 appr-ved nursing home beds as at 9 November 1988 in the electoral division of ' (2) In planning the provision of aged residential care services, the Government assesses needs on the ' basis of specified health planning regions and not by electoral divisiori'. The electoral division of Ballarat is encompassed within the planning region of Central Highlands/Wimmera. The current ratio of nursing home beds per aged population (Le. persons aged 70 years and over) in that region is 62:1000. This provision level is considered adequate at present in view of the longer term aim of 40: 1000 for the State as 'a whole. MUlti-Disciplinary Academy Grammar . ' School (Question No. 1385) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Em' ployment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 23 November 1988: (1) Further to my question No. 1114; has his attention been drawn to an article headed ""Fraud Squad probing MDA School"" which' appeared in the Age of 11 August 1988. . (2) Is he confident that federal funds .are not being misused. Mr Dawkins-The ansWer to the honour"" able member's' question' is as follows: . (1 ) Yes .. My department is monitoring developments. The decision on what action to take, if any, will depend on the outcome of investigations by the Vic-' torianFraud Squad with regard to allegations made in - he Supreme Court. The ho-ourable member may be interested to know. servthat payment of general recurrent, grants to this school has been suspended pending resolutiori of who is to be the approved authority for the school under its restructured management arrangements, The school has also been suspended from the list of institutions approved as eligible to accept full feepaying overseas students pending enquiries as to the schools suitability to cater for such students. (2) The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1984, requires that the approved authority of schools receiving general recurrent grants provide, not later than 30 June in the year following the year irl'which the grant was made, a certificate by a qualified accountant that he is satisfied that an amount equal to the sum of the amounts paid to the approved authority as general recurrent grants has been applied for the purposes of meeting recurrent expendi- Mr G. M. Pemberton ture of the school. MDA Grammar, Mooroolbark, has complied with this condition and there is no evidence of misuse of Commonwealth general recurrent grants. Government Organisations: Part Time (Question No. 1411) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 30 November 1988: (I)' Who are the part-time members - f (a) Qantas Airways Limited, (b) Australian Airlines Limited, (c) Australian National Railways Commission, (d) Australian Shipping Commission, (e) Civil Aviation Authority, (f) Overseas Telecommunications Commission Australia, (g) Australian Broadcasting Corporation, (h) Australian Postal Commission, (i) Australian Telecommunications Commission, (j) Federal Airports Corporation, (k) Special Broadcasting Service, (I) Broadcasting Cbuncil 'and (m) Port Conciliator.

Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable melDber'squ-tion is as follows: In 1987, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) jointly undertook an efficiency scrutiny of the potential for cost savings and efficiency gains from amalgamating and/or co-locating their respective field services. The 1987 Efficiency Scrutiny Report on streamlining field services .in tpe Aboriginal Affairs portfolio was based on the assumption that the ADC and DAA would remain separate agencies. This is not consistent with the fundamental assumptions related to the ATSIC proposal, namely, that the ADC and DAA be amalgamated.

214,Mr HOLDING ,ZZZZZ,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to' the honourable member's question: :(I) The Government is providing funds· to trade unions under the Migrant Workers Rights Scheme (MWRS). The Scheme was established in the context of 1984-85 Budget. It subsidises the employment of development officers to implement programs aimed at ensuring the effective participation of migrants in the workplace. The MWRSbudget for 1988-89 is $610,000 Qut of the total community grants budget of $11.4 million. Grants ilnder the Scheme are awarded for a period of up to three years with no guarantee of re-award. The attaclted table provides, details of all trade union, organisations which have been fun-ed under the Scheme and the annual amounts of funding. (2) Grantee organisations are required to furnish the Dep!lrtment with a financial accountability statement within three months of the end of the organisation's 'financial year. Program accountability arrangements are covered at (4) below. (3) There are no supplementary payments under the Scheme. (4) Organisations are funded to implement programs which are in line with the overall objectives of the Scheme. Examples of such programs are: establishment of information processes to ensure migrant workers understand industrial issues, such as workers' rights (e.g. award conditions, workers compensation), health and safety, worker's representation (e.g. role of occupational health and safety delegates ); working towards increased availability or'English on-the-job programs and other training and re-training programs appropriate to, increasing migrant .workers' employment opportllnities; sensitising members and officials ,to the needs of migrants generally and of migrant workers ,from non-English-speaking backgrounds. ' "" Given that programs are funded in line with the Scheme's objectives, the main criterion used in assessing the benefits of the Scheme is the overall success of the funded programs in achieving ti)eir intended outcomes. Regular reviews of the programs (six-monthly, midterm and at termination) are designed to test their progress.

(5) In appl-ing for a subsidy under MWRS'each organisation is required to provide detail on the size and characteristics of the target group of migrant workers. For peak councils such as the ACTU the target group is very large and spans many unions. The AGTU estimates, for example, that about 1.5 million of the members in its affiliated unions are migrants. MWRS funding to peak union bodies facilitates achievement of the Scheme's objectives by ensuring that trade union policy and implementing programs reflect the needs of migrants in the workplace. To this extent the reach of the Scheme is very wide. At the individual union level the Scheme impacts directly upon migrants through programs such as those described at (4) above. .The following are details of the size of target groups (migrants of non-English-speaking background) for individual unions currently funded under the Scheme: , Target Organisation Group Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia (NSW Branch). . . . . 24,000 Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia (NSW Branch). . . . . 20,000 Australian Railways Union (Victorian Branch). . . . . . . . . . . 5,000 Federated Iron workers Association of Australia (Victorian Branch) . . . 10,000 Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees' Union of Australia (Victorian Branch) . . . . . . . . 5,000 Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia (Queensland ,Branch) .'. . . . . . . . . . 5,000 Food Preservers' Union of WA . . . 2,300 Hospital Services and Miscellaneous Workers' Union (WA Union) 10,000 1984/85 1985/86 1986/81 1981/881988/89 Total Remarks Grant expired 10/1/ $21,518 $21,248 $11,303 $66,069 81 , $15,110 $30,130 $11,414 $63,254 To end of March 89 $32,681 $35,042 $31,114 $39,556 $20,689 $165,142 To end of March 89 $15,350 $34,465 $11,414 $61,229 To end of March 89 $21,518 $29,499 $18,228 $16,654 $8,101 $\00,606 To end of March 89 Grant expired 1/4/ $23,821 $29,499 $15,590 $68,916 81 $25,656 $31,300 $34,465 $11;414 $108,835 To end of March 89 $35,1i3 ' $38,285 $40,606 $43,212 $22,116 $180,592 To end of March 89 $21,518 $29,499 $23,565 $16,655 $8,101 $105,944 To end of March 89 '. $31,536 $31,114 $32,429 $11,548 $118,681 ' To end of March 89 $19,440 $31,300 $33,308 $11,548 $101,596 To end of March 89 $31,856 $20,848 $52,104 To end of Mitrch 89 Trade Union 'Federated Miscellaneous Workers , Union (Qld Branc,h) '.

Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Mr MACKellar asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 27 October 1987: (I) Did the Torres Strait ,Protected Zone Joint Authority incur expenditure of $1,412,430 in the period between 15 Feb'ruary 1985 to 30 June 1986 and is it reported in the Authority's 1986 an,nual report under only two headings, viz, cia'pital items $1,088,000 and recurrent costs $324,430. (2) Will he provide a de.tailed expenditure statement for the period to 30 June 1986. (3) Are financial transactions of the Authority subJe-t to audit; if so, why was' audit certification not included in the annual report. (4) If the Authority is not subject to audit, would it be desirable to do so in the interests of satisfying public accountability requirements for Commonwealth outlays. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The PZJA, comprising the Commonwealth and Queensland Ministers responsible for fisheries matters. uses the services of, three separate gpvernment organizations in administering Its decisions with respect to the management of those fisheries in the Australian part of the Protected Zone over which it has' jurisdiction: the Australian Fisheries Service (AFS), the Queensland Fish Management Authority (QFMA) and the Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol (BFP). The fisheries· concerned are listed in the reports of the PZJA., The PZJA has no establishment or separate funding. It does not bf itself incur expenditure. ' I The cost of fisheries management in the Australian part of the Protected Zone is met through the normal funding processes of AFS, QFMA and BFP. The Commonwealth and Queensland have entered into. an agreement (CSA) , for sharing those costs. ,Under the. CSA, the Commonwealth and Queensl;md share, the recurrent - osts equally. The Commonwealth funds an approved program of initial capital items in full and the two Governments share the cost of replacement of capital, items .. This' basis. of Organisations., ' funding is the same as that which the Commonwealth and Queensland have entered into, for the operation of the Great Bar-ier Reef Marine Park 'Authority. "".', (2) The CSA requires each party to disclose its expenditures, on an agreed list. of recurrent costs to the other and for each party to provide the other with an auditor's report on its expenditures. Funding ,the expenditures is through the' annual appropriations to each of the agenCies' involved and, in the Commbnwealth's case at least; is subject,to internal audit 'within my Department 'as well as to the scrutiny of the Auditor-GeneraL . (3) The ,annual Estimates of my Department for Authority the relevant year contain details of Commonwealth expenditure on management 'ofPZJA fisheries. The (Question No. 339) financial statements in the annual reports of the PZJA refer to the total costs of ,tlte Commonwealth and Queensland agencies involved. This Government has adhered to the principle of the previous Government of not establishing separate agencies to serve fisheries joint authorities but rather of using existing agencies. (4) The following table sets out the outlays by my Department in respect of management of fisheries in the Protected Zone during financial year 198586: ' $ Capital ItemsHouses for occupation by Boating and Fisheries Patrol Office,rs as-igned to patrols in the Protected'Zone . .

(2) Yes. (Please see Mr Hayden's answer ,to the honourable member's Question No. 112 of 21 September 1987.) (3) My Department is examining'the text of the Convention, and is consulting with the Attorney General's Department on a number of points of detail. Following these discussions a decision on accession will be taken by the Government. (Please see my answer to the honourable member's question (No. 1186 of 27 September 1988.) At present only six States have done so (Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Mexico, Sweden and Senegal). Falls in Commodity Prices and Compensatory Financing (Question No, 788) Mr Langmore asked' the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, lipon notice, on 15 March 1988: (I) Have industrialised countries benefited from the decline in commodity prices; if so, in what ways? (2) What has been the estimated i impact on av'erage OECD area inflation rates of commodity price falls? ' (3), Do industrialised countries have a greater capacity to support a comprehenSive system of compensatory financing for Third World countries affected by the fall in prices for their commodity exports? (4), What progress has been made in establishing 'compensat'ory financing facilities through' the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Confetence on Trade and Development? ' Mr ,Duffy-The, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following as-er t- the honourable member's question: (.\) ,Over the, period 1983-'-86, commodity prices (excluding for fuel as measured by the IMF) fell by 15 per cent. Over the same period, oil, prices fell by 53 per cent. - Lower commodity prices benefited, the industriali sed countries in a, number of ways. Most, obviously, they contributed to an imp-ovement in the terms of trade-as major commodity importers, the industrialised countries gained through a decline in import prices relative to export prices. As well the industrialised countries benefited from the impact of lower commodity prices on inflation. Offsetting these direct benefits has been the impact of lower commodity prices' an import demand on the part of the major commodity exporters. (2) Simple graphical analysis suggests a correlation between inflation (as measured by the CPI for particular countries) and commodity prices. This evidence would suggest prima facie, that the' lower commodity prices were largely responsible for the nearly 3 per cent decline in the level of inflation in OECD over the period 1983 to 1986. Whether, in fact, the decline in commodity prices is casually responsible for the decline in observed OECD inflation over this period is, however, an open question. Work by James Boughton and William Branson and the IMF concludes that while the inclusion of commodity prices significantly improves' forecasts of a multi-country consumer price index, there does not appear to be a reliable long-run' analysis of the relationship between the level of commodity prices and the level of consumer pri<;es. The actual impact of commodity price changes on the. CPI will depend I on the monetary policies applying over particular periods and on changes in technology. For example, the impact of a given fall in oil prices on OECD consumer prices will vary depending on energy intensities applicable at the time and on the ease of monetary policy. (3) Since 1963, alI International Monetary Fund (IMF) members have had access to a compensatory financing facility (CFF) funded from IMF resources, designed particularly to assist exporters of primary products in difficulties from temporary export shortfalls in circumstances beyond their control andl,or . importers with' payments difficulties !lrisil)g from excessive cereal import costs. . ' the CFF furds are conditional on 'ap-licants being willing in principle to co-operate with tlje IMF on appropriate solutions to theirdifficulti-, including those caused by, structural problems. However, access to CFF resources is not subject to separate conditionality. Many countries, including industrialised countries such as Australia, have also experienced falls in their commodity export prices. The capacity to support new compensatory ,financing facilities varies between countries according to their budgetary situations and .to the likelihood that they would need to ,contribute to, as opposed to' benefit from, new compensatory financing facilities. , (4) For more than 20 years, developing countries have promoted the idea of a compensatbryfinancing facility (CFF) to compensate them automatically for export earnings shortfalls in specific commodity sectors. The IMF's CFF, outlined in the answer to (3) above, is designed to respond to an exporter's specific short term difficulties, as a buffer mechanism against long term downward trends in prices or export incomes;' At its April 1988 meeting in Washington, the Interim' Committee of the IMF decided, that the essential features of the CFF would be preserved and that it would be combined with a new external contingency mechanism in a single facility. The aim is to help maintain the momentum of adjustment in the face of a wider range of external shocks than falling commodity export prices. The UNCTAD VI Conference in 1983 decided to establish an Export Group to examine a proposal foran additional CFF, within UNCTAD. "" The Export Group's report in 1985 proposed a commodity specific facility which would link the uses of compensatory finance to the needs of supply adjustment and which would have as its principal objective the reduction of supply instability in specific sectors. (Projects proposed include irrigation schemes to reduce the vulnerability of grain to drought.) Some countries have sought to establish a CFF within UNCT AD on' the basis of this report. Many developed countries, including Australia, main unconvinced of the appropriateness of establishing an additional CFF, because export earnings shortfalls are largely a short-term balance of payments problem and should be dealt with in that context, rather than in a commodity specific manner.

(3) The practice outlined in the booklet relating to the death of a foreign Head of State has been followed by all Australian Governments since 1952. This practice was examined in 1980 and reaffirmed by the then Prime Minister. Continuation was endorsed in 1983.

(4) Does the Minister agree that in listing research programs in the Centre's annual reports, research institutions, organisations or individuals responsible for the co'nduct of each program should be identified; if so, will this information be included in future annual reports.",147
223,Mr DUFFY ,ZZZZZ,"The Minister for Foreign 'Research Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 87-88 (I) The information requested attached Table I. (2) The reference in the 1986-87 ACIAR Report to a reduction in ACIAR funding of 21% was the result of a comparison of total expenditures in 1985-86 to 1986-87 appropriations. In 1985-86 ACIAR received $11,720.000 in appropriations, $410,290 in other revenue and utilised the $2,829,786 that was on hand in the ACIAR Trust Fund at 30 June 1985. As a result, ACIAR incurred an expenditure of $15,001,350 plus capital acquisitions of $374,800, making a total of $15,376,150. In contrast, in 1986-87 ACIAR received, $12,913,000 in appropriations. When added to the nominal amount in the Trust Fund at 30 June 1986 of only $53, the resources ACIAR had available (excluding 'Other revenue') to plan its core activities in 1986-87 was $12,913,053. Allowing for inflation of .just under 8% at that time, the net effect in real terms was a reduction of approximately 21 %. 'Other revenue' largely relates to monies received from external sources for specific purposes and canof:' not be applied by AC1AR to other purposes. The majority of funds received by ACIAR under the ACIAR Act from external sources is difficult to predict from year to year. The increase in operating revenue of 19.7% in 1986-87 was due to three factors: an increase if! appropriations of $1,193,000, an increase in other revenue by $982,015, and a reduction in amounts transferred to Capital Accumulation for capital items of $136,617. The operating surplus 'for the year of $607,308 was an accruals-based calculation which shows the results of operations over that current financial year. Hence there is no contradiction between the 21 reduction and the increases in ,operating revenue surplus, as the former was based upon a comparison of the 1986-87 appropriation with the ,expenditure, while the latter reflect comparisons which ignored the changing balances in the ACIAR Trust Fund. (3) The increase of 54.8% referred to in the question relates only to the variation in administrative staff salaries as contained in the 'Centre Administration' component of the annual accounts. Total salaries for ACIAR increased from approximately $838,500 in 1986-87 to $975,000 in 1987-88 (an increase of 16.3%). In addition to salaries reported in the 'Centre Administration' item of the accounts, there are salary components included under both the 'Office 9f the Director and Centre ,Secretary' and Activities' line items, (totalling approximately $510,600 and $576,800 for 1986-87 and respectively). This approach to the reporting of expenses is consistent with the principles of program is set out in the budgeting. The reasons for 'the increase in amount- expended Annual for all salaries include the following: a National Wage increase in the year of 4% staff resignations for. which one-off termination payments were made empillyment of three trainees under the Australian Public Service Traineeship scheme an additional staff position approved in 1987-88 plus the full year costs of a position approved in 1986-87 the average level of employment in 1986/87 being below the approved level payment of back-pay to an officer that w!is not previously brought to account. (4) In earlier annual reports the Centre did include the suggested details of research institutions, organisations and individuals responsible for the conduct of approved projects. In recent years, in view , , "" (i) the move to program budgeting in the Commonwealth Government, (ii) the increased number of approved projects, and (iii) the need to keep the report to a manageable size and cost in response to Government guidelines, it was decided such information was inappropriate for the Annual Report. However, recognising the importance of communicating the details of ACIAR projects to interested parties, ,the project information previously included in Annual Reports i- published in - ClAR 's Ne'Ysletters, which appear three to four times per year, % and in a new ACIAR publicatior ""Partners in ,Reand search for Development"", which appears twice each year and highlights promising results emerging from previous year's commissioned projects.

Family Allowance Supplement (Question No. 1607) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 2 March 1989: How many families have had their income level raised above the poverty line through the introduction of the family allowance supplement.",148
224,Mr HOWE ,ZZZZZ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I assume Mr Baldwin is referring to the Henderson poverty line. It is not possible to estimate with any accuracy the number of families who have had their income raised above the Henderson poverty line without information about the housing costs of low income families in receipt of child payments. In addition, the Henderson poverty line is based .on a number of highly questionable features including the use of equivalence scales based on relativities of expenditure of families in New York in 1954. The Government's commitment on 'child poverty in financial terms involves meeting by 1990, benchmarks of adequacy for child payments relative to the combined married rate of pension (15 per cent for children under 13 and 20 per cent for 13 to 15 year olds). Currently more than 600,000 families with more than a million children are benefiting from the substantially increased payments introduced in the Family Package in 1987 and the subsequent increases in the 1988-89 Budget. Chile: Removal of Unionists from Embassy (Question No. 1656) Mr Snow asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 8 March 1989: Table I 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 1985-86 1986-87 1987-88 $ $ $ $ $ $ 3,800,000 7,000,000 10,500,000 11,720,000 12,913,000 14,800,000 584 410,290 1,392,305 1,348,024 417,438 558,875 954,718 1,285,754 1,048,500 1,453,524 1,175,395 4,778,721 9,963,094 13,341,419 11,708,040 11,857,301 33,854 189,719 286,914 374,177 484,687 411,766 2,078,521 1,385,720 (766,218) (3,245,860)' 825,895 2,287,865 Programs (refer note below)12 '60 39 47 6 30 7 50 44 44 20 21 I 13 19 23 28 38 6 43 68 89 81 64 II 15 20 19 18 22 $13,565 $172,063 $396,569. $414,661 $584,386 $520,583 research workshops and research co-ordination (I) Who employs the guards which were recently used to evict trade unionists from the Australian Embassy in Chile. (2) If they were hired through a private security company, (a) is this - sual security practice at Australian embassies and (b) do our contractual arrangements for private security guards ,vary according to the political situation and sensitivities of each country. (3) Is the Minister able to say whether these security guards have had past connections with the police or military in Chile and with the past and present brutal practices of those institutions. (4) Is the contra-ting of these security guards consistent with' Australia's commitment to human rights. (5) Can the government implement a voluntary code of conduct for Australian companies investing in counfries such as Chile to ensure that their employees enjoy the minimum work conditions stipulated under the International Labour Organisation Convention and on the model of Australian companie- inVesting in South Africa.",149
225,Mr DUFFY ,ZZZZZ,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The six guards who removed the three unionists from the Australian Embassy in Santiago are employees of a private security company which has been used by the Embassy over a period of approximately 18 months to provide guard services for Embassy personnel. and, premises. (2) (a) Some Australian embassies use the services of reputable private security companies to provide both short and long term protection for embassy personnel and premises. The alternatives are to ask for local police protection or to provide guards from Australia. (b) Contractual arrangements vary bet-een countries for a variety of reasons which would include the prevailing political situation and the specific duties to be performed. (3) We are informed .that the background and employment records of personnel employed by the private security firm in question are closely vetted. As with other security companies in Santiago, some of the firm's guards formerly served in the Chilean police force. None of the guards employed by the company is licensed to carry arms. (4) The Australian Government has a responsibility to protect its personnel and premises overseas. The non-violent removal of three persons who were illegally occupying the Embassy and who had repeatedly refused the request of Embassy staff to leave the premises was in no way inconsistent with the Government's commitment to human rights. The Government does not accept the occupation of Embassy premises as a legitimate form of protest about a labour dispute in a private company. (5) As I emphasised in, an answer to Senator Macklin in the Senate on 2 June 1988, the Australian Government has made clear its wish that Australian employers and entrepreneurs in Chile and elsewhere overseas should conduct their activities with respect for human rights, as they would in Australia. The Government does not normally intervene in the investment decisions abroad of Australian companies except in special cases such as South Africa where the racist basis of the regime singles it out for widespread condemnation and sanctions. Unlike the South African case, there is no widespread call by Chileans in Chile for sanctions against the Chilean regime. A relevant consideration in Chile is the existence of a program for a return to' democracy by early 1990. That has led us to the conclusion that, at this stage, guidelines as proposed for Australian companies investing in Chile are not justified. Superannuation Funds",149
226,Mr KEATING ,ZZZZZ,"On 28 September 1988 (Hansard, page 1044) Mr CONNOLLY asked the Acting Treasur,er the following question without notice: Is it a fact that superannuation funds are collecting taxes on employer contributions since I July as required by the Treasurer's May statement? Is is also a fact that fund administrators are liable to be sued for collecting such a tax as there is no legislation in place, for' this tax to be collected? Why has there been a delay in tabling the enabling legislation for the new tax and when does the Acting Treasurer expect that it will be introduced into Parliament? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I should make it clear that there is not to be a specific tax.on employer superannuation contributions. Such contributions will form part of the assessable income of taxable superannuation funds. As I announced in the May 1988 Economic Statement, subsequent press statements and as now reflected in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1988 presently before this House, the tax payable by superannuation funds on employer contributions will be determined by annual assessment and will be payable in the year following the year of income for which it has been assessed. The first tax payments will not be made by superannuation funds until 1989-90. (2) The manner in which the trustee of a superannuation fund makes' provision for its tax liability is a matter for the trustee of the fund having regard to the fund's rules, Issues concerning the rights and obligations of fund administrators and members interests should generally be decided between the parties in accordance with any terms contained in the trust deed of the fund, or elsewhere, that govern members' entitlements. . ' (3) Drafting of the proposed legislation has been of high priority. However, as the ht;mourable member can appreciate, it is not possible to produce major legislative amendments overnight. Since the honourable member asked his Question the, Government has introduced in this House a Bill (the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.6) 1988) which, among other ,things, gives effect to two central elements of the superannuation tax reform measures announced in the 1988 May Economic Statement. Firstly, it will bring forward tax from end benefits to annual, assessment of employer contributions and, secondly, will, introduce a ta,x at a ,concessional rate on the investment income of superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. The balimce of the legislation, including the concessional application of capital gains tax to superannuation funds and the reduction in the rates of tax on retirement benefits paid from taxed superannuation funds, will be introduced in the near future. Austrade: Export Promotion , (Question No. 1549) Mr Spender asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: ' Do different Austrade offices put specific bids on the same export promotion, thus competing between themselves; if not, is there any system of competition between Austrade offices for export promotions and how does' it work. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised by the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) that, in allocating its resources in accordance with the planning process stipulated by the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985, Austrade formulates a market promotion programme annually. This p,rogramme includes the. various elements of market promotion, such as participation in overseas fairs and displays and the mounting of trade missions, that can be undertaken from time to time within available,reSources. All parts of Austrade with an ,nterest in trade promotion, including Austrade's posts overseas, participate in varying degrees in the formulation of this programme. It is not clear from the terms of the Question what precise information the honourable member is seeking but Austrade had indicated its willingness to explore further with the 'honourable member the substance of his enquiry, if that is his wish. Commodit- Agreements (Question No. 1572) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 1 March 1989: Will he bring up-to-date the information on commodity agreements which he gave in answer to question No. 116 (Hansard, 26 November 1987, page 2480).
