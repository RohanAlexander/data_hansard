Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of messages from His Excellency the Governor General, recommending appropriations for the purposes of the following Bills :Old-age Pensions Appropriation Bill . Audit Bill . Referred to Committee of the Whole. DEFENCE. SMALL ARMS FACTORY.",15
1,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It is understood that the proposed small arms factory is to be built at Lithgow, but I ask the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Minister of Defence, whether he does not consider it desirable that Parliament should have an opportunity to express its opinion as to the location of the factory. Does he not know of thefeeling that this factory should be within Federal territory? I have been informed that prices have already been received, and that the Government is actually considering the acceptance of a tender. Is not the Prime Minister aware that some of the responsible officers of the Department are averse to placing the small arms factory at Lithgow, thinking that it should be placed absolutely under the control of the National Parliament?",15
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"For months past Lithgow has been announced as the site of the proposed small arms factory, which the Government and honourable members, too, no doubt, are anxious to establish as soon as possible. Though I do not brush aside the suggestion that the factory should be placed in Federal territory, it must be remembered that, even if Parliament accepts at once one of the areas which are shortly to be submitted for approval, much will remain to be done 'before it can be ready for occupation. Therefore, to change a site which has been tacitly agreed to would mean great delay in the manufacture of small arms by the Commonwealth. Mr. JOSEPH C. DAVIS.",16
3,Mr COON,Unknown,"I desire to direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the heroic conduct of Mr Joseph Davis, a miner at Bendigo, who, on Friday last, saved a comrade at the risk of his own life, and to ask if he will bring the case under the notice of the Imperial authorities, so that the bravery of the act may receive wider recognition ?",16
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Australi a is ringing with approbation of the heroic act of Mr Davis. In view of what is being done by the State authorities, no method occurred to me whereby the Commonwealth could recognise the deed, but the honourable member's question contains a suggestion. Within the last two or three years, His Majestv the King has instituted a special decoration in addition to the Albert medal for the recognition of such splendid deeds as that of Mr Davis, and I shall be only too pleased to consider the advisability of suggesting his heroism as a proper subject for recognition. FEDERAL CAPITAL.",16
5,Mr HALL,Unknown,Will the Minister of Home Affairs say how matters are progressing in regard to the settlement of the Federal Capital question?,16
6,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has written to the Premier of New South Wales, calling his attention to the fact that this Government desires to enter into negotiations with him for the acquirement of Federal territory, and asking his immediate attention to the matter. ELECTORAL ROLLS, VICTORIA.",16
7,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Is it the intention of the Electoral Department to collect new electoral rolls for Victoria ? The rolls now in existence are over twelve months old.,16
8,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Ne w rolls are to be compiled in September next. OLD-AGE PENSIONS ADMINISTRATION.,16
9,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Treasurer if he can see his way to facilitate the hearing of applications for old-age pensions? I understand that special magistrates have been appointed for the Melbourne districts, but that in some cases applications have been heard at the rate of only fifteen a day; and that in others the magistrates have not commenced to hear them. In the Coolgardie electorate, great difficulty is experienced in obtaining persons who can testify that they have knowni applicants) for pensions for a period of at least twenty-five years. I desire to know whether the Treasurer cannot issue instructions to the magistrates who hear these applications not to insist too rigidly upon the production of certificates from persons possessing a twenty-five years' acquaintance with applicants. Can he not instruct them to accept the testimony of persons who may not have known the applicants' for so long a period? I would also point out that old people experience very great difficulty in producing certificates of their age. In this matter also can he not relax the regulations?",16
10,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I should be obliged if the honourable member would give notice of his question, not because I do not wish to answer it now, but in order that it may Be answered very definitely. I would point out that I have no power to alter either the law or the regulations, nor have I the power to instruct magistrates as to their decisions. I shall be glad to make inquiries into the matter with a view of affording the honourable member full information. SILVER COINAGE.",16
11,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether he is correctly reported as having said in reference to the issue of the new silver coinageI t is now certain that on one side there will be a representation of the King's head encircled with the words "" King and Emperor.""",17
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I have not yet had final information on this matter, but I believe that the statement which the honourable member has read is a fairly accurate one.",17
13,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Empero r of what ?,17
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Everybody knows that the King of England is both King and Emperor-that he is King of England and Emperor of India.,17
15,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Fro m the press reports I notice that the new silver coins are to have a representation of the King's head upon one side and a map of Australia upon the reverse side. I desire to ask the Treasurer whether Tasmania will be represented in that map?,17
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Perhaps the honourable member will be good enough to give notice of his question. As far as my information goes, Tasmania will be shown upon the map in question. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.",17
17,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I left the House on Thursday last under' the misapprehension that the debate on the motion of want of confidence would extend into this week. Had I been present on Friday afternoon, I should have voted with the Government. I make this statement because I thoroughly approve of the party movement now known as the fusion.",17
18,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"May I be permitted, in my simple language, to say "" ditto "" to what the honourable and learned member for Parkes has said?",17
19,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"B y way of personal explanation I desire to make a statement affecting the honourable member for Herbert, the Ministry, a well-known citizen of New South Wales, and m\self. ' To make my explanation intelligible it will be necessary for me to direct attention to Hansard of the present session, page 1231. Upon 15th inst. the honourable member for Herbert, in speaking in this House, saidAs the Minister of Defence is now present, I may, perhaps, be allowed to repeat what I said before-that the Rev. Mr Dillon, speaking at Inverell last Sunday, said that he had been offered the whole of his expenses by a member of the Federal Government to travel through New South Wales before the elections to put forward the policy of Orangeism. Then follow a number of interjections. The next portion of the Hansard report to which I desire to direct attention reads",17
20,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"When a statement of that sort is made either some member of the Federal Government has given that promise to Mr. Dillon, or Mr Dillon has told an untruth. We naturally ask ourselves which member of the Government would be most likely to do that? That was a perfectly natural question to put under the circumstances, and one that I would have asked myself. The report proceeds",17
21,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Mr Dillon is a very straight 'little man, and if the honourable member will write to him I am sure he will tell him what member of the Ministry, if anv, made the offer.",17
22,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I am not in the habit of making wagers, but I am game to wager that Mr Dillon will not give the desired information.",17
23,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is said that only fools make wagers, but I am willing to become a fool by wagering with the honourable member that Mr. Dillon will supply the information. Apparently the substance of the Hansard report has been published in the Sydney newspapers, as on Saturday morning last I received the following letter, which explains itselfS't. Paul's Rectory, Lithgow, Allow me to thank you for your kind reference to me in connection with the question asked by Mr Bamford in the House of Representatives on Friday afternoon. In my address at Inverell on Sunday, n t h July, I am reported to have said that a rriember of' the Federal Ministry had offered to pay my expenses if I would deliver certain addresses throughout the State in every electorate. This report found its way to the Sydney Morning Herald. I cannot understand how I could have used the words "" Federal Ministry,"" as I do not know one member of that Ministry. If I was correctly reported I made a slip and used the word Ministry instead of Parliament. Some eighteen months or two years ago I delivered an address upon the subject of loyalty to the throne of England and in opposition to Home Rule. At the close of that address a Federal member, who was present, thanked me, and said "" I should like that address delivered in every electorate in the State, and would willingly do my share in meeting your expenses."" This is the incident I briefly referred to in my Inverell address, and which has caused some little stir in certain quarters. - Mr Bamford is, I think, reported to have said that it was to pay my expenses to deliver addresses upon Orangeism. Such is absolutely incorrect, but upon the subjects already referred to. I thought it well when writing to thank you just to place the simple facts before you. Again thanking you. I remain, yours sincerely, I may add that as soon as I saw (he report in the papers I immediately corrected it, and in a large meeting on Tuesday evening in Inverell referred to it. I also called at the of the Sydney Morning Herald and made the necessary correction. This was done before the matter came on in the House on Thursday. 1 make this explanation in justice to the honourable member for Herbert and the Ministry themselves. If any Minister had Iieen guilty of the conduct alleged by the honourable member, his act would have been wry reprehensible indeed. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). NEW ZEALAND AND SOUTH .AFRICAN CUSTOMS AGREEMENT.",17
24,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [3.17] I desire to move the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The effect of the New Zealand and South African Customs agreement on Australian trade."" Five honourable members having, risen in their Question proposed.",18
25,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It will be within the recollection of honourable members that some two or three years ago, shortly before Mr Seddon's death, this House endorsed a draft agreement which had been entered into between the Government of the Commonwealth ancl the Prime Minister of the Dominion of New Zealand, under which a modification of the New Zealand Tariff would have been made in favour of Australia. Unfortunately, that agreement was not ratified by the Dominion Parliament, ancl consequently, from the stand-point of trade, we occupy precisely the same position towards New Zealand as does the rest of the world. That was not the first at-, tempt which Australian Parliaments had made to conclude a reciprocal Tariff agreement with New Zealand. The first effort of the kind of which I have special knowledge was one which you, sir, made, when, in 1895, you introduced into the South Australian Parliament a reciprocal agreement lietween New Zealand ancl that State. But after the agreement had been tentatively arranged, the New Zealand Parliament altered the items which it covered very considerably by striking out the provision that fresh fruits from South Australia should be admitted free, and by considerably reducing the preference to be granted by that colony to South Australian wines. D . H . DILLON. As"" a result .of that alteration . the South Australian Parliament carried an amendment, compelling the Government to lay office aside the agreement. Since that time other Governments-and particularly the Governments of the South African Colonies-hav e done more than we have in concluding reciprocal agreements with New Zealand. An agreement has been concluded between the Dominion of New Zealand and the South African Customs Confederation, which is already having a considerably prejudicial effect upon Australian trade. It is therefore urgently necessary, as honourable members will agree when I supply them with some statistics, that steps should at once be taken to enter into communication with New Zealand, in order to see whether Australia cannot be placed upon at least as good a footing in these respects as South Africa. The agreement between New Zealand and South Africa came into force on the 7th January, 1907 ; that is, a little over two years ago. It is styled an agree-places, ment between the Dominion of New Zealand and the South African Customs Confederation which includes the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal, and Southern Rhodesia. The agreement provides that certain special duties shall apply to South African products. Under the agreement feathers enter New Zealand at a duty of 15 per cent., and fish at i^d. per lb. Dried and fresh fruits are admitted duty free, although the ordinary New Zealand duty on fresh fruits is i d . per lb. in some instances, and £d. for the smaller fruits. On maize the general tariff is 9d. per central; the tariff for South Africa is 6d. per central. On sugar the duty is is. 8d. per central; on tobacco, manufactured, 2s. 6d. per lb.; on tea, i d . per lb. On wines other than sparkling, the duty is 2s. petgallon; whilst the duty on Australian, wines is ss. per gallon-a . preference of 3s. per gallon in favour of South African wines. Wines, sparkling, pav 9s. per gallon under the general tariff; and there is a preference duty of ss. per gallon on South African wines. On other goods, except spirits, the duty is 25 per cent, less than what would be payable except for this agreement. Now, the total imports from Australia into New Zealand last year amounted in value to £2,841,426; and if South African goods are to obtain a preference of 25 per cent, it will be seen that that constitutes a very substantial handicap on Australian merchants.. It is a very serious matter, requiring urgent attention on the part of the Parliament and of the Government.",18
26,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Is the honourable member aware that he is raising the fiscal,19
27,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I shall go on as I am doing, irrespective of the issues that I raise. On the other hand. South Africa has granted to New Zealand preference on the following lines:-Bran , is. per central ; flour, 2s. 3d. per central; wheat, is. per central; oats, is. iod. per central; butter, 2d. per lb.; cheese, 12 per cent, ad valorem; meats, i d . per lb.; all other goods except those specified, 25 per cent, less than the duty which would otherwise be payable. Of course, we need not trouble so much about that branch of the subject, because Australia has her own preferential Tariff with South Africa. But it will be seen that the agreement between South Africa and New Zealand involves a considerable handicap upon Australian trade.",19
28,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member propose that we should proffer to New Zealand the concessions that New Zealand has given to South Africa?,19
29,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is a matter for negotiation. It would be absurd forme to propose a Tariff, which is a subject for negotiation between the two Governments. But I say without any hesitation that it ought net to be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to make some concession to New Zealand in the matter of trade, which will not shut us out from New Zealand markets, but which, on the contrary, will enable us to secure the same preferences as are granted by New Zealand to British South Africa. Surely a trade amounting to nearly £3,000,000 per annum is worth making some efforts to conserve. ' In order to show the effect that has already been produced in one line of trade I may mention the wine business. This is the only aspect of the matter into which . I have been able to inquire since the subject was brought under my notice. The figures have been supplied to me by some members of the Viticulturists' Association of South Australia, and Victoria. The effect upon their trade has been marked. The effect on the fruit trade I have been unable to ascertain; but the Government can easily obtain the figures with reference to those goods. In the year 1907 no wine was imported from South Africa to New Zealand. In 1908 the imports were 434 gallons, valued at £126. That was the first year after the new agreement came into force. In the same year Australian viticulturists exported to New Zealand 60,765 gallons of wine other than sparkissue ? ling, valued at ,£24,248.",19
30,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Is the honourable member sure of those figures?,19
31,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"They have been supplied to me by viticulturists, and I presume that they are correct. They have evidently been obtained from some official source.",19
32,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The figures supplied to me show that the value of the wine exported from Australia to New Zealand was about £7,000.",19
33,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,When was that?,19
34,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Thes e figures are for the years 1908 and 1909. In 1908 the quantity was rather under the amount I have stated, and in 1909 it was rather over. There is such a marked disparity that I corrected, the honourable member.",19
35,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I am afraid that the honourable gentleman's figures are incorrect. I have figures here which I obtained this morning from the Commonwealth Statistician, which correspond with those I have quoted. He gives the value of the total import of Australian wines into New Zealand for the year 1908 as .£28,959.",19
36,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That includes sparkling wines.,19
37,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Yes , but they are valued at only £ 3 , 5 3 I",19
38,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Accordin g to the figures I have, the import of these wines for the year ending 31st March, 1908, was valued at £24,000.",19
39,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That valuation must include transhipments of other than Australian wines. According to the figures supplied to me, the total import for 1908 was about 70,000 gallons of wines other than sparkling wines, valued at £24,240. Of this import 23,000 gallons came from Victoria, New South Wales sent nearly 12,000 gallons, and South Australia 35,000 gallons. Of sparkling wines, in the same year, Victoria sent 531 gallons, and New South Wales 1,329 gallons.",19
40,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Thos e figures agree with mine.,20
41,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The value of the imports of sparkling wines was £3,531In the following year the imports of Australian wines into New Zealand very considerably decreased. The decrease in the imports from Victoria was not very great - 3> 33 gallons, as against 23,243 gal2 I - Ions in the previous year- a drop of about 100 gallons. The import from New South Wales, however, dropped from 11,927 gallons to 7,574 gallons, and from South Australia from 35,000 gallons to 26,400 gallons. That was a very considerable decrease in the imports during one year. New South Wales imports show a drop of about 40 per cent., and those from South Australia very nearly as much. The , total import for the year ending 31st March, 1909, was 57,184 gallons, valued at £i Oj26o, as against £24,248-the 2 valuation of the import for the previous year. In sparkling wines the import from Victoria dropped from 531 gallons to 457 gallons, and from New South Wales from 1,329 gallons to 746 gallons. The value of these imports of sparkling wines dropped from £3,531 to £2,234, a very substantial decrease. Honourable members will, perhaps, say that this decrease corresponds with a period in which New Zealand experienced a temporary check upon the extraordinary prosperity hitherto enjoyed. The' value of the total imports in the same year from all other countries than Australia and South Africa dropped from £23,737 to £23.5 S . showing that, so far as the imports from other countries were concerned, there was no considerable falling off. If we look now at the South African figures for the same period, we shall find them very suggestive of the reason for the falling off in the Australian trade. In the first year during which the preferential treaty was in force the imports into New Zealand from South Africa were nil. In the second year they were 434 gallons, ancl in the year. ending March, 1909, they were 5,602 gallons.",20
42,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,What was case the total shortage in the imports from Austra (is ?,20
43,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It was greater at than that. Australia probably suffered ness from a loss in consumption of wine in that wealtharrangement year, or the importers may have been more least, place fully stocked. The point is that a prodoing trade with gressive decline is shown in the imports from Australia, whilst there is a startling increase in the imports from South Africa. Australians, as well as South Africans, are of course pleased to see any part of the Empire doing an increased trade, but whilst a transfer of trade from Australian to SouthAfrican wine growers is of no advantage to the Empire, it is a source of considerable danger to the interests of Australia.",20
44,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I think I drew attention to that last year, as the probable effect of the treaty.",20
45,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I dare say that the honourable' gentleman did, and, if so, his prophecy would appear to be borne out by the facts. I do not wish to occupy too much time in dealing with this matter, but I think I should refer to a few other items. I take, for instance, imports of fruit. The fresh fruit imported to New Zealand from Australia represented a value of ;£74,985; dried fruit, £^20,845; bottled, pulped fruit, and so on, £16,292, or a total value of £112,122. The value of the total imports of fruit from all sources was £354,752, so that in 1908 one-third of the total imports of fruit into New Zealand came from Australia. We are in danger of losing the whole of that trade, unless some such arrangement as I suggest is made. I do not wish to be an alarmist, but the figures are striking. Refined cane sugar to the value of £28,417 was imported into New Zealand, as against an import valued at £28,831 from all 2 other sources. So that one-half of the import of refined cane sugar is affected. I do not know whether at present South Africa is producing any refined cane sugar, but the very considerable preference - given her will probably soon induce her people to enter for the New Zealand sugar trade. Of tobacco manufactured, £102,840 worth was imported from Australia, or about 33 per cent, of the total imports. I have read the wine statistics, and, therefore, need not refer to them any further. I point out to the Government, however, that the is sufficiently urgent, and that business interests involved are so large as to warrant Ministers in entering into negotiations the very earliest moment, with a view to concluding some equitable busibetween the Commonand New Zealand, which will, at us on as good a footing in that part of the Empire as is British South Africa. New Zealand is our nearest neighbour, and, if we are shut out from one of our most profitable markets, one which ought to belong to us-thoug h I do not mean in an exclusive sense-it will be a very disastrous blow to Australia. I admit that it is not the. simplest matter in the world to at once write out a list of the variety of articles which could be admitted into Australia, without, perhaps, raising some difficulties amongst the producers of similar goods in Australia; ought not to be beyond the statesmanship of the two colonies to come to some agreement. The last agreement this Parliament accepted very readily; but, unfortunately, it was rejected in New Zealand. We ought not, however, because of that, to stay our hand, and refuse to enter into further negotiations; seeing that the business interests at stake are so large.",20
46,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [3.43]--The honourable member for Boothby, in the last portion of his remarks, placed his finger accurately on the real obstacle there is to meeting the situation. tion that has arisen. In 1906 a draft agreement for reciprocity with New Zealand was made by the then Commonwealth Government; and, as mentioned by the honourable member for Boothby, passed by this House; but, unfortunately as I think, owing to the untimely decease of the late Mr Richard Seddon, who was responsible for this agreement-h e having represented his own Government, and conducted the negotiations which led to the framing of the proposed reciprocity schedule-it fell to the ground.",21
47,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We drove a very hard bargain !,21
48,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Opinion s differ in that regard. Any of us who were personally acquainted' with, or even only knew the late Prime Minister of New Zealand by reputation, .will suspect that he was far more likely to have driven a hard bargain with us than we with him.",21
49,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The agreement failed in New Zealand.,21
50,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes ; but, as a matter of fact, although the schedule presented was the result of a series of long and arduous struggles of a friendly, character across the table, as between the Minister of Trade and Customs and myself on the one side, and the late Mr Richard Seddon on the other, the latter, after its acceptance, expressed himself satisfied with it, not that it contained all he desired, but as representing substantially the basis of an agreement for commercial interchange between the two Dominions. I have always believed that, but for his untimely decease, his strong ascendancy in his own Parliament would probably have led to the acceptance of the agreement as it stood, or, perhaps, with some minor amendments. but it Since then, however, we have on more than one occasion, and latterly in an informal manner, attempted to bring about a revised agreement; but on each occasion so far we have been informed that the time in the sister Dominion is not ripe for anything like the agreement which we desire. anyI assure the honourable member for Boothby that we shall need no stimulus, and we have needed none, to repeat those proposals. In point of fact, it was in my mind to take advantage of the return of the present Premier of New Zealand, Sir Joseph ""Ward, should he come to his home by the Australian route, to once more re-open the quesWhether that be so or not, although it would be a favourable opportunity, there will be other opportunities to endeavour to revive the matter. I cordially agree with the honourable member for - Boothby that, amongst all the proposals for reciprocity and preference, the Dominion of the Empire which is nearest to us, and situated in the same seas, is, above all others, one with whom the very fullest commercial relations ought to be sought; and they will be sought without any hesitation. The agreement which was approved by this House provided for a reduction of duties on our wines, as the honourable member for Boothby has properly said. At present Australian wines pay 5s. and 9s. per gallon, the latter for sparkling wines, before they enter New Zealand. Under the treaty which was proposed, the 5s. would have been reduced to 4s., and the 9s. to 6s., so that there would have been only an advantage of 2s. on non-sparkling wines, and no advantage on sparkling wines under the treaty which has since been made with South Africa. At present South African wines have an advantage of 2s. on both non-sparkling and sparkling.",21
51,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That means that no Australian growers can possibly compete.,21
52,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am afraid it means something very like that. But if the treaty had been passed, the advantage would have been only 2s. on non-sparkling wines, and no advantage on sparkling wines. After having looked at the figures, we require to bear in mind two very important facts. New Zealand is a non-wine producing country, and imports all it requires; and it was the entrance into its market of our wines on which the late Mr Richard Seddon rested in a great deal of the bargaining that took place. South Africa, like Australia, is a wine-producing country, and, of course, the South Africans, having our treaty before their eyes when they made this agreement for reciprocity with New Zealand, naturally took particular care to put their wine industry on the most favourable basis possible. so, as my colleague, the Attorney-General, prophesied more than twelve months ago, when he asked a question in this House. The object of the 'treaty, from the South African point of view, largely to get an advantage over Australian wines. I do not think my figures differ substantially from those of the honourable member for Boothby. I make the decline in the quantity of our wines about 13,000 gallons from 1908 to 1909, and the decline in value to be about .£3,000, taking all wines together.'",21
53,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"My figures ,£4,000 odd.",22
54,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is the measure of our loss in one year; but there still remains ufon noticeto us a trade chat we should be very sorry to lose. Since New Zealand accepted this Royal treaty with South Africa, knowing what its effect would be, we are placed at some slight disadvantage when entering into further negotiations. This debate, and the figures themselves, clearly point to the direction in which we should seek for concessions, ancl these would require to be paid for in some other direction. The difficulty, however, is by no means insuperable. The condition of things brought about by this competitive treaty certainly calls for the closest attention; and I undertake, on behalf of the Minister of Trade and Customs, that he will make full inquiry at an early date into all the circumstances of the present condition of trade between New Zealand and the Commonwealth, so that we may reopen negotiations for a reciprocal treaty in which the duties on wine and fruits will receive special consideration.

Is it not a fact that communications from the New South Wales Telephone Exchange Asso-i ciation and kindred associations have since their inception been given every publicity, and circulars from the first-mentioned been exhibited on the notice-boards in the Exchanges, and, in the case of Sydney Central, by the direction and with the concurrence of the Manager of Telephones ? t 3. Is he aware that a communication has been issued by the Manager of Telephones asking .for the names and particulars of the men who have followed this usual custom, and that certain officials have been called upon to explain their action ? 4. Will he issue instructions that all association matters may be given the same publicity as heretofore?",23
58,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The answer to the first of the honourable member's questions is as follows :1. It is a fact that certain associations of officers of this Department are officially recognised by the Postmaster-General's Department. The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information regards questions 2 and 3 :2. Where the contents of circulars are not sidered objectionable, no objection has been to their being posted in the Exchange for formation of those concerned. 3. Action was taken as indicated in one instance where a circular containing matter considered subversive of discipline was posted in one of the Exchanges, and was then removed by the officer in charge of the Exchange and referred to the Sydney Head Office for directions. Inquiries were then made, and the paper dealt with by the Deputy Postmaster-General. Papers are with Royal Commission on Postal services. There is no objection to communications of this kind being posted in Exchanges as long as they are not of an objectionable nature. 4. Such instructions are unnecessary, vide concluding portion of answer to No. 3. Mr J. H. CATTS asked the Minister of are as Home Affairs, upon notice I. What rate of salary is paid to the head caretaker at the General Post Office in each of the Australian Capitals? 2. Is the position referred to, at Sydney, below other Capitals as regards classification ? 3. If so, will he give instructions to raise the classification of the largest office, at least as high as the maximum paid to smaller offices in other States?",23
59,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The answers to the member's questions are as fol1. Sydney, ^156; Melbourne, ^228. These are the only General Post Offices at which caretakers are employed. The salary paid to the officer was granted while he was under State control, and he has been allowed to continue in receipt of it. He is regarded, however, as largely overpaid, and in the event of the position becoming vacant, it will be filled at a reduced salary. 2. Yes, for the reason stated. 3. The salary is the same as that paid for the work by the State before transfer to the - Commonwealth, and when the present caretaker was appointed, the same salary was advertised for the position. Before increased remuneration can be' given, it must be demonstrated that the officer performing the duties is worth higher pay, but the evidence on this point is at present unconvincing.",23
60,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon noticer. Is it a fact that Postal officials who sat for the last General Division examination and passed are not eligible for appointment, although men outside the service were appointed in preference ? 2. Why was their money received and the right given to them to compete, if they were ineligible? 3. Will the Minister see that the entrance fee (7s. 6d.) is returned to these officials?",23
61,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In reply to the honoras able member I have to state that nothing is known of any such cases; but should conany have occurred, the officers concerned, taken if they submit an application for refund, the inwould, in the circumstances stated, have their fees returned.",23
62,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice Whether, in view of complaints that in times of drought there is great crueltv to the horses used by some of the mail contractors, he will insert a clause in the mail contracts to minimise this evil as much as possible?",23
63,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as folGeneral, upon noticelows :The general conditions of Commonwealth mail contracts now provide that the horses used in the conveyance of mails are to be subject to approval by the Department. Inspectors and postmasters will be instructed to exercise proper supervision in this matter.",24

Has he abandoned the proposals for Penny low :Postage throughout Australia as put forward by himself in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the present Parliament? 2. Why has this proposal been omitted from the statement of Government business now before the House? 3. Does he not think that Penny Postage operating in Victoria should be made uniform throughout Australia? 4. Does he not also think that the postal rates for printed matter should be made uniform on the basis of ^d. for 2 oz. as a minimum charge? 5. Is he aware that in Tasmania the minimum rate for printed matter is i d . for 4 oz. ?",24
67,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and 2. It is not intended to proceed with the Bill this session. 3. Commonwealth uniformity is highly desirable. 4. The Postmaster-General informs me that it is considered the postage rates for printed matter should be made uniform on the basis mentioned, when other postal rates can be made generally uniform throughout the Commonwealth. 5. No. In Tasmania the minimum rate for printed matter is i d . for 2 ozs. case 'in all States except New South Wales and. Victoria, where the rate of £d. per 2 ozs. for printed matter obtains within the State.  1. Is the statement appearing in the South Australian Advertiser of 7th July true, namely : - That the Postmaster-General states that "" for reasons which are not too disinterested in character several operators, notably a group in South Australia, have for years opposed the use of the Wheatstone in Australia, and where installations have been tried they have raised various technical difficulties "" ? 2. Was an inquiry held 15 months ago into the alleged obstruction? 3. What was the result of the inquiry, and why has it not been communicated to the officers concerned ? 4. If the opposition and obstruction were proved, why are the guilty officers retained in the service? 5. Have not the Adelaide telegraphists all along demanded a thorough investigation? 6. Is it not true that two operators whose names were mentioned at the inquiry as obstructionists have since received substantial promotion? 7. If the inquiry showed South Australian operators to be guiltless, does the Postmaster General consider his communication to the press, as' per question (1), concerning these officers to to date, of the Colebe justified? 8. Will the Postmaster-General have a further and independent inquiry' made into the charges against the Adelaide telegraphists, or, if not, will he direct that the charges be absolutely withdrawn by the permanent head of the Department who first gave them publicity ?",24
68,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. It is not true. 2. Yes. 3. The statements at the informal inquirynecessarily confined to the Telegraph Branchwere of a contradictory character, arid it was considered that no good result would be secured by publishing the report unless the letter from the Adelaide telegraphist, upon which any statement of the Secretary was founded, together with the voluminous statements f r o and con. was also published. I shall, however, be glad if so desired, to place on the table copies of papers relating to the Wheatstone telegraph working, including those with respect to the incident referred to. 4. They were not found to be of such character or importance as to call for any serious action. 5. Yes, into the statements said to have been made by the Secretary. 6. I am not aware of this. 7. See reply to question 1. 8. No further inquiry is considered necessary. I am not aware what the charges are which 'it is desired the Permanent Head should withdraw.",24

71,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"the Postputy master-General, ufon notice I. Has his attention been directed to a published minute of the Lord Mayor of Sydney, is which the following statement appears :""Recently I have seen erected in the city, poles for carrying the telephone that really would be a disgrace to a wayside road. With a country very valuable, and very suitable timber for this purpose, a better selection, and the exercise of a certain amount of work in the way of cleaning, chamfering, and painting, in place of putting them in the street in their raw state, in in any instances with the bark on, and with ugly knotty projections, would improve the local surroundings very much. This matter is one of great importance, and, as the Commonwealth Departments have got such great control over our thoroughfares, I feel we are justified in entering a very strong protest against a continuance of this policy "" ? 2. Has any special representation been made by the Sydney City Council in this matter? 3. Will he see that telegraph and telephone poles in keeping with city requirements are used ?",25
72,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information respecting 1 and 2 1. No .cases known where poles erected in city with bark on and with ugly knotty projections. Poles mentioned in press by Lord Mayor were some in Crown and Liverpool streets. They were undressed round wooden poles, and replaced others much more unsightly.' Dressed poles not used in city, because amount provided on igo8-g Estimates not sufficient. Undressed poles therefore used. Estimated relative cost of using dressed and undressed poles in city and principal streets of suburbs for twelve months is-dressed , £3:335; undressed, ^922 ios. When undressed poles replace others previously painted it is usual to paint the new poles, otherwise undressed poles are not painted, as per instructions. 2. No special representation was made by City Council prior to receipt of a letter from Town Clerk subsequent to statement in press. The following is the answer to the third question :3. Yes, so far as the money at the disposal of the Department will permit.",25
73,Mr HALL,Unknown,"the General, ufon notice I. Is it true that the Department has in the past painted the telephone poles at Bathurst without cost to the local Council? 2. The like information in regard to Orange, that the Dubbo, and Newcastle?

74,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The following information has been furnished by the DePostmaster-General, Sydney, as regards questions 1 and 2, viz. :1. No poles have been painted at Bathurst since the year 1899. 2. At Orange, 2 dressed and 77 undressed poles were painted in 1902, but the painting of the latter was arranged for by the local postmaster under a misinterpretation of instructions. No poles have been painted at Dubbo since 1901. At Newcastle, 28 dressed poles were painted during and prior to 1902, and 7 dressed poles have been painted since that date. 3. A general rule was made in July, 1902, that where it is necessary to paint poTes for departmental purposes, i.e., where dressed poles are necessarily used, and must be periodically painted for the purposes of being preserved, the painting should be done at the sole expense of the Department. In instances where the poles are painted simply to make them more pleasing in appearance, one-half the cost of painting should be defrayed by those who ask that such action be taken. That ruling has never been varied up to the present, but has been confirmed from time to time by various Ministers. It has been applied in the case of Goulburn, because it was reported that there was no special reason why the undressed poles there should be painted without the usual practice being observed of the Municipal Council bearing one-half the cost of the work.",25
75,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"the Postmasterquestions General, ufon notice. 1. For what period of time have Messrs. Percy Whitton, F.I.A.A., and Charles Morell Holmes, F.C.P.A., been appointed to inquire into the financial condition of the Telephone Service ? 2. What amount of salary or other remuneration are these gentlemen to receive for performing the duties allotted to them? 3. Will such salaries or other remuneration be paid from the Departmental revenue, or from the Loan Fund, which the Minister contemplates obtaining ? 4. Is the Department so utterly destitute of actuarial knowledge and skill that it is necessary to go outside to obtain it for the use of the Minister?",25
76,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable members questions are as follow :1. No definite period has been fixed, but I ' have intimated to the gentlemen named that I desire the inquiry to be completed within three Postmaster- months. 2. Mr Holmes will receive ^5 5s. per day, with cost of conveyance, and an allowance of 17s. 6d. per day when travelling and absent from his home in Melbourne. Mr Whitton will receive his official salary, and the same travelling allowance as Mr. Holmes. No additional remuneration for his services has so far been determined. 3. From revenue. 4. It was not necessary to go outside the Department for officers to obtain the desired information, but, under the circumstances of this case, the Government considered it advisable to make the present arrangements. Mi. LIVINGSTON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether he will ascertain the reason why the Penneshaw and Kingscote (Kangaroo Island) telephone was not erected, in view of the fact that the Department accepted a deposit of £24 and a guarantee from the people fifteen months ago, and that nothing has been heard of the money or telephone since?",25
77,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows : The reason is that the Post Office Department has not so far been able to secure the necessary funds to enable it to proceed with the work.

Under the regulations referred to a payment of £ $ per annum entitle'd a telephone subscriber to originate 1,000 effective calls per rings half-year without any additional charge. 2. Such a subscriber can allow a non-subscriber to use any of the calls for which he pays the Department, as indicated in answer No. 1, and make a charge there for not exceeding one penny per call.",26

91,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"This matter is under consideration; but it is thought unwise to enlarge the scope of the law in this direction at present, more especially as the invalid portion of the Act has not been yet brought into force.",27
92,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact .that under the Victorian Old age Pensions Acts 1901 and 1903 the veteran citizen app'ying for the old-age pension would have no questions to fill in, but would only have to sign his or her name in the presence of the required witness ? 2.

The Board did not support his appeal as to title and alteration of division. It considered that his designation should be altered from "" Chief Clerk and Accountant"" to "" Senior Clerk and Accountant,"" but recommended increase in salary from ^335 to £380, an increase of £45 as stated. The Board's recommendation was approved. 3. An advancement was not {/ranted for the year 1906-7, for the reason that Mr Brown had received a substantial increase in the previous year. The salary thus obtained was regarded as sufficient recognition of his merits for that time, and nothing has since occurred to warrant further increase. 4-5. The action already taken was in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act, but final action as to the disposition of Mr Brown's services has not yet been determined. 6. Mr Brown was not intrusted with the duty of revising the Reports of the Examiners. Nothing reported by Mr Brown, within or without the scope of his duties, could settle the question of the validity or invalidity of Patents, that being a matter solely for determination by the Courts. 7. See answer to No. 6. 8. The Commissioner of Patents states that no instructions were issued to Mr Brown to "" take risks."" 9. As the matter is one which, according to law, is dealt with by. the Public Service Commissioner, it would not be proper for a Minister to attempt to interfere with that officer's discretion.

Will he obtain for the information of the House a copy of the prospectus of the Bovril Australian Estates Ltd. ? 3. Will he ascertain who are the vendors referred to in the above paragraph? 4. Can he say where the head office of the Bovril Australian Estates L t d . is located, and will he ascertain who are the principals in the company ? 5. Does he approve of the lands of the Northern Territory being obtained in such a manner by land syndicates?",29
113,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The question relates really to the Department of External Aftoms, upon noticefairs, ancl the answers are as follow :r to 5. My attention has been drawn to the paragraph referred to. The information asked for will be obtained, but at present, without a knowledge of the facts, it would be premature to express any opinion on the matter. PAPUAN ADMINISTRATION : MURDER TRIAL.",30
114,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"the Minister of External Affairs, upon notice I. Is he able to furnish the House with details of the trial of a person named Thoresby, in Papua, before a jury, on a charge of murder? ' 2. Did Thoresby arm some natives and encourage them to fight against another tribe, with the result that some of the latter were killed ? 3. Is there any objection to making public the full details in connection with the charge or charges made against Thoresby, and the facts upon which those charges were based, and the result? 4. Is the Department satisfied with the results of trial by jury in Papua, in cases where white people are charged with offences against natives? 5. Has any proposal been made to pass an Ordinance making it legal to sign on native women as labourers. If so, what is the result?",30
115,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The Department has been advised that Mr. Thoresby was arrested on a charge of murder in the Mafulu District, remanded to Port Moresby, and on the Sth and gth April last tried and acquitted. No details of the trial are available. 2. It was so stated, but there is no evidence The capital of the Bovril available to the Department to enable us to say how far the allegations were justified. The consideration given to Thoresby was charged "" with supplying arms to natives, and was fined £100. He petitioned for the remission of the fine, and consideration of the petition by the local Executive was pending when the last advices were transmitted., 3. There is no objection to making all the The title of the land is a facts known to the Department available to the public, but the information to hand is very limited. 4. Happily the number of cases needing to he tried by jury has been too small for the Department to form any opinion on the subject. 5. A proposal was made by a private citizen that women should be allowed to sign on as labourers. His object was to encourage village settlement in connection with plantations. No measure to give effect to the proposal has been submitted to the Legislative Council. It will be recollected that all ordinances dealing with the subject of native labour are required to be reserved for the Governor General's assent. SIZE OF CORNSACKS.",30
116,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Cus1. Is he aware that the cornsacks now allowed to be brought into the Commonwealth will not hold 200 lbs. of wheat, as was intended when the dimensions of the sacks were decided upon? 2. Will he inquire into the matter, and, if satisfied that the said sacks will not contain 200 lbs. of wheat, take steps to have the dimensions of such sacks increased sufficiently to contain the said weight? 3. Have the Federal authorities taken any steps to induce the State Governments to bring into force legislation to prevent more than 200 lbs. weight of produce being put into sacks?",30
117,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. It is found by experience that the present standard sack holds on the average 200 lbs. It may be slightly and within a few pounds over or under, but it answers all reasonable requirements, is convenient to handle, stack, and stow, and I am assured it is affording general satisfaction. 2. No alteration in variation of the standard size is contemplated. 3. Yes. IMMIGRATION.",30
118,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has his attention been called to the f o llowing editorial notice appearing in the Farmer and Setjler (New South Wales), 7th May, 1909 :"" The British Immigration League of Australia has just welcomed a batch of imgrants from England. They appear to be a decent, well-behavedlot of men, ' and probably their only fault is that they lack the necessary farm experience that would fit them for bush life in Australia "" ? 2. Does he know that these immigrants are in some cases sleeping in the Sydney Domain, and are practically penniless and destitute? 3. Does he know that the same editorial notice above referred to offers on behalf of these men that they are willing to work for 5s. per week as follows :"" Now I want twelve good men and true to write to me at once and offer to take one of these men as a learner, say for a term of three months, at 5s. per week and keep "" ? 4. Does he not think it a scandal that these men should be deluded into believing there was good work and wages awaiting them here, and that the taxpayers' money should be spent in bringing them to Australia? 5. Does he not think such unemployed a menace to fair rates of pay for farm labour? 6. Does he require specific instances to prove that unskilled labour without knowledge of rural life is being imported. If so, will he note the following taken from the Farmer and Settler on the date before mentioned"":"" H . Dulieu, 21, wants work on farm or station, no experience, "" W. G. Brendling, 23, wants work on farm or station, no experience "" ? 7. Does he not think the time has arrived when the Commonwealth Parliament should take full control of immigration as provided in the Constitution?",30
119,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- , 1. Yes, by. the honourable member's question only. 2. No. 3. No. 4-5. Without a full knowledge of all the circumstances I would prefer not to express any opinion. 6. The facts are noted as requested. 7. I do not express an opinion as ing of the constitutional provision in respect to immigration. The Government policy will be. announced in due course. NA LEAVE OF ABSENCE-FIFT H CLASS CLERKS plates LONG SERVICE INCREMENTS.",31
120,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"the Minister of and Home Affairs, upon notice I. How many officials in the Commonwealth Public Service have enjoyed the special leave of absence provided for in Regulation 89A? 2. How many female officers have enjoyed the leave of absence privileges provided for in Regulow :lation 140? 3. Why are male officers nqj given the same privileges upon retirement or resignation from the service as provided for female officers under - Regulation 140 ? 4. Will the Government place all officers under Regulation 140, or amend Regulation 89A in conformity therewith?",31
121,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Eight officers. 2. By the operation of Regulation 140, 108 female officers have been granted leave on retirement from the Public Service through marriage. 3. See reply under (4). 4. The retirement of the male officer under 65 years of age is voluntary, while that of the female officer is compulsory.",31
122,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Is it intended that long service increments granted to Class V. clerical officers of the Commonwealth Public Service are to act as a barrier to the promotion of meritorious officers to Class IV.? 2. If not, how many Class V. clerks of the Customs and Postmaster-General's Departments, respectively, have been recommended for promotion to Class IV . in connection with the Estimates of 1909-10? 3. Should provision not be made on the 1909-10 Estimates for the promotion of such officers to Class IV . , how is it proposed to advance the officers referred lo to that Class?",31
123,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :J. No, where the work warrants higher classification. 2. Promotion from one class to another is only made upon the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. As he has not yet completed his investigations in regard to class promotions to be provided for on 1909-10 Estimates, it is not possible to say how many such promotions will be made. 3. The Public Service Act provides that advancement can only be made on the occurrence of vacancies in the higher class. to the mean- VICTORIAN STEAM-SHIP SUBSIDY.",31
124,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Government of Victoria, with a view of influencing in favour of that State SERVICE. the direction of the external trade and commerce of the Commonwealth, pays, or contempaying, a subsidy of £2,000 a year in support of a line of steam-ships in respect of voyages between Victoria and F i j i , and F i j i Victoria? 2. Whether the payment of such a subsidy is contrary to the Commonwealth Constitution?",31
125,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. It is understood the Government of Victoria contemplates paying a subsidy in support of a line of steam-ships in respect of voyages between Victoria and F i j i , and F i j i and Victoria. 2. A former Attorney-General advised that the proposed subsidy did not involve any breach of the Constitution. STAT E PROHIBITION OF IMPORTS. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S INFECTED FRUIT-CONDEMNATIO N OF",31
126,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"the Attorney General, upon notice I. Is a State justified in prohibiting the importation from another State of slightly infected fruit, when locally-grown fruit, much more seriously infected with the same disease, is permitted to be transported within the State and publicly sold? 2. Does not such differential treatment conflict with section 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution ?",32
127,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:It is not the custom for Ministers to answer questions of law, but the honourable member's question is probably directed to the principle which is, that though a State may, in exercise of the police power, protect itself from the introduction of infected fruit it may not under pretext of exercising that power do anything the real object and effect of which is to interfere with freedom of Inter-State commerce.",32
128,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is the Minister aware that over 2,000 bags of potatoes passed by inspectors of produce at the port of shipment in Tasmania have been condemned by the authorities as diseased and ordered to be returned to that State upon the potatoes reaching Sydney ? 2. Is the Minister aware that this action is likely to prove very inimical to the producing and mercantile interests of Tasmania? 3. Will the Minister make inquiries into the circumstances and inform this House what action (if any) can be taken by the Commonwealth in the matter?",32
129,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1, 2, and 3. Reports have been received giving reasons for action referred to, but the matter is entirely one for the State to deal with. It is understood the State authorities are giving every attention to the matter, and it is not considered that the Commonwealth should interfere. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE.",32
130,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In addition to the question No. 3, sir, may I ask the Attorney-General, without notice, a question?",32
131,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member may do so on a later date. The time for asking questions without notice today bas passed. SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY. Consideration resumed from 23rd June POTATOES. (vide page 303), of motion by Mr. ROBERTSThat the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT. POLICY OF NEW ADMINISTRATION. Debate resumed from 23rd June (vide page 282) on motion by Mr DEAKINThat the paper (Statement of Government Business) laid on the table on 23rd June be printed.",32
132,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [4-20] After the long debate which we have had upon another motion, obviously no good public purpose would be served by again traversing the old ground. Probably the statement which I am now called upon to discuss was drafted with the intention of preventing any considerable debate upon it. It will be recollected that at the time of its submission to this House, some little trouble was experienced, owing to the f.'ict that the Prime Minister then thought that it ought not to be discussed at all. The honourable gentleman shakes his head ; hut I certainly understood him to say then that there was no need to debate it.",32
133,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply would have permitted its discussion.,32
134,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is an apology which comes rather late in the day.,32
135,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No ; the statement was made then.,32
136,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, when leading the Opposition to the late Administration, was enabled within a day of his appointment to that distinguished position, to defeat the late Government. He was thus enabled to do what he had previously done in more instances than one, and in more Parliaments than one. No reflection is cast upon him by that statement. He adopted the best method that he could to attain the object which he had in view. He is the oldest parliamentarian in this House, having had thirty years' political experience, twenty years of which has teen spent in Ministerial office. Naturally, he knows his way about from the standpoint of parliamentary tactics. He knows exactly what to do and what not to do, and this Ministerial statement. I regard as an evidence of what he desired not to say. Upon a former occasion, I did him an injustice by asserting that I thought the Ministry had been too hard upon him by compelling him to put their policy in writing, and by refusing him liberty to depart from it one iota. Upon a later occasion, the Prime Minster declared that, so far from that being the case, it was his special request to the Cabinet, that the Ministerial policy should be committed to writing, so as to obviate the possibility of any misunderstanding as to its contents. I must say, to his credit, that he has always been in favour of putting things in writing. In that respect, he is distinguished from other persons who are quite content on certain occasions to give and accept a word of honour. The Prime Minister, I repeat, desired to put his case in writing. although he does not wish to deceive anybody, he is a very difficult correspondent to bind down to the exact ideas which he wishes to convey. that as it may, I say that the statement read by the Prime Minister contains nothing more nor less than a number of glittering generalities. It embodies no policy like that in the speech which was put into the mouth of the Governor General at the opening, of the present session, which the honourable gentleman condemned. us no Federal guide in the matter of Australian development.",32
137,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It consists only of a number of headlines.,33
138,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall leave,the honourable member for Dallev to deal with it as questions develop in this House. But I repeat what I stated during the debate upon the no-confidence motion that, instead of the Government-wh o boast that they came into office to preserve the Federation, and to develop our national and industrial life-actin g up to their professions, they have merely sought to evade the whole duty that devolves upon this Parliament.. The industrial legislation which is outlined in the Ministerial statement will-if effect be given to it-depriv e the Commonwealth of that dignity which properly belongs to it, by taking from the. Conciliation and Arbitration Court which it has established, the powers which are now wielded by that tribunal, and by vesting then in another authority for the purpose of preventing the workmen of Australia from getting the benefit of verdicts which they have won at great expense, and after strenuous fighting. Because a method has been discovered by which one Commonwealth tribunal may decide what is a fair and reasonable wage in all the States, it is now proposed to delegate its powers to another authority-a n authority which will not be able to deal with industrial matters so expeditiously and effectively as can the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court.",33
139,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Perhaps the Ministry will explain the matter.,33
140,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I believe that I am not doing them any injustice when I say they will explain anything, so long as they are not asked to do anything. Some time ago, the Prime Minister stated that the payment of old-age pensions was in danger. That statement, however, was subsequently either withdrawn absolutely or qualified. Now, I think that I am stating the exact But, position when I say that £692,000 were available for the payment of old-age pensions when the present Treasurer took office. Be Sir JOHN FORREST - The figures did not work out exactly as was anticipated.",33
141,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"At any rate, ,£692,000 was approximately the amount which was available in the absence of any further appropriation. Therefore, the Ministry could practically see six months ahead of them so far as the payment of old-age It offers pensions was concerned.",33
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I never said anything to that effect.,33
143,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The right honourable member may not have said anything directly to that effect, but it is wonderful how his supporters outside the Government were able to convey such an impression to the public, and to the old-age pensioners themselves ; so that they became alarmed because of our action in discussing a proper motion in this Parliament, fearing that they might be deprived of their pensions. I may observe, further, that there is in draft a Bill to amend the Old-age Pensions Act, and that it was the intention of the previous Government to introduce that measure at once. But they were defeated before they had an opportunity.",33
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that there was a Bill in draft?,33
145,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the right honourable member questions my statement on that point, he will question anything. If he means to convey that the Bill was not in type, I agree with him. But we had conveyed to the official head of the Department our intentions in regard to a Bill, which could' be drafted in half an hour. The facts were all settled as regards the reduction from twenty-five to twenty years, and all the subsidiary points which were necessary to make the measure work smoothly. I was pleased to read the Prime Minister's statement, published in the newspapers, that it was the intention of the present Government to make that amending Bill the first measure introduced. I think it ought to have been dealt with some time ago; and but for the action of the Prime Minister in dispossessing the previous Government, it would have been passed by now. I only mention that fact - so that if it be said that we have been delaying the matter it may be seen that the blame does not rest with the late Government, but that it must be thrown on to the present Ministry, seeing that, by their action, they rendered necessary legislation impossible. However, I presume that honourable members on all sides of the House will agree with the principle of the Bill, although it has been delayed for a week or two. I also assume that there will be no difficulty in incorporating in the measure a provision to enable payments to be made as from the ist July to all old-age pensioners, who would have been entitled to the pension from that date, had the alteration of the residential period from twenty-five to twenty years been made earlier; because, obviously, had the previous Government not been disturbed the measure would have been passed during May or June, and consequently a large number of persons would have been entitled to the pension. That, at any rate, is the view which I take. I should like to say again to the Prime Minister that I regret very much that he did not think it necessary to make a fuller explanation of his reasons for including ten Ministers in his present Cabinet. I consider, Mr. Speaker, that that was a dangerous encroachment on responsible government.",33
146,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Fro m nine to ten?,34
147,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The number of Ministers in the Cabinet rose from eight to nine, and then from nine to ten; and it is singular that the last increase was made by those very gentlemen who are always saying that we must have responsible government. If the number of Ministers can be increased from eight to nine, and from nine to ten, it can be increased from ten to twenty; and by adopting that course, as I said previously, anv Government could suborn Parliament. The Prime Minister will perhaps reply that Parliament itself would be the corrector of such an abuse. But how could we expect Parliament to correct an abuse of that kind under a state of things such as we have existing here at present, when the pledges given by honourable members to their constituents seem to stand for nothing whatever? Promises made to the electors are flaunted, on the ground that If we go to the constituencies f ! we shall be defeated."" Surely that is not a sufficient answer. I should like the Prime Minister to state to the House and the country the reasons why he thought it necessary to have a tenth member in the Cabinet. I make no charge against him for taking the position of Honorary Minister himself, although I think it is most undesirable that the chief adviser to the Governor General should be without a portfolio, and nominally without a salaried position. I do not suppose, however, that the Prime Minister intends either the House or the public to believe that he does not share in the emoluments distributed amongst Ministers",34
148,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We should get over the difficulty if Ministers, on taking office, had to seek re-election.",34
149,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That would be one way of getting over the. difficulty, I admit. The honourable member has suggested one remedy for the constant changes of Governments, and for ""fusions"" such as have recently taken place.",34
150,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It is the only remedy.,34
151,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Le t us have elective Ministries, and then we shall get over the difficulty.",34
152,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Nothin g would delight me more than if I could come to the same conclusion as the honourable member for Perth has done, but I venture to say that if he lives long enough to see elective Ministries in this Parliament he will witness a state of affairs in which there will be a greater amount of abuse than we see at the present time.",34
153,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,That has not been the effect elsewhere.,34
154,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That may or may not be so. We are only ten years away from the time when the Constitution was drafted. At that period many of the authorities on constitutional government who took part in the Convention felt that the effect of bringing into operation a Constitution such as ours would be that Federation would kill responsible government, or that responsible government would kill Federation. It is just as well to remember that fact.",34
155,Mr WILKS,Unknown,That was merely a smart epigram.,35
156,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But there was something behind it. The drift in Australia is undoubtedly towards responsible government, but it is getting further and further away from the Federal ideal. I am not going to complain about that. But I have a right to challenge honourable members opposite who call themselves the Federal party, the protectors of the Constitution, &c, & c , and who must see that what has recently taken place in connection with the formation of this Government has not been in accordance with the principles of responment. sible government, about which they make so much outcry.",35
157,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,""" Responsible governj ment"" is another name for irresponsible government.",35
158,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall leave that subject for the honourable member who interjects to discuss with his friends. The point which I make against the Prime Minister is that he has increased the number of Ministers from nine to ten; and I say that if he can constitutionally do that, can equally ""well increase the number still further. It is only fair that he should whether he adopted this course deliberately, and for the good of the country, or whether he did it for party purposes. He should state whether he considered that the increase of the number of Ministers would be beneficial to Australia. We must assume that that was his motive. This same question was brought up in the first Parliament by the leader of the Opposition, when Sir Edmund Barton included an Honorary Minister in his Cabinet.",35
159,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Two .,35
160,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But there are three agreed thatthan now. Sir Edmund Barton included the effectively Vice-President of the Executive Council, liament and of the which is called an honorary office. that office can be justified.",35
161,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",35
162,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Si r Edmund Barton have also appointed an additional Honorary Minister. The present Prime Minister is very experienced man. He certainly has had the longest Ministerial experience of man in Australia. As without constituunless tional authority he has increased the ber of members of the Cabinet by another Honorary Minister, I should like him to equipped. tell us what is the limit at which the making of such appointments would become corruption. He is the person responsible.",35
163,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The next move will be the appointment of Under-Secretaries.,35
164,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Ministerial statement is submitted to us under three headings. The first portion of it deals with industrial matters, which are all important. I think that the proposals submitted by the Government are altogether unsatisfactory. I hold the opinion that it is impossible for such machinery as the Government suggest for the purpose to be made effective. I shall watch eagerly for the Government proposal regarding new Protection. It is not to be found in the. Ministerial stateThere is nothing in that statement to guarantee fair and reasonable wages to the workers of Australia. There is nothing in it that takes us any further than did a statement submitted on behalf of a previous Government led by the present Prime Minister, in which we were given to understand that fair and reasonable wages were to be paid in some industries, and a minimum wage fixed in others. This Parliament should not say that fair and reasonable wages are not to be paid to every one. he Surely we should not seek to shelter ourselves in this matter, and proclaim that, if say an industry is not a protected industry, the workers engaged in it need not be paid reasonable wages? It might be difficult to meet the circumstances of various industries, but we ought to leave it to a competent court to decide that any industry which is unable to pay fair and reasonable wages shall cease to be carried on in Australia. I need make no further reference to the proposal respecting silver coinage than to say that I am happy that it is about to be consummated. On the question of defence, all parties in the House are it must be dealt with more feel sure that I it has been in the past. I express the desire of ParI think we hope something countrywill be when I say that done, and that people will cease merely to talk about providing an effective defence. Hitherto we heard most eloquent orations regarding the defencelessness of this country. We a have now reached a stage when it has been said that action must be taken, and I know any of no way in which action can be taken we begin by collecting from the numpeople the funds necessary to equip our defence forces as they ought to be",35
165,Mr WILKS,Unknown,We must tell the people that they will have to pay for it.,35
166,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I had but one statement to make to the public on this question throughout my campaign in the country. I asked, "" Do you think that we are sufficiently defended at the present time? "" By interjection those to whom I spoke usually said, "" No."" I then asked, "" Are you prepared to pay a sufficient amount for the efficient defence of Australia?"" And the usual answer was, "" Yes."" The only position which any man holding a responsible office in the Commonwealth can take up on this question is that, if we'are going to defend the country, we must provide ""funds to enable our forces, however well trained they may be, to be as well equipped as any enemy that might operate against them. I know of no way of securing the money which will be required for this purpose but by'obtaining it from the people by taxation. The present Government would appear to have access to some Fortunatus' purse, into which they can dip their hands and obtain money without in the first place taking it from the people. I know of no such way of getting money, and I shall await with some interest an announcement of the scheme by which the Government propose to defend Australia effectively without touching the wealthy people of this country, whose property will be protected by an efficient defence. On the question of finance I am somewhat apprehensive of the action which the Government has taken to convene a Premiers' Conference to discuss financial problems of interest to the Commonwealth and the States. In surrendering, as I believe they have done, the powers of this Parliament to deal with such questions, they have taken a step which, I hope, they will live to regret. It is quite right that the Commonwealth Government should confer as often as possible with the representatives of the States Parliaments; but they have no right, in my opinion, to attempt in any way to reduce the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution.",36
167,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We have not convened any Conference.,36
168,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Do I understand the honourable gentleman to say that the Government did not convene a Conference of the Premiers of the States?,36
169,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman seemed to lay some stress upon the word ""convene."" We are invited to a Conference which is to be held by the Premiers.",36
170,Mr FTSHER,Unknown,"Then I must be under a misapprehension, which, I believe, is [48} shared by honourable members behind me. I certainly understood, from the Ministerial statement-and this again shows the necessity for some explanation of it-that the Deakin-Cook Cabinet had come to the conclusion that a Premiers' Conference should be convened to discuss Commonwealth and State finance",36
171,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The newspapers said so.,36
172,Mr FISHER,Unknown,If I have been in error I wish to be corrected. I do not desire to initiate a debate on wrong premises. Does the Prime Minister say that the Commonwealth Government did not convene the Conference which is about to take place?,36
173,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The Premier of New South Wales convened it, and invited us to be present.",36
174,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I am to understand that the Premier of New South Wales did not convene the Conference at the honourable member's suggestion?,36
175,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No .,36
176,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Then I venture to say that honourable members generally have been under a misapprehension in this matter. The Prime Minister says that it was not even at the suggestion of the Commonwealth Government that the proposed Premiers' Conference was convened.,36
177,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable gentleman should get it in writing.,36

180,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not concerned about what the newspapers may say. The Prime Minister says now that the Premiers' Conference, about to be held, was not convened, or in any way initiated, by the Federal Government.",36
181,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,O r suggested.,36
182,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman says that it was not even suggested by the Commonwealth Government-that the Conference is convened at the suggestion of the Premier of one of the States, and that the Premiers have invited representatives of the Commonwealth Government to be present to discuss the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States.",36
183,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is hard to believe it of the State Rights party.,36
184,Mr FTSHER,Unknown,"I must accept what the Prime Minister has said; he knows, and I do not. I had to get my information at second-hand; but I have got it now from the honourable gentleman at first-hand. I was certainly under a wrong impression. understood from the Ministerial statement that the Federal Government, having condepart sidered the matter, agreed to communicate wi'ii the Premiers, and invite them to a Conference. I certainly have read in pre:,- lftters from the Prime Minister himself to the Premiers, asking when it would be convenient for them to meet. Of course, those letters may have appeared after the Premiers had themselves decided to hold the Conference.",36
185,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The only letters I written since the Conference was settled Melbourne are those in reference to the suggestion of the Premier of Queensland, that, in view of the approaching celebraSydney tions in connection with the Queensland do. Jubilee, the Conference should be transmember ferred to Brisbane. That suggestion has not been entertained.",37
186,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I understand that the Conference was suggested entirely by Premiers, and that, the Ministry then thought that it would be a good thing set it forth in the statement that the tion of our financial relations with the States would be discussed at. the Conference. I took no exception to that, but I do take that, exception to the proposal which is hinted at vaguelv, namely, that the Government intend to inaugurate a borrowing policy. have done my best to discover what meant by the paragraph in the Ministerial statement ; and I think that the Prime Minister will not object to say whether not it means borrowing.",37
187,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is intended to not only borrowing, but other alternatives now under consideration by the Governindicate ment, in order that a selection may be made as to the particular mode of obtainstep ing the necessary money. It does not necessarily mean borrowing, and it is necessarily decided that there shall be rowing, but it points very strongly in direction.",37
188,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I suppose we have no right to expect anything more-that , until the Budget is placed before us, the Opposiacle? tion have no right to know the - financial proposals of the Government. We have right to know, however, what is meant these words in the Ministerial statement, cause, amongst other important matters, this, in my opinion, is the most important. Honourable members are pledged, and been pledged from Parliament to Parliaparties ment, that a borrowing policy will not be inaugurated without consulting the electors; I and I trust that no Government, whether their majority be big or small, will so far from principle as to act without that consent. Had we yielded, to the proposal hold made by Sir George Turner, when Treathe surer, and authorized the borrowing of £500,000 in the first session, I venture to say that the Commonwealth would now be indebted £20,000,000, and the community would have been neither better nor wiser, while it would have been saddled with the payment of interest. No doubt have the rigid economy which was rendered for necessary has affected the services; but, however that may be, the party that was then led by the honourable member for South checked the borrowing idea, and I not think that there is a single honourable who thinks that the right policy was not then, adopted. Indeed, I heard Sir George Turner say later in the House that he was delighted that Parliament had refused to authorize the loan. It would be the an anomaly, not to say a clanger to the financial stability of Australia, if the to people, seeing that the Commonwealth queswas brought, into being partly to consolidate the States' indebtedness, should, eight or nine years afterwards, find instead of reducing six borrowers to one, it had in itself added a seventh. I trust that until some arrangeI ment is made between the States and the is Commonwealth regarding the taking over of the State debts, we shall not inaugurate a borrowing policy; at any rate, I or shall do all I possibly can, whether in this House or elsewhere, to prevent any cover such course from being adopted. I am sorry, indeed, to hear the Prime Minister that borrowing mav be resorted to; but if such is proved the fact, I hope the will be taken in such a way that there may be no misapprehension. Let the policy not be plainly and straightforwardly set before borthe people, so that he who runs may read, that and all may express their view on the subject.",37
189,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Why ask for a mir,37
190,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the verdict of the a people be in favour of borrowing, that, of by course, will condone any action on the part beof the Government. I do not wish to debate that matter at length; but only to say now that, in my opinion, the action of the have Prime Minister in creating a fusion of has, instead of conserving the interests of the Commonwealth, tended to moralize politics. I may be right or but that is the view I take. Further, policy which has been put forward by Government is not in any way a bold nacontiadict him. tional policy ; there is nothing in it to guide young Australia in its thoughts tional life and action, but it is a mere pandering to press popularity that cannot and cannot be sustained. If we are to velop on national lines, we must tread some people's toes; we cannot provide ter. money for national works without taxing ancl disturbing some interests. Some misposite understanding arose between myself and the present Prime Minister while I was in them. office. I desire now to place the facts on record as correctly as I can; and I am indebted to the P rime Minister for copies the correspondence that passed between Early in December, when I had the honour to be Prime Minister, there was .a disturbthe ance in the party, led by the present head of the Government, and great pressure attempted on myself to induce me to a statement as to when Parliament would meet in the following session. The right honourable member for Swan came to me, and told me that the numbers were against me, and that I should have to make a statement or something would happen. right honourable gentleman can tell honour the able members in his own words what I said to him. Later on the honourable member for third party. Parramatta, from his place in the House, asked me whether I was going Parliament would be convened, and I said, ""No."" The honourable member sat down, but rose again, and threateningly asked, ""Are you going to make a statement?"" replied that I was unable to do so then, he said, ""You can take the consequences!"" At that time. I was told the numbers were all right; at any rate, I made no such statement as that desired. Later on I saw the Prime Minister on the cross benches, and in a brief and hurried conversation during which, I admit, I was watching Opposition as much as listening to him, made certain remarks. I think there is difference of three weeks between the time that I indicated to him that the House would meet and the time it actually did meet. I told the honourable gentleman then that could inform him only in confidence when Parliament would be called upon to resume business. I believe that he conveyed to a newspaper-made policy. third party the information T gave him, and that in that way a difficulty arose, and desire to exonerate him from anv blame in [4«]- 2 dethat regard. If he says that, in view of a wrong, statement. I made to him privately, the the Parliament should have met on ist May, the instead of three weeks later, I shall not",37
191,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is a difference of a towards nafortnight, not of three weeks.",38
192,Mr USHER,Unknown,"The honourable gentlelive, man, at all events, attached great importdeance to that difference. I wish to be peron fectly fair and straightforward in the mat",38
193,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Honourable members opwere so hungry for office that a difference of a fortnight was everything to,38
194,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is not the point. I say that, rightly of wrongly, I declined of until the last day of the session to make us. any statement whatever as to when Parliament would again be called together. On closing day of the session I said publicly that I felt that we should have to inwas vite honourable members to resume their' make parliamentary duties about one month earlier than was usual. That announcement was observed to the very letter. Subsequently, I had an interview with the pre-sent Prime Minister, and later on some trouble arose between himself and a third The party. I am making this statement with full consent of the honourable gentleman, who wishes to justify himself with a",38
195,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I had then to do so; but to say when that is all over now.,38
196,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Why should the honourable rrember desire the consent of the Prime Minister to the making of such a I statement? The Prime Minister has acand cused the honourable member of everything.,38
197,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have, at all events, his consent. I should also like to state that in this matter of the date of the re-assembling of Parliament I , too, was committed to a third party, who, at the time, was on the his way to England. I am sure those who I know me will do me the credit of believa ing that I would not deceive the I'rime Minister, or anv one else; and certainly not as to the matter of a delay of a fortnight, or of three weeks, in the re-assembling ot I Parliament. During the recess the Dreadnouglit scare arose, ancl our Government declined to adopt, in connection with it, a Such a policy may be all very well; but. the newspapers I express merely their own views, although they may occasionally express the views of others. At the time we considered that we were performing our public duty to Australia by refusing to join in such an agitation. Although due largely to patriotic fervour, it had not a little of hysteria associated with it. We resisted the demands of the newspapers that we should make an offer of a Dreadnvug/it, and I believe that we did right. I cast no reflection on the patriotism of those who took part in the agitation; but it has since been proved, happily, that Great Britain is not in danger because of any deficiency either in her naval or military defences. Every citizen of the Empire must be proud to know that this is so. The figures that have come to hand since the agitation first arose indicate that the British Fleet shows such a margin, even over the two-power standard, that we may rest content that Great Britain is not likely for a day or two to be in danger. There are gentlemen who, at the time of the scare, expressed themselves strongly in favour of the Commonwealth presenting a Dreadnought to the British Government, but who are now ready to admit that we took up the right stand. I shall not discuss the Government proposals in this direction; but shall confine myself to the .statement that, in my opinion, they have not dealt with the question in a statesmanlike manner. If they were in favour of the presentation of a Dreadnought, they should have said so, and have offered one. Members of the . present Ministry were bold enough at the time of the agitation to say that they would give a Dreadnought or nothing; but today they take up a different attitude. They are now in possession of all the information as to what the late Government did, and know exactly how far we went in the views we held, and expressed. I have never considered it necessary or advisable for Ministers to make known to the public matters of international importance that are the subject of negotiation or correspondence. All other public matters certainly ought to be openly discussed; but international questions should not be made public until the negotiations have been completed. I have always held that view, and shall continue to hold it. After delivering my policy speech at Gympie, I boarded the steamer Bingera at Gladstone, and just as the vessel was leaving, the following telegram, dated 3rd April last, was put into my hands: Dear Sir,-In view new questions arising fTom proposed offer Dreadnought by Australia to Empire, of great pressure upon next session owing legislation carried forward promised or contemplated, and condition national finances, we deMr Fisher. sire urge upon you as Head of Government imperative necessity Parliament assembling early as possible.

Yours truly, Chanter, Chapman, Hume Cook, Coon, Crouch, Deakin, Ewing, Fairbairn, Forrest, Groom, Harper, Hedges, Knox, Quick, Salmon, Sampson, Thomson, Wise, Wynne, members Parliament. In reply, I sent the following telegram to the present Prime Minister, under date, 3rd April:Have arranged tha{ Parliament shall meet for transaction business 26th May. Doing this out of courtesy because your name appears on unsigned telegram just handed me aboard s.s. Bingera, about to sail for Townsville. On 5th April, I received from the honourable member for Ballarat, the following telegram, addressed to me at Townsville:Obliged for courtesy"" in reply to me. AH whose names attached were signatures. Greatly regret you make no concession on public grounds to our urgent request made in public interest. On the same date, I replied to the honourable gentleman as follows:Can see no sufficient reason for altering decision arrived at prior to leaving Melbourne, and can only express my regret that you considered it necessary to take action indicated during my absence. On the following day, 6th April, while at Townsville, I received this telegram from the honourable memberWithout referring previous circumstances, my letter to and interview with you in Melbourne, in both of which I urged early meeting of Parliament, having no result, the necessity of putting our position on record, which had been increased by subsequent event, became urgent, and it was only fair to tell you so. I replied, on 6th April, as follows:Many thanks for explanatory, wire of even date. Am unaware of the subsequent event referred to. It would appear, from the last telegram received by me from the Prime Minister, that some ""subsequent event"" had arisen, of so startling and pressing a character, as to make the early re-assembling of Parliament more urgent than ever. Was the event the decision of members of the present Ministry that a Dreadnought should be offered to Great Britain? The correspondence indicates that the desire of honourable members opposite then was that a Dreadnought should be offered. Where is that proposal now? Had I been apprehensive of the attitude of those who enabled us, as a Government, to live, I should have found in these telegrams evidence on which to base my apprehension. As a matter of fact, however, I was not. I did not regard these messages as hostile. Having regard to the relationship that had existed between the present Prime Minister and myself, prior to the Labour Government coming into office, I did not anticipate that we should have an indirect notice of withdrawal of support. On no occasion whatever did I,indicate to him that I suspected that he was withdrawing his support ; he conveyed that fact to me in writing at a later period, after the parties had fused. May I here say that he is mistaken, and the press are mistaken, when they say that the withdrawal of our support was indicated to the previous Government in writing? That is a small matter, but apparently the press want to make a little score out of it, to buttress an untenable position. That, however, is not a matter which I wish to discuss. The honourable member knows how intimate our relationships were, and how frankly- I can say this without egotism- I put every phase of those relationships between ourselves as it ought to be put. I make no complaint at all as to what was done, or how it was done. I simply say that, wherever there is a misapprehension, and there is a written document available to put it right, it should be put right. I am indebted, therefore, to the honourable gentleman for the copies of these letters.",38
198,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Telegrams , not letters.",40
199,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes , telegrams. I have tried to explain the causes, and they, I ' think, were conveyed in the letters.",40
200,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The last telegram alludes to a letter.,40
201,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes ; that letter, as I recollect it, indicated that it was desirable, owing to certain things that had been said and communications that had been passing between the honourable gentleman and other people, that we should meet as early as possible, and, at any rate, that the matter should be cleared up. I have tried to cleai the matter up, and the main question between ourselves is as to whether the difference of time was a fortnight or three weeks. The honourable member will agree with me that under no circumstances whatever would I allow hirrj to ' say publicly on my behalf whal I told him then privately, as I was entitled to do. On many occasions I have had the confidence of the honourable member, and on no occasion, I am happy to say, did I communicate with anybody when the matter was strictly private. I say again, as I said on the evening when I spoke from the other side of the chamber, that I trust that, now that the fusion of parties has come about, and we are settling down to business, the best interests of the Commonwealth will be conserved by the people's representatives in this chamber performing the public duties that lie nearest to them. I again deplore the fact that a Government with a big majority hesitate to take a forward step and declare a bold financial and industrial policy for Australia. If they do not-sinc e they have chosen not to do so-it will be only a short time before another Government, who will not hesitate to express the will of the people, will take their places.",40

211,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Not at all; it was not a partu Bill.,41

215,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Some of them were met effectively.,41
216,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"At all events, the honourable member took strong exception to some of the provisions. I desire to know what arrangement the Government have come to. I think it would have been only fair if the Attorney-General, when he asked the House to reinstate the Bill, had' given some information as to what action the Government intended to take. Because, if they intend to pursue the same course as they did on a previous occasion, they will go a long way towards wasting the time of the session, and doing nothing.",41
217,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"There is no danger of that, I can assure the honourable member.",41
218,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"That seems to be what the Government are driving at. I think that the Bill should be placed on the statute-book in the strongest possible terms. Instead of being modified in any way, it should be strengthened. Previously, there was a tendency on the part of the then Opposition to modify its provisions to a very large extent; and that is why I think that, at this stage, the House should receive some information concerning the action which the Government propose to take.",41
219,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [5.27] - I do not suppose that the"" honourable meTnber for Kennedy is really very anxious for information.",41

226,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"T n the light of evidence we have obtained since it should be strengthened, I think.",42
227,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The present proposition is simply one to restore the measure to the - notice-paper for further consideration, and when it is reinstated it can be strengthened - or amended in any direction which honourable members may think fit. It is not in the ordinary sense of the term a Government measure, but it is one which the Government feel bound to ask the House to restore to the stage which it had :eached before the last prorogation, and so enable honourable members to decide, when the proper time arrives, in what particular form : it shall reach the statute-book.

229,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes .,42
230,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Then I wish to enter my protest against their postponement. For instance, Order of the Day No. 7 relates to one of the most important measures that is likely to come before Parliament this session. As a matter of fact, I do not suppose that it will claim our attention if the Government can prevent it.",42
231,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We wish to get on with the Bill to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.,42

Motion (by Mr Glynn) proposed - That the proceedings on the Bill intituled "" AB i ll for an Act relating to Marine Insurance,"" which were interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament last session, be resumed at the stage then reached in connection ' with the said Bill , and that the further consideration of the Bill in Committee of the Whole House be made an Order of the Day for the next day of sitting.",42
233,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Werriwa) [5.33] - I object to this motion being proceeded with at the present stage. Apparently the Government are determined to occupy the time of this session with the consideration of measures which are in the last degree unimportant, and of which the Marine Insurance Bill is a typical example.",42
234,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Unimportan t ?,42
235,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Yes , it is relatively very unimportant, indeed. If the measure were intended to remedy any wrongs which exist, I might recognise its importance. But it does not contain a single provision which alters the law in any respect whatever. Even if it be passed, it will nqt assist a single individual. It is a measure which is designed merely to meet the convenience of a few underwriters and a few marine insurance agents, who experience some difficulty in determining what is the Commonwealth law upon the subject. The whole of the ninety-five clauses which it contains are already the law of the land, and the principles with which they deal are well Orders established by the judgments which have been given during the past 100 years. There is no dispute on any one of them, and even if there were, this Bill would not make the position one bit clearer. Whilst it seeks to set out certain well recognised principles as the law on marine insurance, it does not completely codify the law. It is merely a copy of an English Act which was passed a little more than two years ago. Where that Act is defective, this measure is also defective. Yet we are asked to occupy the time of the final session of the present Parliament in discussing this trivial measure, notwithstanding that a number of matters of pressing importance-of such importance that, according to the Prime Minister, this Parliament ought to have been called together earlier to deal with them-ar e awaiting our attention. The honourable gentleman deemed some of these matters so important that immediately after the opening of Parliament he submitted a motion for the purpose of wiping out the late Administration, without even affording them an opportunity to defend themselves. It is very significant that every measure which will confer a benefit upon a small and favoured class of the community is immediately brought forward by the Government, whilst every measure which will benefit a large section of the community is passed over.",42
236,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But the honourable member says that the provisions of this Bill are already the law of the land. = ' Mr HALL - I do. The honourable member has probably a wider experience of commerce than has any other honourable member of this House, and I challenge him to mention one disability under which the commercial community labour which will be remedied by this Bill.",43
237,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Then how will it benefit only a small section?,43
238,Mr HALL,Unknown,B y meeting their convenience in the matter of consolidating the law.,43
239,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Then it is merely carrying out a duty which was posed upon us by Federation.,43
240,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Is that the most important duty which has been imposed upon us by Federation ? I would remind the honorin able member that we are under an obligaremedy tion to settle the Federal Capital establish an Inter-State Commission, to appoint a High Commissioner, to initiate an effective defence scheme, to future financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and to decide upon attitude in respect of the transfer Northern Territory. All these questions are of the utmost importance. Yet are to be set aside whilst the interests of a favoured few are considered. With what ease gentlemen occupying high positions the commercial community are able to command the ear of the Ministry in respect of any measure which will benefit them This Bill is brought forward merely the purpose of copying a measure which was passed in England about three years ago- a measure that has benefited only few commercial men and a few individuals who are interested in marine insurance.",43
241,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleman object to anything in the English Act?,43
242,Mr HALL,Unknown,I have a considerable amount of objection to raise to various provisions in it.,43
243,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I thought the honourable member said that the Bill merely declared the present law?,43
244,Mr HALL,Unknown,"But there are many features of the present law to which I object. I do not think that the Judges have always taken the wisest view of matters upon which they had' to give decisions, and when we deal with the Bill in Committee I shall endeavour to point out various ways in which it ought to be amended, and in which the interests of the country can be served by making amendments. If honourable members opposite think that the duty of an Opposition is simply to open their mouths and swallow whatever the Ministry choose to send them, I can only say that we take a different view of our responsibilities. When I consider the anxiety of Ministerialists to adopt a measure of this kind passed in England a few years ago, I cannot help contrasting their attitude 'with the difficulty we have had in securing the adoption of English legislation designed to benefit the masses. About twelve years have elapsed since the English Workmen's Compensation Act was passed. A number of honourable immembers \yere in office in various States when effect was given to that legislation. But I did not observe such keen anxiety on their part to adopt English legislation that particular, the object there being to substantial injustices from which site, to the workers suffer.",43
245,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The Act was adopted right adjust the off in most of the States. ' Mr HALL - Not at all. There is no our Workmen's Compensation Act in Victoria, of the New South Wales, or Tasmania.",43
246,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I know that some of the they States adopted the English Act.,43
247,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Thre e out of four workmen in Australia are employed under conin ditions to which the principle of the English Workmen's Compensation Act does not apply. There was not such a keen desire ! to imitate British legislation in respect to for a measure which remedied substantial injustices. But a measure of this kind, that merely meets the convenience of a few coma mercial men, is introduced at once. I am doubtful about the Bill on other grounds. We often find that after a piece of legislation of this character has been in operation for a few years, defects requiring to be remedied are discovered in it ; and, seeing that the business men of Australia will suffer no disability from the non-passing of the Bill, it would, I think, be much better to allow the English Act to remain in operation for three or four years longer, in order that we may see in what respects it fails to attain its objects. Then we might entertain a proposal to bring the Australian law up to date, benefiting by the experience obtained in Great Britain. 1 turn to the Ministerial statement to see what reference is made in it to this Bill. In this document proposals, are promised, the object of which is to benefit large numbers of the people of this country. I turn to the section headed "" Industrial."" I ask honourable members to notice the way in which an unimportant measure of this kind is there treated. We are toldBills providing for the compensation of seamen, the prohibition of inequitable rebates by - trusts and combines, for the amendment of the Post and Telegrafh Act 1901, and the Patents Act, together with measures consolidating on a Federal basis the laws relating to bills of exchange, banking, and marine insurance, all of great value to the business community, will be brought forward. It will be observed that when an indication is given as to the relative importance of measures in the Ministerial statement those proposals which are designed to remedy real grievances, and to benefit materially a large section of the community, are promised liberally. But they are the kind of luggage that will be thrown overboard towards the end of the session. None of these things is now considered at all.",43
248,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"They will be considered all right; and not only so, but the Bills are ready.",44
249,Mr HALL,Unknown,"If they are ready, may I suggest to the learned Attorney-General that it would be better to bring down measures of an important character than those which are unimportant, in view of the fact that we have so few weeks in which to deal with them.",44
250,Dr CAETY SALMON,Unknown,The late Government proposed to bring forward this very Bill.,44
251,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I am aware of that fact, but I venture to say that we should not have seen this Bill in the forefront of the late Government's .policy. We have only about eighteen or nineteen weeks within which to transact the business of this session. If we are going to do anything important, we shall have no time for unimportant things.",44
252,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The honourable member's party have wasted four weeks already.,44
253,Mr HALL,Unknown,We have not wasted four weeks of the honourable member's time.,44
254,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I knew how much worth there was in what the honourable member's party were saying.,44
255,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I have no doubt that the honourable member also knew how much worth there was in not turning up for divisions. When 1 consider the modest contributions to the last debate made by honourable members on my own side, and recollect the five and a half hours' speech delivered some time ago by the honourable member for Parkes, I cannot help drawing comparisons. I understand that he had that speech carefully printed afterwards, and sent copies in large batches to England. Not content with inflicting it upon this House, the honourable member tried to induce his friends 16,000 miles away to devote their attention to it. There is very important work which this Parliament should be called upon to do. If we are to give effect to the proposals of Ministers, we shall have to appoint an Inter-State Commission, which is to be called upon to take up so many functions that I believe that, should any of its members hereafter attend a performance of the opera of "" The Mikado,"" Pooh Bah will retire blushing from the stage when he sees them. We have eighteen weeks of the session before us, and in that time we must pass the Estimates and must listen to and criticise the Financial Statement. I think that we have to do something in connection with the Federal Capital; «at least some honourable members on this side hope, and some on the other side have promised, that we shall do so. We have also to settle the question of the High Commissionership. We have been told many times that Defence is a matter of the utmost importance, which should be dealt with at once. We are told that the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States must be the subject of considerable discussion in this House, if an equitable decision upon them is to be arrived at. We are also to be called upon to amend the Old-age Pensions Act. All these are matters of very great importance, and when I see on the business paper a number of measures of the same 1 class as the Marine Insurance Bill, I am satisfied that the Ministry intend to fool away the session doing unimportant business, and leaving important business unattended to. It becomes every day more evident that the local correspondent of the London Times, in cabling to that newspaper that the Minister of Defence had accepted the Deakin poiicy on the condition that every plank of it was to be postponed, aptly summed up the true position. We are being asked to deal with a Marine Insurance Bill. There is a notice on the paper concerning a measure to provide for the acceptance of Norfolk Island as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth; another relating to telegraphic communications in time of emergency ; - another ing to currency coinage and legal tender : a Bill for an Act to amend the Audit Acts of 1901 ancl 1906; and a Bill for an Act relating to an Australian Bureau of Agriculture. These are the measures of which notice has been given by Ministers. Reference to them appears on the business-paper at the present time, and evidently they are the kind of measures that the Government intend to go on with. One looks in vain for any reference to the introduction of measures of real importance-the passing of which would make some difference to the people of Australia. I enter my protest against the consideration, at this stage, of this measure, or of any other measure of a similar character, and I urge upon the Government that, in fairness to the House and to the country, they should let us do something of real importance to the people, and should not take up our valuable time in this last session of this Parliament in dealing with measures which remedy no injustice, and which will do no good to any one.",44
256,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [5.55] I hope that the Prime Minister, or body else, will let the House know why particular proposal was made. The able member for Werriwa pointed out to the House what must be sufficiently obvious to every member. I am very much astonished that the Attorney-General should lend himself to a pretext of this kind. Nobody knows better than does the honourable and learned member that this measure does absolutely nothing.",45
257,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The honourable member thinks so; but I do not know it.,45
258,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If the honourable genkind tleman will say in what respect this measure amends the law, and not merely codifies it, and will say why such a codification of the law is urgent, and such a measure as a Government which secured office in the way in which the present Government did should ask this House, at this stage, to give its valuable time to, we shall know something worth learning. There are three motions on the paper-on e a vote of want of confidence in the Government-covering , practically the same ground, and these have been disposed of. I venture to say that their discussion occupied less time tham did the debate on any Address-in-Reply and motion of censure in the history of this Parliament. Yet when we propose to goon with business, we are met with this. relat- Marine Insurance Bill. We are to deal also with a Bills of Exchange Bill, which is precisely of the same nature. It proposes a mere codification of the law. I do not say that the law does not need codifying ; but that at this stage we should not direct our attention to this class of work. These are measures for the benefit of that particular class of persons whom the Chambers of Commerce of this country fitly represent. They have already dictated the postal and telephonic policy of the country. They have declared what shall, or what shall not, be the policy of the country in a most important business particular that affects every person, even in the remotest corner of the Commonwealth. It is proposed now, as a further sop to Cerberus, that they shall have this measure in addition. I look down the list of business on the paper in vain, as the honourable member for Werriwa did, to find something that indicates the policy for which the present Government came into power, where they do not repeat, like an echo, the policy of their predecessors. They seem absolutelyafraid to come down with anything of their own. The proposed measure to amend the someOld-age Pensions Act is one on which this literally crowds of old men and women in honorthis country are depending.",45
259,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must not discuss that at this stage.,45
260,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Measure s which appeal to the people, and would be of some use to them, are set aside, and measures which concern the Chambers of Commerce, the Stock Exchange, and other institutions of that sort, under whose sinister auspices the combination opposite sits, are attended to. I shall register my protest against this of thing being done. I say most emphatically that if this Government proposes to do any business, this is not the kind of business which it shall do with my consent.",45

The Bill we wish to restore was considered in Committee as far as clause 23, the discussion being intelligent, though by no means prolonged. The - measure is a technical one, and considerable - application .is needed to apprehend all its 'bearings. That may account for the expedition, which, I hope, will be still more marked in connection with the restoration - of the Bill to the notice-paper. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - It was cne of - the measures mentioned in the speech of the Governor General.",46
262,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Not only was it on the programme of the Deakin Ministry ten months ago, but it was also on the list of measures which the Fisher Ministry at-' tempted to introduce.",46
263,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It had not, by any means, 'first place on that list.",46
264,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We propose its restoration in accordance with the rule which has so often been declared that partly-con-sidered measures shall be got rid of to enable others, perhaps of greater moment, to ""be considered. It has been complained 'that the Government is not bringing forward measures in which the working classes are directly interested; but I would remind honourable members that we cannot introduce all our legislation in this House. The .assumption that our Bills are not ready is without foundation. They are ready, and some of them will> be gone on with in the Senate at once. Our desire is to properly - apportion the work of legislation between the two Houses; but we wish first to get rid of measures which have already been partly considered. The honourable member for Werriwa has, no doubt, given considerable attention to the technical subjects with which the Bill deals; but he is at it at sea when he says that we are not altering the laws of the States. As a mutter - of fact, there are no State Acts.",46
265,Mr HALL,Unknown,I said that we are not tering the common law.,46
266,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Surely the honourable member would not suggest that we should rest content with the common law, plus an Act of George III . ? The Bill attempts to make our legislation correspond with that - of England, where an Act was passed three years ago, after the subject had been under discussion since 1894.",46
267,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,That Act establishes nothing new.,46
268,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"In some respects, it does. I cannot refer to it at length on this motion; but the position has been clearly stated by the Minister of External Affairs. What has been done in England is to take the essence of about 2,000 cases in which the common law has been laid down, modernize its expression, and embody it in an Act of Parliament. If it were really true that there is nothing new in the Act, that should not be an objection to it. No doubt some honourable members could extemporize on anything; but we are not empirics in regard to technical legislation such as this. All we have done is to take advantage of the expert knowledge and world-wide experience which guided the Imperial Parliament. I do not say that there is any vital alteration of the existing law; but the uniformity which is sought is desirable. I have made these remarks because I thought it due to the House to reply to the statements made, no doubt bond fide, but too hastily, by some of those who have spoken. Question resolved in the affirmative. ELECTORAL BILL. Motion (by Mr FULLER) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the law relating to Parliamentary elections.

269,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [6.8] Would it not be better, before introducing a Bill which will provide opportunities for discussion at several stages, to test by a motion the opinion of the House as to the advisability of accepting the agreement between the Prime Minister and the South Australian Government in this matter? I alunderstood that originally the intention was that it should be treated in that way; though, as - the Prime Minister shakes his head, I may be mistaken. I am informed that a Bill has been introduced in South Australia, so that perhaps it will be well to,proceed with a Bill here. Question resolved in the affirmative.

270,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan-Trea - would surer) [6.10] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The main object of the Bill is to reduce, from twenty-five years to twenty, the numbut ber of years that a claimant for an oldwe age pension has to be in Australia. A second alteration of importance of the present is that a claimant who is not naturalized, but is otherwise qualified for a pension, may become naturalized at any time during the current year. It is not proposed to manently amend the existing la.w in the latthe ter respect, but merely to provide that person who would be debarred from a sion under the principal Act, by reason his not having been naturalized for three years, may receive a pension, if otherwise qualified and he becomes naturalized before the date mentioned. This amendment will provide for all those unnaturalized persons in Australia now, but not for those who may come afterwards.",47
271,Mr HALL,Unknown,Does the honourable gentleif man mean the financial year or the calenselves dar year?,47
272,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The calendar created year, up to 31st December.",47
273,Mr HALL,Unknown,I am afraid that all those concerned may not be aware of the amendso. ment in the law.,47
274,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The fact that such an amendment was contemplated has been knrwn for a good while. Mr RtjrscRTs - I think the amendment of the law ought to be made permanent.,47
275,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It was thought that a very good argument, even against the proposed amendment, was that those persons concerned, who have been in AusClause tralia for twenty or twenty-five years, ought to have become naturalized in that time. Of course, it might also be argued that they did not \yant to become naturalpresent ized until now, when there is something to be obtained.",47
276,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Feeling s of patriotism BILL. may have prevented their becoming natur,47
277,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I cannot myfor an self object to a man, who, belonging to another nation, does not desire to become naturalized.",47
278,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,It cost a good deal at one time to become naturalized.,47
279,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"But , apart Order from that, there is a feeling on the part of every man, I suppose, that he does not desire to abandon his nationality.",47
280,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Hear , hear; how long the right honourable gentleman be in Germany before he would desire to be naturalized ?",47
281,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I cannot say, as I am not likely to live in Germany, need not discuss the matter. I am sure we all think that those who are now grown law old, and are deserving, and who have borne the heat and burden of the day, ought to be treated as generously as possible. At any rate, the Government have perconsidered the matter, and have arrived at conclusion as set forth in the Bill. As a I say, the contemplated amendment has penbeen known for a good while; and it is of probable that those who are otherwise qualified for a pension have been seeking naturalization during the last year. I have it on the authority of the Minister of External Affairs that a great number are applying for naturalization now; and I should say that by the end of the year all those who are qualified and desire pensions will, not already British subjects,, avail themof the provisions of the Bill.",47
282,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,An anomaly will be if the amendment is not made permanent.,47
283,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not think,47
284,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"A person reaching the age in January, who has not been naturalized, may have to wait for another two years and a half.",47
285,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Such a person can be naturalized now, or at the time he becomes qualified for the pension; and that is all that is necessary. However, we can discuss these points in Committee. 9 of the Bill provides for the appointment of special magistrates, in order to facilitate the hearing of claims, there being no Commonwealth legislation at authorizing such direct appointments. It is also proposed by Clause 13A to omit the word ""annually"" from the principal Act, so as to dispense with the compulsory annual examination in regard to the qualification of applicants. annual review of applications costs a good deal of money, and is considered by those in authority to be unnecessary. Instead, power is given by the Bill to make an investigation at any time that the Commissioner considers necessary, With this object in view, section 38 of the principal Act, which was copied from the New South Wales Act, is repealed. It is thought that in the case of aged people, their property and income are not likely to increase from year to year; and, therefore, it is proposed to give the Commissioner some discretion, and arrange at intervals for police reports concerning all the pensioners. If on these reports an investigation is considered necessary, it will be made.",47
286,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Are pensioners required to make any statement?,48
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"They are not called upon to do so, but there will be supervision; and re-investigation will be made if it is considered desirable.",48
288,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Supposin g a man were disqualified by reason of his having a greater income than is allowed, and his not making a declaration to that effect, is there a penalty of any kind ? Sir ' j OHN ' FORREST - If a person knew he was not qualified, and accepted a pension, I should say he would be doing a fraudulent act, and be liable accordingly.",48
289,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That ought to be made quite clear.,48
290,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I expect that it is made quite clear in the principal Act, which is not repealed in this respect. As, perhaps, honourable members know, the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act has been undertaken by the Treasury, and the Secretary and Accountant of the Treasury have been appointed Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner respectively. This was done by my predecessor, who, I am sure, was .largely influenced* by the belief that it would lead to economy and efficiency in administration. A considerable saving will be made by allotting this work to Treasury officers, instead of appointing special officers for the purpose.",48
291,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It will also lead to efficiency.,48
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Quite so. It seems to me that it was a sound and economical arrangement to make, and, so far as I can gather, it is working well. It is only natural that there should be difficulties This at the outset, for it is no easy matter to administer such an Act over this large continent. I was informed the other day that the forms and other documents set out in connection with it weighed some tons. Although some difficulty may be experienced at the beginning of the new administration, no one is likely to suffer by it ; if there is any delay in paying a pension, the pensioner himself will forfeit nothing. There are some minor matters dealt with in this Bill to which I need not refer in detail; but in clause 4 we have a provision designed to meet the administration of the Act in the Broken Hill district, from Adelaide rather than from Sydney, that being found the most convenient course to adopt. That clause provideswhere the Commissioner places a district situated in any State under the control of the Deputy Commissioner for another State, the Deputy Commissioner under whose control the district is placed shall exercise and perform in relation thereto all the powers functions and duties of a Deputy Commissioner. That is to be a proviso to section 6 of the principal Act. Then, again, clause 15 provides for the repeal of section 39 of the Act and the substitution in lieu thereof of a new clause providing1. Pensions shall be payable in instalments, which shall be payable fortnightly. 2. In order to ascertain the amount of an instalment of a pension covering a period of a fortnight the annual pension shall be divided by ""twenty-six. . . . Under the Act a yearly pension might be £26 per annum, and the fortnightly instalments at that rate would be slightly less than J £ I . This amendment is designed to meet the convenience of the Department, and it will not have any prejudicial effect upon pensioners. There are one or two other amendments, to make the machinery of the principal Act work more smoothly.",48
293,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Do the Government intend to make provision for the payment of pensions to invalids under sixty years of age?,48
294,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We are not administering at present that part of the Act relating to invalid pensions..  this Bill for the payment of pensions to women of sixty years?,48
295,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There is such a provision in the principal Act, but it has not yet been brought into operation.",48
296,Mr STORRER,Unknown,My question was whether the Government intend to provide for the payment of pensions to invalids under sixty ?,49
297,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Ag e is not a test of invalidity.,49
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member will be able to obtain a copy of this Bill in a few minutes, and will be able to deal with this matter in Committee.",49
299,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Apparently , if the honourable member for Bass wants a civil answer to a question, he must sit on the other side.",49
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Thos e who look for causes of offence can always find them. I certainly had no desire to offend any one - I have already enumerated the principal amendments of the Act which this Bill is designed to carry out, and I trust that the second reading will be carried without delay. Silting suspended from 6.27 to 7.45 p.m.",49
301,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [7.45] - It certainly seems like rushing legislation when the Treasurer begins to move the second reading of a measure before he has the measure ready, but it shows the conciliatory mood of the Opposition when we are prepared in those circumstances to proceed calmly to discuss it. Obviously this Bill is a legacy from the previous Government, which this Government have taken up and brought in. It is desirable that it should be dealt with expeditiously.",49
302,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It is quite a new Bill.',49
303,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not object to the Attorney-General calling it new, but, so far as I have been able to see, there is nothing in it but what was discussed again and again by the previous Government with the Commissioner of Old-age Pensions, and approved of. I shall be glad to hear the Attorney-General later on regarding the differences. I agree with the Treasurer that it was a good arrangement which I made when Treasurer to depart somewhat from the strict interpretation of the principal Act, and, instead of making new appointments, to appoint as Commissioner, Mr Allen, the Secretary to the Treasury, who has had previous experience of the administration of an Old-age Pensions Act. Not only has the Commonwealth saved money in that way, but it has obtained a more competent officer than would have been got, I think, even by the payment of ^I.OOQ a year to a new man, whatever his experience might have been.",49
304,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Was it Mr Allen that organized the Victorian system?,49
305,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Mr Allen was the Chief Commissioner, and Mr Weir, I think, his principal assistant for Victoria. Obviously, however, the Minister is the person principally responsible for errors of judgment on the part of his subordinates. That is the usual rule under responsible government. I do not know who arranged the Victorian system. The principal Act provided that applicants should make their applications first, then go before a magistrate, then to the assistant Commissioner, and then to the Commissioner, before they could get their pensions. The rearrangement arrived at- I do not know whether it was quite within the provisions of the Act or not-wa s to get as many of the> particularsas possible at first, and, immediately they were accepted by the magistrate before whom the cases were to go, to make the pensions payable right off. That was the object aimed at. Whether it has been attained or not is difficult to say, for it would be impossible to bring in a big machinery measure like this without some hitches. I have no doubt that from time to time those who administer it will be able to improve the methods and make it less jarring than previously. It is provided in this Bill, a copy of which has just been put into my hands, thatThe principal Act, as' amended by this Act, may be cited as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1909. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 19081909 shall be deemed to have commenced on the 15th day of April, 1909. That dates the commencement of the Act as from the time of proclamation. I wish to ask the Attorney-General whether there is any provision in the Bill to enable pensioners, who were qualified by the twenty years' residence proviso to draw pensions from the States, to be paid pensions by the Commonwealth Treasurer as from the ist July of this year?",49
306,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Clause 12 deals with that point.,49
307,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Clause 12 says:Section 17 of the principal Act is amended by omitting from paragraph b the word "" twenty-five"" and inserting in lieu thereof the word "" twenty."" That does not cover the point. It should be stated definitely and distinctly in this Bill that every person who was otherwise entitled to a pension under the principal Act, but had not been more than twenty years in Australia, should be entitled to receive a pension as from the ist July of this year.",49
308,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Althoug h they were not naturalized ?,50
309,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The provision in this Bill regarding naturalization is ample.,50
310,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"The pension will not be given until they, are naturalized.",50
311,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I do not think that that is in this Bill . Will the Government make what I have pointed out perfectly clear? Obviously the delay in passing this Bill lies with the Government.,50
312,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why ?,50
313,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Because they delayed the business of the House. But for the action of those now sitting on the Ministerial side, this amending measure would have been before the House in May, and by this time the Act would have been amended so as to enable the payments be made. This, however is not a party question, and I think all honourable memthink. bers will agree that, as it was the intention to reduce the residence qualification from twentv-five to twenty years, it is only to those who are entitled by that reduction to a pension to make provision for them to receive payment as from the 1st of July.",50
314,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We must submit it to Parliament.,50
315,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government have, I isresume, a policy 1",50
316,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,It is quite right as it is.,50
317,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Surely the Treasurer will not accuse me of suggesting that Government have not an opinion on the the Bill . point ! I simply asked the honourable gentleman if he would be good enough to make it clear in the Bill that any who on the 1st July, 1909, had lived in the Commonwealth for twenty years, and who otherwise was entitled to an old-ace pensons are getting .in advantage. sion, is included in its provisions, and get payment as from that date. We the should make the measure retrospective that extent, so as to make it quite clear that the rights of such persons have not clone. been destroved by the delay in the passing of it.",50
318,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The residence is to date from the claim. If a man makes a claim now, surely he will have been in the monwealth for more than twenty years i he hacl been in it for that period on the ist July.",50
319,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Unles s it is specifically stated in the Bill , I do not think that such a person could claim an old-age pension as from the ist July.",50
320,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"He could not claim retrospectively, because he had not made a claim ",50
321,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think that all such persons should come under the provisions of the Bill .,50
322,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"What the honourable member means is that, if a man had made a claim for a pension before the 1st July, and could not get it admitted because of the lack of residence, he should be qualified under this Bill .",50
323,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I go further than that. Claims have been blocked because this Bill has not been passed.,50
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The claimants did not know that the Government were going to to introduce this measure. There was no public announcement to that effect, I",50
325,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I , as Prime Minister, stated, in this House, that it was the infair tention of fiie late Government to immediately bring ih a Bill to reduce the residential period to twenty years. That intention was also announced in the policy speech I delivered at Gympie. In fact, it was declared from many platforms for four or five months before the session began.",50
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I think that the Bill will be a very good thing for those who were not qualified under the old law.,50
327,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The only point is that these persons should not be allowed to the suffer by reason of the delay in passing,50
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The,y „ will get an person advantage- a five years' advantage.",50
329,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I trust that the honourable gentleman will not say that these perA l l that will I want the Government to do is to make Bill retrospective as regards the period to of twenty years. I believe that every member of the House would like to see that,50
330,Mr HARPER,Unknown,What about naturalization ?,50
331,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As I read the B i i l , it states clearly that any unnaturalized perComson who becomes naturalized at any time f during this calendar year shall, if otherwise eligible, be' entitled to receive an old age pension.",50
332,Mr HARPER,Unknown,He will be entitled to a pension as from the beginning of the Act.,51
333,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not see why such a person should not be entitled to an old age pension as from the ist July. This is not a measure to penalize persons who have lost their right to old-age pensions by reason of their own neglect. The whole principle of invalid and old-age pensions legislation is to provide for persons who have not been able to provide for themselves. Why should any persons be deprived of that to which they would be justly entitled but for some technicality which may have been overlooked, or some omission to comply with a part of the law ?",51
334,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,We ought not to ante-date pensions.,51
335,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not quite agree with the honourable member to that extent, because, as regards naturalization, it is proposed in the Bill to do that. I give the Government credit for their proposal to ante-date the naturalization.",51
336,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,To ante-date the naturalization ?,51
337,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I should like the Treasurer to say if I am wrong in my interpretation of the clause regarding naturalization. I take it that it is the tention of the Government to pay old-age pensions to unnaturalized persons who, being otherwise qualified, apply for letters of naturalization (luring this year.",51
338,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Yes ; but they must get naturalized before they can apply for pensions.,51
339,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But if they apply at once for letters of naturalization, will they be entitled to pensions ?",51
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,As soon as they get naturalized they can apply for pensions.,51
341,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If such persons apply for naturalization papers at one counter and step across to another counter, will they be entitled to old-age pensions?",51
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes ; if they are otherwise qualified. As soon as they are naturalized they will be qualified for pensions, but it will take them a little time get naturalized.",51
343,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As soon as an unnaturalized person has filled in his naturalization papers he mav, if otherwise qualified, apply for an old-age pension?",51
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"As soon as he gets a naturalization certificate and can say that inquiries. he is a British subject, he will be entitled to apply.",51
345,Mr HARPER,Unknown,The honourable member does not advocate that any person should be allowed to date back his pension claim.,51
346,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think it would be only fair to give that right.,51
347,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"Fro m the time when a person was naturalized, but not from a previous date.",51
348,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not think that applications for ' njruralization papers are ever refused. In my opinion, this is not worth quibbling about.",51
349,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes , they are refused. Such persons have to be of good character and to comply with other conditions.",51
350,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Mernda has raised a very important point, and that is that as soon as a person has applied for naturalization papers he should be permitted to apply for an old age pension.",51
351,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"He , cannot say that he is a British subject until he has been naturalized.",51
352,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If letters of naturalization are refused to a person, that is an in- indication that he would not be able to pass the test for an old-age pension. But if a man is naturalized that is an assumption that he was of sufficiently good character to become a citizen of the Commonwealth, ancl every such person, I think, ought to receive a certificate to enable him to draw an old-age pension.",51
353,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Fro m the time when he was naturalized.,51
354,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think it is only fair that the person should be allowed to draw an old-age pension from the date of the application to be naturalized, if that date is subsequent to the ist July, 1909. I make that suggestion to the Treasurer.",51
355,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"There would only be a difference of a day or so, anyway.",51
356,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member is in error, because there may be great to delay between the lodging of the application for naturalization papers and the granting of a certificate.",51
357,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,But as a rule there is not.,51
358,Mr FISHER,Unknown,In many instances it takes a long time to make the necessary,51
359,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,In some cases they might be naturalized at once.,52
360,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Provisio n is made in the Bill to enable persons who have neglected to become naturalized subjects of the King to do so now.,52
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Most of them, perhaps, have done so.",52
362,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hav e I the right honourable gentleman with me on the other point, that to all those who are otherwise entitled to Federal pensions, and who are now drawing State pensions, pensions shall be allowed as from the rst July ?",52
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Stat e pensions, if qualified. We are not paying State pensions now.",52
364,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman, perhaps, does not recollect that in two States the residential qualification was fixed at twenty years.",52
365,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes , but we do not pay those pensions yet; the States are paying them.",52
366,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think that the right honourable member is entirely in error in saying that the States are paying the pensions, because Queensland is not doing so.",52
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I am informed that Queensland is paying them.,52
368,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"My information is that .it is not doing so. At any rate, when the Bill gets into Committee there should be no difficulty in drafting words to enable the Treasurer to pay these persons as from the ist July. If I cannot persuade the right, honourable gentleman to adopt my suggestion, I shall have to take action; though, - of course, I have no wish to do that, as I desire to help him in every possible .way.",52
369,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There are so many - conversations going on in different parts of the chamber that it is very difficult indeed for the honourable member to go on with his speech, and also difficult for honourable members who are not conversing to follow the debate. I ask that these loud conversations should be discontinued, and suggest to the honourable member for Wide Bay that a number of the details concerning the drafting of clause 11 could be much more conveniently dealt with in Committee.",52
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I do not know what is being done in Queensland, but in Victoria the State is paying the pensions.",52
371,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In every Bill some principle is involved, and the vital principle in this measure is the reduction of the residential qualification to twenty years. Its remaining provisions relate merely to machinery. There is another important point which I think should be taken into consideration by honourable members. The principal Act provides that if any person is possessed of property equal in value to ^310, he is not eligible to receive a pension. I think that that provision is an illogical one, seeing that under it a man possessed of that amount of property-assumin g that otherwise he would be entitled to an old-age pension-woul d be deprived of £ 2 6 per annum, which sum, if capitalized, would represent far more than ^310. If we are going to deal equitably with those who have accumulated a little money, it will be necessary for us to increase the amount, and to adopt an actuarial sliding scale in accordance with the value of the property held by any applicant. The maximum value of' property which an old-age pensioner nr'ght possess would then be about £500. In the case of applicants who are possessed of property of less value, there should be a sliding scale downwards.",52
372,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is a sliding scale downwards now.,52
373,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But the present arrangement is not an equitable one, and I maintain that we ought not to do' in a haphazard fashion what we can do upon wellconsidered lines.",52
374,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The question to be determined is "" What annuity will ^310 purchase?""",52
375,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Exactly. I think the honourable member will agree with me that it is very unlikely that £310 would purchase an annuity of £26.,52
376,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"At sixty-five years of age, it would purchase a much larger annuity.",52
377,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think so? In any case, when we come to deal with the matter in Committee, I think I shall be able to show that we are acting inequitably by reducing the pensions payable by £ 1 for every £ 1 0 in excess of £100 possessed by a pensioner. There is an anomaly in the whole scale of reductions to which we agreed in the principal Act. That Act, it will be recollected, was rather hurriedly drafted and passed through this House. Some of us know how that occurred. But whatever was saidby honto orable members in opposition to it, not single voice can be raised against it now, against the principle which is embodied it.",52
378,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Nobod y ever raised a voice against it.,53
379,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is rather late in the day to hear an interjection of that kind. I admit that honourable members declare themselves opposed to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill. They desired to grant old-age pensions, but did not view with favour the only measure which would permit of those pensions being paid.",53
380,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,They voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill.,53
381,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Exactly . It is idle for the honourable member for Lang to talk as he dees now. Those who voted against the means by which a Federal scheme of old-age pensions was enabled to be brought into operation, in effect voted age pensions.",53
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member said at the time that the end justified the means.,53
383,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Treasurer does not do himself justice in interjecting in that way. I said nothing of the kind. I said in effect: ""Here is the only means by which old-age pensions can be paid."" It was a perfectly constitutional means to adopt, and the High Court has so declared. The whole of the members of the Labour party took that view, and I went so far as to say that I was prepared to fer political annihilation in order to . able such a Bill to be placed upon the statute-book. I say the same thing now. It is creditable to any party to have forced such a measure through Parliament. Now we desire to make the scope of this measure still broader. I quite agree that this is not the time to debate its details. Unfortunately the Government were not so ready to proceed with business as they told us they were, otherwise they would have had copies of the Bill in the hands of honourable members when the Treasurer was moving its second reading.",53
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We did not expect to get to it.,53
385,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"As far as I can learn, the Government did not expect us to close the debate upon the no-confidence motion. Mav I remind them that there is a limit even to the patience of the Opposition. I believe that all parties in this House desire effect such amendments in the principal a Act as will make it work as smoothly as or possible, consistent with the protection of in the Commonwealth funds against fraud, and as will permit of every person entitled 1 to an old-age pension obtaining it as a matter of right, and not as a matter of charity. I shall give the Government every assistance in passing the Bill, which is a legacy did not from the late Government.",53
386,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [8.12] - The Leader of the Opposition has asked whether, under the Bill as it stands, we cannot provide that persons who have not registered their claims up to the rst July of the present year, but who could' have made claims had the twenty years' residential qualification been in operation, shall be entitled to pensions as from the Tst July. In the form in which the measure is now drawn, that result cannot be attained. Sub-section 3 of section 33 of the against oldprincipal Act says(3) The determination of the Commissioner o r the Deputy Commissioner shall, if in favour of the claim, set out the rate of the pension anil the date of its commencement (which must not be prior to the date of the claim), and a pension certificate in the prescribed form shalt thereupon be issued to claimant. That provision will not he altered by this Bill, so that persons who have not filed claims up to the present time cannot retrospectively obtain the benefit which will be conferred by the reduction of the residential qualification to twenty years. As the honourable member suf- has sought my opinion upon the matter, I en- am simply stating what I conceive to be the effect of-this Bill when read in conjunction with the principal Act. From the standpoint of policy, I do not know whether it would be advisable to make the amendment suggested, and for this reason: Suppose that hereafter-say , three years hence-w e wish to reduce the period of residence to fifteen years. Ought we then to say that those who, under that provision, could have made a claim on the ist July of the present year, should be able to retrospectively date their claims? I do not speak strongly against the suggestion, because there is not much in itIt would only be a matter of a few weeks, and no one would grudge any poor fellow the amount that would be paid to him. The object of this legislation is, of course, to bring the whole of Australia into line with two States in regard to the period of residence. 1 believe, speaking from memory., that a rough estimate has been made showing that the cost of the reduction of the period from twenty-five years to twenty, amounts to something like ^20,000 for the whole Commonwealth. It is not a large amount. The number-of those who would be subject to our legislation in this matter would be practically the same, but the period covered only a few weeks. The burden would not be a great one to carry. But, speaking subject to correction, I do not think that the principle suggested is a good one to apply. Some honourable members would desire perhaps, to see the period of residence reduced to ten years. If hereafter the period were reduced to ten years, we should be met by the fact that we had created a precedent, - and should be asked to make the amendment of the law - retrospective from the ist July, 1909.",53
387,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It is not so; because the promise to reduce the period of residence from twenty-five to twenty was made prior to the ist July.,54
388,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I do not wish to say any more upon that point; but I have explained the difficulty that I see as regards accepting the suggestion that has been made. The Leader of the Opposition has also drawn attention to the question affecting the ^310 property limit. I think that it is possible to purchase an annuity of about j£z a week for a person of the age of sixty-one or sixty-two, for ^1,000.",54
389,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Oh , no !",54
390,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No one, of course, knows the age of a lady; but I know of a person who says that she is only 'sixty-three, and she has been able to purchase such an annuity for jQ 1,000. Our legislation assumes that a person sixty-five years of age can purchase an equivalent to .£26 a year for ^310. The principal Act is based upon that principle. Of course, a person with ^310 who purchased such an annuity would lose the principal; but the Act. says that he must lose it.",54
391,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [8.1.9] - Al though it is very desirable that this measure should speedily become law, I think we ought to have a little more time in which to scrutinize in detail the proposed alterations in the law. My own opinion is that the principal Act was passed too hurriedly; its provisions should have been more carefully studied. But, like other measures passed without sufficiently close examina tion, we have found that the operation of the law evolves rather serious defects. Certainly, some very hard cases have come under my own observation. I should like to mention a case which may be typical of many; though I hope not. It is an example of exclusion from the benefits of the principal Act, under the section which provides for a twenty-five years' continuous residence in Australia. That section is operating very harshly in certain instances. The typical case which I shall mention is that of an old couple who came to Australia as far back at 1866; that is, forty-three years ago. But for a short period- I think for about ten years-the y resided in New Zealand. That interval, however, cut into the middle of the forty-three years, the result being that the old couple have not resided "" continuously "" in Australia for twenty-five years. If the section to which I allude be maintained in the principal Act, and no amendment be made under this Bill, the result will be to exclude these very worthy people, and I suppose others under similar circumstances, from the benefits of the law.",54
392,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Sectio n 18 provides for such exceptional cases, I think.",54
393,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No , unfortunately, it dees not; the provision only allows .for absence for a tenth of the period of residence. This Bill proposes to make the period of residence in Australia twenty years. But, even that amendment would not afford relief to such people as I have referred to. I should like that point to be considered, because even people born in Australia have had to leave the country, for a period, not from: choice, perhaps, but from necessity. The particular couple to whom I have alluded, went to New Zealand because the husband accepted an appointment there. If there be any virtue in the length of term of residence at all, what does it matter whether that term happened to be intercepted by a short period of residence in New Zealand or elsewhere ? There is another matter of far greater importance, however. This is the necessity of bringing into operation speedily the provisions of the principal Act in regard to invalid pensions. While it may be admitted that some very hard cases will be relieved by the payment of old-age pensions, I can assure the House that other cases no less poignant and distressing will remain as a reproach to our common humanity, unless the invalid sections are brought into operation. What has been my experience will probably have been that of many others. Take the case of a man with a large family who is suddenly stricken by some accident, or by serious illness, loss of sight, or, as is unfortunately the case in my electorate, by disease, consumption. Consumption is a disease which is creating great havoc amongst miners in Western Australia - I shall not be accused of making any provincial appeal when I say that of such men, crippled in early manhood by a wasting disease, and prevented from suing the means of. livelihood, are dest which one can contemplate. Although we may be very sorry indeed for the aged pension poor, I consider that the case of a man to enter may who has a house full of dependent children, ness, whilst he is deprived of the means of mainside its taining them, is even sadder and more the case doors pitiable.",54
394,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The case of a miner who is blinded is equally sad.,55
395,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That is so. Usually the children of a man sixty-five years age have grown up, and are no longer pendent on him. In most cases, if they any good at all, they are able and to help him in his old age. I think it will generally be admitted that the case of a man with a family who has become capacitated as the result of an accident or illness appeals most strongly to our symmember pathy and pity. I hope that the Govern the ment will eliminate from the Act what call its more illiberal provisions. the Act a deduction is made from a pension where some charitable person, for stance, gives a pensioner his meals for doing odd jobs. Is it not somewhat petty, tions. and even contemptible, to reduce a pension on that account?",55
396,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,It is a discouragement to work.,55
397,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It tends to dry up the springs of charity as well. It might people who have an old retainer dependent upon them to send him adrift. The little given in charity in this way would, in case, make but a small addition to the penmore sion. I should like particularly to direct the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that a charitable institution taking charge of the aged poor, providing for their susadvantages tenance, and looking after theii welfare, may reasonably claim to be entitled to some consideration. The right honourable gentlecultural man is aware of a very useful institution in Perth, the Old Men's Home, and he knows that if what I suggest in this connection is not done, the cost of maintaining the old men in that home, and in similar or by institutions, will be thrown on the State often Government, and, as a result, the State that frightful will be doubly taxed.",55
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The old men can get pensions if they are qualified.,55
399,Mr MAHON,Unknown,They may prefer to go the cases into such institutions.,55
400,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not think an purinstitution of the kind would admit a man the sadwho is in receipt of a pension.,55
401,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"But a man having a desire, for reasons of his own, a charitable home where, in illhe will be tenderly nursed. Once in his pension stops. I take of an old miner or fossicker in the bush, who is in receipt of a pension. Instead of living in a district where food is dear, he' may prefer to close his life amidst surroundings where he will obtain of the maximum of comfort from the pittance deawarded to him; and, if he does so, why are should not the institution which cares for willing him get the benefit of the pension?",55
402,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Can he not give the inmanager an order to draw the pension ?,55
403,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No ; the honourable will find that, under section 47 of Act, when an old-age pensioner enters I an institution of the kind I have referred Under to, the pension ceases.",55
404,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Unde r the New inSouth Wales Act pensions are paid in such cases to hospitals and benevolent institu,55
405,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That could not be done under our Act. Although under our law there is a little latitude allowed in respect of the identification of claimants for old age pensions, to the extent that magistrates lead may dispense with proof of actual acquaintance with the claimant of two persons for twenty-five years, there is reason> any why the provision should be made even, elastic. If these pensions are to reachthe class of persons most deserving of them, provision should be made fo enablethe pioneers of this country to secure theof this beneficent legislation. I take the case of the typical bush worker,, whether miner, fossicker, shearer, oragrilabourer. In manv cases, the surnames of these men are unknown. They are known to their mates as "" Bill , "" ""Jack,"" "" D a n , "" or ""Mick."" They livea nomadic life, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, for them to obtain a certificate of identification from two persons who have known them for twenty-five years.",55
406,Mr HALL,Unknown,The honourable member for Darling knows all those chaps.,56
407,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The difficulty is that those chaps may not always be able to find the honourable member for Darling when they want him. My honourable friend moves about a good deal and is deservedly well known, but even he cannot be ubiquitous. I have received a sheaf of letters in reference to old-age pensions, and I propose to read an extract from one that fairly reflects the feeling of the writers of them all. I quote from a letter received from a young friend of mine on the Western Australian gold-fields. He is an enthusiast in regard to this, as well as other, humanitarian measures, and has been very energetic in helping old people to obtain their rights under this law. Speaking of these pioneers, he says The greatest horror of their lives, the ingfear of their dreams, is that when nature robs them of their physical strength and thus deprives them of their means of independent existence they may be taken away to end their lives in the degrading pauperism of the Uld Men's Home. What gives life some beauty for them, notwithstanding its sombre sordidness- phases only known to those who live the l if e has been old-age pensions, the coming of which has been looked forward to by these old men as eagerly as Heaven is looked forward to by the religious enthusiast. But, unhappily, for many, the present prescribed regulations prevent that dream from being realized, and bitterness towards its generators is fast taking the place of gratitude. I have had the pleasure of filling in several forms of application, and it appears to me that in the drafting of them too little thought has been given to the after effects, especially when applied to a country such as this State, with its unsettled roving population. That is the point I wish to impress upon the Treasurer. A great many of these old pioneers have always lived in the back blocks. They have never had the benefits of any Tariff protection for the industry they have followed, and they will be absolutely cut off from the benefits ,pf 'the Old-age Pensions Act unless some more liberal provisions are introduced into it and these harassing restrictions eliminated. The writer of the letter from which I am quoting goes on to sayAs an instance, the regulations state that a claimant must secure the testimony of two independent witnesses who have known him or her for 25 years. The absurdity of such a proviso must be apparent to any one who reasons how impossible it is to find persons who have known men for that period on these fields which have drawn their population from all ends of Australia, many of whom have led a nomadic life since gold was first found. Referring to the advantages which people in civilized centres enjoy, as compared with these men, he says The man who stays at home leading a peacef u l life, luxurious in comparison to this one as a farmer or city man surrounded by friends from childhood, can obtain the pension without the least trouble, whereas the restless spirits' who have "" blazed the track"" to the detriment of health and wealth, and opened up the highways and byways of Australia, from whence its great wealth is derived, are debarred from obtaining that which they have earned tenfold. There he draws a contrast, the full force of which we should all recognise. Then, as to requiring certificates of birthsThese men do not carry their birth certificate about with them, and cannot produce them as proof of their bona fides. I am informed by natives of both places that in Ireland and Scotland registration of births was unknown prior to thirty-five years agoI think that the system of Government rehaunt- gistration is a little older than that, and has prevailed in Ireland since 1864; but, at any rate, it is of comparatively recent originand many are unable to read or write, and are unable to tell their correct age. The clause debarring one obtaining the pension on account of imprisonment savours too much of Sunday school legislation, and is unjust, for thousands have been imprisoned for crimes for which they were innocent, and some for political offences committed in the interests of Democracy. . . The general opinion is that, when any one reaches the ripe age of sixty-five, they have earned the pension, and all the circumlocution contained in the application forms could be overcome by allowing the claimant to make a sworn affidavit, signed by two witnesses, before .a justice of the peace, to the effect that he or she was sixty-five, &c. The authorities could investigate the veracity of that statement, and if it were found to be false, .1 conviction or two would prevent any great infringement of that law. I have said that it is not desirable to deal with the details of the measure at this stage, but in Committee I shall have something to say on the various points that I have raised. Seeing that the Bill has been in our hands only a few moments, the Government should not attempt to go very far to-night, but should give us the evening to study it, so that tomorrow we may be able to bring a better understanding to its discussion.",56
408,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) ,,[8.40] - I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie that we should not go far with the measure this evening, but should have an opportunity to study carefully the proposals of the Government. I shall not discuss the measure at length now, though in Committee I shall have a word or two to say on the subject of naturalization. At this stage I wish to refer to what I regard as an improper omission from the Bill. I regret that the Government does not propose to give to charitable institutions the assistance which they undoubtedly deserve, as suggested by the honourable members for Coolgardie and Fremantle. The hospitals and benevolent asylums, of Victoria at any rate, are not State institutions entirely, and, in most of the States, the Government contribution is small in relation to the whole expenditure upon the care of the sick, the injured, and the aged.",56
409,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Unde r the New South Wales Act pension money was paid to these institutions.,57
410,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"I think that those Ministers, especially in view of the reprehave, sentations which have been made to them, allotted to them. should have proposed a similar arrangement under the Commonwealth law. I handed to the Treasurer a carefully writI ten statement, emanating from the managand ing body Of the Castlemaine Benevolent Asylum, which made some very reasonable proposals in regard to the treatment of those who are compelled to enter such inhere stitutions. Old men frequently suffer from ailments which, when living alone, they, are unable to treat. They have, therefore, at intervals, and sometimes for long periods, to seek treatment in charitable stitutions. In Victoria the hospitals are not allowed to deal with these cases, so that it is only in benevolent asylums they can obtain the attention which their condition demands. The Act, however, places them on the same footing as pria soners in gaols, except that upon leaving a hospital a person may receive the penelapse sion which has accrued to him for a period not exceeding four weeks.",57
411,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Apparently, under little section 47, a man could successfully apply for a pension, and enter a charitable stitution.",57
412,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,Sectio n 45 to would then apply to him.,57
413,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It deals only with asylums for the insane and hospitals.,57
414,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"I think that they the definition of hospitals could be strain-:d to make it include benevolent asylums. . age pensioners entering a benevolent asylum find that their pensions cease, and on coming out they can receive not more than four weeks of accrued arrears.",57
415,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Whil e they, are in the asylum the State is paying for their keep.",57
416,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Thes e institutions are maintained chiefly by charitable subscriptions, and give charitable relief. We have been extremely careful to differentiate between that and old-age pensions. The Government might have made available part, rf not the whole of the, pension, while the pensioner was resident in an asylum cr hospital. By not doing so, we will compel those persons to remain outside of such institutions, because they know that inside they will be deprived of many comforts in the way of tobacco and so forth. 1 strongly urge the Government to give further consideration to this matter, with a view to making some provision whereby who do enter the institutions shall at any rate, a portion of the pensions",57
417,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [8.45] should like to impress on the Treasurer the Attorney-General the points raised by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the-first payment of the pensions. It is, I am sure, a. sincere pleasure to every man to have the privilege of amending this Act, and righting a very grievous injustice - as it must be regarded, although it was committed inadvertently-to very many of our fellow-citizens. In no sense of the inword is this a party measure, and we, therefore, may co-operate with great advantage for the purpose of making it perthat fect. The Bill must become law before any person can take advantage of the proposed amendment, and it will possibly be fortnight or more before it passes both Houses. In addition, some weeks may before a person otherwise qualified can become naturalized. The Department of External Affairs is admirably conducted, but like other Departments, it has its wsays. There are by-paths in which 4 naturalization papers get stowed away; inand, as I say, weeks may elapse before they can be dealt with. It is easy for us understand how to become naturalized, but those concerned are foreigners, and are the very persons who are least acquainted with the necessary forms. The fact that have not become naturalized is owing, not only to their love of their own countries, Oldbut to their ignorance of our forms; and, as the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out, they ought not to be allowed to suffer on that account. If such persons are entitled to pensions, they ought to have them from the day such a Bill as we are now considering would have become law had there been no change of Government. Never mind whether it was right or otherwise for the Government to be changed, the fact is that, for certain party purposes, there has been a change. If there had been no change-if the Deakin or the Fisher Government, for instance, had not gone out of office, or if there had been no parties at all in the House-the Bill would have become law, and these people would not have been called upon to suffer. Section 38 of the principal Act provides that the date of the commencement of a pension shall not be prior to the date of the claim, and I think that that ought to be repealed or amended on lines I shall suggest.",57
418,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The repeal of the provision would do more than the honourable member desires.,58
419,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have no desire to do more, and I am quite willing to safeguard the amendment; at any rate, the section should be repealed so far as certain particulars are concerned. The amendment I suggest is to this effect:Any persons not qualified to receive a pension under the principal Act, shall, on lodging a claim within thirty days after the passing of this Act, be qualified to receive a pension as from the ist July, 1909, in exactly ""the"" same way as if , under the principal Act, they had lodged a claim prior to the ist July. Mr WfLKS - The honourable member would make the Bill retrospective.",58
420,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Onl y so far as to enable a person to take advantage of the Bill directly it is passed. Unless a person is naturalized he cannot take advantage of the measure; and in the case of hundreds of persons six weeks or two months may elapse before they can be naturalized.,58
421,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Some are getting naturalized now.,58
422,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Some are, but in my own electorate there are 200 or 300 unnaturalized aliens, who are most estimable citizens, ancl many of whom were in the habit of voting at State elections under the impression that, as men, they were entitled to do so. In country districts six weeks or two months must elapse before many men can take advantage of the law.",58
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"They can be naturalized tomorrow, if they desire.",58
424,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Yes , if they are in the cities; but, as it happens, many of them are not.",58
425,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,They have had twenty years in which to become naturalized.,58
426,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We all agree that they ought to have been naturalized, but, in any case, we are prepared to let that pass and give them a chance. Do we desire them to take advantage of the Bill? If so, we ought to give them every opportunity, and I would penalize no man merely because naturalization is a cumbrous and lengthy process, and he is unfamiliar with our forms. I have had personal experience in this matter, and I know that, with every good will in the world, to get naturalization papers issued in a fortnight is quite quick work. I have seen piles of naturalization papers waiting in the Department, though, of course, I have no doubt such is not the case under the present Government. I suggest to the Minister that the amendment I have drafted, though not necessarily in the same words, should be adopted.",58
427,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire once more to point out that this detail work is by no means in place on a second reading. The honourable member is again suggesting an amendment; and the place in which to refer to amendments, proposed cr suggested, is Committee and not at this stage.",58
428,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Cannot we outline amendments.,58
429,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Certainl y an honourable member may suggest amendments, but what the honourable member for West Sydney is doing goes far beyond that. The honourable member is not only suggesting ah amendment to meet a certain case, but has one drafted, and was about to read it again. That is not a proper course of conduct on a second-reading debate, but will"" be proper in Committee.",58
430,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The point I wish toemphasize is that we ought to enable these people to receive their pensions at the earliest possible moment. There are many points, but I feel that it would be wrong for us to speak as to the full extent we should like to go, because we have no means at our disposal to deal with invalids. No matter how deserving they may be, or how they may have been neglected by the States, we cannot provide for them until we can make an equitable arrangement with the States which will permit of the Commonwealth having sufficient revenue for the purpose. Whether the proposals indicated in the paper which we decided to print this afternoon, will enable us to do that, I do not know; but until arrangements are made to place at the disposal of the Commonwealth a larger revenue, we shall be unable to do justice to a class of persons who, as the honourable member for Coolgardie says, deserve it even more than do the aged poor. There is cne other matter that I desire to mention. A'few weeks ago, before the Commonwealth'took over the old-age pensions system, I was interviewed by a native of this State who is sixty-seven years of age, and entitled to a pension. He applied for a pension, and his application was granted; but, owing to his having thoughtlessly inserted in his papers a statement to the effect that he had been working for six months of the year, he was held to be entitled to, I think, only is. per week. Had he not been so neglectful of his interests-had he been loafing for the six months-he would have been entitled to the full pension. That is a glaring anomaly, and, as far as possible, we ought to remedy it. A man who has been industrious is penalized, while the man who does not work reaps a reward for his lack of industry. I cannot conceive of ?ny basis for such a system; I cannot even conceive of its expediencv. I communicated with the Old-age Pensions Department of Victoria, and the officers proved that their decision was right; but T feel that it is quite wrong to perpetuate such a system. If we desire to save money, we ought to say so; if we have not sufficient money to do justice, we ought not to penalize a man in this way. We might very well make such arrangements as hav« been indicated, in order to do justice to all classes concerned, subject to the means at our disposal. I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Wide Bay, and outlined by me, and also the amendment relating to accumulated wealth and annual earnings. A man ought not to be penalized in respect of income which is the result of personal exertion. If he has received it from an outside source, that is another matter; but if it is the result of his personal exertion, I cannot conceive of anv argument in favour of the perpetuation of such a system. Mr Hughes.",58
431,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [8.58] - I do not think that any large principle is involved in the suggested amendments, and I propose to delay any observations upon them until we get into Committee. I wish, however, to make a very strong protest against what I conceive to have been the most urfair statement made by the Leader of the Opposition : the statement that those who opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill also opposed the principle of old-age pensions.",59
432,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Did the honourable member use the word "" principle""?",59
433,Mr REID,Unknown,He did; but I do not think that he could have meant to do so.,59
434,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Did I not say that they were defeating the purpose of old-age pensions ?,59
435,Mr REID,Unknown,"No ; the honourable member used words to the effect that those who opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill showed that they were opposed to the principle of old-age pensions. It ' is to that statement. I object. The justification for any other expression is quite a matter of opinion; but I must strongly object to such a statement. If honourable members of this House since the first Federal Parliament have been unanimous on any question, they have been unanimous on that of the payment of old-age pensions.",59
436,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",59
437,Mr REID,Unknown,"Thos e who opposed the Surplus Revenue Bill did so because, in their opinion, it transgressed one of the principles of the Constitution. That alone was the ground of their opposition to the Bill. If honourable members of the Labour party believed that we had the constitutional right to pass a Surplus Revenue Bill in order to provide for old-age pensions, how will they answer to the people of Australia for their lethargy during the last six or seven years, when ,£6,000,000 were paid to the States, over and above their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, without any attempt to ear-mark those millions for the benefit of the old people of Australia?",59
438,Mr MAHON,Unknown,We were misled by the honourable member and the other lawyers.,59
439,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,No .,59
440,Mr REID,Unknown,"Why should the honourable member make such a statement as that? May I remind him that there are some distinguished legal gentlemen in the Labour party. Where is there a man of greater legal experience than the ex-Attorney-General, the honourable member for West Sydney? Then, again, there is the honourable member for Werriwa. I wish to point out, further, that when the honourable member for Hume, as Treasurer in the Deakin Government, introduced and moved the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill, he mentioned the purposes for which the surplus revenue was to be appropriated and held in trust; but he said nothing about appropriating one penny for old-age pensions. I have here the report of his speech on the motion for the second reaoing, and find that although he mentioned harbour defences and other public works for which it was proposed to provide in that way, he said nothing of an intention on the part of the Government to devote one penny of the surplus revenue so obtained to an old age pensions fund. Not one penny was to be so used, unless we are to assume-and we have no right to do so-that the Treasurer had some secret intention of putting aside moneys for that purpose. We are sure that he had no such secret purpose. He would have been delighted to mention it to the House if it had occurred to him then, that the surplus revenue was to be used for such a purpose. I have not read the report of the whole debate on that B but I shall be glad if any honourable member will draw my attention to one word uttered during the consideration of the Bill by this House, reminding the Treasurer that the surplus revenue should be put to such a purpose.",59
441,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member for Wide Bay mentioned it in his speech.,60
442,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am coming to the motion in regard to old-age pensions moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay. It may. be that during the debate on the Surplus Revenue Bill, some one mentioned it. If any 'honourable member did, he deserves credit for it. But either honourable members of the Labour party thought we had the constitutional right to put aside these moneys, or they did not. IE they did not think we had the constitutional right to do it, then they were in the same position as I was, and we are equally to blame for having a wrong opinion. If they did think we had the constitutional right to do it, they slumbered on it, and allowed enormous sums of money to which we were entitled, beyond the three-quarters due to the States, to be handed over to the States, instead of being devoted to the payment of old-age pensions for Australia.",60
443,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Onl y for two years.,60
444,Mr REID,Unknown,For'the whole time that we had that constitutional right.,60
445,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I thought that we had not the power until the five years' bookkeeping period was over.,60
446,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member may be perfectly right in that view. I have not considered the matter. On the second reading of the Bill the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Hume, pointed out that we had paid over to the States a sum of ^5,728,000 in excess of the amount which we were legally entitled to pay. There seemed to be a general impression, rightly or wrongly, that we could not use the power which was brought to light in connection with that Bill. If it was an error, it was a general error, or I feel sure that honourable members, who were all desirous of passing that measure, would have taken this step long before. To sho,w that it was an afterthought, the Treasurer never mentioned old age pensions in moving the second reading of the Surplus Revenue Bill, so that at the time he had no idea of making use of the Surplus Revenue Account for that purpose.",60
447,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,The honourable member ill ; for Darwin asked the question in 1902.,60
448,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"He asked the question of Sir Edmund Barton, and suggested that the surplus revenue should be used for old age pensions.",60
449,Mr REID,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Darwin did so, he deserves every credit for having the foresight to address such a question to the Ministry of the day; but I do not know whether he expressed an opinion on the subject. However, whether he did or not, it was a very good thing, in the light of what we know now, that he did put such a question; but, as a matter of fact, we have all apparently laboured under a delusion in regard to the matter for a long space of time. In the very session in which the Old-age Pensions Act was passed into law, the honourable member for Wide Bay, who is now leading the Opposition, took advantage of a formal motion to go ' into Committee of Supply on "" Grievance Day "" to move an amendment on the subject. ' Hansard of 19th March, 1908, page 9300, shows that the honourable member movedThat all the words after the word "" That "" be left out, with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the wordsThen comes a recital of facts regarding old age pensions, and the words follow"" this House is of opinion that the passing of a measure to give effect to the expressed will of the people is an urgent public duty."" The honourable member for Dalley wanted to make it stronger than that.",60
450,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Did he?,61
451,Mr REID,Unknown,"I will read his amend the ment. The honourable member for Wide Bay said it was an urgent public duty do this, but the honourable member for Dalley wanted to add these words to the honourable member's amendment"" And further, this House is of opinion Government should give effect to such expressed will of the people during this session."" That was surelv putting a point upon it. The honourable member for Wide Bay said it was an urgent public duty to do this Bill. thing, and the' honourable member for Dalley proposed to add: ""Yes, and this session too,"" but that amendment was opposed by my honourable friends oppointo site.",61
452,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"There was a sting in the tail of it. If we had voted for it, should not have got old-age pensions.",61
453,Mr REID,Unknown,"I cannot follow the inteltions lectual sinuosities of all my honourable friends opposite. All I know is that honourable member for Dalley declared plain English, speaking in March, igo8,' that it ought to be done ""this session."" People outside who were hungry and starvbers, ing for the want of a pension would have objected to the words being added that it should be done at once. One has to become a member of Parliament to undersure, stand that those words cover some misertime before. able point of political strategy. I am very anxious that my honourable friends, now they have taken the place that I have filled for seven years, should uphold the high ditions that I established. The honourable member for Newcastle proposed to amend the honourable member for Dalley's amendwhat ment by inserting the words ""take steps wards giving."" I wish to read this tence from the speech of the honourable member for Newcastle ini support of amendment, to show what was in his in moving itHonorable members may say that, but I that what I suggest is the only practicable and if the honourable member will adopt will remove himself from a position in he is leading the country lo believe that thing can be done this session which we cannot possibly accomplish. Yet, strange to say, the Act was passed that very session-in June, 1908.",61
454,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does the honourable ber say that the Labour party did not vote for it for that specific purpose?,61
455,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not say anything of the sort. How do I know what my honourable friends voted for? All I say is that honourable member for Dalley moved that the matter should be given effect to to ""this session,"" and that the honourable member for Newcastle, in moving a further amendment, explained that it was impossible to do it ""this session."" In spite of that the the honourable member for Newcastle's statement, the Bill became law that session.",61
456,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,And in spite of those who voted against the Surplus Revenue,61
457,Mr REID,Unknown,"My only reason for rising was to point out that it is grossly unfair to endeavour to put any honourable member the position of seeming to oppose old age pensions because he had an opinion as to the constitutional effect of a certain meawe sure which was of a new character. There is no necessity for those unfounded imputa; but I have already heard of statements made in different States about hon the orable members in this House being opin posed to old-age pensions. It is a mean way of political fighting to bear false witness in that fashion against honourable memand I say to those who rely on the not principle of the Surplus Revenue Act that the responsibility lies with them,, because if we hacl the right to pass that meait ought to have been exercised some",61
458,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) that [9.15] - The Surplus Revenue Act had the effect of appropriating very largely for the trapurpose of old-age pensions money which previously had been given to the States, but which they were not entitled to under is known as the Braddon section. A tonumber of honourable members thought it sendesirable to provide for the' payment of old-age pensions by appropriating the unhis expended fourth of the Customs and Excise mind revenue belonging to the Common wealthy instead of the money being returned to the believe States, as had been done previously; and way, it was on that point that a division of it he opinion arose. Whatever might have been which in the minds of those who opposed the Sursomeplus Revenue Bill, they did not suggest that the scheme of old-age pensions could be advanced in any other way. In fact, in up to that time, the wRole cry against the provision of old-age pensions was, not that memhonorable members were opposed to the principle, but that they could not see how the scheme could befinancedunder the conditions which then obtained. That was the position which was put to the House; but when it was discovered that, in the course of eight years, the Commonwealth had paid back to the"" States, £6,500,000 over and above the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they were constitutionally entitled, it was considered that the time had arrived when the House should take some action with respect to that surplus revenue. The members of the Labour party deemed that the best use to which it could be put was to appropriate it for the purpose of old-age pensions, and also for the purpose of more efficient defence; hence action was taken to have the Surplus Revenue Bill passed. Those who opposed its passage did so very largely on constitutional grounds. Tliere was a big outcry made in the States against its enactment. The supporters of the measure were charged by the Premier of New South Wales with being ""political burglars;"" with taking away from the States money to which they were justly entitled. then, the States have had the opportunity of appealing to the highest tribunal in the land as to what were, and what were not, their rights. The Federal High Court told the States in no unmistakable language that this Parliament was quite within its rights in appropriating the surplus revenue as it did. It was because we made that appropriation that we were able to place on the statute-book a great humanitarian measure, providing for Commonwealth old age pensions. I have been reminded that the honourable member for Flinders, who is a very learned authority on these matters, quite agreed with the members of the Labour party as to the legality of the action which was then taken, but opposed the passing of the Bill for other reasons. There is no need to debate that phase of the question now, as it has been settled, and those who were in doubt as to the constitutionality of the appropriation have had their doubts set at rest by an authoritative decision of the High Court.",61
459,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The old-age pensions could not have been paid if the Surplus Revenue Bill had not been passed, and they knew that perfectly well.",62
460,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If the Surplus Revenue Bill had not been passed, there could not have been any legislation on old-age pensions today. The Parliament would have been in the old position of not being able to finance the scheme. So far as could be ascertained, there was no desire on the part of the States to come to its aid in the direction of dealing with the subject from the Commonwealth rather than from the State stand-point. That is the position which the House has to face on the present occasion. Whatever may have been the opinion of some honourable members with respect to the Surplus 'Revenue Bill when it was being considered here, the members of the .Labour partywere animated at that time by the desire to give to the Commonwealth the principle of old-age pensions, and they took the course which seemed to them best calculated to secure that object. Our present position demonstrates amply and fully that the course which we then favoured and took was the correct one, and has resulted in giving, to the Commonwealth the system of old-age pensions, which otherwise it could not have had at the present time. The position in which we now find ourselves is rather a stTange commentary Since on some utterances we have read in the press from members of the Ministry during the last two or three weeks. In New South Wales, at every week-end, we were favoured with an interview which set out the position of the Government, and which was far from complimentary to the Labour party.",62
461,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Is the honourable member discussing.this Bill?,62
462,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Yes , sir. I want to show the unprepared state in which the Treasurer finds himself today, despite the representations made by the Government to the public, through the press, that they were simply awaiting an opportunity to deal with this measure. It was specially mentioned by one Minister as one of the measures which were being held up by the Opposition by the debate on the motion of no-confidence.",62
463,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There has been no delay.,62
464,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,I wish that the honourable member would tell the Minister of Defence that there was no delay.,62
465,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I mean that there has been no delay today.,62
466,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"If the Treasurer intends to bring forward his business in the way in which he has submitted this Bill, he will belittle the highest traditions of our parliamentary institutions. He came here today and threw upon the table of. the House the manuscript of what purported to be a Bill. The Bill was only placed in our hands, hot from the printing press, after the dinner adjournment, and, of course, after its second reading had been moved. Still, we are told that there was no delay. We were told a little while ago by the Treasurer that it was expected that some other business would have occupied 'the time of the House, and that that was the reason for his unpreparedness. For three weeks we have been debating a motion ot no-confidence.",62
467,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"What other business did he expect to come on ? Mr THOMAS BROWNWThat is for the right honourable member to say. The business on the notice-paper included the resumption of the debate on the Addressin-Reply to the Governor General's speech, and the debate on the Ministerial Statement. The probabilities are that, despite the representations which the Government have been making through the press that those Orders of the Day ought not to be debated, they expected them to be discussed, and were not ready to proceed with the business which they had in hand. wonder what position the House would have found itself in if Ministers had not had some inheritance from their predecessors to fall back upon. This Bill was placed on the stocks a month ago by the Labour Ministry, and the idea was that it should be dealt with before the beginning of the present financial year, so that certain persons who will be benefited under its operation might receive that benefit from the date of the proclamation of the principal Act. If the Government had not had this Bill upon which to fall back, it seems to me that they would have been completely stranded this afternoon. I maintain that a measure of its importance ought to have been further advanced than it was. If there were anything in the arguments which have been put forward by the Minister of Defence in Sydney during the past few weeks, the Treasurer ought not to have found himself in the position that he did this afternoon.",63
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There was half-anhour's delay in supplying honourable members with printed copies of the Bill. That is all - who m I have known from my youth up,63
469,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The circumstance merely goes to show how hollow were the piotestations of the Government that they desired to proceed with public business, and were being delayed by the censure debate. There are two or three points connected with this Bill which, in my judgment, are worthy of consideration. I trust that the Treasurer will give them his attention, so that when we reach Committee we shall not have to fight them as strenuously as we might otherwise have to do. Most of the provisions of the measure are mere machinery proposals, which are designed to overcome the difficulties which have been encountered in the application of the principal Act. But the amendments of sections 16 and 17 of that Act are of far-reaching importance. In those sections the questions of naturalization and of a reduction in the residential qualification of ap r plicants for old-age pensions are dealt with. In New South Wales particularly there has been a considerable discussion upon the question of naturalization, and a large measure of injustice has been inflicted upon a number of deserving residents by the provisions of the State Old age Pensions Act which formerly operated. When that measure was under consideration' in the New South Wales Parliament, I I objected to the provision that a person must be naturalized for ten years before he was eligible to receive a pension, and I privately interviewed Sir John See, who was in charge of the Bill upon that subject. But, finding that he and his Government were strongly opposed to any reduction in the residential qualification, I was compelled to allow it to pass, rather than to jeopardize the safety of the measure. In the principal Act that period has been reduced to three years, and the proposal in this Bill is to enable that provision to operate straight away in certain circumstances. It is well known that in New South Wales-particularl y in the early days-person s were attracted thither from all parts of the world by mining discoveries. They made their homes there, and contributed largely to the development of the State. But, owing to the fact that legal assistance was required to enable them to take out naturalization papers, a number of these miners were not eligible to receive a pension under the New South Wales law. Quite recently I received communications from some of these individuals wards-askin g me whether, under this Bill, they would be able to secure pensions. 1 replied that they would have to be naturalized for a period of three years, but that the late Government proposed to remove even that embargo. In some instances I was asked to advise whether applications should be lodged, in anticipation of the Bill becoming law. I told them that I did not think it was necessary to adopt that course, because in this Bill, I assumed, special provision had been made to meet such cases. For that reason I think that provision should be made in this measure to meet the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition in favour of claimants with a twenty years' qualification being paid from ist July. I do not foresee the difficulties which the Treasurer apparently foresees in this connection. An almost analogous piece of legislation was enacted in New South Wales in connection with the Land Act of 1895. . Prior to that time unnaturalized persons could acquire land under the settlement conditions which then obtained. But that Act provided that these special provisions should be limited to British subjects and to those who had become naturalized. To overcome the difficulty which was apparent, provision was made that the Land Board might satisfy itself that the claimant had lodged an application for naturalization with the proper authorities. I do not see why the same principle should not apply to these provisions, and if persons who are not naturalized now, but who are qualified by twenty years' residence in the Commonwealth, make application for naturalization at the same time as they apply for the pensions, I do not see why they should be debarred from participating in the benefits of this legislation. I commend that suggestion to the Treasurer as one which, if adopted, would have the effect of placing a number of very deserving people upon a fair footing.",63
470,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Would honourable member desire such a provision fo apply from the ist July?,64
471,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I do not see why it should not date from the ist July. A number - of applications for pensions have only been lodged, and are still subject to consideration; and a number of other persons who would have liked to lodge applications were debarred from doing so by reason of the provisions of the Act. When they sought for advice from the administrators of the Act, they were informed that under its terms they were debarred from participation, inasmuch they had to show three years' clear naturalsoon ? ization. Only yesterday I answered a letter from a miner whom I know very well, and who has been in this country forty or fifty years. He became naturalized about twelve months ago. He asked me whether he could lodge an application for an old age pension now. I consulted with the authorities administering the Act, and had to write to tell him that under its provisions he had to be naturalized for a period of three vears. But I also informed him that an amending Bill was in contemplation, and that as soon as it was passed, I hoped to be in a position to inform him that he could lodge an application. The Leader of the Labour party, and those who are supporting him, are asking that such men should not be penalized because of the provisions of the principal Act; but that they be allowed to lodge applications for naturalization now, or within twelve months, and then have the right to participate in the old-age pensions legislation from the ist July last. The same principle applies to the reduction of the term of residence, except that it affects a wider area.",64
472,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member intend that the pension shall be paid from the ist July, when application is only made for it in August?",64
473,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I am speaking on behalf of those who have been debarred under present legislation from applying on account of failure to naturalize, or because of their age. I contend that those who make application as soon as this Bill becomes law should have the pensions dated from the ist July. Those who neglect to apply, say for three months, or even for a month, deserve to suffer for their neglect. I do not think that a person who applies in August, September, or October the should have the right to have his application dated back. I am appealing on behalf of those who were debarred from applying on the ist July, on account of the provisions in the principal Act regarding naturalization ancl the term of residence. As soon as this Bill passes, those people should be allowed to lodge their applications, as they woulci have done had their cases been provided for in the principal Act; and they should have the benefit of the pensions from the ist July.",64
474,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that those persons will as be lucky in having the bar removed so,64
475,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"That is not an argument against the application of the principle that I am urging. The honourable member may think that these persons are lucky to be able to apply for pensions at all. I was, at the outset, one of those who took part in the movement in favour of granting old-age pensions in the State from which I come. While the principle of this legislation does not meet with much objection now, at that time we were told that we were proposing to pauperize the community. All sorts of objections were raised. Those who had to bear the burden of the struggle know how severe it was, and how very timid leading politicians were about touching the subject at all. After the fight has been won, those who secure the pensions may consider themselves lucky; but if some members of Parliament had not been progressive and prepared to put up a good fight in favour of social legislation, such enactments would not have been passed.",65
476,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The honourable member's remarks do not apply to this Parliament.,65
477,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I am glad that they do not. The history of the movement only shows that some leaders of popular thought are very much at sea when they come to deal with wide humanitarian legislation. Those who come after are always ready to tell those who fought for a reform in its initial stages that they would have supported it from the beginning. Two points that were raised by the honourable member for Coolgardie are worthy of consideration. One is as to what are to be the conditions relating to the furnishing of witnesses who will certify to having known the applicant to be a resident of the Commonwealth for the period of twenty years. The second is with respect to the provision requiring that the applicant shall supply a birth certificate, or shall be in a position to prove that his age is what it is certified to be. Under the operation of the New South Wales Act, a great number of very deserving peopfe were shut out from the benefits of the legislation because of their inability to comply with those requirements. Without particularizing, I might refer to one case which recently came under my ' notice. The applicant was a native of the State of New South Whales, and because in the early davs there was no State registration of births, and the registration records of little country churches were very often destroyed as of little value, this man could not furnish a birth certificate. He could not discover any of the people . who were alive - when he was born, some sixty-five years before, ancl so was unable to supply the evidence which the Old-age Pensions Board required to satisfy them as to his age. He was, on that account, deprived of the benefits of the Act.",65
478,Mr REID,Unknown,There was too much red tape about that.,65
479,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Yes , altogether too much red-tape. In many cases the members of the Board were perfectly satisfied that the applicants were over the prescribed age, but because they could not produce documentary evidence that they were, they were locked out. Equal difficulty arose in procuring certificates of knowledge that applicants had lived in the State for the prescribed time. As honourable members are aware, miners stay only a few years in one place. They are continually moving about, all over the Commonwealth, and they find it very difficult to discover people whom they knew in the olden days. I have known claimants for these pensions to go to considerable expense, in making inquiries, to secure the evidence of age and identification required. I remember one very hard case which came under my notice in New South Wales. I may say that at first the administration of the State Act was very much more liberal than it afterwards became. A few years ago, when there was a call for retrenchment, the records of many persons who were drawing old-age pensions were looked up, and they were askecl to furnish evidence of identification. In the case to which I refer, the authorities, on searching the records, decided that the pensioner had been improperly paid his pension for three years, and they asked for a refund of the money paid. The Department contended that he was not the age he said he was when he made his application. I asked the man about his claim,and he told me that when he came into the State he was seventeen years of age. The authorities claimed that, according to the shipping returns furnished, he was nineteen years of age when he entered the State. I looked through the papers, and found that his age on entering the State was marked infigures,and it was a toss-up whether the figures were seventeen or nineteen-as the last figure might have been a seven or a nine. The Department decided that it was a nine, although the man said that he was informed by his parents that when he landed here he was seventeen years of age. and he had been accustomed to reckoning his age on that information. The Department decided that in the circumstances the pension had been paid to him for three years improperly, and they required a refund of the payments. Such strictness in the interpretation of the law should not be permitted to enter into the administration of humanitarian legislation of this kind. The case to which I refer arose out of a cry for retrenchment by a Government that claimed that their predecessors had been extravagant, and I have indicated one of the ways in which they set about retrenchment. In the administration of an Old-age Pensions Act regard should first be had to the need of the applicant for assistance,, and, secondly, to a reasonable compliance with the provisions as to age and residence in the State. If there is a reasonable compliance with those provisions, there should not be too much red-tape introduced in requiring a certificate of birth in cases in which it is very often impossible to produce such a certificate, or a sworn declaration of continuous knowledge of an applicant for a period of twenty-five years. I have very much pleasure in complimenting the Government in taking up the good work of their predecessors. I hope that this amending measure will shortly find a place on the statute-book of the Commonwealth, as I am sure it will confer a great deal of benefit on a large number of very deserving people.",65
480,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.50! - The Bill before us is intended to amend the Invalids and Old-age Pensions Act of 1908. I have looked through it, and find that it contains practically two principles. One is in regard to procedure, delegating power to a Deputy Commissioner. No member on either side is in a position to claim credit for this proposal, or to make it the subject of debate for party purposes. Then it is proposed to limit the time for naturalization, and to reduce the residence qualification from twenty-five to twenty years. I take it that the latter proposal is submitted to bring our Old-age Pensions Act into uniformity with the law in Queensland.",66
481,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,And in Victoria.,66
482,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The residence qualification under the New South Wales Act is twenty-five years, and I have always thought that too long. In discussing the Bill honourable members have made certain suggestions. The honourable member for Coolgardie, with a good deal of warmth, and with what at first blush appeared to be a good deal of force, suggested that section 47 of the existing Act should be amended. It provides that pensions shall not be paid to inmates of charitable institutions and benevolent asylums. It does not at first appear unreasonable to suggest that pensions should be given to inmates of charitable institutions who are otherwise qualified to receive them, but on reflection I think it would be a most dangerous thing for this House to allow. I shall give my reasons for using that language in regard to the suggestion. One of the principal reasons urged for the establishment of old age pensions was that their payment would enable old people to avoid the barrack system in force in asylums and similar charitable institutions. In the early days of the advocacy of old age pensions it was urged, with much force, that it was cruel and inhuman that our unfortunate old people should be placed in asylums, like so many cattle. It was contended that the barrack system should not lie permitted to continue. In many asylums husband and wife are separated, and it was urged that the payment of old-age pensions would enable old people to avoid the barrack system, and to live in a civilized manner. It was contended, also, that the upkeep of these benevolent asylums represented a great charge on the various States. The honourable member for Coolgardie has failed to recognise that, unfortunately, the greater portion of the funds contributed by the charitable public for the building and maintenance of these benevolent asylums is used for the payment of officers' fees. In many cases the unfortunate inmates have to accept a reduced dietary scale, to meet the expenditure in wages paid to officials. That is what happens when charity is not properly regulated. The public subscribe money for the benefit of those in benevolent institutions, but the funds thus provided are spent mostly on official administration. It seems to me that we might well say that the pensioners, male and female, may live where they like. I would not restrict their freedom in this respect, but I certainly would not hand over pension money to those controlling charitable instimaimed tutions. I say that if pensioners like live within the walls of charitable institubegging tions, they should be paid their pensions just as if they were living outside. no concern of ours where they live, or aged. what they do with their money. I cannot understand the Labour-party saying, ""We are the authors of old-age pensions legisplus lation. Other honourable members have had nothing to do with it . "" Surely they are not going to make capital out of the destituways tion of their fellow beings.",66
483,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,A good many the State Parliament were opposed to age pensions.,67
484,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I cannot be twitted with having opposed old-age pensions, in either this or the State Parliament. I did what I could to forward the cause long before was a popular one. But I take no credit for that - An objection to the Bill is like the Act, it is improperly branded. is called the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill, although the provisions relating invalids are not to come into force until proclamation has been issued. If the bour party wishes to do what is right, should see that its legislation is correctly branded. There are many in this commufact nity who, by reason of accident or suffer infirmities, such as blindness, which entitle them to public assistance, irrespecmatter tive of their age. But it is a mockery call these measures, which give assistance at all, ""Invalid Pensions"", legislation.",67
485,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I intend to move an sions ? amendment which will have the effect of repealing the section of the Act which vents the payment of invalid pensions a proclamation has issued.,67
486,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I am glad to The honourable member proposes a straightforward course. It does not do to start with a falsehood in these matters. It is cruel to allow our invalids to believe there is legislation in force which will them relief when, in fact, no provision made for assisting them.",67
487,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,It is the lack funds which has prevented that.,67
488,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Fu r many years I have held the opinion tiiat our Government should be paternal in character. We make provision to assist the unfortunates whom J refer. Those who are better cumstanced, and able to bear the burdens of taxation, must provide relief for and blind. It is a crying shame to and a doleful spectacle, to see the blind for alms in our big cities.",67
489,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Some of these It is persons are even more needy than the,67
490,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is so. It has been said that those who voted against the SurRevenue Bill were opposed to the payment of old-age pensions.. I supported and voted for the measure, because I have albeen ready to do what I could to make provision for the payment of penin sions. But the Labour party must admit oldthat it might have discovered eighteen months earlier how to make this provision. The States have done very well out of the Commonwealth, but it was only during the operation of the bookkeeping section of the it Constitution that we were compelled to return all surplus, in addition to the threethat, fourths of the Customs and Excise reI t venue, and I am sorry that since then the surplus has not been ear-marked. If it had to been, there now would be ,£6,000,000 to a the credit of the Commonwealth, a sum Lawhich would cover two-thirds of the value it of the transferred properties.",67
491,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Shoul d not that be used as an argument for opposing birth, the claims of the State Premiers ?",67
492,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I am referring to the to show that the State Premiers have to very little ground for asking the Commonthem no wealth for better treatment.,67
493,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Shoul d they not be generous, and provide for invalid pen",67
494,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We ask themto be, prenot generous, but just.. The Commonuntil wealth should not do anything by the grace of Gregory Wade, John Murray, or hear that. any other State Premier.",67
495,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,But I presume that the Constitution must be fairly construed.,67
496,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The right honourable that member for East Sydney referred to a mogive tion moved by the Leader of the Labour is party, who has since been Prime Minister, and'is now leading the Opposition. The of honourable member submitted a motion on "" Grievance Day,"" and, as already said, I moved an amendment to that motion. It was suggested that there was a sting in the must amendment, but, so far as I am personto ally concerned, it was moved without colcirlusion with any honourable member. I suggested to the honourable member for Parthe ramatta, when he was combating the statement made by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that he ought to submit a motion himself to effect the purpose, my only desire being to see it accomplished. In proof I should like to quote the following from page 9304 of Hansard of 19th March , 1908 : ",67
497,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The finding of the means necessary to give effect to the verdict of the country is a duty devolving upon those who administer its affairs. The electors do not care whether the Braddon provision makes the thing difficult. They mean what they say. The resources of the Commonwealth are within the control of the Parliament for providing the funds necessary to pay old-age pensions throughout Australia.,68
498,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member proposes that the House shall give the country a mandate.,68
499,Mr FISHER,Unknown,My motion is clear and distinct. I say that the matter is now urgent.,68
500,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That is a mandate. It was the opinion contained in that last interjection which caused me to move an amendment in order to clinch the matter. The honourable member for Wide Bay was submitting a motion as a mandate to the Government, asserting that old-age pensions were within the Constitution, he not caring for any financial difficulty; and I simply moved the amendment. But the Labour party, apparently, consider the exigencies of party government of superior concern; and I am pleased to say that, although they opposed my amendment, the Bill itself was carried that, session. I have no desire to dwell on the matter, but merely to place the facts on record. I have heard honourable members opposite take credit for this legislation; but surely there is not a single honourable member who would not take a generous view in regard to the treatment of the aged poor. Surely no man is so bereft of political capital that he has to fall back on questions such as this ! I am pleased that the Government have introduced an amending Bill ; and I desire to say here that, if the Labour party are so very concerned as to the aged and infirm, I cannot understand how a Labour Ministry could allow such regulations as were issued under the principal Act. These regulations emanated not from a Conservative Ministry, but from a Labour Ministry; and how a Labour Minister of Home Affairs could allow such a proclamation to go broadeffort cast",68
501,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,This had nothing to do with the Minister of Home Affairs. - [49],68
502,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Then , df it were the Labour Treasurer it makes the matter all the worse. I admit th!at some of the questions are essential, but others are beyond the capacity of the average unfortunate to answer. For . instance, there is the question as to where a claimant's children are or what has become of them. Men of the world know that the average unfortunate is one whose home ties and home circle have been broken up for years, and that such a question is in most cases impossible to answer.",68
503,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Were not some of the regulations prescribed by the Act?,68
504,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Some were not. As I have already said I have no wish to dwell on the matter, beyond saying that if the Opposition desire to do a good act on behalf of the unfortunates of Australia they will seek to simplify these regulations. The minds of those who have struggled and have not been treated too well by the world, are not very keen or alert; and it is certain that they would find it absolutely impossible to answer nine-tenths of . the questions. In some cases it would be. most painful to applicants to seek outside assistance in such a matter; and on the ground of humanity their personal feelings ought to be considered. The whole object of the regulations should be to prevent collusion or fraud, and they ought to be simplified. If these regulations had been issued by the present Prime Minister or the Treasurer there would have been an outcry on platforms throughout Australia about the Conservative class putting indignities and burdens on the unfortunate poor. It may be, perhaps, that the ex-Prime Minister was busy, and allowed the regulations to go through because it would be hard to believe that, if he had given any attention to them, they would have been issued. This is a simple measure of procedure- I am thoroughly in accord with it ; and if the principal Act can be amended on more liberal lines no one will be more anxious than myself for the early proclamation of the coming into operation of the sections dealing with invalid pensions.",68
505,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [10.12] I am glad of the opportunity to make an to liberalize the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act. When the honourable member for Dalley referred to the scope of the Bill as not being very wide, I said that I would submit an amendment which would have the effect of bringing the invalid sections of the principal Act into operation at once; and I may say that I tabled that amendment before the honourable member rose to speak, so that he will have an opportunity, of voting on that and other points. The right honourable member for East Sydney sought to fasten some blame on the Leader of the Labour party, because the idea of a Surplus Revenue Bill had not suggested itself to him sooner, but, as I interjected, the right honourable member might as well throw blame on George Stephenson for not having invented the locomotive before he did. I wish now to refer to the point which has been raised as to whether or not those who voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill believed that, in doing so, they were voting against old-age pensions. that the honourable member for Flinders, a very eminent lawyer, in the course of the debate on the motion for the second reading of that measure, said that, in his opinion, it was entirely within the limits of the Constitution. According to Hansard, page 9865, on the 31st March, 1908, he said If I believed, as does the right honourable member for Swan, that in passing this Bill we should transgress our constitutional powers, or that we should be attempting, by means of an Act of Parliament, to place upon the Constitution'an interpretation that we have power to do something that we could not possibly do, I should feel as indignant as he apparently does. But I do not regard this proposal in that light. Subject to one important consideration, to which I . shall refer in a moment, I think that this is a. very reasonable business-like proposition to rnake, and that it - does not impinge upon the rights .of the States. The whole tenor of his address was to the effect that in his opinion the Bill was quite within the Constitution. Whilst he was strongly of that opinion, he voted c against the Bill, although honourable membersgenerally knew that one of its purposes was to provide for old-age pensions. ; Mr Reid - No . Such a purpose was never mentioned by the Minister in his second-reading speech.",68
506,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The right honourable member .knows that the honourable member for Hume, who introduced the Bill, is not the most fluent of speakers, ancl does not always put his case as well as it might be put. But it was mentioned by the Leader of the Labour party when he rose in this House that that was one of the objects of the Bill. As - to the measure now before us, I may say at once that I shall support those provisions which will tend to liberalize the principal Act, and that I shall endeavour to extend them. On the other hand, I shall vote against some of its provisions, which wouid, in my opinion, contract the few liberal sections of the principal Act. I agree with those who say that naturalized citizens who become entitled to pensions should receive therrj as from ist July, and that the same treatment should be extended to those who come within the twenty years' residence clause. The pertinent objection has been raised that such persons might not apply for six months or twelve months after the passing of the Act, and that under such proposed amendment, their pensions would date back to ist July. My contention, I find however, is that a three months' limit might well be fixed. One month's notice is far too short. Australia is so large a territory that more than a month's notice is necessary to enable residents of all parts of the continent to become acquainted with these provisions, and three months is the shortest possible notice that we could fairly give. Those who apply for pensions within three months from the date of the passing of this Act should have their pensions ante-dated to ist July. The honourable member for West Sydney referred to a grievance for which we might well provide a remedy. He pointed out that a person who had been working for six months preceding his application would have his' pension so reduced that for the rest of the year he would be entitled to only about one shilling per week. The Old-age Pensions Act is designed to meet the immediate needs of those who apply for pensions, but if it is declared that those who have been earning something during the six months prior to their application shall have a corresponding reduction made in their pensions for the rest of the year, we shall not carry out the spirit of the Act. I should also like to see the age at which a person may receive an old-age pension reduced to sixty years. The 'Commonwealth Public Service Act provides for the retirement of public servants at from sixty to sixty-five years of age, and it is well known that those who have been engaged in the most laborious work, and have been in receipt of the lowest rates of wages, are more likely to be retired at sixty years of age than at sixty-five. If men who have been receiving the lowest rates of wages are retired at the age of sixty years, they will be left tically destitute for five years. with some of the State public servants. I have in mind more particularly the employees of the Railway and Tramway Department of New South Wales. Under the State Railways Act,' the employees have to retire on reaching the age of sixty years, and I know of numerous cases in which the lower paid men, who are compelled to retire at that age, would be practically destitute for the five years during which they would have to wait for Commonwealth old-age pensions. Oh their retirement from the service 'they are too old to turn their attention to other avenues of employment, and they would not be retired if they were able to follow' their usual avocations. In the circumstances, therefore, I think that the Act should operate so automatically as to apply to persons of sixty years of age who are not able to earn a livelihood. I am also of opinion that a person who is incapacitated from earning a livelihood should become entitled to a pension on reaching the age of fifty-five years. I have' given notice of amendments covering these points. I have also given notice of my intention to move an amendment which will provide for the immediate payment of invalid pensions. The Government might well show its adherence to progressive principles by agreeing to so reasonable an amendment. Another point that I wish to bring before honourable members is that the proofs that applicants for pensions have to present in support of their claims should be less stringent than they are. An applicant should not be compelled to present declarations by persons who have known him personally for twenty years. It should be sufficient to provide that an applicant shall prove to the reasonable satisfaction of a common-sense individual that he .has been resident in Australia for the specified time, and that he is of the age at which he is entitled to draw a pension. I am in perfect agreement with the honourable member for Dalley regarding the payment of old-age pensions to charitable institutions and asylums. It would not be wise to enable them to collect the money due to old-age pensioners. If the pensioner likes to board and lodge at any particular place, that is his business; but the pension should be payable to him direct, and not to institutions on his behalf. Consequently, if an amendment is proposed pracwhich raises that point, unless something And so very strong can be adduced in its-support, I shall feel compelled to vote in the direction I have indicated. I quite agree as to the necessity of liberalizing the forms of application and the questions submitted to the applicants. I raised that point in the party to which I belong, and asked why regulations so stringent, and questions apparently so needlessly searching, were framed. I was told that the Act prescribed that certain regulations shall come into force, and necessitated certain questions being asked, and that the framers of the regulations were powerless, in face of the provisions of the Act. I hope we shall be allowed a little time after the second reading is carried to consider the regulations and the questions thereunder, with a view, if necessary, to so amend the' principal Act that the questions can be simplified, and the regulations made much easier to work, and to enable applicants to prove their claims. We have an opportunity, now that this Bill is before the House, of considerably liberalizing the principal Act, and showing not only Australia, but all the world, that the Commonwealth Parliament is prepared to deal fairly with its old people, and to carry out the Scriptural idea by indicating, at least as regards our aged citizens, that every man in Australia is his brother's keeper.",69
507,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [10.29] - If is pretty clearly understood in the House, and I hope will be understood by the country generally, that if there is any blame for delay in dealing with' the old people', and granting them pensions, it is due to the influence of the State Rights idea; because, very early in the history of the Commonwealth, as Hansard records, the honourable member for Darwin asked Sir Edmund Barton if he could not use the surplus revenue, which was then being largely given to the States, for paying old-age pensions. The reply was that the Government could not do so, and that the money had to be paid over to the States. Honourable members will remember the great care that was taken by the then - Treasurer, Sir George Turner, to consider the interests of the States, so that the State Rights' idea is the cause of the delay in paying old-age pensions. The point I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer has'been already mentioned; but I wish him to look into the point whether the principal Act makes- 'it' mandatory that the particular questions asked, and the line of examination 'adopted; should be as set forth in the regulations, or if it is within the power of the Mintablished, ister to alter the regulations, and how far they can be altered to meet the circumthe stances which I intend to mention. There is a. big difference between those who beclaimants under the Commonwealth Act. and those dealt with under the State Acts. Under the Victorian State Act, an appliown. cant had to be resident for twenty years, and under the New South Wales Act for does twenty-five years, within the borders particular State, and that very limitation made it easier to get the necessary to prove residence within a State than it can be in the case of those who have been shut out of the provisions of the Acts by having - resided in more than State - This is the stage at which to attention to these facts. A very large ber of those with whom I have been nected for many years-me n who are pioneers, generally called bushmen-no t only travel very much, but have resided but a short time in any one place. Think of the trouble that they would have in getting any evidence at all.",70
508,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The same thing apculties plies to miners.,71
509,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It applies particularly to miners, and even more to those condifficult, nected with the pastoral industry. Many of the latter are frequently known by difas ferent names. That is not anything to ashamed of, for sometimes, in connection with the pastoral industry, a man has secured what is called a stand, and perhaps his mate or some one else that he knows and takes his place, with the consent of the employer. Sometimes the name changed; but at other times it may not Men are often known only by nicknames. Some men have names tacked on to them, and do not take the trouble to tell anybody their real names; and in another place they may have other nicknames. The whole question of dealing with those w'ho are coming under the Old-age Pensions Act surrounded with difficulties; and I afraid that officers who have only had perience of a State law have, when drafting the regulations and questions, overlooked the difficulties associated with the adminisshould tration of Commonwealth pensions. Another difficulty is that of proof of age. I know of a good many cases where there is difficulty in getting sufficient evidence connection with the State pensions. There was no registration at all in New South Wales until it obtained responsible government, and even since registration was esthe births of an immense number of children have never been registered. If Ministry intend to adhere strictly to the forms that are to be filled in, they will dewill bar many of those for whom the Act was intended from securing that to which they are entitled, and through no fault of their They are asked to produce that which it is impossible to get, because it not exist-the register of their birth. of the These points should be looked into.",71
510,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We have been lookevidence ing into them all along.,71
511,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"They should be looked State into now, so that any amendmienfe one which are necessary in the principal call . Act may be drafted '*and proposed numbefore this Bill goes through Committee. conI make this appeal on behalf of the who really deserve pensions more than do any other class in the Commonwealth, because they have done a great deal of rough pioneering work. Many of them, for instance, have opened mining fields. All - these men, have, by trie very nature of their occupation, been confronted with diffiwhich render it practically impossible for them to comply with the regula_ tions under the Act. It should not be very ' however, to make it possible for magistrates to receive reasonable evidence to the age of a claimant. I suggest that be a very wide latitude should be allowed to the magistrates, so that in dealing with evidence they may be guided by a sense of equity, and not by any technicality. I feel goes sure that whatever Government may be in power, it will administer the law, not with is a view to trying to read seven into nine, as be. indicated by the case referred to by the honourable member for Calare, but rather with a view to give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant, and to say that the seven is nine, so long as the friend concerned has sworn that, to the best of his knowledge, now the claimant is of the prescribed age. In is a great many cases, the sworn declaration am of a person as to his age is accepted as exsufficient evidence. When a claimant under this law submits evidence that he is a respectable person of the prescribed age, it be received. It will be somewhat rare, I think, to find a case where two friends can honestly certify that they have great known the claimant for twenty years, in simplv owing to the fact that he may have resided for a few years in one State, and the rest of the time in other parts of the Commomvealth. How can anv two friends of a man, unless they take his word, say whether or not he has been in the Commonwealth for the whole period of twenty years ? If a magistrate has to depend upon the filling up of two forms by two friends, a claimant will not be able to find any two friends who could honestly discharge that duty. In the desire to help some person who they, feel was deserving of an old-age pension, friends might be tempted to say that they had known him for twenty years, and, therefore, the document would not be so valuable as it ought to be. I ask the Treasurer to see that there is sufficient elasticity in the law to enable the officers to draft regulations which will meet such cases as I have been referring to.„ Otherwise, I am satisfied that only a very small percentage of the deserving nomadic class will be able to comply with the conditions. Surely the right honourable gentleman must realise that otherwise claimants will not be able to adduce the necessary evidence. We have not yet had sufficient experience of cases before magistrates to realise the difficulties which many claimants will have to surmount. I feel certain that, so far, not more than a small number of such cases as I have been dealing with have occurred.",71
512,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Act has been in force in Queensland and New South Wales.,72
513,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,But the claimants have not had to answer these questions.,72
514,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The position of a claimant under a State Act is utterly different from what it will be under the Federal law. Surely the Treasurer can understand that under a State Act a claimant has only to prove that he has resided within its boundaries for twenty years. In Victoria a man has no difficulty in proving that he has been a resident for that period, because he has never at any time been far removed from some friends. .",72
515,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is all we ask him to do.,72
516,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Surely the right honourable gentleman knows the provisions of the Federal law better than his remark implies. The object of that Bill is to meet the cases of men who have resided in the Commonwealth for twenty years. Take the case of a man who has lived for different periods in various States. No two friends of that person can honestly say that they have known where he has lived during the whole of that period. One man may know that he lived for a certain period in Victoria, and another that he resided for a time in New South Wales.",72
517,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We cannot take a man's word off-hand. His claim must be investigated.,72
518,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am sure that the Treasurer's officers will tell him that in very many cases no two friends of a claimant can swear to the fact that he has resided in the Commonwealth for twenty years, simply because they have not been following his movements during that period. Suppose, for instance, that one friend has been domiciled in Victoria, and that the claimant has been travelling all over Australia during twenty years. How can he honestly swear that the claimant has resided within the limits of the Commonwealth for that period ? It is absolutely ridiculous to require a declaration of that kind.",72
519,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"What does the honourable member propose, then ?",72
520,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I suggest that considerable latitude should be allowed to the magistrate in taking evidence, apart from the documents which are submitted.'",72
521,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"So there is, and an appeal from a magistrate is allowed, too.",72
522,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,But the law requires a magistrate to have certain documents before he can deal with the claim.,72
523,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"They can find out the name of the ship in which the applicant arrived, and that will give a clue.",72
524,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,There are difficulties as to the time when a claimant arrived in the C'ommonweath.,72
525,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"All these things will be considered. From the honourable member's remarks, any one might think that we had not looked into the Act or the regulations.",72
526,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I do not wish to say anything unkind, but, to judge from his second-reading speech and subsequent remarks, I doubt whether the honourable gentleman has ever read the Act. I assume that the spirit of the administration is favourable to the deserving cases, and that the only desire is to shut out .undeserving cases.",72
527,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We understand that, too, and that is what we are doing.",72
528,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I ask the right honourable gentleman to draft any amendments which may be required to meet such cases as I have represented. I might cite the case of a lady who was born in Australia seventy-five years ago. I had known her for forty years, and, therefore, I was able to fill up the form, but .cases of that kind are very rare. This Bill deals mainly with nomadic persons. All persons who have been claimants under a State Act are transferred, and the evidence given to the State authorities will be accepted by the Commonwealth, officers. It is the cases of those who are not qualified by residence in one State for twenty vears which we have particularly to consider. I do not know what instructions have been given to the magistrates who will be charged with the administration of this Act. If they are to be allowed a reasonable degree of latitude 0 the difficulty which I have mentioned may be met. I think that the Treasurer might well agree to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Wide Bay by permitting persons with a twenty years' residential qualification,. but who may not yet have registered their claims, receiving the advantages of the old-age pensions as from the ist July. The alteration would not involve a large sum, and it would constitute a graceful act on the part of the Commonwealth.",72
529,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [10.47]. - My view is that the Invalid and Old : Age Pensions Act, which we passed last year with the extensions which are proposed in this Bill, will by no means represent the last word that is to be said upon this question. Personally, I am in favour of universal old-age pensions, and believe that until we get them we shall not meet the real necessities of the case, nor deal out even-handed justice.",73
530,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,The method which we are now adopting is merely a pauperizing one.,73
531,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I do not believe in the pauperizing conditions which are imposed under the principal Act, and I am prepared to vote the necessary funds to permit of the payment of universal old age pensions.  making the age of sixty-five years the only qualification ?",73
532,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That.is my own view. That being so, I ' shall vote for every liberalising amendment which may be submitted. There is one point to which I wish to direct special attention, namely, the desirableness of including residents of Papua within the scope of the Bill. I ask the Treasurer to look into this question before the House meets to-morrqw, with a view to seeing whether he cannot support an amendment which I desire to effect, ir* the interpretation section of the principal Act. When I was recently in Papua this matter was brought under my notice by a deputation, and also by the Governor, whoexpressed the hope"" that when the principal Act was amended the disability to which I have referred would be removed. As honourable members are aware, Papua is a Territory of the Commonwealth. Practically alJ its white residents are Australians, and in - the natural order of things most of them will return to their homes before very longIt would be a distinct injustice to exclude them from participating in the benefits conferred by this Bill, seeing that they are assisting in the development of one of our own territories. All our public offices there are filled by Australians. . We invite applications for positions In the Possession, and as we appoint public officers from the Commonwealth to administer its affairs, it is obviously unjust to debar them from becoming eligible to receive old-age pensions. Whilst I was in the Possession I promised to move in this matter. I have no doubt that the Government will agree to my suggestion. I shall also endeavour to remove from the principal Act one of its worse blots- I refer to the provision which excludes Asiatics from becoming recipients of old-age pensions merely because they are Asiatics. If we admit them to full citizen.ship we are doing an absolutely contemptible thing by excluding them from the right to obtain a pension merely because they are Asiatics. I hope that in Committee the principal Act will be so amended as to remove this blot. Debate (on motion by Dr MALONEY) adjourned. NORFOLK ISLAND BILL.

538,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The - thing is beneath notice.,74
539,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I should not have referred to it were the facts of the case properly represented. Amongst other Apropos of nothing in particular, the Leader of the Opposition blazed up into a sudden fit of wrath, accusing the Government of throwing aside all the decencies and courtesies of life. That is not so. Honourable members will recollect that the reason why the Leader of the Opposition was indignant in his reply on Friday was on account of an extraordinary statement made by the Prime Minister in regard to the division that had just taken place. The article goes onto say that the honourable member for Maranoa stated that There had grown up a custom of providing, on. nights of late sittings, a free supper for Government supporters and a free cab to take them home. The Labour party, as a section of the Ministerial following, had always enjoyed these little perquisites. That is not so.",74
540,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Fro m what paper is the honourable member quoting?,74
541,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Fro m the Age of yesterday.,74
542,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Where is it published?,74
543,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I desire to say that all sections of the House have enjoyed similar courtesies on other occasions at the hands of other Governments.,74
544,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,And in other Parliaments.,75
545,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The same courtesies and hospitalities were extended by the Fisher Government, and were accepted by every section of this House. That remark applies not only to late sittings. I have the bills showing that honourable members accepted the hospitality of the Fisher Government just as members of the Fisher Ministry and their friends accepted hospitalities from previous Governments, not only on the occasion of late sittings, and not only in the form of cabs being provided-properl y so-for conveying honourable members home when the House sat late,- but also on the occasion of the prorogation.",75
546,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I feel some difficulty about permitting the honourable member to continue his remarks until I know whether he is making a personal explanation or not. Standing order 268 readsNo member shall read from a printed newspaper or book, the report of any speech made in Parliament during the same session. Of course, we always waive that limitation when personal explanations are being made. I could not prevent the honourable member from making a personal explanation. If he assures me that he is making a personal explanation, he may continue: but, if not under the standing order. I have quoted, I could not permit such extracts as I have referred to to be read.",75
547,Mr HUTCHITSON,Unknown,I desire to make a personal explanation. The article from which I was quoting eoes on to sayOn two or three nights during the recent debate some of the Labour speakers purposely delayed the sittings past midnight so as to compel Ministerialists to miss their trains.,75
548,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,That is a deliberate lie.,75
549,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Boothby remarks, that is a deliberate lie. To begin with, there were no debates continued until after midnight, and no honourable member on this side continued a debate in order that honourable members should miss their trains. article further saysOn the two or three nights of late sitting, when it wreaked its vengeance on Government supporters by compelling them to miss their trams and trains Government supporters were, as usual, indulged in free suppers and cabs at the private expense of Ministers, but, of course, the Labour members were omitted from these trifling luxuries. They were in another camp, and by all the laws of war and even decency thrown upon their own resources. I am glad to say that that kind of thing has never been recognised in this House, whatever may have been our political differences. I for one would not care to remain in public life for one week if we were not able to extend ordinary social courtesies to each other. The article continuesEven Scrooge, though "" hard and sharp as flint,"" would not have expected the man with whom he was at open war to ask him to supper and pay for his cab home. That was reserved on Friday last for the Australian Federal Labour party. That was not so. I have described the position as it always existed. The article continuesIt has proclaimed aloud to the world that it is willing to feed at the expense of its foes; accept graceful courtesies from people whom it reviles as beneath contemptThe only other extract I shall make is thisThe Prime Minister said that the Government took the entire responsibility of the course followed, as the Labour party had gone out of its way to declare all withdrawals of ordinary courtesies from Ministers, and had therefore, it was to be presumed, placed itself beyond the acceptance of hospitality. I want to say that this is not so. The Government will admit that honourable members on this side of the House granted pairs for the last division taken. There was no caucus resolution in regard to pairs at all. The granting of pairs rests entirely, as it always has done, with honourable members themselves.",75
550,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,Is that so now?,75
551,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Yes ; and if it were not so, 1 should not say that it was.",75
552,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I was refused a pair by an honourable member who sits on the front Opposition bench.,75
553,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is quite another thing. To show how courteous honourable members on this side have been, let me say that when the Supply Bill was being , 1 discussed at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, and because an arrangement had been made and agreed to between the leaders on either side to allow the Government to have a vote on a particular night, The I resumed my seat without completing my remarks. What was the result of that courtesy ? We immediately found the honourable members for Wentworth and Fremantle, and even the Prime Minister himself, getting up and delaying business after that courtesy had been extended from this side. But that did not end our courtesy. In the middle of my utterances on the want of confidence motion, and at the desire of the Government, I was requested to ask - leave to continue my remarks, and I did so. If any of the statements which I have quoted from the Age article were true, these things would not have taken place. I think that it is only due to the members of this House to show the country the disgraceful tactics that are being adopted by the press to misrepresent honourable members on this side.",75
554,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [ n . 1 0 ] to ask the Treasurer if he proposes to order the new coinage from England before the proposed Bill dealing with coinage is passed-by this House? If so, I intend to take every opportunity to protest against what I understand is to be done. I was told by the Treasurer today that on the new coinage there is to be a representation of the King's head with the words "" King and Emperor.""' This is a matter to which I referred before in this House, on the first dav on which the Federal Parliament met. On the 21st May, 1901, I made reference to the wrongful use of the word "" Emperor,""' by whoever prepared a certain document for the King to send here. Amongst other things, I saidTbe records of the' English House of Commons will show that when the Royal Titlrs Bill was passed Mr John Bright and Mr Lowe, who was afterwards Lard Sherbrooke, strongly protested against the use of this word Emperor in regard to India. It was pointed out by Mr. Bright that in the course of time the title of Emperor would be used, not only in regard to India, but would also be extended to Canada and other parts of the Empire until it came home to England. It was only after repeated assurances, to which I can refer' honourable members if desired, given by the Government of the day that that word should never be used in any community outside of India, and should be used in regard to India, and India only, that the word Emperor was allowed to remain in the Bill . The new coinage proposed is intended to circulate only in Australia. If it were proposed that it should be an Empire coinage, or that it should circulate in India, where the title Emperor might properlv appear on coinage, there would be something in the proposal. We know the title of "" K in g , "" and we know tnat it has a constitutional - meaning which has been the growth of cen turies. It is the only title used in the Commonwealth Constitution, and the use ""of the title "" Emperor "" mav impose to the extent .that that title.exceeds the title of "" K in g , "" some autocratic, power differing from that of the constitutional Sovereign we know, and whose position is recognised and understood. If on the new coinage to be cir' [S°] culated in Australia, the word ""Emperor"" appears, it ma\ be assumed to involve all - sorts of things in the way of the power of "" autocracy in excess of the power of a constitutional King. I protest against what is proposed to be done; and I wish now to give notice th.it should the Coinage Bill make provision lor what 1 understand is proposed, so far as I can influence any votes in this House, I . shall endeavour to - I wish . have a clause inserted in the Bill which will provide that the word '.' Emperor"" .shall not appear on the coinage.",76
555,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,-What is the hon- . orahle member's objection?,76
556,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"That the proposed new coinage, which is to be circulated only in Australia, should bear a representation of the King's head, and underneath the words "" King and Emperor."" Such a 'thing would not be allowed in England or in Canada.",76
557,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I think the words' are to be on the same side of the coin as the King's head.,76
558,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"What , does that matter. Is the King Emperor of Australia ? And, if so, what is meant by that title?",76
559,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Is this a recommendation from England?,76
560,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I do not know where it comes from ; but it is a very bad recommendation. Mr KING 0 ' MAI . LEV - It is a violation of the essence of Democracy.,76
561,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I do not accept that interjection; but I hold that is bringing into the Constitution an unknown force and power. The King I am loyal to. The "" Emperor"" is an Asiatic assumption. The matter is one in connection with which I think a protest should be made, just as I made a similar protest on the first 'lay on which the Federal Parliament met against anv attempt to use this title to describe the Sovereign of a constitutional people. Mr THOMAS . :BROWN' (Calare) [11.14] - Before the Prime Minister replies, I should like to ask whether he has noticed an - article in this evening's Herald .headed, "" Our Defences. Is the Service Rotten? Startling Statements. An Inquiry Demanded. Sergeant-Major Daly's Request."" Sergeant-Major Daly was in the Defence Farce in New South Wales for some considerable time; and, so far as I know, had a very good record. Recently he was placeil under arrest, and has since been court-martialled. I had a conversation with him, during which he informed me chat he intended to take the step which he has taken. He went from Molong to Sydney, and there placed his resignation in the hands of the military authorities as a preliminary to having his case investigated. He was charged, with behaving in a discourteous fashion, and was put under arrest, it being stated that he had informed his commanding officer that he would not be "" found dead in such a rotten service."" I gather from the newspaper account that he has formulated some very serious charges. I shall not read them; but as, for several years past, our military service has been in an unsatisfactory condition, I ask Ministers whether the time has riot arrived for a searching inquirv by a Commission of experts to ascertain the causes?",76
562,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [ri.ifi] - The cons now in circulation bear the inscription "" Britanniarum Omnium Rex Indiae Imperator,"" and the words "" King and Emperor "" are a short English rendering of the phrase.",77
563,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"On the present coins the monarch is described as King of Britain wd Emperor of lnd'a. We might very veil put on our coins, "" King of Austraaa,"" but not "" Emperor.""",77
564,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On e side of the proposed coin may be regarded as Imperial, and there will appear the title, ""King and Emperor,"" without further definition. On the reverse, which is the Australian side, will be represented the physical contour of the Commonwealth. The words used on the Imperial side are a free and short tran.Jation of the title on the present coins,, and there can be no trespass of regal or Imperial authority in consequence. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at xi.18 p.m. ;",77
