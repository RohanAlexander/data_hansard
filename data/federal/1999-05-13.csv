(2) With respect to each project or program referred to in part (1), (a) what is its name, (b) who operates it, (c) what are its aims and objectives, what funding has it received and (e) in what year did Commonwealth funding commence.",166
35,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commonwealth does not provide funding directly to organisations except through the National lllicit Drug Strategy. Under the Public Health Outcomes Funding Agreements (PHOFAs), New South Wales receives a grant for public health initiatives including drugs. The State determines the priorities and organisations funded. Under the Nationallllicit Drug Strategy, $10.16 million has been allocated directly to non-government organisations in New South Wales for new and existing illicit drug treatment services. Details of the organisations funded under the instalment were provided in my Media Release of 28 August 1998. (2) Not applicable. Native Title: Legal Aid (Question No. 375) Mr MCClelland asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 8 February 1999: (1) Is legal aid available to native title respondParagraph ents; if so, are applicants required to demonstrate financial hardship. (2) Is the legal aid referred to in part (1) availcant able to corporations as well as individuals; if so, a corporation which is a respondent to a native title NA claim entitled to legal aid regardless of its income or profitability. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Financial assistance for native title matters may be provided to respondents and non-claimant applicants under: Section 183 of the Native Title Act; Special Circumstances (Native Title) Scheme in those cases where assistance may not be available under s 183; and Common Law (Native Title) Scheme to assist persons involved in common law native title claims. (d) Financial assistance may be granted where: the applicant is not eligible to receive assistance from any other source; the provision of assistance to the applicant is in accordance with the guidelines determined under sub-section 183(4); and in all the circumstances, it is reasonable that the application be granted. Section 183 of the Native Title Act was amended to remove the need for the applicant to establish 'hardship' before assistance could be granted. However, underÂ· the current guidelines financial considerations are one of a number of factors that may be taken into account in assessing any application for assistance. It should be noted that fmancial assistance for native title matters is administered separately from first the Commonwealth's legal aid funding, which is administered through State and Territory legal aid commissions. (2) Financial assistance is available to individuals, partnerships, small businesses, local government bodies and other organisations. Incorporated bodies as well as unincorporated bodies may be eligible for assistance. As stated above, under the current guidelines, financial considerations. are one of a number of factors which may be taken into account in assessing any application for assistance. 6.7 of the Guidelines provides that any person who has significant fmancial backing is unlikely to be provided assistance. Where the appliis not a natural person consideration will be is given to its financial position and whether other financial resources may be available to it, eg guarantees from directors, provision of further funds from shareholders and levies from members. Superannuation: Compulsory Contributions Investigations (Question No. 504) Mr Ripoll asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 March 1999: (1) Is it a fact that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has changed its practice from investigating every complaint against employers for non-payment of compulsory superannuation contributions to gathering the information in a database and developing profiles of industries and employers where compliance is a problem; if so, (a) is the information used to conduct targeted investigation and education measures, (b) when was the practice of investigating every complaint changed,(c) how many complaints of non-payment of compulsory superannuation contributions (i) were investigated annually under the previous practice and (ii) are conducted annually under the existing practice.and (d) what effect will the change have on persons affected by non-compliance. (2) Will the Government ensure that the ATO acts on every reported breach of the superannuation guarantee regulations to protect the entitlements of Australian workers, particularly low-income workers. (3) Will the Government provide legal aid to enable low-paid workers to act against their employers when the ATO has failed to act. (4) What is the (a) cost of, and (b) number of ATO employees involved in, compliance activities concerning (i) PAYE taxpayers, (ii) business taxpayers and (iii) compulsory superannuation contribution by employers. (5) Is the ATO's superannuation compliance unit adequately resourced. Mr Costello---The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is using its resources to ensure maximum possible coverage of the Superannuation Guarantee (SG). The ATO has changed its compliance approach in respect of SG. We have adopted the ATO compliance model which means putting into place best practice by tracking compliance patterns and the causes of non-compliance by employers with the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (the SGAA). This data is analysed and appropriate compliance activities occur. Under the new strategy all employers identified in employee notifications will receive a reminder of their superannuation obligations. Further to this, high risk employers will be included in a compliance project and subject to further investigation. (1) (a) The information obtained from notifications by employees is recorded on a computer database along with other risk indicators of non-compliance: anonymous 'dob-ins', referrals. from other areas of the ATO, etc. This information is analysed and this analysis assists the ATO to better target those cases that need further investigation. (1) (b) The review of the ATO's compliance strategy for compulsory superannuation contributions was undertaken in October 1998, and the new approach implemented between November 1998 and February 1999. (1) (c) (i) Approximately 5,000 notifications annually were investigated under the previous practice. (1) (c) (ii) See answer to Question 1 above. (1) (d) The new strategy will also address the superannuation entitlements of persons who currently do not contact the ATO about the non-compliance of their employer. In many cases this is because the employee is unaware of their entitlements. Typically, industries involving lower skilled, lower paid work represent the greatest risk. The strategy seeks to increase overall compliance in an industry or employer group, thereby increasing the number of employees receiving their entitlements. The education campaign undertaken by the ATO last year with the key message ""Super-It pays to take an interest"" is an example of a strategy to inform employees as a way of improving compliance by employers. (2) All reports of non-compliance by employers with their compulsory superannuation obligations are valuable to the ATO in targeting their compliance action. This information is actively sought from employees when they contact the ATO and recorded on a compliance database. Past evidence shows that 'one to one' follow up in not appropriate and imposes unnecessary costs on employers who have made superannuation contributions. At the point of initial contact employees are advised that it is ,in their interest to first check with their employer, or the relevant superannuation fund if known, before providing information about their employer to the ATO. Callers are also advised that action may not be taken immediately in respect of the information they provide, but that all the information we receive is recorded and used to guide and target compliance at particular industries, regions and other employer 'groups'. The shift to a more proactive and leveraged compliance strategy, based on analysis of the employee notifications and other risk indicators, is a productive way of making the most of the ATO's resources to ensure all employees receive their entitlements. (3) No. The Superannuation Guarantee Charge (the charge) is a debt owed by the employer to the Commonwealth and the employee has no recourse to legal action under the SGAA to enforce the payment of the charge . (4) It is not possible to provide precise figures for the resources allocated to compliance activities for PAYE, compulsory superannuation and business taxpayers as these three groups are not distinct segments (ie, they overlap) and an integrated, cross ATO approach is adopted where possible. For example, examination of compliance with compulsory superannuation is included in the audit of business taxpayers for withholding taxes (pAYE) and income taxes. To provide an indication of the relative allocation of resources to P AYE, compulsory superannuation and business taxpayers however the following figures (for the 1997-1998 year) may assist: Large Business and International (Income Tax)1196 staff Small Business Income (Income Tax)-2948 staff Individuals Non Business (Income Tax)-4033 staff Withholding and Indirect Taxes (PAYE, PPS, Sales T-)-2750 staff Superannuation (Compulsory Super)-671 staff Source: Commissioner of Taxation, Annual Report, 1997-1998 (5) Superannuation Guarantee compliance activity is adequately resourced. The ATO believes its new strategy for Superannuation Guarantee compliance will enable it to maximise the compliance of employers through improved compliance intelligence and analysis, and targeted compliance projects including educative, reminder and audit measures. The organisational structure of the area has been redesigned to focus resources specifically on compliance activities relating to compulsory superannuation. The ATO's survey of employer compliance with compulsory superannuation requirements conducted in 1998 demonstrated that although a small number of employers are fully non-compliant, of equal concern is the rate of partial compliance where employers are making errors in attempting to comply, or are not fully aware of their obligations. The new strategy addresses this area of compliance risk through educative, information and reminder activities. At the same time, audit and investigative action is targeted at those employers aware of the requirements but choosing not to comply. The shift in strategy is a recent one and the ATO will continue to review the effectiveness of its approach to compliance. The ATO is confident that it will be able to build on the already high rate of compliance, increasing the coverage of superannuation for all employees, to their benefit in retirement. Sydney Olympic Games: Tickets (Question No. 515) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, upon notice, on 23 March 1999: Is it a fact that (a) the Government paid $1.2 million for tickets to the Sydney Olympics for entertaining visiting dignitaries and (b) it had initially asked for the tickets to be provided without cost; if so, (i) who initially raised the issue of free tickets with the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), (ii) on what date was the issue first discussed, (iii) how many free tickets were requested, (iv) how many tickets were purchased, (v) for what events were the tickets purchased, (vi) what criteria apply to distributing the tickets, (vii) how many departmental officers are establishing the criteria, (viii) what is the cost of using departmental officers to establish the criteria, (ix) will the Government meet the (A) travel costs to and from Australia and (B) expenses of the visiting dignitaries; if so, what are the details and (x) will she publish a list of the recipients of the tickets. Miss Jackie Kelly-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Government has not yet purchased any tickets for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Out of the $32.0 million allocated by the Government for payment to New South Wales to enable the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) to purchase services, facilities and equipment to assist with the staging of the Games, some $850,000 has been earmarked for the purchase of tickets to enable the Commonwealth to extend hospitality to visiting international dignitaries and business people at the Olympic Games as part of its broader strategy to maximise the national benefits of the Games. (b) (i) and (ii) Yes. The matter was raised by Commonwealth officials and staff of the Office of the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games as part of the initial negotiations with SOCOG over Commonwealth assistance for the Games in January 1998. SOCOG subsequently agreed that the cost of tickets would in fact be met from the total funding provided by the Commonwealth. (iii) Some 400 tickets per day were initially sought for the Olympic Games, with a similar allocation for the Paralympic Games, and an additional 200 Olympic tickets per day for distribution to the general public. (iv) No tickets have as yet been purchased. Precise requirements are not expected to be finalised until later when there is a clearer picture of number of dignitaries visiting. (v) Tickets will be purchased for a range of Olympic events including the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. (vi) Criteria are being developed by the Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Foreign Affairs and Trade and by Austrade. (vii) A number of officers across several agencies as part of their normal work on the Games. (viii) No additional costs are being incurred. (ix) (A) and (B) There is currently no intention to meet the travel costs or accommodation expenses of government dignitaries visiting Australia for the Sydney 2000 Games. (x) A full list of the recipients of tickets purchased by the Commonwealth to Games events will be available after the Games are concluded.

Work for the Dole Projects (Question No. 549) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 25 March 1999: Is it a fact that more than 76 per cent of workfor-the-dole projects have been carried out in electoral divisions held by Coalition Members; if so, what action is he taking to ensure that national distribution of the projects is fairly balanced. Mr Abbott The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Round 1 of Work for the Dole was announced in July 1998, in which 71 per cent of the 227 successful project sponsors were located in Government electorates. However, many of these successful projects have multiple sites (534 in total) of which 64 per cent were situated in Government electorates. September 1998 September 1997 December 1994 November 1992 February 1990 Round 2 of Work for the Dole was announced in December 1998, in which 56 per cent of the 236 successful project sponsors were located in Government electorates. Of the 688 separate work sites, only 48 per cent were in Government electorates. To put these figures into context, at the time of the Round 1 announcement, 64 per cent of House of Representatives seats were held by Government members. At Round 2, 55 per cent of seats were held by the Government. The entire selection and allocation of Work for the Dole projects is undertaken by officials from the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business in accordance with strict guidelines and at every stage this is closely oversighted by Probity Advisers. Once officials have completed their selection process all recommendations for Work for the Dole projects are confirmed by an independent national selection committee. Work for the Dole projects are allocated by Labour Market Regions of which there are 29 across Australia. Allocation of projects was targeted to regions with high unemployment and hence many regional areas of Australia were targeted. No allocation is made by electorate. At no stage are Government members involved in the assessment, selection or location of any Work for the Dole projects. Migration Agents Regulation Authority: Migration Agents Conduct (Question No. 571) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 31 March 1999: (1) During the Migration Agents Regulation Authority's (MARA) first three months of operation, (a) against which migration agents were complaints made, (b) what was the name of each agent whose registration was suspended and (c) what was the period of suspension in each case. (2) What penalties can MARA apply to agents who breach MARA's code of conduct, other that suspension of registration. (3) Is there a need to improve migration agents' conduct, especially because, many agents are lodging applications which they know have no chance of success and which are designed to delay their clients being made to leave Australia; if so, does his Department record for each migration agent (a) how many applications they lodge (b) their success rate and (c) the fees charged for the service they perform. (4) Who will the Government consult, other than MARA, on ways to further improve migration agents' , conduct. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) It is not possible to provide able Member the names of agents against whom complaints were made. Unless the name of an agent has been published because of a decision by the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA) to cancel or suspend the agent's registration, the names of agents who are subject to complaints are not made publicly available. To do so may prejudice the agent, especially where the complaint has been resolved in the agent's favour or has not been resolved. (b) One agent, Mr John (Qun) Du had his registration suspended in the period. (c) The period of suspension was for six months. (2) Under section 303 of the Migration Act 1958, MARA may cancel the agent's registration by removing his or her name from the Register of Migration' Agents, or caution the agent. When an agent has been cautioned, that fact is included on the Register for the period of the caution. (3) Yes. MARA was established to undertake this function and has taken firm action to discipline agents who have been involved in unethical conduct. Regarding visa applications with ""no chance of success"", my Department in consultation with the Migration Institute of Australia is examining ways of further strengthening the Code of Conduct to to the honouraddress this matter. (a) The Departmental data base records whether a visa applicant has been assisted by a migration agent. . (b) The Department does not collect information relating to the number of applications lodged by a particular agent or on the success rate. (c) Agents are not required to inform the Department about fees charged for services. (4) The Government will consider constructive proposals from any source to improve migration agents' conduct. The Code of Conduct will be examined by the review of statutory self-regulation which is being conducted by officers of my Department and guided by a Reference Group of independent experts.",167
