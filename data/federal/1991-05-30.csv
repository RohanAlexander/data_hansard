And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mrs Bailey (from 41 citizens), Mr Chaney (from 18 citizens) and Mr Reid (from 68 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. - That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. - That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. - That in 1989/90 alone Medicare provided medical benefits for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Brereton (from 27 citizens), Dr Harry Edwards (from 60 citizens) and Mr Fitzgibbon (from 353 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. - That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. - That the Government's first duty is to proTelevision tect this right to life. - That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. - That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. - That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr MCGauran (from 108 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every human being, from the first instance of fertilization, is of unique and precious value, not only to him/herself, but also to his/her parents and to the community at large. - That every abortion kills a human being before his/her birth. - That the right to life of all human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights according to article 3 of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. - That the primary duty of the Parliament is to protect this inalienable right to life of all citizens, born and unborn. - That in 1989/90 alone, medical benefits were paid for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to Australian tax-payers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of all Australian citizens before birth by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare and by other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 206 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn baby. - That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. - That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. - That in 1989/90 alone Medicare subsidised 69,587 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will protect the right to life of unborn Australian babies by ceasing to subsidise abortions through Medicare by passing the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990 and t-y all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Burr (from 38 citizens) and Mr Smith (from 153 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: l. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements. 2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble. 3. will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: 1. By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) arc debated by the Parliament. 2. The Parliament take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regard to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibil ities of parents. by Mr Cadman (from 199 citizens) and Mr Smith (from seven citizens). Political Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled; the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we call upon Honourable Members to reject legislation denying Australians the right to advertise political material on radio and television, believing such a ban to be arbitrary and discriminatory, a denial of freedom of speech and a curtailment of criticism (or support) of political parties and/or their policies. And your petitioners as in duty bound will every pray. by Mr Moore (from three citizens) and Mr Reith (from 191 citizens). Political Advertising To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia expressing complete opposition to the banning of political advertising, and regard any ban as: - a denial of the freedom of speech; - promoting the government in power by allowing the continuation of government department advertising; - a guise to cover a move toward massive direct-mail campaigns which will make the removal of sitting members a virtual impossibility. Your petitioners therefore pray that: 1. The Parliament rejects any move to abolish political advertising; and 2. Parliament enacts legislation to abolish public funding of political parties, which costs taxpayers up to $13 million each election, and acts to artificially boost expenditure on political advertising. by Mr Cadman (from nine citizens). Firearms To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Federal electorate of Riverina draws to the attention of the house that we are of the opinion that the clauses appertaining to firearms in the so called ""Generic Statement"" are nothing short of a deceitful attempt by the Federal Government to take the control of firearms laws away from the States and into the Federal sphere of control. We believe this is contrary to our State's rights as guaranteed in our constitution. Your petitioners therefore pray that the house reject all aspects of the Generic Statcment as being contrary to the State's rights of control, and private ownership of, the firearms discriminated against in the above mentioned ""Generic Statement"". by Mr Hicks (from 324 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits-Hormone Replacement Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Hormone Replacement Therapy in the form of implants is cssential and ongoing for a woman to rcplacc natural hormones after certain surgical procedures i.e. complete hysterectomy, but expensive and, as so, could become socially discriminating without Government assistance. Your petitioners therefore request the House to recommend to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Authority that they allow placement of Hormone Replacement Therapy on the free-list, enabling costs to be more equitable for all women in need of this essential and ongoing treatment and thereby eliminating social injustice. by Mr MCGauran (from 296 citizens). Medicare: Abortions The Honourable Speaker and Members of the proceedings. House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicarc. Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy. Those who will be hardest hit by proposals to restrict access 6469, 274 and 275 on the Medicarc schedule poorer and disadvantaged women who will be able to meet the cost of a non-subsidised abortion. Your petitioners humbly pray and request that the House will vote against any attempt to restrict access to abortion or any abortion-related items on the Medicarc schcdule. by Ms MCHugh (from 60 citizens). Tobacco Sponsorship To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: We, the undersigned citizens, express our utmost concern that our national Parliament should discriminate unfairly against those who choose to smoke and the tobacco industry, by proposing new taxes on smokers and introducing unique marketing restrictions on the industry. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: a. support the right of sporting and cultural groups to choosc their own sponsor; b. support the right of tobacco companies to sponsor sport and cultural events; and c. reject the proposal that smokers be singled out as the source of funding sport through a special and additional tax levy on tobacco products. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Tuckey (from 43 citizens). NA NA Report",12
3,Mr KERR,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I present the report of the Committee entitled Review of Auditor-General's Report No. 12, 1990-91-Abori/?inal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Community Development Employment Projects, together with the minutes of Ordered that the report be printed.",14
4,Mr KERR,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"The Auditor-General's report raises a number of issues in relation to the effective and efficient administration of the community development employment project (CDEP) scheme which operates within the framework of the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy to items (AEDP). The Committee's review is not a are review of the policy that underpins the not CDEP program, but of the key findings by the Auditor-General's office which undertook an efficiency audit of the scheme. These key audit findings include the importance of community development plans, bcttcr targcting of activities funded under CD EP, the correction of anomalies in relation to the payment of unemployment benefit, family allowance supplement and award wage rates, an increased emphasis on the need for training and an improvement in the administration, management and financial accountability procedures for CDEP. By way of very brief background, the CDEP scheme was first introduced in 1977 in some remote Aboriginal communities wherc there was little or no prospect of employment or economic development. It is now a fully fledged Aboriginal employment program with a budget of more than $180m for 1990-91, with some 18,000 people participating in the scheme. The Committee held a public hearing on 14 March of this year to investigate areas highlighted by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). Our review is based On evidence given at that hearing by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (A TSIC), the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the Department of Social Security (DSS) on written submissions by those agencies. I will not attempt to review all the recommendations made by this Committee in its review-they are laid out in the report itself-but I would like to take a short time today to highlight a number of significant aspects of those recommcndations. The Committee report reinforces the strength of the CDEP, which is now a significant program in the ATSIC portfolio. Our report states: The committee finds that CDEP is proving to be a sound and effective scheme that has much to offer. However, given the rapid rate of sion of the scheme and the administrative issues of scale and complexity that have arisen as a consequence of this, there is considerable scope for improved efficiency. This process of expansion within the newly evolving agency of ATSIC is also impacting on statutory and program tionships with DSS and DEET. This unforeseen growth is a measure of the success of CDEP, but has meant that effective review and monitoring processes have lagged behind the development of the scheme. The acceptance of the CDEP by Aboriginal communities has been noted by the Committee on its many visits to remote Aboriginal communities during the course of its different inquiries and this is an important endorsement for the scheme. However, there are a number of aspects of the management and administration of CDEP at all levels of its operation that need serious and sustained attention. Ultimately, the success of the scheme will depend on the ability of ATSIC, DEET and, to some extent, DSS to grapple with and solve these problems. The key areas highlighted for improvement by the Committee are: first, ATSIC's policy framework and organisational management of the CDEP scheme; secondly, the administrative and financial management of CDEP; and, thirdly, CDEP's linkages and program relativities with DEET and DSS. There must also be a greater emphasis on better planning and evaluation for CDEP. The Committee found it difficult to gain a clear statement of the objectives of the CDEP program and what key performance measures are used to judge the success of the scheme. There is considerable anecdotal evidence that is critical of the CDEP. While this is not a reasonable way to address the scheme, it will continue to attract such criticism until proper review mechanisms are in place. For this reason the Committee emphasises the importance of the full review of the AEDP which will include CDEP in 1992-93. The need for ongoing consultation and negotiation with Aboriginal communities is also of fundamental importance and it is for this reason that the Committee expanmakes a point of re-emphasising the need for community development plans for CDEP, to involve communities in a structural way in their own development. The need for effective community derela- velopment planning is again something that has been reinforced by the Committee's visits to a range of Aboriginal communities. Improved and ongoing training and support of managers for local CDEP projects are also crucial to the success of the scheme. It cannot be overemphasised. The Committee accepts the difficulties in establishing successful training schemes, as outlined in our report, but considers that ATSIC and DEET should be achieving more and be able to measure the success of the existing programs. A clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities of both ATSIC and DEET is needed, together with better linking between the two agencies on the whole issue of training. However, coordination between ATSIC and DSS is improving and developing in the areas of procedural arrangements and payments. The Committee would, however, like to see closer links in the area of policy development. CDEP requires certain flexibility to enable it to operate and this will require a coordinated policy response from both DSS and ATSIC to facilitate the growth of CDEP and its expansion beyond remote communities. In this context, I would like to flag the possibility of CDEP as a model for other situations of entrenched unemployment. I realise that this can be a contentious issue, but the success of CDEP may well have some lessons for the wider community. It will, therefore, be interesting to note the success or otherwise of CDEP in non-remote areas as a possible model for those in need of assistance to progress to full employment. Before closing I would like to say a few kind words about the Audit Office and its constructive approach to reviewing CDEP. It has taken a positive and forward looking approach to the need for ATSIC to move into a fully operational mode and for the CDEP scheme to become fully established as a major ATSIC program. I also note in passing the very fulsome cooperation that we have received from the officers of ATSIC and the other two agencies that are involved. I would also like to place on record the Committee's thanks to Ms Maree Bowman, who was with the Committee for some months on a placement under the executive development scheme and whose work was central to the drafting of this report. Certainly, it would be remiss of me not to place on record our gratitude to her in this regard. The audit report does not pull any punches about the need for CDEP to improve its effectiveness, efficiency and accountability, but it does acknowledge the need for realistic time frames to achieve this. The Committee endorses this approach in its review and has placed a heavy emphasis on the full review of AEDP and CDEP in 1992-93 as a point in time by which significant progress will need to be achieved in a demonstrable way on the recommendations we have made. It now remains for ATSIC, DEET and DSS to take account of the recommendations of this Committee and to come back to us with a response to these recommendations. As I said before, we have been immensely warmed and pleased by the constructive approach of ATSIC and its officers, DEET and the Department of Social Security and by the constructive way they indicated that they would be working towards these objectives. We will be looking for quantifiable measures of progress for this scheme and see feedback from the agencies as an important conclusion to the process of presenting audit reports to parliamentary committees for review.",14
5,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"This is a review of an audit report to the Parliament. The audit concerns the community development employment projects scheme (CDEP), which is the single biggest scheme in the Aboriginal affairs budget. Our report is necessarily limited to those issues raised by the audit. In spite of this limitation, the review does, however, raise broader questions and strategic issues for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) and the Department of Social Security (DSS) that simply cannot be ignored. The recommendations as outlined in the report include six that I wish to highlight. They are: first, improved planning and evaluation for CDEP within the framework of the Aboriginal employment development program; second, ,an identification of key result areas against which the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme can be measured; third, a restating of the importance of commu-ity development plans; fourth, the t-rg-tmg of COEP projects to defined obJectIves; fifth improved training and developmen'tal support for communitie- .and the staff overseeing those commumtles; and sixth, through this, a capacity t,o .achi-ve increased financial and admInIstratlve competence. I find it very disturbing that in the single largest program in the Aboriginal Affairs budget, we have to. make these sorts of recommendations. CDEP is supported as an effective scheme t-at is acceptable to Aboriginal peopl-. It IS - good scheme that is not avaIlable In eqUIvalent forms to other groups with special needs in the community where graduated employment programs might assist people to pursue economic independence and the dignity of employment. It has my personal support as shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I sec CDEP as continuing as part of the Aboriginal employment development po-­ icy at least in the foreseeable future. It IS worth putting the effort into CDEP to make it a fully operational, viable and accountable government program. At the moment it is not. Considerable work and energy need to be put into CDEP's. growth and development, and the CommIttee report acknowledges that this work has been put in. There is reason for concern, however that the same effort is not being put into 'the planning and review process. It is noted, for example, that annual reviews of the CDEP scheme have not occurred although they were originally scheduled. The last major public review of CDEP was the Miller report in 1985, which led to the current phase of expansion. What we are left with, in the absence of such publicly accessible review processes, are facts and figures relating to the scheme and details of procedures and guidelines relating to CDEP. These are welcome, but they indicate the process by which improvements are made. They are not outcomes; they are not ends in themselves. In particular, I would like to comment on the lack of availability of a current, viable corporate plan for ATSIC that would set qualitative and quantitative outcomes for programs. Throughout the review and the audit report, it was not possible to obtain details of performance indicators for CDEP, against which such outcomes can be measured. Such material would normally be available through the mechanism of a corporate plan. ATSIC has been going for 15 months and still does not have a corporate plan-that is pathetic. I recall from public hearings that such a corporate plan is in the pipeline. I look forward to seeing the document and anticipate its preparation sooner rather than later. I put ATSIC, the Depart-en- of - oeial Security and DEET on notIce 111 thIS regard and place particular emphasis o- the Committec's first two recommcndatIOns: firstly, that planning, review an.d evaluation activity for the 1992-93 revIew of the Aboriginal employment development program should be commenced as soon. as possible, so that it is eoordin-ted With current review procedures and IS part of a publicly visible and accessible process; secondly, that the 1992-93 review of Aboriginal employment development program should constitute a major assessment of all aspects of the CDEP within which the Aboriginal employment development program framework can cover policy issues efficiency, effectiveness, administrative 'competence and coordination between kcy agencies. In many ways, these recommendations set the framework for dealing with the other issues raised in the report in respect of the management of CDEP, administrative competence at all levels of the scheme, significantly improved financial procedures and the accountability of CDEP as a program. DEET will also need to look at its performance indicators and outcome measures for the training support that it supplies to CDEP. Again, I note that no formal revi-- of the evaluation process of its Abong1l1al training program has been undertaken and such an evaluation is planned for the future-it has not yet been done. Questions that need to be asked in this area of training include: what are the aims of the training program; what are the strategies used and why; what is the time frame that is being set; what has been achieved; what has proven a success and what has not; how does this link into future planning? Is this all basic, fundamental stuff? It does not seem to apply in Aboriginal affairs. I have highlighted training, but this set of questions could equally be applied to other issues, such as administrative procedures, financial accountability, improved linkages with the Department of Social Security and DEET, planning and assessment of individual CDEP projects to ensure that the objectives are being met, CDEP funding arrangements between DSS and ATSIC, and so on through the various recommendations of the report. While supporting the CDEP scheme itself, it must be confirmed, as the Committee said in its report, that the lack of formal planning and review mechanisms has led proponents of CDEP to rely too much on statements of intent and good news stories. That is all we seem to hear coming from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission today-good news stories. In the last two months, I have worked as a doctor at Hermannsburg in the Northern Territory, which was highlighted on a Four Corners program just a number of weeks ago. I have also travelled through outback Queensland to places such as Cunnamulla. The good news stories I would like to see are that the number of infants evacuated from Hermannsburg due to diarrhoea has dropped over a three-year period due to a program that we have run, or that the number of Aboriginal kids in Cunnamulla who receive basic, infant vaccinations has reached close to 100 per cent because of a program over three years. They are not the good news stories we hear. We hear all about the process, all about what is being done. We do not hear about outcomes. We do not hear about successes. Quite frankly, in my opinion in many parts of Australia things are going backwards. They are being masked by the incompetence that has been raised in this report. This is an approach for the future: to look at goals, benchmarks and outcomes. It would have been possible to take a much harsher, much more critical approach in this report, but we have chosen not to. Howevcr, if in the future these deficiencies still remain unaddressed, a much harsher approach will be taken. There can be no furthcr extension of time to establish accountability and basic administrative competencc for the CDEP program. I said on 17 September last year, when we released the report Our Future, Our Selves, ATSIC was on notice in terms of its accountability, Some eight months later it is still on notice. I would like to reemphasise this position and will be watching for the implementation of the recommendations of this report with considerable interest. Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who once again has steered this report through with the minimum of fuss and difficulty, and also to Maree Bowman, who is from the Department of Community Services and Health. She was seconded to our Committee on the executive development scheme, as a placement. She has handled this report with the utmost professional competence. I have enjoyed working with her very much and, if her level of performance on this report is any indication, I am sure she has a very successful career ahead of her.",16
6,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"It gives me great pleasure to speak at this time. Firstly, I would like to endorse the remarks which have been made by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). Whilst I could support a great deal of what the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) had to say, I would like to take issue with him very vigorously, but with no animosity, on a number of the points which he raised, although now is not the time. There are some things about his judgment which I question. Without putting too fine a point on it, I think that I am uniquely placed in this Parliament to comment on the community development employment project (CDEP) and its operation. Some years ago, in 1978, I started work on a project with the Australian National University Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies with Dr H.C. Coombs and Dr Maria Brandl and we produced a book entitled A Certain Heritage, which was funded by the then Department of Social Security. That book has in part a section on CDEP. Whilst the detail of that book does not go into the detail of all of the work that we produced in relation to this matter it does go to some of the issues that were raised in the context of this Auditor-General's report. It shows that the problems which were there in 1978, 1979 and later to a large degree still remain. The question we have to ask is why. We have to go back to the very basis of CDEP and ask what it is for. I quote from a government document of 1979, which in respect of the essential objective of CDEP states: To respond to specifIc rcquests from communiwhich, ties for an alternative to unemployment benefits by paying for work done with a view to rcducing the socially deleterious effects of unemployment benefits-particularly in remote communities. I think we have to start from that basis. What we are seeing here is to a large degree an initiative by Aboriginal people, albeit something that was the brainchild, if you like, of Dr Coombs in 1976. It is an initiative by Aboriginal munities to come to terms with a social problem. Whilst it is fair and indeed reawhich, sonable to argue about accountability to argue about the necessity to ensure those bureaucracies that are involved in the administration of CDEP ought to do their job properly, the fundamental issue is to remember what the project is about. It is not a question of trying-and I am sure the honourable member for Chisholm was not so attempting-to undermine the project, because 1 know he supports it in principle. I could give him many good stories about the way in which CDEP operates, if that is what he is after. There are some stories, which in a sense we would all like not to hear, about a CDEP which has not worked effectively; about an administration of a CDEP scheme which has gone awry; and about the way in which the coordination between various Government agencies has not worked efficiently and appropriately, in a way we might like. I go back to the original point. The fundamental issue is that CDEP is to be seen as an initiative taken by Aboriginal people to come to terms with a problem in their communities. We, to an extent, have the responsibility of administering that scheme and ensuring that it meets their objectives. I am concerned to ensure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) does meet the mark when it comes to the administration of its programs, but I think we have to look at this in a far more objective manner. The honourable member for Chisholm and the honourable member for Denison have travelled widely in Australia and visited Aboriginal communities. One thing I would have thought, had been implanted within both honourable members is the notion of isolation-not so much from one another, but from bureaucracies. I do not mean isolation just from lack of personal contact, but isolation even from simple technology. The capacity for agencies like the Department of Social Security (DSS) or ATSIC or, for that matter, the Department of Employment, Edcomucation and Training (DEET) to comprehensively administer a project in reality, covers the remotest areas and of Australia and to come to terms with that the need to coordinate those processes using av:ailable technology in the best possible ways, ultimately means in my view that human error and human failure can be an explanation for almost anything. There is just not the technological capacity at present to provide the administrative backup and mechanisms which I think, and I am sure other members think, are necessary to ensure that these schemes work in such a way as to ensure that the failures which have been alluded to do not happen. They require supervision, constant monitoring and ensuring that people are not rorting the system. We have to examine all the issues. Whilst it is reasonable to argue that ATSIC and DSS need to be more responsible, we need to understand the difficulties within which they work. We need to understand that we are talking about people working in remote areas in these departments, who have to deal with a range of problems with which the honourable member for Chisholm and I come to terms occasionally. The honourable member for Chisholm worked at Hermannsburg for a couple of days and he should be applauded for doing that. He would have seen just a very small fraction of the problems that confront people who work in those conditions on a continual basis, the Northern Territory Department of Health, the Commonwealth departments and the Aboriginal health agencies; they have problems in dealing with each other in those areas. I would like to take the honourable member for Chisholm to task on a range of the things he has said. I do agree with him in broad terms about the need for accountability; let there be no doubt about that. But I think we need to be very careful that we do not put such a burden on the structures that are providing, in many senses, a very effective service to Aboriginal communities, that CDEP would become inoperable. If we reach that point, the whole game is over in terms of these initiatives which Aboriginal people in these remote communities are asking for to deal with a problem. In most of these communities, the chances of employment outside the council office, the school or the health service are minimal. Those employment opportunities have to be created and CDEP is the basis for creating those opportunities, providing there is ongoing training. It goes hand in hand with aspects of the report that deal with planning. To my way of thinking, the fundamental issue about the way in which CDEP operates is the notion of community development planning. If we do not have that basic planning process undertaken at the very start, then the opportunities to maximise the outcomes of CDEP and like projects, not only outcomes which we can measure but also outcomes which are administratively efficient, will go down the drain because we are doing it continually on an ad hoc basis. Planning is of fundamental importance to that process. It is something which I feel very deeply about. I point finally to one outstanding example of a successful CDEP program in operation. It has been run not in a very remote community but in the town camps around Alice Springs at Tangentyere. Currently some 200 people are working under CDEP on these camps and there is an application for 150 more positions. There is a range of jobs, including conservation, environment and land management activities, building, repairs and maintenance, arts, crafts and cultural activities, firewood collection for the elderly, alcohol rehabilitation support work, oral history projects, fencing, painting, plumbing, tourism activities, and so on. The hours worked average around 16 hours per week. I stress that CDEP is not perfect; it is far from perfect. I think that the points that have been raised by the Auditor-General in his report illustrate that fact. I must emphasise that I do not believe that going down the road that has been perhaps foreshadowed by the honourable member for Chisholm is an appropriate course, necessarily. Whilst I agree in principle that there needs to be accountability, I do not believe that we need to be so rigorous to the extent that the initiatives that have come from Aboriginal people are unable to work because of the administrative rigour that we place upon them. I would like to commend the report to the House and thank all those on the Committee.",18
7,Mr RIG GALL,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"In rising to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I wish to say that it is a great privilege to be on this Committee as a new member of parliament. I have had the opportunity as a Victorian of seeing many parts of Australia that I would not otherwise have been able to see. One who has had that privilege to go to those places cannot help but be left with a marked impression of what is happening to the Aboriginal community. I am deeply moved to the point of believing that they are a people within our society who are generally disadvantaged. Having said that Aborigines are generally disadvantaged, I think it is pretty much recognised that this is one of those programs-l concur with the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) - which was designed to definitely respond to the request of the community for an alternative unemployment benefits. I very much agree with the thrust of that idea. I concur that it is a good idea. It is something that is needed within the Aboriginal community. However, I also would take umbrage with the point in so far as this is an Audit report and we are looking at the management of that scheme. The things that I would like to bring to the notice of the House are accountability, responsibility and the dignity that is imparted to the people. I am left with the distinct impression that the management of this scheme does not necessarily deliver those things to the Aboriginal community. There is another responsibility in the management of that scheme. There is not only a responsibility to the Aboriginal people, but also a responsibility to the taxpayers of Australia generally that their money is being spent wisely and in a good cause. By any standards today, we would have to say that what we are trying to resolve with the Aboriginal people has generally failed. That is a tragedy to which perhaps nobody in this place has the answer in the short term, but we are all working with goodwill on both sides of the House to find some way through it. I suspect that the final solution will come from the Aboriginal people themselves, not from programs that we put in place on top of them. In the sense that this program started off as a community based idea, I support it. However, I believe it is being supervised by what I call the Aboriginal industry. There is a group of bureaucrats, from professors through to the smallest bureaucrat in the industry, most of whom are very well meaning but, in effect, consume a huge amount of money without delivering a great deal of results. This report fundamentally comes down to that. Accountability back to the taxpaying community is not good enough, quite frankly. Evidence has been delivered in this report whereby, on the one hand, people receive unemployment benefits while at the same time are funded out of· the community development employment program (CDEP). The attitude that seems to prevail is: to 'Well, it is the Aboriginal community, we can't do much about that'. Members of the Aboriginal community are being treated as if they were children. I do not believe that is good enough. I believe that a responsibility has been indicated but it is not being shown. The program has been going for a long time. One of the things that I looked for in the evidence taken before the Committee was an indication of the Aboriginal communities themselves taking responsibility. Every time. I sit down at the desk I am very disappointed at the number of Aborigines who are actually spokesmen for their own communities. Usually they are almost an appendage to the white bureaucracy which runs these programs. This is a tragedy. The program was introduced in 1979 and it should have been successful with the communities running their own programs. They ought to be doing it themselves. The money ought to be well targeted, so that they have the responsibility and the dignity of looking after themselves. I listened very carefully to what the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) said when he was blaming a lot of the problem on isolation and the fact that accountability is very difficult under these circumstances. During the proceedings I asked some questions about the Lake Tyers Trust in Victoria. It seemed from the information that we had that a serious mismanagement of funds had been going on over a number of years, since 1984. Funding was still coming out of the Department and going into this trust, but the accountability was not there, until eventually the police were brought into lay charges in relation to this account. These things happen, and I understand this. The interesting thing that I found, from questioning the people who were looking after the funding of these programs, was that they had almost opted out from their responsibility. I would have thought that, if they were managing directors of a private company and they found a rotten apple, that would be the first place to go to resolve the problem. They would have hands-on experience and would be very much aware of what was going on and would be working damned hard to resolve that problem. However, there seemed to be some persuasive attitude that these things happen in an Aboriginal community, and we must simply accept that that is what goes on.",21
8,Mr GOODLUCK,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,It is not good enough.,22
9,Mr RIGGALL,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"I concur; it is not good enough for that attitude to prevail. I was very disappointed in their answer and I put them on notice that we would be looking for a significant lifting of results in terms of responsibility and hands-on knowledge. At the end of the day, what happens in my electorate, for example, is that people come back to me and ask why money is being wasted. They see reports where people who are on such programs get a tax refund cheque, where the community has gone on a binge. Those things hurt the Aboriginal communities and hurt them dramatically in that they are not being seen in the greater community in terms of the dignity and respect that they deserve, or should be demanding. It comes down to the whole question of accountability and responsibility. I now draw the attention of the House to the report and to a couple of recommendations that I think ought to be highlighted. On page 15, section 2.68 is a recommendation that I think ought to be read by the people concerned and taken notice of. It states: ... that: a high priority be given to the training and support needs of CDEP administrators, through the combined efforts of ATSIC and DEET Once again they are on notice and they should take that very seriously. It goes on: as foreshadowed by DEET, an evaluation of the effectiveness of current training programs in support of the administrative competencies for CDEP participants be a significant element of the review of AEDP in 1992-93. If they do not take notice of that, I believe that this Parliament, and the Minister particularly, when he is tripping around and hearing only good news and treading on grass, should look a little deeper at what really is going on. The Committee also recommends in 2.81: senior management of ATSIC and DEET take a significant role in the effective oversighting of improved financial management and accountability for CDEP. Once again, that reinforces that the community, and particularly the Committee, will not withstand the current standards put forward. Finally, in the time. I have left I should like to thank the Chairman of that Committee, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), for the manner in which he conducted this inquiry and steered the Committee through what is often not an easy subject-it is a very emotive subject-in a very professional way. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this report. I also endorse the comments the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) made about the staff. They too have been most supportive in this role. I see in the gallery Wynne Allen, who has been of particular help to me. Quite often I get up from the table and go and have a chat to Wynne. I would like to put on record my appreciation of the help she has given me. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Motion (by Mr Kerr) proposed: That the House take note of the report. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-In accordance with sessional order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY the Report: GUll'gahlin's Transport Links",22
10,Mr LANGMORE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, I present the Committee's report entitled Gungahlin's Transport Links, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",23
11,Mr LANGMORE,JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE,"This report is the result of a 10-month inquiry into the sible transport links between Canberra's new town of Gungahlin and the rcst of the national capital. This inquiry has vided an opportunity to make an imporround tant contribution to shaping Canberra's future. In this report the Committee siders a range of environmental, transport and urban planning issues arising from the need to develop a transport system for Gungahlin, and it proposes a vision for Canberra's transport future. It is vision of a more sustainable city, with dependence on the private car for transcity. port, which allows the construction of new roads only in the least environmentally sensitive corridors, and which provides legislative protection for areas of bushinner land that demonstrate significant ecologisessment cal, recreational and educational values. Development plans for Gungahlin indicate that towards the turn of the cenpossibility tury some 30,000 people will be living the district. Eventually Gungahlin will home to over 85,000 people. Demoamenity graphic and employment projcctions sughealth, gest that over 40,000 of Gungahlin's eventual population of 85,000 will be in idential areas. paid employment. If the current development plans prominimise ceed, the town centre in Gungahlin will be similar in size to Belconnen and will eventually employ some 9,000 people. This means that around 33,500 people will need to travel to jobs in locations outside Gungahlin. Whcn that figure is combined with the number of residents demanding travel for reasons not related to paid employment, it gives a total of about 33,000 people who will leave and return to Gungahlin each week day; To provide a consistent framework for assessment of the various elements of the transport strategy and a guide for fudebate on transport issues, the Committee identified a number of key principles. The first is that Gungahlin's external transport systcm must provide effective access to and from Gungahlin. It is equally important, however, that such links do not change Canberra's unique character. Over the years Canberra's urban enviposronment has been designed to emphasise and complement the city's natural landscape setting. Key elements in this setting proare the inner hills and ridges which surand frame the urban areas. Not only do the hills and ridges contribute conaesthetically and symbolically to Canberra's character, they are also extensively used for recreation by the community. Many submissions to the inquiry described how the hills are frequently used a for bushwalking, jogging, orienteering and less as vantage points from which to view the The forests and woodlands of the inner hills are also fine examples of the types of vegetation that were once common in the area. The protection of the hills should figure highly in the asof any transport proposals. Proposals must also take account of the of traffic related noise and air in pollution. Given the damaging effect of be noise and air pollution on residential and on physical and mental it would seem appropriate that any transport proposals should avoid resAnother important issue is the need to the emission of greenhouse gases so that we may make what little contribution we can to reducing the danger of global warming. So the transport solutions developed for Gungahlin must seek to encourage a more efficient use of energy. Canberra relies even more heavily on cars for transport than most cities in Australia and overseas. If a greater than usual emphasis can be placed on public transport in the development of Gungahlin's external transport network, the problems of automobile dependence will be reduced. The most obvious public transport option for Gungahlin is the extension of Canberra's excellent existing bus system, and this must happen. However, the potential advantages of a light rail system of public transport were also described to the Committee. They are as follows: light rail vehicles do not emit exhaust fumes and are therefore less environmentally damaging; light rail vehicles are energy efficient; and the introduction of a sleek and modern transport technology can increase civic pride, provide attractive services for tourists and project a progressive yet environmentally conscious image. A light rail system would offer a high standard of service to travellers and would encourage more people to change their travel patterns away from automobile dependence. The Committee has recommended that land be reserved between Gungahlin and Civic to allow for the construction of a rapid transit system and that a detailed study on all the issues relating to the cost and performance of a light rail system be conducted. Despite the potential benefits of a high standard public transport system, the Committee acknowledges that a considerable number of people travelling to and from Gungahlin will do so in private cars. Additional road space will be needed to cater for the expected growth in traffic. The Committee also recognises that it is important to protect residential streets in north Canberra from any further increase in the level of through traffic. A road in the John Dedman corridorthat is, the corridor to the west of the city-would benefit both Gungahlin residents, by providing a direct route to central Canberra and southern destinations, and north Canberra residents, by providing an alternative to the north Canberra corridor for vehicles travelling to and from Gungahlin. The Committee cannot, however, support John Dedman East. A road on this alignment would severely damage the Bruce-O'Connor Hills area and would degrade the environs of the National Botanic Gardens. The ecological, recreational and educational values of the Bruce Ridge-O'Connor Hills area are such that the area should be preserved from current and future threats by being given legislative protection. The Committee prefers the alternative alignment for John Dedman Drive proposed by the North Canberra Protection Group, but before this alignment can be recommended further work is needed to clarify the extent of this alignment's impact on parking and residential facilities at the Australian Institute of Sport. The Committee supports the construction of an access road in the Majura Valley which would offer a high speed link to and from eastern Gungahlin. However, the Committee rejects the proposal to construct Monash Drive. Reassessment could be necessary at some time well into the future-and I emphasise 'well' into the future-if it is shown that traffic to and from Gungahlin is not being adequately provided for by John Dedman Drive west of Black Mountain and the Majura Parkway, and if residents of north Canberra are experiencing severely disruptive levels of through traffic. The environmental values of the Mount Majura and Mount Ainslie bushland are such that, like the Bruce Ridge-O'Connor Hills area, as much as possible of the area should be preserved and given legislative protection. This should involve protecting all of the bushland on either side of the existing road reservation. Provided the other elements of the transport system are seen to be operating effectively in the future, the road reservation for Monash Drive should also be removed from the national capital plan. In this event, legislative protection should be extended to cover the area of the road reservation as well. These Committee recommendations would reduce the costs of road works by more than $20m. These savings could be used to fund part of the light rail system. One of the key issues the Committee identified during its inquiry was the absence of formal legislative protection for much of Canberra's natural environment. This is an issue of great concern and, in addition to' the specific recommendations made in the report for legislative protection for the hills and ridges, the Committee will be seeking terms of reference for an inquiry into the general issue of nature conservation and environmental management within those areas of open space in the ACT which are described as being of national significance. In this report, the Committee has not only assessed the transport strategies proposed by the National Capital Planning Authority, but also has articulated a number of principles which should guide the future development of Canberra's transport system. If decisions about Gungahlin's transport links are guided by these principles, Canberra's dependence on the private car would be reduced and substantial progress made towards creating a more sustainable city. In conclusion, I would like to express my wholehearted appreciation to the Committee Secretary, Grant Harrison, and his staff, Mrs Marlene Lyons. Both these people have taken a close, intelligent and thoughtful interest in the issues involved in this important inquiry. Their drafting has been excellent. I thank them warmly, as I do all the members of the Committee, including Senator Reid, the deputy chairperson. We all worked well together. I commend the report to the House. Motion (by Mr Langmore) proposed: That the House take note of the report.

NA 1991 Bill presented by Mr MACKellar.",23
12,Mr MACKELLAR,OMBUDSMAN AMENDMENT BILL,"I present the Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1991. This Bill seeks to amend section 5 of the Ombudsman Act 1976, which sets out the functions of the Commonwell\lth Ombudsman. Subparagraphs 1(a) and (b) of section 5 provide for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints relating to matters of administration by a department or a prescribed authority. My Bill will add subparagraph 1(c) to that section and provide for the Ombudsman to be able to respond to and investigate complaints relating to programming decisions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). This amendment seeks to redress the presently unsatisfactory situation where there is considerable evidence of increasing official and public concern about aspects of the ABC's programming and presentation standards, but no independent review or adjudication procedures to handle complaints and grievances. It is true that in recent days the ABC has established an independent complaints review panel. Despite its title and a membership with considerable media experience, it is nevertheless an in-house body which will leave the final determination for action on complaints with the ABC's Managing Director. It is also the ABC's belated response to pressure by the Government for a tribunal to deal with the growing disquiet about the ABC's programming decisions and its presentation standards. Those pressures came to a head in January following the ABC's refusal to have Radio Australia transmit personal messages to troops stationed in the Gulf and over the perceived bias in its coverage of the Gulf war. But the Gulf war was only the final straw for many Australians. The ABC's obsession with higher ratings is taking it towards the lowest common denominator factor. We are seeing comedies that confuse crudity and vulgarity with humour; an increasing reliance on emotional exploitation and trivia in current affairs shows, such as the 7.30 Report; increasing violence, objectionable sexual emphases and bad language, particularly in prime viewing time; a lack of professionalism and downright bias during interviewing by leading commentators and, above all, by so much sheer bad taste. Perhaps this was also in the Government's mind when it made its threat of 19 February that the ABC should either establish an independent body to investigate complaints or be subject to the control of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Faced with that choice, is there any wonder at the ABC's decision to embrace the convenience offered by its so called independent complaints review panel? Clearly, the proposal for Australian Broadcasting Tribunal involvement was unsatisfactory as the Tribunal has a particularly poor track record in its handling of complaints involving the commercial broadcasters. The pity is that the Government did not offer the ABC a third option-namely, for it to come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Ombudsman offers every advantage. It is a review mechanism which need not directly interfere with the ABC's right of independence; it is a truly independent adjudicator; it is highly regarded and respected by the public; and it is an established authority which does not require any additional establishment costs. Furthermore, successive ombudsmen have indicated a willingness to undertake this function and have expressed the opinion that their Act already gives them the power to investigate ABC programming decisions. The ABC has consistently denied this on the grounds, I understand, that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction relates to administrative decisions and that programming is not such. The practical effect of this has been to deny the public any effective, independent review of their complaints against the ABC. The ABC is unique within the media industry in this regard. Complaints against the press media can be addressed to the Press Council, while complaints against commercial television and radio programs can be made to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. What possible justification can there be for the ABC to be placed in the privileged position of not being subjected to some form of independent adjudication? There is no justification for such a privileged position, and I believe that it is accepted by both the Government and the Opposition. What is at issue is not whether there should be scrutiny, but the form of that scrutiny. My proposal contained in this private member's Bill is for that adjudication to be performed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. To summarise my position, there is widespread agreement and support from the Government for some form of review procedure to deal with complaints about the ABC-and there are plenty of complaints about the ABC. The proposal contained in this Bill will maintain the ABC's independence-and I think that is enormously important; will subject it to a respected and publicly acceptable course of independent adjudication; and will do so in a cost effective manner. The benefits are clearly identifiable to the public, to the ABC and to the Government. It is my hope that the very sensible and necessary objectives of this private member's Bill will be supported by the Government and passed through Parliament as a matter of urgent public importance and interest. Bill read a first time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-ln accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. CRIMES (PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN FLAGS) BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Cobb.",25
13,Mr COBB,OMBUDSMAN AMENDMENT BILL,"The Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill was originally submitted on 4 May 1989. On that occasion the Government refused to list it for debate, so I resubmitwould ted it after the last Federal election, on 31 May 1990. It came up for a second reading debate for a brief period on two occasions-on 23 August and 18 October last year-and then the Government saw fit to let the Bill lapse. I believe that that was a great pity because many honourable members on both sides wanted to speak on this Bill, and they indicated that to me. Of the few who did speak on the Bill, all were in favour except for the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) who felt the Bill would hinder Aboriginal demonstrations. I now resubmit the Bill as a private member's Bill. Each time. I have raised this matter there has been overwhelming community support for the Bill. The Bill, if implemented and passed, will then become law so that anybody who desecrates or otherwise dishonours the Australian national flag or an Australian ensign or who, without lawful authority, burns, mutilates or otherwise destroys our flag shall be deemed guilty of an offence and subject to a penalty of $5,000 maximum or imprisonment for two years, or both. If this Bill is passed I believe it will show that we care about our flag, and it will discourage the thoughtless and contemptible minority of demonstrators who offend the sensibilities of the great majority of the Australian people. Having some sort of penalty for dishonouring or desecrating our Australian flag will basically bring us into line with many overseas countries which already have similar penalties. I have already made the point in a previous speech that some sort of penalty should have been included in the original Flags Act 1953 which was introduced by Prime Minister Menzies at the time. It may have been an oversight. I do note at the time that Dr Evatt, in concluding his speech in response, said: The Government should not he content with the passing of this legislation but it should protect the flag in the same way that such countries as the United States of America protect their flags. Also, Mr Calwell-Iater to become the Leader of the Australian Labor Partywhen speaking seemed to indicate that he have supported such an addition to the Bill. So there was strong support from the Labor Party then for what I am proposing today. I do believe there is strong support on both sides of this House, and I would like to see the Government take that on board. A number of criticisms have been made by members of a minority from time to time when this issue is raised. They say the penalties are too severe, for example. I say that these are only maximum penalties and, like all penalties, they reflect the degree of the offence. In most cases, if anyone wa's convicted, it would usually be for a lesscr penalty. There is nothing particularly draconian about the penalties in this Bill. They are on a par with those for offences of a similar nature, and they are similar to what is in legislation in overseas countries such as Norway, New Zealand, Japan, America, et cetera. There is widespread support for the Bill, although there are some civil libertarians who have opposed it. To me they seem all too ready to jump to the defence of !hose who want to burn our national flag Ill. protest-something which always surpnses me. There are ample opportunities and avenues in this country for people to protest without necessarily offending anybody. There are limits to how far we go. We do not allow graffiti artists to display their efforts on the walls of the Australian National Gallery, for example, and we should not allow people to burn our national flag. Some say that our national flag is not worth defending if we have to penalise those who dishonour it. That is a strange argument. I believe that if we are not prepared to defend it, the flag is not worth having. The protesters can get their cheap shots in some other way without offending the sensibilities of the great majority of the Australian people. Our flag is much more than a piece of cloth. It represents much of the tradition that has gone before in this country. I commend the Bill to the House. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Bill read a first time. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-In accordance with sessional order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA",27
14,Mr HOLLIS,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises that the final week in May 1991 marks the 30th anniversarv of the tion of Amnesty Internatio'nal; and (2) applauds the efforts Amnesty International has made to the release of prisoners of conscience, ensuring fair trials for political prisoners and the ending of torture and executions world wide. Thirty years ago British lawyer Peter Benenson had a dream for a better and more just world where the human rights of individuals would be protected. His newspaper appeal, 'The Forgotten Prisoners', was published worldwide on 28 May 1961 and brought in more than 1,000 offers of support for the idea of an international campaign to protect human rights. Within 12 months the new organisation had sent delegations to [our countries to make representations on behalf of prisoners and had takcn up 210 cases. Amnesty International members had organised national bodies in seven countries. The principles of strict impartiality and independence were established. The emphasis was on the international protection of human rights. Amnesty International members were to act on cases world wide and not to become involved in cases in their own countries. The candle that Peter Benenson lit has cast its light in many parts of the world. Amnesty International has more than one million members, subscribers and regular donors in over 150 countries and territories and more than 4,200 Amnestv International volunteer groups in 70 countries. There are nationally organised sections in 44 countries. Amnesty International has over 30,000 members and supporters in Australia and some 180 local groups. Amnesty International Australian groups are open to members of all ages and from all walks of life. Local groups carry out some of the most satisfying and effective work on behalf of human rights abuses. These groups work for a particular prisoner of conscience, participate in country or theme campaigns, promote Amnesty International's concerns and activities in the local community, and raise funds to support Amnesty International's work. Amnesty International Australia is the first section to have a Federal parliamentary group. The patron-in-ehief is His Exfounda- cellency the Governor General. Almost two-thirds of the members of the Australian Parliament are members of the Australian Parliamentary Group. It operates without regard to ideology and includes amongst its members representatives of all the political parties represented in the Australian Parliament, as well as the Independents. It has as its patrons the holders of the offices of Prime Minister Leader of the Opposition, Leader of the National Party of Australia and Leader of the Australian Democrats. Recently, both Japan and New Zealand have established Amnesty International groups within their own - arliament-. The Parliamentary Group m AustralIa welcomes this. In any year, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children confront imprisonment for their beliefs, colour sex ethl!ic origin, language or religion an'd arsubject to torture and execution. The statistics of Amnesty International's 1990 report illustrate the extent of injustice and repression faced by people around the w<?rld in 1989. Ac-ording to that report, pnsoners of conSCIence were held in 71 countries and possible prisoners of conscience were held in another 13 countries' torture and ill-treatment of prisoners werreported in 96 countries; death reportedly from tort,ure or ill-treatment in custody occ-rred m 40 countries; extrajudicial executIOns-that is, killings carried out by g?vernment forces and their agents outSIde legal procedures-were reported in more than 40 countries, with disappearances being reported in more than 20 countries; political prisoners were detained in at least 92 countries; and unfair trials in political cases were known to have taken place in 31 countries. Urgent appeals were issued on behalf of 2,886 prisoners in 87 countries. In 1989, 2,229 known executions of prisoners took place in 34 countries, while 2,826 people were sentenced to death in 62 countries, including China Iran Nigeria, the United States and' Unidn of Soviet Socialist Republics. However three countries-Cambodia, New Zealan'd and Romania-abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 1989, and two, Nepal and H-ngary, a-olished the death penalty for cnmes against the state. By the end of 1989, 68 countries were abolitionist in law or practice, and 17 had restricted the death penalty to exceptional offences. In t-e first six months of 1990, two countnes-Czechoslovakia and Namibiaabolished the death penalty for all crimes. The - arliamentary Group of Amnesty Internat-onal takes up single cases of urgent actIOn called on by Amnesty International in London. That means that - he-ever Amnesty is concerned about the tmI?ment e-ecution or about the persecutIOn, gaohng or potential torture of someone merely because of his or her - acial origin or ethnic or political beliefs, It sends out a message to the world calling on supporters of Amnesty to apply pressure to those errant countries responsible for that inhumane treatment of our fellow human beings. Australia is sending that information to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the hands of the Chairman and the Secretary-who is in the House now-of the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty. That Department then takes up every case of urgent action put to it by the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty. I ask honourable members to think about the implications for the world if this model of action were to be followed in other countries. It means that Australian diplomatic representatives are knocki-g on doors and are taking up in a very dIrect and hands-on way violations of human rights as they appear around the world. :rhat is unprecedented in history. It prOVIdes a model for action for other governments. Priso-ers of conscience are thought to be held III nearly half the countries of the world, and i!l 50 countries political prisoJ}ers can stIll be held without charge or tnal. Torture and ill-treatment as well as extrajudicial execution continue and so mu-h remains still to be done. The Austr-han Govern!llent remains firmly commItted to domg whatever it can to promot- respect for human rights both in AustralIa and around the world in accordance with the principles enshrined in the declarations, covenants and conventions of the United Nations. Amnesty International has been held in very - igh. re?ard in this country since the orgamsatIOn .was founded. I am sure that Australians and Australian governments will continue to support it for as long as human rights abuses continue to occur, wherever they occur. Amnesty has been particularly involved in the struggle in South Africa, and has worked hard in recent years to save the lives of the Sharpeville six and other political victims of injustice. Although it welcomes the South African Government's recent reforms to limit the application of the death penalty, it will continue to campaign for its total abolition in South Africa and elsewhere. As apartheid enters its death throes, the human rights spotlight will shift to other countries with which Australia has closer ties. Amnesty members will keep the candle of conscience burning behind the barbed wire of death rows, detention centres and political prisons wherever they may be. Where appropriate, we must expect that the world's spotlight will be on Australia, such as in respect of the question of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It is said that we politicians are cal lot, but members of the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International can put party politics aside and work collectively for the release of political prisoners. Over the past 30 years, Amnesty International has been concerned to discover the truth and to harness a worldwide network of ordinary decent people-its members-to demand fair treatment for proven victims of state oppression. If Australians sometimes wonder what they can do about appalling injustices in other countries, membership of Amnesty provides an answer. It may seem a long and ineffectual shot to write a letter to a political prisoner, to a foreign politician, or even to the Minister for foreign affairs, but the results achieved by Amnesty International show that it can be effective. I know that all members of this House applaud the efforts Amnesty International has made for the release of prisoners of conscience, ensuring fair trials for pol cal prisoners and ending torture and cxecutions worldwide. A lot has been achieved by Amnesty International in the past 30 years, but a lot remains to be done with the change of political systcms. Indeed, with the change in communications today we become more and more aware of these. I congratulate Amnesty International on what it has achieved in the past 30 years and wish it well for many years to come. The sad point is that, because the world is in such a state and because unjust practices continue, therc is a need for an organisation such as Amnesty International, but thank goodness it is there to carry out this important work. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Is the motion seconded? !VIr RUDDOCK (Dundas) (10.46 a.m.)-It is with a great deal of pleasure that I second the motion. This is not the first occasion on which I have spoken in this House on a motion concerning Amnesty International. We are recognising that this week marks the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of Amnesty. Undoubtedly, from the remarks that have been made by the honourable member a cyniwho preceded me, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), honourable members are very much aware of the involvement of the Parliament in supporting Amnesty's work and of the undoubted success of the organisation and the importance of it continuing into the future. I was particularly gratified to read the remarks made this week by the two patrons of the Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International, when speaking in this House about Amnesty and their association with it, recording many of the benchmarks by which Amnesty could be judged. Some of those comments have been picked up by the speaker who preceded me. For the sake of bipartisanship, I will emphasise first the points of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which I think are succinct and of importance, and then some of the comments of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The Prime Minister noted that Amitinesty now has over one million members worldwide, that it has subscribers and donors in over 150 countries and that in 1977 it was awarded the Nobel Peacc Prize in recognition of its superb record in gaining worldwide support to assist tims of human rights abuse. He menwe have seen over time. tioned, in particular, that in nearly half the countries of the world political prisview, oners of conscience are still held without charge or trial, that in 1989 torture ill-treatment of prisoners were reported 96 countries and that extrajudicial execumented tions were reported in more than 40 tion countries and disappearances in more than 20 countries. The Prime Minister gave a commitcould ment on behalf of the Australian Governlieve ment to continue to promote the principles enshrined in the United Nations declaratralian tions, covenants and conventions on man rights issues. He also noted that the Government-I think in this sense he understated it-is also active in making representations directly to foreign ments about allegations of human rights abuses where they occur. It is a mark of the success of Amnesty that all of the urgent action requests are made by this organisation, including those made to individual members of ParRoyal liament, are now taken up by the Austrain lian Government, which authenticates, where it can, the work of Amnesty and takes up directly in a representative sense the need for governments around world to respond to those requests. That effort by government is not without diffihalf culty. I emphasise that the taking up of humembership man rights issues is not without a cost to nesty Group, of this nation. All too frequently incidents such as the one that occurred having been willing toof associate when the Prime Minister, in an otherwise difficult political context, raised issues lating to human rights abuses in Turkey. There was anxiety that those matters are should be raised when the Prime Minister larly,now of Turkey was in Australia recently. difficulties could be seen from the which he responded when he left tralia. Some very nitpicking and unhelpful comments were made about the difficulties that we acknowledge that have in according proper human rights to Australian Aboriginals. That was used against us and equated in a sense with the rather horrific human rights abuses victhat we are aware of in Turkey and which The Prime Minister-properly, in my because it is a matter that I raise from time to time as an office-bearer of and the Parliamentary Group of Amnestyin acknowledged that Amnesty has comabout Australia. I recall a situain which it was alleged that Australia may have been assisting Indonesian armed forces in relation to certain activities that have involved torture. I do not be that those charges were sustained, but allegations were made that our Ausforces may have been assisting Inhudonesia in that regard. It was a proper matter to be raised if there was concern. It was a proper matter for members of Parliament to be concerned about if it governreflected upon Australia. The question of Aboriginal deaths in custody is one that I think affects every Australian. Everyone of us agonises about that it in our own individual way. The Government took this matter up through the Commission into Aboriginal Deaths Custody in order to ensure that there was no institutional violence in organisations that do take people into custody from time to time. Mention was made of the the Royal Commission report. The Leader of the Opposition, on beof the members on this side of the House, equally emphasised the membership of Amnesty in Australia and the the Parliamentary Amwith over two-thirds of the we find members and senators this Parliament themreselves with this organisation. He recorded the fact that Amnesty has investigated more than 42,000 cases, 38,000 of which closed. He mentioned, particuThe nism in thepossibility the of the new mechaway in take up the monitoring region Asia-Pacific of that might human rights Ausabuses in our area of the world. The Leader of the Opposition noted we what is one of the most important points to me about Amnesty, that is, that it docs not seck support from governments. It specifically e-chews it. It does not accept money because it does not want to be compromised in the way in which it is able to carry out its activities. In this country we have been able to give support throu-h the process of tax deductibility of donatlOns to Amnesty-an important sign of the support that is given but not one that can compromise that organisation in the way in which it works. I was delighted to read both of the speeches by the leaders of the major political parties in Australia because we have this level of bipartisan support for the work of Amnesty. At the end of 1970 the Victorian section of Amnesty wanted to see formed a parliamentary group of Amnesty International. It suggested a number of activities in which members of this Parliament might be involved-reading and noting material on human rights sent to them by Amnesty, having debates on human rights issues, supporting and promoting legislation or international initiatives which support Amnesty causes intereedinr; with governments when requested to do so by Amnesty, and keeping Am.nesty informed on moves by the Aus!rahan Government which might be of Interest. This suggestion led to some correspondence by Dr Dick Klugman, the then member for Prospect, a member of Amnesty, who sought the establishment of a parliamentary Amnesty group. When I looked through the history of our organisation I found that the inaugural meeting was held on 28 November 1973 in the building of this Parliament's predecessor down the hill. Fourteen members of Parliament were present and 37 apologies were received. Race Mathews was elected pro tem Chairman and Tony Lamb was elected pro tem Secretary. In March 1974, David Hamer was elected President, Dick Klugman Vice President, Tony Lamb, Secretary-Treasurer, and I was elected as Assistant Secretary-Treasurer, then on a learning curve. M- association goes back to that inauguratIon of the group and it is one of which I am greatly proud. I was proud to be associated with one of our first issues when we sought to take up the issue of political prisoners in Indonesia. In the same way, I am proud today to be associated with this organisation, because we do take up issues in a bipartisan fashion. The Iran situation, when we were recently denied the opportunity to prescnt our case is an example of our continuing efforts ithis regard.",28
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,Mr Hollis)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,32
16,Mr GIBSON,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"Moreton) (10.56 a.m.)Last Tuesday, 28 May, I and many other members and senators in this place observed a very moving but simple ceremony which involved the lighting of four candles encased in barbed wire in the foyer of Parliament House. That ceremony marked the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the Amnesty International group. It also marked a very significant point, which has been spoken of by both yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker and the previous speaker, the hono-rable member for D-ndas (Mr Ruddock), namely, the questlOn of freedom and liberty of peoples around the world the rights of people to exercise their ow- political beliefs in a free and just society. These views are not held just by one side or other in this place but are fundamental to the exercise of democracy in Australia. This position is universally held by all members of this Parliament and by most people in this country. I hope that the message that the ceremony sent out to the people of Australia is that we should not take for granted our freedom, liberty and the right to exercise democratic beliefs, because this is certainly not something that is common around the world. We in Australia have been blessed in that we have not had to struggle to achieve and maintain that right. But many millions of people around the world do not have that freedom, do not have th- oPI?ortunity to say what they truly belIeve In and do not have the right to represent others in some form of democratic political forum; and in fact many have suffered greatly through torture, imprIsonment, beatings and death for the right to exercise those political beliefs. , It, is !mport,ant for this place, this great InstltutlOn, thIS great representation of our democratic institutions in this country, that all four leaders of the political parties in Australia were at the ceremony, to join with other members of the Parliament, to say that we honour those who have suffered and that we fight for their rights and for the rights of all those hundreds of thousands of people all around the world today who are still imprisoned or who suffer because of their political beliefs, and that we do not take for granted our opportunities to exercise political freedom. Amnesty International is one of many groups throughout the world fighting for political justice and freedom. Amnesty International is strongly supported in this Parliament by all parties-in fact, it is not really a bipartisan group; it is a non-partisan group because it has representatives from all political parties plus independent members of the Parliament. Amnesty International is able to achieve that support in this place and support around the world because it does not pursue any personal or political position. It does not have political views as such. It does not judge the rights and wrongs of particular political causes. It does not take sides in disputes. What it does is take the side of the right of people to exercise political freedom and to have the right to express points of view. That is why it has continued to grow so well over the past 30 years, and it is why it is receiving such strong support in this Parliament today. I am proud to participate in supporting this motion this morning, because although J am a relatively new member of this Parliament what Amnesty International stands for is the very reason why I sought to come into political office and to represent Australians in this place. Amnesty International represents the exercise of political freedom, and I support that wholeheartedly. In my time in Parliament, in speeches I have made in this place I have taken up issues of great concern to me, such as the struggles in Sri Lanka, the struggle in East Timor for the freedom of the people of East Timor and the struggle of the people of El Salvador. They are just three examples of places around the world where people do not have the right to exercise political freedom and choice and on which Amnesty International has made comment. But there are many other places around the world besides those three where the struggle continues. Amnesty International was established in 1961 because of a man's desperation at reading in the paper day after day stories concerning the various causes of people around the world and cases of people being imprisoned or murdered because of their political beliefs and his frustration and feeling that, as an ordinary citizen, he wanted to be able to do something. He felt that maybe our political structures were not achieving what they should be achieving in taking up those cases. He as an ordinary person wanted to try to do something about it. I think Amnesty International's commencement through the work of Peter Benenson shows that there is a place for ordinary people in this world to take steps to exercise their beliefs and to fight beyond the political structures and to take up issues where they believe that they as ordinary human beings have a point of view to put forward and to try to fight for the rights of others to have a similar right to exercise political beliefs. It was not something that was started by government or by a political party. It was an ordinary citizen who said, 'I am frustrated at what is happening around the world and I want to do something about it'. He captured the imagination of many hundreds of thousands of other people who had similar feelings, including politicians and political parties. But he was the one who was the inspiration, and he continues to provide that inspiration. The strength of Amnesty International is that it is an ordinary citizens' group. It is not a political operatives' group. I would urge ordinary citizens in Australia to exercise the rights that they have in this country-which people in many other countries do not have-to joint Amnesty in fighting for the freedom of others who at the moment find themselves imprisoned or tortured and to take up the challenge that Amnesty International provides to do something positive about it, to writc those letters, to take issue with the governments around the world that do not give people the rights to exercise their political freedom. Australia has also been the recipient of critical reports, and this is something that we should take note of. The honourable member for Dundas made the point that our treatment of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has created some concern on occasion. The most recent report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody I think confirms the fact that Australia also has a case to answcr with regard to the way in which we treat some of our citizens. So, we have no right to be cocky and to lecture others and to say that it is other people around the world who have these problems but that we in Australia are pure and good. I think the Aboriginal deaths in custody report highlights the fact that we also have something to answer for and that we also nced to look at our own operations from time to time. I am only a recent comer to Amnesty Intcrnational, having joined this Parliament some 14 or 15 months ago, but I am pleased to participate in it. I am honoured to be in a group that has such a proud history. I will continue my work for Amnesty International because I believe it is fundamental to what I believe in and what my political philosophy is: that is, the rights of everyone throughout the world to cxcrcise democratic freedoms and to be able to do that without fear of punishment or imprisonment. It is a pleasure for me to support this motion, and I commend it to all honourable members.",32
17,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"It is with great pleasure that I rise in this Housc today to support this motion. Amnesty International is a worldwide watchdog on human rights abuses. It is the organisation which has called for the immediate release of prisoners of conscience, gaolcd for their beliefs, ethnicity or gender. It has called also for the fair and prompt trial of political prisoners and for an end to all torture. This week, Amnesty International celebrates its thirtieth anniversary. As a very new member of this Parliament, it gives me great pleasure to join in this debate. Today Amnesty International has 44 international branches, more than one million members, subscribers and regular donors in more than 150 countries and more than 4,200 voluntary groups spread throughout 70 countries. Amnesty International operates without funds from any government. It relies on the generosity of the public for its support. I think that is testimony to the credibility of Amnesty International and the regard in which it is held internationally. It is a sad fact of history, as quoted by the eminent Australian historian Professor Manning Clark, who died only last week, that those who believe they know the truth are often driven to practice abominations against those who disagree with them. I could give a long speech describing the intricate detail of various abominations, but I feel this would be grossly sensationalist and would detract from the cause and the work of Amnesty International. I believe that the work of Amnesty International, its very being, goes a long way back in history. I go back to the sixteenth century. The divine right of kings, as expressed in English history by the Stuarts in the 1600s, is an example of how authoritarian power leads inevitably to human rights abuses. It was James I who believed God had sent him to this earth to be king and, therefore, to God alone did he have to answer for his actions. It was this ideology that enabled James I to believe that he knew what was best for humanity. So when James died, he was succeeded by his son Charles I, who was of the same opinion. Those who dared to voice disapproval or disagreement were promptly imprisoned. The English Parliament was determined to check Charles's actions and refused to consider the King's request for further funds until hc agreed to sign the document which has since become famous in history as the Petition of Right. This petition made it illegal to imprison any man without giving him a fair trial. The Petition of Right of 1628 was the second important landmark in the growth of freedom for citizens after the Magna Carta. For those who know their history, Charles I was not content to abide by the petition and dissolved Parliament. What followed was a long civil war, which ended in victory for the parliamentary forces and the trial and execution of Charles 1. Under Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector, England became a Commonwealth for 10 years. However, after Cromwell's death Charles II was restored to sovereignty, marking the restoration of the Stuarts. Soon after his restoration to the sovereignty, human rights abuses began to manifest as the King imprisoned his opponents and held them for long periods without a trial. To prevent such action by the King, Parliament passed the habeas corpus Act 1679, which stated that any person accused of a crime must be brought to trial as soon as possible after his arrest. I believe that Amnesty International can also be considered a great charter in English liberty, because distinct parallels can be drawn between this slice of history that I have recounted today and the progress of Amnesty International over the last 30 years. It was on 28 May 1961 that a British lawyer, Peter Benenson, published a newspaper article entitled The Forgotten Prisoners in the London Observer. In it he launched a one-year appeal for an amnesty campaign, in which he called for support of prisoners of conscience gaoled solely for their beliefs or origins. The appeal grew so rapidly that there was no question of bringing it to an end after 12 months. Benenson received more than 1,000 offers of support in the first month, and after six months the appeal for amnesty was enshrined in a permanent London based organisation, which we know today as Amnesty International. The organisation gained international respect as a United Nations observer body in the mid-1960s. In 1977 Amnesty International won the Nobel Peace Prize. Today Amnesty International Australia has more than 30,000 members belonging to groups which work for the release of a particular prisoner, join campaigns aimed at particular countries, raise funds and promote Amnesty International's concerns in their respective communities. Based in Sydney, Amnesty International Australia is the first national amnesty body to have a national parliamentary group comprising about half the members of parliament in all political parties. The Australian Government made representations in 460 human rights cases internationally last year on the basis of material provided by Amnesty International. Certainly this organisation has brought the plight of political prisoners to the world stage and has forced many governments to sit up and take notice. Since 1961, 38,000 of the 42,000 amnesty cases have been closed. Many of the prisoners involved were either released ahead of schedule or given amnesty; however, many others served their full term or were killed in custody. No system of government is exempt from criticism on the issue of human rights. We have much to do in Australia about removing the blots from our own society, as the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody is testimony to. Amnesty considers that its presence in eastern Europe contributed to the dismantling of draconian rule behind the iron curtain. Amnesty International was warning people about abuses in China long before the Tiananmen Square incident was brought to the world's attention. Similarly, in Iraq Amnesty has been raising concerns about the treatment of the Iraqi people for many years. The progress and success of Amnesty International cannot be viewed with complacency. The effect of the world's vigilance in condemning human rights abuses has been reflected by a change in tactics by governments. Where governments find it difficult to detain people because of international pressure, they have been known simply to eliminate those they want to persecute or oppress outside the judicial process, or hold them in secret without knowledge of their detention. These changes in tactics include the detention of people repeatedly for short periods rather than detaining them for long periods, which makes it more difficult to mount international pressure. I congratulate Amnesty Inter-ational on its work and support the motIon before the House today. I believe that the work Amnesty has done ensures the freedom of people regardless of colour, creed or race, and I trust that its work will go on into the future.",34
18,Mr KERR,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"It is very pleasing that by one of the ironies of this parliamentary process the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who moved this motion, now sits in the chair and conducts the debate. It is very pleasant because the whole focus of this debate has represented a microcosm of how members of Parliament share common ideals in this crucial area of human rights. However I want to get away from the focus on the parliamentary group in my address. I think it is important to realise that the Amnesty movement is a movement of people who generally would b- regarded as being at the grass roots. It IS a movement of hundreds and hundreds of ordinary Australians, writing l-tters every in response to urgent actIOn appeals. It IS a movement that brings in doctors' and 'lawyers' groups, but it also brings in sands and thousands of people whose only reason for participation is the growing concern that in a troubled world there are some basic principles that require defence, and defence at every level. I pay tribute to those thousands of.A,usfrom tralians who are part of the one mIllIOn members of Amnesty International worldwide who are today opening their mail, receiving an urgent action appeal, and then at their own expense and in their own'time penning a letter to the president of s-me country or to a Minister of external affairs or to a general who is military commander of some zone or another, to plead for those who are in prison because of their political views or who face the death penalty. I start by saying that our Parliame-t, whilst quite properly at the forefront In expressing concern, is only part of a worldwide movement. I am very pleased to note that Australia has been at the forefront in putting human rights on the agenda. It has done so consistently for many years. It is now true. to say. th-t, wherever issues of human rIghts arIse In this world Australia leads. We have been unafraid - f making representations on these issues even in instances and at times when other nations have resisted the view that it is part of the international community'S legitimate area of concern to scrutinise the internal conduct of another nation on issues of human rights. I think it is significant that shortly. an Australian delegation is to travel to ChIna, one of the nations that for a very long time resisted any international scrutiny of its human rights conduct, said it was a matter entirely for its own internal I?rocesses and refused to hear any VOIces raised'regarding instances of human rights abuses. Now China is opening the doors to international inspection on human rights issues. This reflects the great success of Australia and other governments in making sure that the international perception of human rights as a key issue that concerns all the world is now irreverwee.k sible: the boundaries will not be rolled back. In this change one has to commend Amnesty as being the spearhead that has thou- led to this very different perception. I now address a point put to us by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and an earlier speaker in this debate in relation to Australia's position. It has been noted that Australia's conduct time to time, particularly on Aboriginal policy, has been the subject of Amnesty report. I think that is. import--t because we have to be receptIve to cntIcism from external sources about our own conduct. It highlights the point that even a democratic system of free elective government, participated in in a way such as we have in this country, is no absolute preventive to abuse of human rights. I guess one could instance South Korea as another government which has universal franchise and a democratically elected parliament, but a human rights reco-d that most fair observers would deSCrIbe as quite appalling. So there is no necessary connection between a commitment to democratic principles, an elective system of government, and an observance of basic human rights. The issue that then arises is what we ought to do about our own commitment to entrenching human rights. There are instances where the heat of political pressure may lead otherwise moderate, responsible people in parliamentary positions of authority to do things which on colder reflection they would resile from. Without seeking to be overtly partisan, I take up the remarks made yesterday by the Liberal frontbencher, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), regarding Mr Kennett's conduct in Victoria. He indicated that it resounded against the ordinary principles that we take for granted in democracies, namely, that people will not be punished by superannuation being taken from them by reason of their political stances. Because Mr Costello is distant, he has the ability to step back from that instance, and accordingly is able to say something that is really self evident. But perhaps it is not self-evident to Mr Kennett in Victoria, and that is the problem with relying on the good sense of members of parliament always to shine through in these crucial instances. I think we have to go back to a fundamental debate in this country about whether we should entrench into our constitutional framework some of the basic guarantees of human rights that are entrenched in the United States Constitution, that now apply in the United Kingdom through the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in Canada through the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and were recommended to us by the Constitutional Commission in its final report. It strikes me that we are perhaps guilty of humbug if we do not place in our constitutional framework adequate protections for the very basic freedoms we all concede to be fundamental to our democracy. It is not right to say that the ordinary checks and balances will protect· us always. As the Kennett example shows, overheated judgments can be made in fierce political conflict. As South Korea shows, even a democratic framework is no ultimate impediment to abuses of human rights, nor is a constitutionally entrenched Bill of rights. But it is an additional bulwark, an additional protection that most democracies have seen fit to place into their constitutional framework to make sure that there are some fundamental freedoms and rights-the right of free speech, the right of assembly, rights to jury trial and the like-which are built in in such a way that no government can unpick those rights without at least a referendum. I would strongly urge that the Australian Government revisit the debate around guarantees of basic human rights into our constitutional framework. I go to paragraph 9.123 of the final report of the Constitutional Commission 1988, where it says, adopting the words of Hart: The central mistake is a failure to distinguish the acceptable principle that political power is best entrusted to the majority from the unacceptable claim that what the majority do with that power is beyond criticism and must never be resisted. I hope that this thirtieth anniversary of Amnesty represents an opportunity for us to springboard these fundamental and central concerns about the protection of human rights back onto the constitutional agenda.",36
19,Mrs GALLUS,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"Hawker) (11.26 a.m.)I support the motion before the House. I would like to start by reading some comments on Amnesty International, as follows: '. . . a tout of the US imperialism and its chief espionage and subversive agency .. .' Kabul New Times, Afghanistan. 'It does not even try to hide its true Soviet character . . .' Government of Guatemala. 'Amnesty International is nothing more than a variation on the sinister organisation formerly called ""Hitler Youth"" .. .' Hoy, Mexico. 'All the lackeys of satanic powers like Amnesty International . . . are trying to suffocate the Islamic republic . . .' Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran. Those comments give some idea of the work that Amnesty International does-if it can keep everybody unhappy, it must be doing something wonderfully right. Thousands of people are in prison throughout\ the world, often held without charge. They arc tortured and they are executed because of their beliefs. Men and women disappear after being arrested by authorities and they are murdered without any pretence o(legality. These are the sort of things we read in the newspapers and the sort of things that terrify us when we read them. The strength of Amnesty International is that it allows small people, everyday people like us, as we sit down and watch television, to feci that we can do somcthing about it. Too often we sit there and hear of these things, and feel totally impotent. Amnesty International has given all persons a way to feel that they can come forward and do something. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) mentioned this; that Amnesty offers a way of allowing people to take an active part and feel that they too are helping those people who are imprisoned. I turn to my own State of South Australia and to some Amnesty groups who work there. They are looking after particular people who have been imprisoned. As honourable members would know, Amnesty works at the grass roots, with cells adopting particular prisoners and fighting for their release by writing to ernments asking for their release. The Prospect group is supporting prisoner of conscience Ali Kilic. Ali has not used or advocated violence; he has bcen in prison solely for the non-violent expression of his political beliefs. The Prospect, South Australia, group of Amnesty International has adopted Ali Kilic as a prisoner of conscience; they work for his immediate and uncondi tional release by writing letters to the Turkish authorities and by publicising his case. We also have the Hcnley Beach group of Amnesty International. The Henley Beach group has worked for Vladimir Osipov, a Russian who has becn committed to gaol twice for being a conscientious objector. On both Qccasions he has served a long gaol sentence, yet Vladimir Osipov is not particularly well and has in fact been described by his doctor as feeble minded. Despite this, because he was a conscientious objector, he had to go to gaol twice. The Henley Beach group has been working very hard for his release and was relieved to hear last year that in fact he has been released. The Unley group of Amnesty International is working for Raila Odinga, a prisoner of conscience in Kenya. Raila Odinga, a businessman, scientist, and former academic, aged 48, was arrested on 4 July 1990 and again detained under the Public Security Regulations which provided for administrative detention for an indefinite period without charge or trial. The Unley group of Amnesty International has adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, detained for his non-violent opinions as a leading supporter of multiparty democracy in Kenya. It is in this way that the people of Adelaide can have some influence on the intcrnational scene, because I think it has been shown that the letters they do write to govcrnments certainly have an effect. Amnesty Intcrnational seeks the release of pcoplc who are in prison for their beliefs, colour, sex, ethnic origin, language or religion. It fundamentally opposes the death penalty, torture, inhumane punishgov- ment and degrading treatment of all prisoners, and sceks to ensure fair and prompt trials for all political prisoners. This year 1991 is a key year for Amnestv International. It is the Women's Action Year. In 1991 Women's Action Amnesty International is campaigning to involve its members and the general community in a worldwide campaign to put an e?d to abuses, particularly those concernmg women. 'Nomen have been subjected to gross and humiliating human rights violations. Women are targeted when they speak out in organised protests against the injustices of governments. Women are threatened, imprisoned, tortured and killed by authorities as substitutes for relatives and friends, or simply because of the relationships they have with men who are unaceeptable to authorities. They are targeted because they are seen as vulnerable, willing to do anything to protect their families and others close to them. Consequently, we have many women who have been detained, and Women's Action 1991 has listed hundreds and hundreds of women who have been detained because of their beliefs, not because of anything they have done. I would like to read out just a few of those names to give an idea of the type of women who are being held. In Ethiopia, Tadelech Haile-Mikael has been held in detention for over 11 years without formal charge or trial. In El Salvador, Sara Cristina Chan Chan Medina's whereabouts have not been clarified by the authorities, despite evidence that the government forces were responsible for her arrest. She has simply disappeared without trace. In India, there was the arbitrary arrest and alleged torture of Gurmit Kaur by the Punjabi police solely because of her family association. This is something that happens to women. They are targeted when their husbands, brothers and sons become involved in political movements. They are also used because women, of course, are particularly vulnerable in relation to their children. Maria Nonna Santa Clara, Angelina Llenaresas, Josefa Padcayan, Marcelo Bawagan and Arnel Hidalgo have all been placed in military custody in the Philippines and have disappeared; there is no sign of them. In Turkey, Gulnihal Yilmaz has disappeared. I could go through this book, which lists hundreds and hundreds of names of women who have disappeared, not to be heard of again. Groups of women throughout the world are working for those women who have disappeared, trying to find out what has happened to them and working for their release. As I have said, women are particularly vulnerable because rape and other forms of violent abuses are used as forms of torture, and because women can be intimidated by the threats to their children. On another note. the honourable member for Denison mcntioned freedom of speech. That is surely what Amnesty International is all about: the right of anyone to have the right to say what he or she believes. The honourable member for Denison introduced a political note into this debate, despite its being a quite apolitical debate or a non-partisan debate. He mentioned what is going on in Victoria, and he expressed his strong belief in the freedom of speech. I might put it back to the honourable member for Denison that I will be interested to see how he votes when we later have a vote on the freedom of speech to do with the ban on political advertising. It has been raised that Amnesty International is a tool of the West. Rights in texts drafted when western European powers hold sway in the United Nations system are seen by many new states as an extension of the liberal democratic traditions of Western countries, which other countries with different values and cultures cannot reasonaply be cxpected to observe. Amnesty International, in other words, has been accused of moral imperialism. I think that we should look at this issue, because Amnesty International's position is that the international community of states recognises that some human rights apply to all humans, and I think we have to support this. The right to free speech, the right to say what we want to happen in our own country is a fundamental right and is not just a right of Western nations. If there is moral imperialism, perhaps it is a good form of moral imperialismthat we have to believe in something, and that something has to go forward into other countries. Let us applaud Amnesty International for taking the very strong stand that the principle behind it is not just a belief that belongs to a few countries but one that belongs to the whole world, and that we should move it out on that basis. It is not a matter of debate. Freedom of speech is paramount, as is the right not to be tortured or imprisoned without just cause. I congratulate Amnesty on its 30 years and wish it well for the next 30 years with the fervent hope that, in this time, the need for its existence diminishes.",37
20,Mr LAVARCH,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,"Fisher) (11.36 a.m.)About two\ years ago, a rather famous incident occurred in a shopping mall in South Australia when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) confronted a rather angry pensioner. They exchanged words and unfortunately, for the Prime Minister's sake at least, the incident was recorded on television and ran as a rather controversial issue for several weeks. But a few points about that incident are very relevant to this debate and speak volumes about what we take very much for granted in Australia-some of our most basic human rights. We have here in Australia a situation where not only can a citizen approach the leader of the land and tell that leader exactly what he thinks about him, but also where an exchange can take place between the two individuals and, at the end of the day, it is the Prime Minister who apologises to the citizen. I wonder in how many countries in the world that would happen. First of all, in how many countries could a situation occur where citizens could directly confront the leader of their country? Secondly, in how many countries would that leader apologise to the citizen when a heated exchange occurred? I think that speaks volumes about many of the basic fundamental rights that we take for granted in Australia. It is, of course, a matter of profound concern and sadness to us all in this House that the same sorts of rights exist, and that incidents of that nature could occur, in relatively very few countries around the world. Australia is one of half a dozen or so countries that has enjoyed a period of continuous parliamentary democracy since the turn of the century; given all the countries in the world, that is quite a startling figure. It is for those reasons that Amnesty International is such a vital and important organisation. Amnesty, as we have heard in this bipartisan debate, is an organisation which did not start from a government's point of view; it did not start out of an established political movement. It started with one individual, an individual who decided that one person can make a difference. Fmm that first decision has grown over the last 30 years an organisation which has had a profound effect on the way in which governments operate around the world. Sadly, of course, for the many successes which Amnesty has enjoyed, there have been as many, if not more, failures. But the really importantand, I suppose, startling-point is that there have been successes at all. We have here an organisation which does not have behind it the force of any particular government; it has no military back up; it cannot impose economic sanctions upon countries. And yet, simply through the force of public and world opinion, mobilised through individuals deciding to bother to be concerned and take a stand, we have seen changes of attitudes from many governments in relation to many thousands of individuals who would otherwise still be imprisoned or who would have suffered an even worse fate. That is a remarkable achievement, and it is only fitting and right that this House should debate the motion on this subject. I am delighted to see the very strong bipartisan support for Amnesty. This is an occasion when we can step back a bit and think that the things that join us as Australians and the things that join us across political differences are far more important and far more fundamental than our differences, because we in this country do believe in basic human rights, in the rule of law and in the right of individuals to have and enjoy certain liberties. They are the building blocks of a decent democratic society and on the whole they are building blocks which are unquestioned in Australia. That is not to say that Australia can now sit back and gloat and think that all things are perfect. They are not. On occasions, as has been pointed out, Australia has itself been the subject of comment by Amnesty. Certainly our record towards Aborigines has not been a good one. One only has to start to go through the recommendations and the evidence of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody to have that clearly understood. In terms of improving the position, status and rights of a segment of our own population, Australia has far more to do. We should always bear that in mind when, quite rightly, we point to other places in the world and make representations-either at a governmental level or as individuals, as members of Amnesty-about the practices which are occurring elsewhere. We always have that fundamental obligation to have our own house in order. Having said that, the purpose of today's motion is to celebrate and pay tribute to Amnesty. Amnesty's current report covers violations of basic human rights in some 96 countries; some 40 countries recently have executed political prisoners. That cord, unfortunately, will no doubt remain. Internationally, through the United Nations, we have basic covenants and conventions which attempt to guarantee basic human rights and political rights for all citizens of the world. Although many countries subscribe in name to these particular conventions, it is an unfortunate fact that mere adherence to a written set of laws in itself does not mean that those countries will in fact give full effect to those laws. That is where Amnesty plays its part-by putting the pressure of world opinion, public opinion and individual opinion on governments and decisionmakers. I would like to take up a point raised by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who said that we in this country should not be complacent and that, outside the question of the Aboriginal uation, there have been examples where some basic rights have been challenged. It is right that we should carefully consider any instance such as this. I look forward to the debate on these points later this day, when there will be a debate on a controversial piece of legislation. Indeed, in my own State of Queensland, for a period of time, limitations were imposed on the right of assembly and on the freedom of expressing views through street marches. I wonder whether we should not again look at the recommendations, as the honourable member for Denison suggested, of the Australian Constitutional Commission, which recommended that Australia have as part of its Constitution a statement-a Bill, if you like-of basic rights. As I pointed out, that in itself does not guarantee anything but it does add an important adjunct to the Australian system whereby we do have, through our courts, a long history of supporting rights. It is a further weapon-a further safeguard, if you like-to make sure that Australia continues to enjoy its generally very high standard of recognition of basic rights. Until all human rights abuses are removed from the world there will always be a place for Amnesty International. We re have a strong record of support here in Australia for the organisation. I have no doubt that that will continue, and I wish it well in its future and in the job that it does so well. Mr 'JUGENT (Aston) (11.46 a.m.)-It is my privilege to have the opportunity to speak in this debate today. I know that previous speakers have given extensive coverage of what Amnesty is all about, and inevitably, as I am the eighth speaker, there will be some duplication. As one of the vice-chairmen of the Australian Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International, I Will concentrate my remarks primarily on the activities of that group. The Australian Federal Parliament is unique, of course, in that it has one of the Australian Amnesty International groups organised entirely within its strucsitture, membership being open to all Federal senators and members and their staff and others working within the Parliament itself. The Australian Parliamentary Group comprises nearly 190 members. The overwhelming majority of the elected senators and members of this place, drawn from all parties represented in the Parliament, are represented in Amnesty. Amnesty itself was established in 1961, the inspiration coming from an English lawyer, Peter Benenson, who had read in November 1960 of the sentencing of two Portuguese students whose crime had been to drink a toast to freedom in the darkest days of the Salazar dictatorship. Benenson realised that throughout the world there were \ thousands of people imprisoned and tortured simply for holding political opinions contrary to those of the repressive regimes under which they were living. With the assistance of Eric Baker and Louis Bloom-Cooper, Benenson published an advertisement on 28 May 1961 drawing public attention to the fate of eight men imprisoned for their beliefs. His advertisement, entitled 'The forgotten prisoners', drew attention to the fate of such prisoners as Agostino Neto, the poet who was to become the first president of independent Angola; Ashton James, an American minister and civil rights campaigner; Peter Duncan, a South African anti-apartheid activist; and Jose Cardinal Mindszenty, the Roman Catholic Primate of Hungary. In December 1961 the first symbolic Amnesty barbed wire surrounded candle to remember prisoners of conscience was lit on the steps of the church of St Martins-in-the-Field in London. The symbolism of the candle, now Amnesty's worldwide symbol, is derived from the old Chinese proverb, 'Better to light a candle than curse the darkness'. Amnesty's charter is a simple one. It campaigns to prevent abuses 'of human rights on a general level with internationally coordinated efforts to eliminate practices such as torture and the use of the death penalty. It also campaigns for the freedom of prisoners of conscience, those men and women around the world who have eschewed the use or the threat of violence and who have been imprisoned simply on the basis of their political beliefs. The work of Amnesty is never ending. Nearly half of the members of the United Nations hold prisoners of conscience. There have been reports of torture in more than 60 countries. In over 50 countries people may be held without trial or without charge. In at least 35 countries the death penalty continues to be enforced, often for crimes which are purely political. In 1973, following an initiative of the Victorian section of Amnesty International, Dr Dick Klugman, the then Australian Labor Party member for Prospect, wrote to all Federal senators and members to invite them to indicate an interest in forming a parliamentary group of Amnesty. By 1974 such a group had been established with a small initial membership, which now has grown to almost 190. The Parliamentary Group annually elects a president, various office bearers and an executive committee. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the leaders of the other recognised parties represented in the Parliament act as patrons of the group. All its work is entirely bipartisan or, perhaps more correctly, non-partisan in its nature. Chairmen of the group have included Race Mathews, David Hamer, Philip Ruddock-my colleague at the table in the debate today-the late Senator Alan Missen, Barry Jones, Bill Morrison, Peter Falconer and the current president, Robert Tickner. The executive always contains representatives of all of the parties in the Parliament, including the various Independents. The support of Amnesty patrons has been important in reinforcing both the significance accorded to human rights issues in the Federal Parliament and the non-partisan nature of that support. In October 1983 the patrons lit a candle of hope in Kings Hall in the old Parliament House to mark the opening of prisoners of conscience week. On 28 May 1986 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the then Senator Macklin lit candles made by local Canberra school children marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of Amnesty. Just this week we have had the thirtieth anniversary of Amnesty when the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Powell) and the Acting Leader of the Australian National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), also lit candles in the foyer of the new Parliament House. The regular meetings of the Parliamentary Group are also attended by a liaison officer from the human rights section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. All Foreign Ministers have been vigorous supporters of the group's work. The group itself undertakes various activities. In the first place, it provides a forum to hear various speakers from outside the Parliament on specific issues. Secondly, the group hears reports from its own members who have raised human rights issues with foreign governments during their own official or private overseas travels. Thirdly, the group participates in Amnesty's worldwide activities, such as those aimed at torture or the death penalty. Amnesty parliamentary members have presented petitions and made visits on these questions to embassies, including those of Chile, Indonesia, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States, China, Iran, South Africa and many others. Fourthly, the group acts on various individual cases brought before it. It is that the group often shows its particular value as being a parliamentary one. Fifthly, the group submits regular urgent action appeals to the Department of Foreign Affairs which, with the support of the Foreign Minister, endeavours to give those prompt attention through Australia's various diplomatic posts overseas. Regular reports are made back by the Department to the group, which has expressed its keen appreciation of the great efforts made by the Department and its officers on these difficult matters. Sixthly, the group uses the resources of the Parliament to give publicity to the launching of various Amnesty International reports. While the group consists primarily of elected parliamentarians, its membership is open to all those who work within the Parliament, and members of staff, librarians and press gallery representatives have been active over the years as participants. Worldwide there are thousands of parliamentarians who are individual members of Amnesty International. However, the unique status of the Australian Parliamentary Group has proved to be extremely valuable, because it allows Amnesty International access where that might not have been possible to nonparliamentary representatives. It provides a status for Amnesty International activities, underpinned by the patronage of leaders such as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. It operates closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and with the support of the Foreign Minister. It allows easy access to the media for Amnesty International initiatives. It fosters a truly national and non-partisan level of support for the vital work done by Amnesty International in the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the world. Within the forum of partisan conflicts which otherwise characterise the Parliament, this achievement is both politically unique and, I have to say, personally very satisfying. The Parliamentary Group of Amnesty International is proud of the support which it has been able to give to ' here Amnesty International's work and the extent to which we have helped to keep the flame of the candle of hope burning bright. Finally, the Parliamentary Group has been pleased to be involved with the thirtieth anniversary of Amnesty International this week in both the candle lighting ceremony in Parliament House and at the Alan Missen memorial lecture yesterday given at the National Press Club by Sidney Jones. May I conclude on a personal note. I knew Alan Missen. I would always hold him up as an outstanding Australian, as an outstanding parliamentarian and as an outstanding human being-and perhaps, above all, as an outstanding champion of Amnesty International. He probably did more for the cause of Amnesty International in this country than almost any other person I can think of. I am sure that he would have been very pleased had he been able to be here today to join us in supporting this motion.",39
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is apjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA,43
22,Dr BOB WOODS,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"I move: That the House: (1) is of the opinion that grave injustices done to many Australians of Italian descent were interned during World War II; (2) acknowledges that many of these people were falsely accused of being fascists when they left Italy because of their intense dislike that ideology and the way in which it was being enforced by the then Italian Government; (3) whilst recognising the internment policy the circumstances of the national emergency in which it was implemented, nevertheless regrets the suffering caused to certain innocent lians of Italian descent who were interned; (4) recognises that many of those who interned were loyal Australians who wished see democracy triumph over nazism and fascism; and (5) investigate the possibility of having tions to the above effect appended to the ment records which are now part of the public record. Today I wish to address a blot lian history-a blot which rclates to the internment of Italians during the Second World War. In many respects it may seem somewhat trite or even hypocritical for people to extend their sympathies or state their embarrassment about events for that which they were not responsible and which took place half a century ago. On the other hand, in precisely the same way that we understand and, indeed, applaud the efforts of contemporary Germany to come to grips with the many crimes committed in the name of the German state during the Second World War and, indeed, the recent openness in the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, in light of the Stalin crimes, it seems fitting, if only on a much smaller and much more benign scale, that we in Australia should come to grips with some aspects of our response to others during the Second World War. I am ticularly referring to the difficult situation of a nation trying to rationalise the ment of its own citizens in a time of crisis. During the Second World War Britain, Australia, and, indeed, most countries, in one way or another, with few exceptions, interned citizens who, because of either DESCENT ethnic or political affiliations, were reas potential spies, enemy agents or fifth columnists. With respect to Italian Australians, the were sentiment abroad in Australia in the late who 1930s and 1940s clearly reflected a lack of sophistication and a genuine concern about Australia's security, bordering at in fact times on xenophobia in regard to nonof English speaking people. It would be ridiculous to say that there was no basis at all for those concerns, but they were, of in course, greatly exaggerated at that time. T think it is important that, rather than Australabouring in the past or simply offering what would amount to a meaningless were apology, we should observe that the Italto Ian community has made a substantial and, indeed, an outstanding contribution to Australian society. Italians at that time notawere just as split in their politics both for internand against fascism and communism as many Australians were. Of course, both Italy and Australia have matured substanon Austratially since that time. It is also of great importance that we learn from this experience that the spirit of Australia is one of decency and one of a desire to protect and to enhance the rights of individuals. It is to be hoped instances such as this internment will never occur again and, that by remembering the past, we will never repeat or attempt to realise the denial or destruction of individual rights in the name of political expediency or cultural xenophobia. Rather than just extending our sympathy to those who suffered, what I would rather do is say that we have indeed learned from such tragic experiences and that out of them we will all work together to create a greater democracy in this country and a greater sensitivity to the rights of individuals, no matter what their parbackground and their affiliations. In addressing the question of civil rights treatin general, we are always faced with a problem of balancing what is perceived to be in the national interest and such matters of instrumental opportunity, pragmatic politics and commercial opportunity with a genuine desire to protect personal and civil liberties and the perception of all citizens that they are equal in the eyes of the law. I think it is a truism that such cynicism has always been part and parcel of politics at all levels, from the shop floor to Federal Parliament, but that is no excuse at all for the crimes which have been perpetrated in the name of cxpediency or, in that most plastic of political tcrms, 'necessity'. There never was a necessity for such a broad-based internment; never will there be. It seems that at the time the necessity was for people to be seen to be doing things. This was a most convenient way of doing something at minimal cost and for maximum political benefit. We have learnt many lessons from the Second World War. I think that the least of those lessons is that, once a state or society loses respect for the rights of its own citizenry, it loses the sense of its own civility-the strength of purpose and identity which make the very idea of a state possible. In these highly volatile and exciting times it gives us pause to reflect more upon the nature of citizenship in a contemporary state and the question of the rights of the individual. I think it is fair to say that no country can ever achieve true security if it is constantly questioning the loyalty of its own citizens. The only safety for a state lies a sense of common purpose which overrides the myriad conflicts and arguments which are characteristic of a pluralistic society. The issue here then is not to neutralise our pluralism but rather to confront it as the very essence of our democracy-indeed, to encourage it and to encourage the sort of debate that leads us yet again to question many matters of policy, both during and after the war. What is further encouraging is that debate is now taking place all around the world, in Italy and different arenas, as much as in Australia, in respect of this matter and other similar matters. There is no question now that as generations pass it is meaningless to arbitrarily identify Australians simply by their ethnic background or by their heritage; it is much more important to identify Australians in terms of the contribution they make, which may, of course, be related to that heritage and to that cultural background, and to the way in which they choose to fashion their identities both as individuals and, indeed, as members of both the Australian community and their own ethnic community. It is very clear in regard to this issue of internment of Italians during the Second World War that, far from being spies or fifth columnists or hostile citizens working for the enemy at that time, the overwhelming majority of Italians who were interned were very fine representatives of their community. They showed many of the fine qualities which are still characteristics of that community today-particularly their love of their families, their caring for their elderly and their protection of and affection for their children, as well as a strong work ethic and a keenness to provide for their own futures. The wonderful contribution of the Italian community to the Australian way of life has been well recognised, aI}d rightfully so, over the last few years. As is my colleague opposite, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), I am very proud to represent a large number of Italians in my electorate in this Parliament. I am pleased to say that there is a bipartisan approach into this issue, both to the issue of internment and to the great qualities of the Italian community. The contribution of the Italian community did not begin with the surge of Italian migration in the early postwar years. It has been with us since the very early days of our country, certainly well before the internments occurred. Undoubtedly, our country is the stronger for a the contribution of number of different ethnic communities. I have particular associations with the Italian community and I am very well aware of the particular strengths of that community. These internments, very sadly, interrupted that process. Indeed, they interrupted the contribution of the Italian community to the building of Australia-a process which is still going on and which is strengthened by the bipartisan multicultural approach which we have at present. I am sure it is one which will continue to build a strong Australia. I say again that this episode of the internment of Italians during World War II is indeed a blot on our history. Clearly, we cannot erase that blot, but we certainly can acknowledge it. Most importantly, we can make sure that that blot, or anything like it, never happens again in this country. I am sure that the bipartisan approach to this motion is one supported by all members of the House. I am delighted to have the support of the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) for this motion. We have discussed the matter in outline. I think that the strength of Australia's commitment towards not just the Italian community but communities in general with an ethnic background, leading to the construction of a stronger, more united Australia, is one that we would widely endorse and which I would certainly endorse. I commend the motion to the House on behalf of both the Liberal and National parties and, I am sure, the Australian Labor Party.",44
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,Is the motion seconded? Mr Ruddock-I second the motion.,46
24,Mrs CROSIO,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"Prospect) (12.04 p.m.)It is with a great deal of pride that I rise today to support this motion and to commend the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) for bringing it forward. I believe it is never too late to amend a wrong. When one looks at the development and growth of Australia and the benefits achieved from the contributions of the Italian community, one should note, for the benefit of the honourable member for Lowe, that an Italian set foot on the soil of this country as a member of the First Fleet. In supporting this motion-and I hope that action will result from it-I will relate the story of a young man who left Italy on 1 January 1927, when he was 23 years old. He arrived in Adelaide 42 days later; he picked grapes for a penny a fourgallon tin; he lived in a tent and cut timber; and during the Depression years he got a job by claiming to be a lefthanded shoveller. He wrote about his first shift 1,200 feet down in the North Mine: We were paid by the tonne and we had to bore and blast the material and we had to pay for the gelignite we used. The year was 1929 and he was then 25 years old. He lived, he worked, he bought a house, and he married in Broken Hill. He left there in 1934 and rented a house and five acres of land at Rydalmere in Sydney. In 1935 he was naturalised, and proud of it. It went down as the day in his life he became an Australian citizen. In 1938 he moved to Wetherill Park and built a home on the 10 acres of land he had bought. He wrote to his brother George in Italy, and in 1938 George came out to help him work his market garden. I might add that it was eight years before George saw his wife and four children again because in 1939 the Second World War started and the Government of the day, with whatever intention, immediately interned the Italians. The Italians in the community ofWetherill Park, which I proudly represent, were all market gardeners and poultry farmers. They built that area; in the 1930s and 1940s the area grew because of the contribution of the Italians who had left their native land to start a new life in Australia. Having seen his brother interned and his cousin in turn scooped up and taken away, this man kept working. He was worried and concerned because he had a young son. In February 1942 the authorities came to his farm. They said, 'You have half an hour. Get showered. Let's go'. He said, 'Where?' They said, 'We are taking you to a camp now'. He said, 'But I am an Australian.' They said, 'No, we are taking you to a camp'. The man got ready within the half hour and begged to be able to say farewell to his son, who was at school. They took him to the school, held him at the gate, but would not allow him to enter the property. They took the young boy, then eight years old, out of the classroom and the man said, 'Farewell, my son'. After spending three weeks at Liverpool, the man was sent to Cowra, where he was interned for 12 months. He then spent 12 months in South Australia. Eight months before they were allowed to come home, the men were allowed to start cutting pines at Mount Gambier. As I said, they were given no notice and no warning. It also occurred that this man's brotherin-law, who lived not far from him and was working a rented property at the time, was also interned. His wife had nothing and moved in with this man's wife, taking her two-year-old daughter with her. Those two women continued to work the farm. The man returned in 1944 from Mount Gambier, having been interned for two years. Ironically, when he came back to the farm he was given a contract to grow vegetables for the Army. I want this man's story recorded in the House because he was my father-in-law. He died two years ago, but he was a gentle man who loved his country, his family and his God. He never harboured any bad feelings about what had happened to him, just sorrow and regret. It is sad and regrettable that these sorts of things happen. People can say it is because of war, but we are human beings and we must always remember what we have done in the past in order to project into the future. That needs to be said because the community I represent proudly projects and promotes the fact that it is the largest multicultural city and local government area in Australia. It has over 100 different nationalities, but the Italians who built that area and their descendants are still the largest group in the city of Fairfield, a city of 104 square kilometres situated 40 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district. I would also like to have recorded not only the importance of that wonderful city of 27 suburbs and a population of 185,000, but also a profile that was projected on a report of the Fairfield City Council in 1990, which said: In many ways today's Fairfield can be seen as a reflection of Australia's development since World War II with each cultural group contributing to our society. This distinctively multi-cultural foundation represents one of Fairfield's greatest assets. Today Fairfield City is a lively blend of the old and new Australia. It is a great place for business, work and leisure. The growth, the cultural contribution and the work that went into that city came from people like my father-in-law and the other Italians who worked, who had small beginnings, and who gave up everything when they left their homes. My father-inlaw, a man of 23 in 1927 when he took the step of coming to Australia, never saw his mother and father again because when he finally could go back to Italy they had died. His brother, who came out to assist him, did not realise that it would be eight years before he saw his wife and four children again. Through their contribution those people gave so much to this country; that man has given so much to his family. I believe that many stories like that could be related throughout Australia. From my own area I could relate story after story of the heartbreak that occurred when those farmers were interned, of the women who did not know what to do, where they would go or how they would live. The friendships that grew among those women in those days remain even now because they all extended a hand to help one another. I hope that is something today's society can learn more from. Those people do not have the bitterness that prevails today among many people who are upset or concerned, whether about something the government of the day has done or about what should have been done or what has not been done. The bitterness that sometimes appears in society today was not in those people, the forefathers responsible for the growth of the area I represent; more particularly, it was not in an Italian-Australian family that suffered so much. Surely all these years later we can say that suffering should not have happened? We talk about hardship and communication today, but when my father-in-law was interned at Cowra and my motherin-law wished to see him, she had to travel for a day and a night with her eight-yearold son. They were allowed to speak only through the wire, which was probably their only contact, except for highly censored mail. Of course I realise that it was wartime, but I do not believe the situation should have gone that far. I again commend this motion to the House. In conclusion, I remind the House that the Australian Citizenship Act was proclaimed on Australia Day, 26 January 1949. In introducing the Bill, Arthur Calwell, the Minister for Immigration, said: It will symbolise not only our own pride in Australia but also our willingness to offer a share in our future to the new Australians we are seeking in such vast numbers. Had that Act been in place in 1942, the internments that took place might not have happened. No-one will ever know that; all we can do is learn from that experience and hope it never occurs again.",46
25,Mr HICKS,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"Honourable members have spoken of the injustices carried out against people of Italian heritage during the Second World War. As we have heard, many of these people were interned quite undeservedly and were separated from their loved ones. The Allies were fighting the Axis powers and, as in the First World War when people of German origin in Australia were incarcerated because of the fear of the development of a fifth column, so too possible enemies were interned during the Second World War. It is difficult for the present generation to understand the feelings that pervaded Australia at that time, but many of the actions taken against Australians of Italian heritage were shameful, as previous speakers have indicated. I may be broadening this debate, but I also wish to pay tribute to other Australians of Italian heritage who were incarcerated during the war. I speak of people who were at one stage engaged in hostilities against the Allies during the Second World War and who were forcibly transported to Australia: the Italian prisoners of war. It is ironic that I should be speaking of this matter, because half a century ago my late father was fighting, along with many Australians, against the combined German-Italian forces in the Middle East. My late father-in-law was a prison guard at the Sandy Creek prisoner of war (POW) camp in South Australia. The saga of Italian prisoners of war in Australia forms an interesting part of Australian history and in particular the Riverina history. This year in the towns of Griffith and Hay in New South Wales and Murchison in Victoria a reunion of Italian prisoners of war is proposed. Many of those 18,500 prisoners, because of a shortage of manpower in Australia, were sent out to various POW control centres radiating from the POW camps to work on local farms. These POW camps were located throughout Australia at Cowra, Hay and Liverpool in New South Wales, at Murchison, Myrtleford and Tatura in Victoria, at Loveday and Sandy Creek in South Australia, at Gay thorne in Queensland, at Mariginup and Northam in Western Australia and at Brighton in Tasmania. There are many stories of the valuable work most of these prisoners performed. In the town of Hay and surrounding areas in the Riverina there can be found a number of artefacts that remind us of their stay. Presently, Mr Michele Larichia, now living in the Griffith area, who was captured in the Middle East in the early 1940s and who arrived in Hay as a prisoner of war, is organising a reunion of former Italian prisoners of war. Mr Larichia and  news of the surrender of Italy's forces to the Allied forces while in a prisoner of war camp in India. When they heard they were to leave, both hoped they were being sent home. Instead they were sent to Australia as farm labourers, still prisoners. They arrived in Gay thorne, Queensland, in 1944 and spend time in Gympie and Cowra camps before being marched into Hay in March 1946 after the Japanese prisoners had been repatriated. In spite of this indignity, Michele and Pietro and most of the other Italians took to Australia like a second home. Like most Italians conscripted into a war, they did not understand, they were from poor peasant families and kn-w little of the war in which they were lDvolved. In an article in the magazine Migration of November/December 1980, Michele is reported as saying: After this suffering, coming to Australia w-s like rising up to heaven. Australians were so kmd to us We were supposed to be enemies but they ga-e us tea and tucker and treated us like human beings. Most Australians would recall the story of Lieutenant Simoni, who escaped from Murchison and spent 10 months of freedom before being recaptured and sent to Hay. I recall that he may have escaped from there also. He was one of a handful of those who escaped between May 1941 and December 1947, when the last were repatriated to Italy. Some of those who escaped were still free until 1952. Recently, while visiting the well-known historical riverboat town of Echuca on the Murray River, I happened to view the remains of the paddle steamer Murrumbidgee which caught fire in November 1948 - nd lay under the silt for 37 years until being recovered for the Echuca museum. I was interested to note that one of its tasks during the war was' carrying sleepers that had been gathered by an Italian prisoner of war team from Hay. There are some small buildings still remaining in the Riverina that these m.en constructed and on some of the propertIes in the district their work, much of it done to remind them of their homeland, can still be seen. The reunion of the Italian prisoners of war is to take place on 1 November in Griffith, 11 November in Murchison and 12 November in Hay. I am sure all members of the House will join with me in wishing those former POWs ev-ry succ-ss for their reunion, as we recogl11se the SIgnificant contribution those who settled in Australia following the hostilities of the Second World War have made to this nation's history.",48
26,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"I am pleased to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), supported by my colleagues in the House the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) and the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). I am pleased to see Senator Panizza here in the public gallery as well. This is a very important motion, and it will be supported by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) for good Italian reasons. The important thing to understand in respect of this motion is the circumstances that gave rise to it. During the recent Gulf war some people in Australia were suggesting that we should deal with people of Iraqi citizenship as if they were enemies. The reality is that very few people want to be politically active; most people who choose to come to a country are happy to be peaceful citizens and to get on with their lives. It was certainly the case with the people of Italian origin who were in Australia and who were interned. There were a variety of experiences. My colleague the honourable member for Riverina-Darling spoke about Italian prisoners of war (POWs),whose circumstances in general were somewhat better than those of some who were interned because in a sense they were dealt with with a degree of dignity because they were prisoners of war. They were fortunate in that they came to Australia from India. We had some in Western Australia. A very happy experience involved one Italian prisoner of war who was sent to a farm in Western Australia and ended up building a farmhouse. He was an Italian builder. He built a farmhouse that was much more majestic and better designed ° than anything the farmer ever thought possible. There were very happy experiences. In general, the experience of the POWs was somewhat better than that of the internees. The honourable member for Prospect has spoken of the shock of suddenly being treated as an enemy when the day before one was treated as a neighbour. This is something that took a lot of people by surprise and hurt them deeply. Many people in Australia had to go through that experience. Colleagues have spoken about that. There were internment camps in various parts of Australia, ineluding Liverpool, Orange and Hay in New South Wales, Loveday in South Australia, Gay thorne in Queensland and Tatura and Murchison in Victoria. That shows that there was a very large internment program in Australia. I can understand the mentality of fear that gripped Australians at the time. It was fuelled by the active pronouncement of fascism by some Italian consuls. then project that political guilt upon all of the Italian people who had chosen to settle in Australia was quite wrong. We recognise that in this motion. This subject has been well written about in a very good book entitled The Italians by Gianfranco Cresciani, which was made into an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television series, and another book on Italian heritage in Australia by Robert Pascoe. I am very pleased that a fellow Western Australian who works for the ABC-Senator Panizza would know about him-Bill Bunbury, has done some excellent work on the Italians who were interned. Incidentally, the Western Australian perience, in many senses, was a better experience than that in north Queensland, where even after the war the Returned Services League (RSL) moved that some 2,000 Italians should be deported. Such was the mentality of the time. In many cases one of the reasons why the RSL wanted them deported was that they were successful; it was not just that they were Italian. They were successful at growing cane and they were successful at running businesses. In Western Australia we saw that they were successful because many of them were interned for only three months. Once that period was over the authorities let them get back to the market gardens because in places such as Waroona and Harvey there were no longer any· vegetables being grown. There was a great impetus towards getting those people back to their previous occupations. In many parts of Western Australia it was essential to get the Italians back into the eommunity where they wanted to be. The experience in Fremantle was not quite so happy. The men were taken away and the women, by and large, were left to run the shops. In a sense it was very diffieult. Their boats were impounded. The experience there was not good. In general, in Western Australia a degree of lament was expressed by the authorities at having to do anything, beeause there was not really any great zeal in trying to deal with the Italians. We saw a process that was But to gone through somewhat reluctantly. The important thing about today's motion is that it gives us a chance as members of parliament to say that we have learned from the experience. What have we learned from the experience? We have learnt that if people have come to live in our country they have made a great commitment. One ought not to presume that, in doing so, because they are foreign they are an enemy. It is a great wrong to impose that upon them. I am therefore pleased to support this motion; I think it is very important. I support the sentiments expressed by my colleagues.",49
27,Mr RUDDOCK,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"I speak briefly to be associated with this motion and to commend, particexularly, Senator John Panizza, who proposed a motion in like terms in the Senate some while ago. He was very instrumental in developing the form of motion that we have before us today. I am very pleased that he has been here in the public gallery to witness this debate in the House of Representatives. I know of his commitment to ensure that this motion was brought forward in a form which could have bipartisan support, which it has had. He deserves to be commended for his involvement in ensuring that we have had this opportunity to discuss this issue. I want to make one other observation. In the national agenda for a multicultural Australia a number of points are made about the way in which we expect new settlers in this country to conduct themselves and also about the commitment that we in the Australian community have to those who join us here. It speaks in the definition of 'multiculturalism' about new arrivals having a first and overriding commitment to Australia. We have recently had to witness Australia again playing a part in a war situation, this time in the Gulf, in which some people called for forms of internment in relation to people of Middle Eastern origin here in Australia. That was not necessary. In looking at those events, we can see that people of Middle Eastern origin demonstrated a commitment to Australia. In the way in which we address these questions today, I think we show a degree of maturity, and had that been evident in those earlier times it would have led to a very different experience. There is no doubting the fact that the commitment of Australians of Italian origin whom I know was first to this nation. Their experience does not speak well of us, but they came through it and their continuing commitment-and I know this from Italians who experienced those events-is first and foremost to Australia.",50
28,Mr SCIACCA,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (12.26 p.m.)-I support the motion. I did not realise that the motion coming on for debate today, but I want to be associated with it. I do so with a sense of pride, having regard to my association with Italians, as is the case with Senator John Panizza, my colleague from the Senate, who is in the gallery.",51
29,Mr GOODLUCK,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,A good member.,51
30,Mr SCIACCA,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"Yes. He is a good fellow too. Senator Panizza moved in the Senate a motion similar to that we are debating today. It was passed with bipartisan support, and that will be the situation here as well. I rise to speak on this motion as, I understand, I am the first Italian born Federal member of this Parliament. As such, it gives me a warm inner glow to know that this motion will be passed. I want to express particular thanks on behalf of the total Italian community, which is a constituency that I tend to represent, being one of its members, as are a number of people. I always seem to be cornered at functions and so forth with requests to help people with this or thatwhich I am quite happy to do. I want to thank in particular the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), a very good friend and colleague of mine, who I know had a very deep personal respect and admiration for her father-in-law, now deceased. I thank my friend the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) and also the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), who moved the motion before the House. These are people for whom I have a great deal of respect. The honourable member for RiverinaDarling mentioned that the Italian prisoners of war association is having a reunion in Griffith. I am well aware of that, because I have been invited to it and I am looking forward to going. Yesterday, Mr Tony Catanzariti telephoned to ask me whether there was some way to get something in writing to acknowledge the motion passed in the Senate. I did not realise that the motion was coming before this House today. I said that I knew that the honourable member for Lowe had a was motion on the Notice Paper for mention on Thursday and that I could arrange for the association to be provided with a certified copy of the Hansard for the Senate and House of Representatives debates on the motions, for presentation to the meeting. The association wants a copy for the historical archives and a copy for the local city council. It will now give me a great deal of pleasure to be able to give it copies of the records of debates in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. I thank in particular Senator John Panizza. I know that it was through his efforts in Western Australia, as well as the efforts of the person from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Stirling, that this got off the ground. I also want to mention a lady by the name of Sonia Turkington, who wrote to me some months ago asking me whether there was something I could do to support her idea of a reconciliation dinner in Perth. She asked me whether there was something I could do and whether I could lobby the Premier of Western Australia. I did that, and I am sure Senator Panizza, as well as other members of the Italian community and, I guess, other politicians, did so too.! I am very pleased to say that only the other day I received a letter from the Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, saying that she not only agreed with the idea but had referred it to Judyth Watson, Western Australian Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs. I heard only yesterday that there will be a reconciliation dinner in Perth some time in August. My only comment is: 'How come I have not received my invitation yet?'. It is fairly obvious to me that there is a great deal of recognition on the part of the total Australian community that once and for all we should put to bed the matter of the Italian prisoners of war. I am Australian first, and very proud of it, but I will never forget my Italian cultural heritage. It is something that I treasure and that is unique to those of us who were born overseas. Italians form the largest non-British or Irish immigrant ethnic group of people in this country. We are proud of it, and I am very proud to be associated with this motion, which, on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, I wholeheartedly support.",51
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIANS OF ITALIAN,"Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Rostered Days Off",52
32,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to raise the issue of productivity in the workplace, with particular reference to the matter of compressed work weeks and the practice of having what is known as rostered days off (RDOs). I recently came across a pocketin sized card that is put out by the Operative Painters and Decorators Union of Ausequipment, tralia. This card lists all the rostered off for 1991 on one side, and the public holidays are shown on the other. Is it mere coincidence that on one side of the card there are the public holidays on the other side there are the rostered days off that this union has told its members they will have off for the year? Australia Day, for instance, falls on 28 January and the rostered day off is 29 January. That gives people a long weekend. Labour Day is on 11 March and an RDO is shown for 12 March. The union members can celebrate their being in work and the institution of the 40-hour week by taking two days off on that weekend. Easter Monday is on 1 April and the RDO is shown for 2 April. The Queen's Birthday falls on 10 June and the union has arranged for an RDO on 11 June. It is all carefully documented on the small card that the members carry close to them as they move around the workplace. They know exactly when the RDOs will be and they can arrange their holidays accordingly. The Australian industrial relations survey found that 60 per cent of all workplaces were organised in such a manner as to permit the working of a four-day week, a nine-day fortnight or a 19-day month. Whilst these arrangements do not result in the employees themselves working a shorter number of hours per week, the Opposition believes that rostered days off are holding Australia back in the recessionary environment of 1991. We are not opposed to flexible working arrangements, provided they are suitable at the local enterprise level. The painters union arrangements are clearly not suitable. The union seeks to impose its will on a whole range of employers, whose capacity to deal with what is effectively a tying up of capFor instance, let us take the Ford plant in Geelong, where there are 600 salaried employees and 3,000 wage earners. Imagine what happens when there is an RDO that plant, when all those personnel are not on the job and when the plant and the capital, is idle for that day days in the month, because of the RDO arrangements. I have just heard this morning that further personnel have been put off at Ford, which is a great calamity for while people in the Geelong region. One can contrast the inflexible industry-wide arrangements of the Painters and Decorators Union with a special agreement that a company in my electorate, Rip Curl Pty Ltd at Torquay, has come to with its employees. The staff in that company knock off at about 12 o'clock each Friday to conduct personal business and spend time with their children. The difference in comparison with the painters is that Rip Curl. employees work for longer hours from Monday to Thursday, which accommodates their production schedules. They get more work done in a more flexible way, by contrast to the arrangements that the painters union has now inflicted on a number of companies that its members work for. It is significant that compressed work weeks are found more frequently in the larger and more unionised enterprises than in small business. The Australian Industrial Relations Society found that 87 per cent of workplaces with more than 500 employees had granted their staff this concession. The corresponding statistic for employers with fewer than 50 workers was only 58 per cent. As usual, the Government has been a pacesetter in this regard, with 69 per cent of those in public administration having access to rostered days off, whilst in the finance sector, typically composed of private sector employees, only 49 per cent were granted this privilege. In simple terms, it means that big plants stop and the small businesses keep going. Similarly, public enterprises, such as those in the electricity and gas production. fields, have been very accommodating. Of course, in Victoria we are used to such 'generosity'. To see that, one has only to look at the massive unfunded liabilities in the State Electricity Commission of Victoria's superannuation scheme or at the featherbedded railway system. Over 90 per cent of employees in the public utilities have access to rostered days off. In the largely privately owned mining sector, by comparison, the figure is only 47 per cent. The Opposition does not disagree that individual RDOs offer some benefits, including the better use of leisure time or home time or, possibly, greater work satisfaction. But at a time when we are grappling with the problems of an economy that has not achieved international best practice in so many areas-for example, land transport, shipping, the waterfront, product quality and timeliness of production-our insistence that employees have a natural right to an RDO needs to be questioned. The idle time of the bigger manufacturing operations is a yoke around the neck of productive Australia because of the RDO view. The practice of concession bargaining or buy-backs, which occurred in the United States automobile industry in the 1980s, has certainly not been favoured here. It is, however, encouraging to see some people on both sides of the industrial relations fence beginning to recognise that we must face up to our many problems. Rostered days off are particularly bad in the blue collar area, as their implementation leads to Australian business using its capital less intensively. Building sites and factories have been closed down for a whole day or a shift; yet importers from other countries rely on our manufactured exports-which we are trying to encourage-being delivered as quickly as possible. Additionally, the cost of shutdown may lead to the deferral of major investment projects. This is not helped by Australia's typically high interest rates compared to other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development industrialised nations, requiring capital to be used for more of the time. Where employees have on their own initiative tried to give back some of their award conditions, they have not found it easy. SPC Ltd staff agreed to forfeit their rostered days off, penalty rates for weekend work, over-award payments and higher shift loadings. To their eternal dis..; credit, the Australian Council of Trade Unions attempted to stop the deal. Seemingly, the union delegates on the shop floor did not know best, despite having tried to tailor their working conditions to suit the needs of their employer. This localised SPC deal has been so successful that yesterday the Chairman of SPC announced that all so-called lost carnings since last December, when staff and management altered their working conditions, would be paid back to employees because there had been more productivity in that plant-up to a 48 per cent improvement-as a result of these changed working conditions. The Opposition agrees with Professor Judy Sloan from Flinders University, who, while speaking on ABC radio on 5 November 1990, said: Looking at things to reform, you should be looki ng at things like rostered days off, and shift restrictions and the like, because we have to use our capital very intensively to be competitive, and hopefully we can pay ourselves very well by doing that. Under this Government, Australia is languishing under the burden of such concepts as rostered days off. The Opposition believes in giving workers the right to recognise that times have changed and that the preservation and growth of 'employment opportunities depend upon creating a more flexible industrial relations approach and doing away with entrenched and statutory RDO obligations that have no regard to profitability and productivity. Rural Women",52
33,Mr HULLS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Kennedy) (12.38 p.m.)Rural women from all over Queensland have converged on Mount Isa this week for the Queensland State Conference of the Country Women's Association (CWA). With over 650 delegates in town, every motel and hotel in Mount Isa is fully booked and hundreds of Mount Isans have put delegates up in their own homes. As well as being an obvious boost to the local economy, the conference has highlighted the often understated yet pivotal role of women in country Australia. I truly believe that rural women have contributed untold bcnefits to Australia's well-being. It is great to see that, after decades as the silent contributors, rural women are making their voices heard and their actions known. The CW A is a non-political organisation; so non-political, in fact, that at the Tricnnial National Conference of the CWA in Brisbane in July 1988 the Association made a deliberate decision not to seek government funding for its projects, although I believe some branches did apply for funding under the National Agenda for Women grants program in 1990-91. The CWA has approximately 56,000 mcmbcrs across Australia. It was first established in New South Wales in 1922 and became a national body in 1945, with the purposc of enabling country women throughout Australia to speak with one voice on matters affecting the welfare of women and children. The continuing need for a body to do ,iust that was highlighted in the CWA submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its reference on equal opportunity and equal status for Australian women. As part of the submission, the Association attached a copy of a mock advertisement for a position for a woman on the land. Among duties listed in the advertisement were the following: responsibility for physical and emotion well-being of self, partner and children; general domestic duties such as cooking, gardening, eleaning and washing heavy, dirty work clothes; supervising correspondence lessons for children or driving them long distances to school; general labouring such as fence building, repairs, cleaning out sheds, clearing weeds, chopping wood and the like; handling, feeding and general care of animals; planting, tending and harvesting crops; sorting and packing produce; pruning and spraying trees; doing business with bank managers, stock and station agents and solicitors; bookkeeping and management of farm accounts; other general secretarial jobs; and consultation on dccisions regarding farm operations such as buying and sclling, improvements and capital expenditure-all this for no guarantecd wages, holidays, sick leave, maternity leave, workers compensation, superannuation or retirement. The hours? All waking hours. Of course, it is not all negatives. The advertisement acknowledges the benefits, such as participation in a joint economic enterprise and the joys of country living-fresh air, home-grown food, plenty of space, and privacy. To my mind, the equation does not quite balance up, which is why organisations such as the CWA have been working with this Government to ease the burden on country women and to address key issues such as health, care availability, transport and education. The Government has worked with the CWA to identify the needs of rural women. Back in 1987 the Association was involved in the rural women's survey in conjunction with the Office of the Status of Women. The CWA distributed survey forms to members and non-members in rural areas. Women were asked about the availability of services in their areas and their priorities for establishing new services and expanding existing ones. They were also invited to give opinions on overall priorities about different forms of government expenditure. The culmination of this work was the joint publication of Life has never been easy, the report of a survey of women in rural Australia. Roads, health and medical services, better education and training facilities and more community welfare services were the top four priorities identified by women if more funding was available. Social issues, such as isolation, and economic issues shared top billing as the single greatest concern of the women surveyed. The December 1989 statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on rural and regional Australia incorporated a response to the survey involving a $25m package of initiatives for new or extended programs to improve the lives of Australians living in rural and regional areas. The gains for country women since our Government came to power have been substantial. This Government has responded to women's needs, and I believe the future looks bright as more and more women become directly involved in the political process. The CWA has demonstrated that constructive lobbying does work; however, I believe we have a long way to go before successful applicants for a job as a woman on the land get their just reward. The next step in the process has already started, albeit slowly, at the local level; that is, more women are becoming directly involved in the political process. Rural women must be amongst the most multi-skilled group of people in Australia, and I am calling for them to add even further to their talents. Gough Whitlam, then Prime Minister, had this to say in child- his opening address to the Women and Politics Conference in August of 1975: For most of this country's history women have lived without visible political power; they have been excluded from almost all levels of government in our society. The momentous decisions which affect how all people live have been made by a minority of individuals who happen to be born white and male. I look around this House and sadly note that not much has changed since 1975. There are still only 10 women in the House of Representatives, which means that only 6.75 per cent of elected members are women. This is out of a total Australian population of which women make up 50.1 per cent. Although the situation may appear a little better in the State government arena, where we have women as Premiers in both Western Australia and Victoria, the figures, before the New South Wales election, show that on average women make up only 10.85 per cent of elected members in lower Houses in Australian State parliaments. This varies from 16.6 per cent in Western Australia to a dismal 7.3 per cent in New South Wales. The most radical increase in the level of women's direct political involvement has occurred at the local government level. In 1986 approximately 13 per cent of elected representatives in local government, Australia-wide, were female. Today that figure is 18.4 per cent. The rapidity of change can be seen in the Queensland figures. In the local government elections in Queensland in March this year the percentage of women elected jumped to nearly 20 per cent, up from only 11 per cent at the last elections. Change is occurring and women are becoming more involved in the political process. However, it has taken a long time to· get not very far. There are some fundamentals that have to be addressed if women are going to be able to seriously consider a political career. It is interesting to note that the first woman ever to become a member of parliament in this country was Edith Cowan, who was elected to the Western Australian Parliament in 1921. The Federal seat of Cowan is now appropriately and ably represented by another woman, Carolyn Jakobsen. One of the main issues regularly addressed by Edith Cowan was support for mothers and child-care assistance. This Government has been exemplary in its child-care programs yet we do not have a child-care facility available in this House. I understand that there are moves afoot for a child-care facility in the Parliamentary Triangle some time in the future but, with about 4,000 people working in this building, I am sure you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there ought to be an appropriate facility in this House. Of course, ridiculously, there is not a parliament in Australia that has in-house child-care. Perhaps one reason why there is an increasing number of women entering politics at the local government level is that many councils run their own childcare centres and, if not, care generally is available at the community level. I first raised this issue in my maiden speech in this House and, once again, I call on the House to set an example in terms of work based child-care and establish a centre in this building. When one looks at the antics of some honourable members, I guess some would say that this House already is the most expensive child-care centre in the land. At this point, I guess I should declare a personal interest: my wife, Petrina, is due to have our first child in three weeks. Despite the restrictions of parliamentary life, I hope to play an active parenting role which would be made much easier if I had child-care available to me here. Petrina would appreciate it as, I am sure, would many other honourable members of this House, their partners and the thousands of parliamentary employees. Finally, I return to the work of the CWA. I applaud the Association for its unsung efforts on behalf of isolated women and families around Australia. I appreciate the merits of its non-political stance. However, I urge honourable members of this House to take note that rural Australian women are the hidden backbone of this country and that we should be doing everything we can to encourage them to enter the political process. Their involvement can only benefit all concerned. If not, we will have Gough Whitlam's words ringing in our ears for another decade and a half. Heaven forbid. Industrial Relations Commission",54
34,Mr CHARLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance today is with this Federal Government, the Cabinet and the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for bringing into question the rule of law in this great nation. On 16 April 1991, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, a quasijudicial body, brought down a decision with respect to the national wage case which was at variance with an accord between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Executive, the Federal Government, represented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). From that date, literally millions of words have appeared in print, been heard over the airways, and been expressed in speeches in this House and elsewhere regarding the appropriateness of the Commission's decision and its role or non-role in the fixing of wages and conditions of employment affecting many millions of employees across the length and breadth of our land. The issue I address today is not the issue of accord mark VIol' the Industrial Relations Commission's response to that accord but, rather, the issue of the independence or otherwise of the judiciary and the quasi-judicial bodies in our democratic system. I am reliably informed that there is great angst amongst those in the legal fraternity. Their view is that the independence of the judiciary and quasi-judicial bodies is under severe threat by executive government to undermine or limit their independence. There is, in fact, a body of opinion that suggests that justices, the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission and commissioners are spending such a great proportion of their time discussing amongst themselves the issue of contempt that their real working efficiency is today severely reduced. It is public statements made by Cabinet Ministers, officials of the ACTU and other top-ranking union officials regarding the Industrial Relations Commission's April national wage case decision which has brought into question the competence of industrial commissioners and the Commission-which is a serious matter in its own right-an'd, as well, has questioned the role of that Commission and whether or not it should simply be a rubber stamp for executive government decision. Many of us on this side of the House and, I suspect, some on the Government benches as well, today have severe reservations regarding the relevance of Parliament and specifically the relevance of the House of Representatives, considering the extraordinary power held by, and exercised by, this Federal Labor Government. The issue regarding the role of the Industrial Relations Commission is just one more example of the arrogance of this Government, its lack of response to the will of the people and the denigration of the role of parliament and the judiciary in our democratic society. I draw the attention of honourable members and, in particular, the Attorney General, to a recently published statement by the Australian Bar Association drawing attention to the fact that. the independence of the judicial and quasi-judicial bodies in our country is under threat. The Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council, Mr D. L. Harper, has stated that 'recent action by members of the Federal Government has served to emphasise the immediacy of that threat'. Firstly, the Treasurer was reported in the Sunday Age of 5 May 1991 as saying that 'the Industrial Relations Commission would have to rethink its position or it would not have a position'. Secondly, the Minister for Industrial Relations, as reported in the Australian of 6 May 1991, indicated that 'any determination of the Remuneration Tribunal which sought to pass on benefits of the national wage case to Australia's Federal judiciary would not be implemented'. Thirdly, Mr Wally Curran, Victorian Secretary of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, was reported in the Herald-Sun of 12 May 1991 as having accused the Industrial Relations Commission and the commissioners of 'lacking ability, obvious bias, hypocrisy, impropriety and incompetence'. Fourthly Mr Bill Kelt-, Secretary of the ACTU,' was reported m the Australian of 2 May 1991 as havil)g said in relation to the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission: It is a sickening decision, but there is no reason for the trade union movement to eat the vomit. These are all clear violations of section 299(1) (d) (ii) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988; an act to downgrade the role and status of the Commonwealth judiciary and the Industrial Relations Commission. The community view would be that they constitute an attack on democracy. I am concerned that the Attorney General has failed to exercise his responsibility to consult with the Director of Public Prosecutions to the effect that any, or all, of the above statements may constitute a violation under the Industrial Relations Act. The Director should consider bringing charges against any or all such individuals in accordance with the Act. I ask honourable members: is the law to be upheld, is it to be changed, or is it to be ignored in order for us to live by executive decree? Mr Harper, in his statement on behalf of the Victorian Bar Council, went on to say: These examples are but the latest in a series. They demonstrate an attempt to downgrade the status and role of the Commonwealth judiciary and of the Industrial Relations Commission. They herald an attack, no doubt unintended on democracy it s e l f . ' , The issue is not one of benefits for individual members of the judiciary or quasi-judicial bodies. The issue is whether the judiciary can be independent if its pay and conditions are subject to government whim; and whether the Industrial Relations Commission should exercise independence of judgement. By its actions, the Federal Government has attacked the institutions best positioned to protect democracy against the encroachments of executive power. It has placed the rule of law and the freedoms of a civilised society in jeopardy. It deserves condemnation in the strongest terms. Mr Harper has rather eloquently stated the major case of concern by all those practising law in Australia. But I remind honourable members that the Industrial Relations Commission is not a court of law. It is, in fact, a statutory body-a commission-given legitimacy by an Act of Parliament. I have no doubt that the executive members of the Commission, including the President and deputy presidents, consider that the Commission is a court and, as such, is entitled to total independence from both the Parliament and from executive government. Recently, the Government has broken the nexus between the Federal Court and commissioners' pay rates. It seems to me fairly obvious that the Commission is not a court, because this Labor Government and the unions are obviously able to selectively accept or reject decisions made by the Commission. The Industrial Relations Act 1988, itself, together with recent amendments to that Act, gives great control to the Commission to force Commission decisions on employers and legally enforce those decisions with very heavy penalties for non-compliance. But the Commission seems unable to enforce its decision on individual trade unions or now upon the ACTU in national wage cases, representing as it does the entirety of what we call the great union movement. It is this great lack of balance which, more than any other argument, calls into question the power of the Industrial Relations Commission and its status as an independent legal body. The Industrial Relations Act 1988, section 299 (1) (d) (ii), clearly states that a person shall not by writing or speech use words calculated to bring the Commission or a member of the Commission into disrepute. Clearly, today the Industrial Relations Commission is in disrepute and the independence of our judiciary is under threat. That clause and other less onerous clauses in Acts relating to other statutory bodies are intended to give a form of protection to those institutions which we in Australian society see as having a role to play on behalf of the community-on our behalf-and to allow their role to be protected from verbal and written abuse, from contempt. It is clear that we as a society believe that we should not show disrespect to our judicial and quasi-judicial bodies or to members of those bodies in the performance of their duties. As long as the Commission has such rights and such powers it is my view that this Government has a responsibility of the highest order both to uphold the law and to be seen to be upholding the law. Action or lack of action by this Federal Labor Government is to be brought into question. My heart and my soul grieve today for the future of the rule of law in our particular form of parliamentary democracy. Multiculturalism",56
35,Mr CAMPBELL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I want to grieve about the new class and the havoc that I see them wreaking on this country. I have said in this House before that the Duke of Wellington said that, if your neighbours are church people, you should mark your lambs early. It is advice that I have found to be profound in my life. Those people who are given to moralising are amongst the most suspect. Examples abound throughout history of such moraliserspeople such as Senator Joe MCCarthy in the United States and the inquisitors of Spain. In fact, during the Spanish Inquisition the suspect nature of the inquisitors was encapsulated in the proverb, 'The devil hides behind the cross'. In Australia today some of the biggest moralisers are to be found in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. They are the sanctimonious parsons of the new class. One of the chief among them is Irene Moss who, over a period of two years, at great expense to the taxpayer, conducted an inquiry into racist violence and recently delivered a report. One of the gems in this report was the claim that Lambing Flat was in Victoria. Of course, it used to be in New South Wales near Young. So the new class attempts to rewrite history as well as to distort the truth about racial problems in Australia. [rene Moss's inquiry into racial violence clearly targeted the old Australian population and no other. It made no mention at all of the violence between ethnic groups, which is much more of a problem in this country. Local Australians, therefore, effectively and unwillingly subsidised Irene Moss to launch a bigoted attack upon themscIves. When I read this report in the paper recently, I phoned up a friend of mine in Perth and I said to her. 'You are a bit Chinese looking, aren't you?' She explained to mc that most Chinese people were. I then said to her, 'Well, you have been in Australia for 16 years; how much prejudice have you encountered?' She said, 'None at all. I have found Australians very friendly. I think Australians like the Chinese.' 1 just cite that as an example. Here we have Irene Moss, who goes out, at our expense, looking for trouble and then complains when she finds it. I think that, if she were to adopt a more positive attitude, she would have a much less jaundiced view of Australian society. Generally speaking, Australians arc much more tolerant than the migrants we import. The actions of a few arc highlighted, repeated ad nauseam and used as stereotypes. Moss and others recommend punishments, bannings and legal sanctions to suppress or change the attitudes of old Australia. It is their irresponsible actions that are prone to make racial backlash and violence more likely. They do this quite simply by debasing the language. Every time people raise a criticism of immigration or of multiculturalism, they arc told that they are racist. In the final ysis people will say, 'So what? I am a racist.' Then real racists wi 11 arise in society and people will say, 'But they call everyone racist.' That is how the damage will be created and wreaked on society by these people. We are told that we need drastic action. Irene Moss's action is typical of the witch hunters that abound through history. What do they do? The first thing that they do is to create a problem, then they claim the problem is endemic in society. They say it needs this drastic action-drastic solutions. They, as self-appointed moral guardians in society, will lead this charge to make sure that these evils, which thcy have created, are rooted out. An example of this is in the Australian of 1 May 1991 where Irene Moss is reported as follows: ""I try to look at it this way,"" she said. ""Multiculturalism is working in 90 to 95 per cent of people. We are looking at the ugly 5 per cent. But it has to be looked at."" Irene Moss is saying that, if one opposes multiculturalism, one is a racist and, therefore, must be looked at-put under the inquisition. I have got news for Irene Moss. I oppose multiculturalism and I do not think that I am particularly racist. Not only 1, but at least 80 per cent of Australians, oppose multiculturalism-a policy that was forced on Australia by the political parties; and it is to be found in both political parties. There has never been a mandate for multiculturalism in this country and no government has ever had a mandate. In my view, if it were put to a vote, there never would be a mandate for such a policy. Another one of Irene Moss's gems comes to mind; she said in an interview recently, 'We need to have contact with our Asian neighbours if we are going to survive economically'. She points to the Garnaut report which found that when Asian people conduct business in Australia they are intimidated by racism. That is absolute nonsense. People from Asia arc not intimidated. Generally, people in Asia do not see us as racist. I have been to China on two occasions and I can say that racism is alive and well in China. The Chinese people look to Australia and anallike to do business with us precisely because we are not Asian. To them we are a Western country that is non-threatening. That is the reason that we will get business from China. The Garnaut report was a very flawed document. Garnaut is a man with no experience in business. He has jumped on the new class band wagon, and is virtually saying to Australia, 'If you don't cavil, if you don't crawl, if you don't subjugate yourself to Asia, then they won't be nice to you.' I say to Australia that we have a duty to trade with the world. It is a duty that we owe to our children and no-onc else. We, as Australians, must make sure that the world, not just Asia, is our oyster. Indonesia has said recently that Australia and Indonesia are part of the Pacific. I would say that, while this is true, we are equally part of the Indian Ocean. So we must have a policy that takes in a much wider choice than that bestowed on us by these people. I would like to quote the views of Oliver Wendell-Holmes, one of the great jurists of the American Supreme Court, and I would like to contrast this with the actions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because what it is doing is undermining free speech. All its actions tend to want to limit it, to curtail it and to deliver us into the hands of this self-purported elite-this new class that postures that it knows what is best [or us. An article quotes Oliver Wendell-Holmes as saying: The best test of truth is the power of the trut h to get itself accepted in the market place. The article continues: It is in the free discourse and conflict of views that a democracy draws its vitality and draws its strength to embrace people of all racial backgrounds in an atmosphere of mutual tolerance, understanding and respect. I would say, therefore, that movcs to legislate in Australia against racial statements are in fact very counterproductive. This view was expressed by David Allen, a solicitor from Victoria: Legislation to outlaw such views or ideas rests primarily on a desire to shape moral attitudes which may have a general impact upon behaviour. Accordingly the New South Welsh racial vilification legislation was introduced as having a strong symbolic value-to make people realise what is and what is not acceptahle to society. That objective is perfectly admirable. But the law is not the proper vehicle to teach such morality. In a democracy the /}'/{th should never be proclaimed by the state. Clearly moral considerations do underpin the Jaw hut it is the act of murder, not anger or hatred, which is punished. In 1989-90, the total expense of the Human Rights Commission was $9m. Australians are entitlcd to ask what they get for their moncy, apart from sanctimonious sermons and insults and recommendations to reduce freedom of speech-all by a few people such as Irene Moss. These people, as I have said earlier, are the people that create the problems, thcn put themselves up as solutions to the problems, thereby ensuring their own continuation. What we get is a totally Stalinist attitude which I believe is a very ugly side of the new class of Australia which attempts to engineer in this country the social changes that it, for reasons of its own, deems to be in our interests. Social Justice",58
36,Mrs GALLUS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I notice that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has spoken strongly this morning about freedom of speech, as did the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) earlier on today. I say to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie what I said to the honourable member for Denison: I hope that he will remember the speech he made today when it comes to voting on freedom of speech and political advertising later today. I want to address today the absolute hypocrisy of this Government. Day after day, I sit in this chamber at Question Time and hear this Government tell us what a great, caring, kind Government it is and what a bunch of uncaring people we are on this side of the House. It is full of rhetoric, not only spoken but written, and I refer to the document Towards a Fairer Australia: Social Justice Budget Statement 1989-90, on which is written 'Circulated by the Honourable R. J. L. Hawke and The Honourable Brian Howe', who might otherwise be known as the Minister for social justice. Under the heading 'Social Justice-The Centrepiece of the 1989-90 Budget', there is a great statement about this Government's aim: The Government's social justice strategy is about making 'a fair go for all' a reality and redressing inequities in Australian society. It goes on: . . . the Government has, since 1983, progressively put in place a wide range of programs that are making Australia a fairer, more compassionate society that provides better !ife chances for all Australians, particularly the most disadvantaged. I have never heard so much hypocrisy because this is absolute rhetoric and there is nothing in the actual facts of the way this Government has gone on since 1983 that bears out these claims that it makes. There is a great difference between what this Government says and what this Government does. I would like to start by having a look at a report by Marc Lombard from the Macquarie University School of Economic and Financial Studies entitled An Examination of Income Distribution in Australia 1983-89, which one would think would be one of the platforms of which this Government would be very proud. It has boasted of its aim for equality in income distribution. Under the heading 'Evidence', the report states: The major finding of this study is that there has been a significant widening of the income gap in Australia during the period 1983-1989. This is probably best illustrated by the fact that, in 1982-83, the top 1% of income earners earned as much as the bottom 11 % per cent of income earners. By 1988-89 that same top 1% earned as much as the bottom 21 %. A nearly 100% increase. Translatcd into number of taxpayers, it means that, in 1982-83, some 61,000 high-income earners had a taxable income equivalent to that of 672,000 low-income earners. Six years later, the 79,000 taxpayers representing the top 1% of income-earners were earning as much as the bottom 1,666,000 income-earners. ... the bottom 10% of taxpayers have seen their share of income reduced from 3.52% to 2.79 . . . . Likewise, the bottom 50% of taxpayers saw their share of income reduced from 30.3% to 26.7%. It also states: . . . at the same time, the top 1% of incomeearners have seen their share nearly double from 3.98% of total income, in 1982-83, to 7.36%, by 1988-89. That is all very well; it might havc happened. But these statistics make absolute nonsense of this Government's going around boasting and saying that it is the Government that looks after the little people. The writer of this article has calculated something called 'the Gini coefficient', which is a coefficient of inequality. The report states: The Gini coefficient, traditionally used income distribution comparisons, and based here on taxable income, shows a 21 % increase in inequality. That is the record of this Labor Government-a 21 per ccnt increase in inequality. The report also gives the other findings of the stu<;J.y: The second major finding of this study is that the widening of the income gap reported above was further increased by govcrnment taxation policy. The third major finding concerns women, and shows that their share of total income has remained by and large stationary over the 6-year period. The conclusion of the study is: As evidenced by the findings above, the Hawke Labor Government has presided over a significant widening of the income gap in Australia, between 1983 and 1989. A widening which has been further increased by taxation policy. As for females, their share of national income, relatively low comparcd to males, has remained rather stationary. In summary, the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer-and this is a Government that claims that it has a great social justice policy. Maybe the middle class has fared better than we thought according to those statistics. Let us look at average earnings for a family with a dependent spouse and two children. Back in 1982-83, the annual after-tax earnings in 1989-90 dollars were $24,891. By 198485, that figure had actually picked up $1,000 or so-it was $25,475, so things are looking good. But let us have a look now at 1989-90. The figure is $23,600-a decrease in real terms from 1982-83 to 1989-90. This is what this Government has done for the average family with two children. I think we all know what has happened to housing. If we look at the housing situation when this Government came into office in March 1983, it took 19 per cent of the median income to pay a mortgage per year. In December 1990, that had gone up to 31 per cent-a comment on this Government's caring for middle Australia. The words I quoted earlier emphasise the care that this Government has for the to make disadvantaged. One of the groups that are disadvantaged are the disabled. What has the Government done for the disabled in its term of office? Let me quote from a person who has a disabled child in my area. She said: The Government has cheated us. It promised everything and gave nothing. I can give another statistic to back that up: in South Australia at the moment we have 800 people with intellectual disabilities without accommodation, and the increase in funds for this year was actually $70,000. What about the aged? Nursing homes have had cutbacks throughout South Australia. A matron who runs a nursing home in my electorate states: We have had drastic cutbacks-reduction of 50 hours per week nursing time. All the gulf the community about aged care-that it's better-is a joke. The government's not paying for it. She also says: On the one hand they demand we provide social justice and on the other they snatch money away so we can't provide it. But the Government has had a policy of dein'stitutionalisation, so perhaps it is providing to the community the money that it is not providing to the nursing homes. I have a copy of comments on the home and community care program (HACC) from a woman who runs a domiciliary care service near my electorate. She says: Blind Freddy could have known that HACC was not going to do what it said-there was simply not enough money. The government hasn't given what it was going to give. At the end of every week there are 35 people we don't have the funds to help. That is the number for a very small area. She also says: If you said it was hypocrisy on the part of the government everyone would agree with you. This is the Government that says it looks after the poor and the disadvantaged; it is a government of great hypocrisy. In respect of poverty, I have in my electorate the Marion Chureh of Christ Community Care service, which does a lot of good work for people who simply run out of everything they need to keep on living. The number of people who have come to them for aid has gone from an average of 100 people per month, which was up on previous years last year, to 160 people per month. In January it was 170 per cent higher. The minister who runs this service concludes: Over the same period, the number of sole parents seeking assistance increased by 40%, the number of single people by 70%, and the number of children by 75%. This is the Government that boasts that it looks after the poor, the disabled and the weak and that we on the other side of the House do nothing like that. For the final irony we need just look at this week's said to news about Senator Richardson. The Minister for Social Security, who cares for these disadvantaged people, was living it up at the London Carlton Hyatt at over $ J ,000 per night, courtesy of the taxpayer. His Parliamentary Secretary, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), seems to have similar tastes. He spent almost as much on accommodation during a 1O-night stay in London as a fullrate pensioner receives in pension payments in an entire year. I would like to know how Senator Richardson spent over $4,000 in two nights on one car. What did he do in the car? It is a bit of worry, is it not? The list goes on, but my time is about to run out. I think I would rather go through the other expenses of Senator Richardson, the Minister for Social Security.",60
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Uranium Mining,62
38,Ms MCHUGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I hope there will be ample opportunity to take on some of the statements made in the speech of the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) who has just resumed her seat. But this is grievance day and I have a particular grievance and a great deal to say about it so I had better get straight on with it. There are stories in this morning's press that apparently, unbelievably, some people, even in my own party, still do not understand the enormous opposition to uranium mining from people in the Australian Labor Party and certainly from the public of Australia. The proponents of uranium mining have been trying for years to con the Australian public-and, of course, some politicians-into believing that we should expand mining because otherwise we will miss out on enormous profits and that we cannot possibly miss out on them as it would be unfair to the Australian public. The proponents of uranium mining cannot get people to likc this industry; they cannot say that it is safc or clean or cheap or popular or that it will solve the greenhouse problem; thcir only argument, one that is designed to beguile and entice us in hard economic times particularly, is that we cannot afford to miss this moneymaking opportunity. So I have to ask why so many people still oppose the mining and export of Australia's uranium. Why is opposition so overwhelming within the public and certainly within the Labor Party? First, the very serious problems relating to this industry have not been solved; they are far too big to ignore. Second, the only argument ever put up in support of the industry-that is, that we can make some dollars out of it-simply cannot stand up to scrutiny. There is no evidence to give credence to the wild assertions that come from the companies on the profits to be made. I am going to dispel again, because of those crazy stories in this morning's paper, some of the misinformation that is constantly put out. I will confront the wild assertions of profits to be made with some acknowledged, documented facts on uranium mining: on the market-that is, whether we can sell the stuff; on revenue-that is, what we get for it; and on jobs-how many Australians it will actuallyemploy. The market is in decline and it has been for years, for some very obvious reasons. Nuclear powcr is just too costly and it is enormously and increasingly unpopular. Even countries that have totally committed themselves to nuclear power, like Japan, are now finding it impossible to find a site for the next reactor because the public is awake-up to the dangers of this industry. Sweden has undertaken to phase out nuclear power by the ycar 2010. Recently it has often been said that it has reneged on that decision. It has not reneged on the decision to phase out nuclear power by 2010 and anyone who claims that is deceiving the Australian public. Reactor orders are being cancelled all over the world and have been for years. The industry assertions must be looked at very clearly. They must be looked at country by country and the industry cannot simply keep plucking figures out of its imagination and asserting that these reactor orders arc in place throughout the world. There has been a glut of uranium for years. There is now just a balance between supply and demand. The companies always predict that thcre will be a great upturn in the industry and the. market in the years to come; according to them, it is just around the corner. They have been making those assertions and projections for years and they have always been wrong-they have never been correct. Even if there were to be a slight upturn in demand in the mid-1990s there is plenty of uranium available from Eastern Europe, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and throughout the world. The proponents of uranium mining often mention Canada. They ask why Canada, with 10 per c'ent of the world's uranium, has 30 per cent of the market and why Australia, with 30 per cent of the world's uranium, has 10 per cent of market. I would like to ask them why they assert that we would immediately get that 30 per cent of the market. Canada has an entire marketing machine which markets the whole box and dice. It markets reactors, it markets every facet of the nuclear fuel cycle. In any event, once our uranium goes on the market with Canada's, the price goes down. The pricc has been going down for years anyway. Let me tell the House how they try to can us in 1}ustralia. There has been a glut for some time. This is a very interesting example and I am quoting the same paper that is carrying those stories this morning. On Monday, 10 September last year, the Wall Street Journal carried a story on the uranium glut. The headline was, 'Uranium Glut Likely to Restrain Prices Despite' Oil Crisis' and there is a graph with the story. In the Australian on the same day, Monday, 10 September 1990, the same graph appeared, but with an additional line. The headline was 'Uranium Price Surge Forecast: Export earnings may more than double to exceed $500m a year'-a very different headline designed to can the Australian public when the same story in the Wall Street Journal said that the uranium glut would lead to a drop in prices. They simply want to can the Australian public. The revenue from this industry is not so good anyway and it ought to be looked at. New mines, of course, do not produce much revenue for a long time and certainly not for the Australian taxpayer. It is a very capital intensive industry, ularly when it has to open new mines. It is years before the taxpayer gets a return. What is more, when the revenue does start coming in, 45 per cent of it goes back overseas. It goes back in interest payments, in servicing loans, in dividends paid overseas and in paying for the imports. It does not do much for our balance of payments problcms. We ought to ask France about that. France has got itself into such problems borrowing to service its nuclear industry that Electricite de France has become one of the biggest borrowers in the world, causing enormous problems for France. So how much do we get out of this revenue? After the Commonwealth infrastructure costs go in, we get precious little. The Northern Territory Government so far has got nothing; the South Australian Government, I think, is still putting more money in than it gets out; the Aboriginal people, certainly in the Northern Territory, have got royalties but the Government has not. Jobs: they are what we are interested in. Evidence from the very successful operation of Ranger Uranium Mines Pty . Ltd showed that it produced one job for every 17 in the manufacturing industry with the samc amount of investment and one job for every five in other mining operations with the same amount of investment. These figures are documented from known facts on Ranger's operation, from the record, not from wild projections and wonderful promises put in front of the Australian public. Of all the industries into which we should be putting our investments and hopes for the future, this is the last. But the overwhelming opposition I talked about is not based on the argument that it is not very profitable. The opposition is to the very stuff which this industry deals in-nuclear power, with all the associated unsolved problems. We have to confront, and can easily demolish, the mine-far-profit can because it is the only argument the pro-miners have. They cannot demolish our arguments. They cannot say it is safe. If they do, we need only think of Chcrnobyl. The particwhole world knows now what Chernobyl meant for the world. We need think only of workers' health. The radiation levels deemed acceptable-no radiation level is safe-are lowered year after year beeause they are always found to be too high. For underground miners such as Jabiluka would have, the radiation levels are very dangerous indeed. What about weapons proliferation? No safeguards in the world, not even Australia's, can guarantee and ensure that uranium does not get into weapons. In addition, we would be selling to countries that have not even signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The pro-miners cannot say uranium mining is clean. Just ask them how much high-level waste has been disposed of. Despite all the promises, not one gram of high-level waste has been disposed of. Is it not sensible and reasonable to ask this industry to solve that problem before it creates more waste? The industry cannot say it is cheap. Reactor costs are extraordinary. Decommissioning costs still have not been worked out. The costs associated with the health of workers are a problem for the industry. It cannot say it is popular; I have already cited Sweden and Japan. It is getting increasingly unpopular every year. It cannot claim it will solve the greenhouse problem. Nuclear power provides only 17 per cent of the world's elecWool Corporation. tric power and that is a tiny fraction of the total energy. Let us put our resources into other energy sources. Let us put it into industries that provide jobs. Let the industry answer our arguments. We have answered its arguments. Our arguments have been vindicated over the last 15 years. I urge honourable members to think again of Chernobyl. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) says that opposition comes from 'the baying of the Left'. I want to tell the National Party, the Liberal Party and my own Party that the opposition does not come from just the Left. The opposition comes from the wide public.",62
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Wool: Stockpile,65
40,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the House in this grievance debate as a result of an answer that was given to a question I asked of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on 28 May, in which the Minister said I had my facts wrong. I will run through some of the facts so that he may be a little more enlightened and perhaps make a better judgment in the future. Opposition members could then perhaps help the Minister in some of the debates that have been going on in the wool industry; of course, those debates will go for the rest of this parliamentary session. The Minister in hisreply certainly brought a new meaning to the word 'enjoint:d'-as in the last 12 months he brought a new meaning to the word 'immutable' when he lowered the reserve price last year. I would just like to read the first few sentences of the Minister's response to my question, which related to the release of 100,000 bales of wool from the stockpile prior to 30 June this year. He said: I took the decision to release 100,000 bales of wool from the stockpile after six days of being constantly enjoined to do so by the Australian My information is that it was not the Australian Wool Corporation that enjoined the Minister to release this 100,000 bales of wool from the stockpile-unless the Minister has found a new meaning for the word 'enjoined', which means to command or order. I am sure it was not the Wool Corporation's command that the Minister do so. I certainly agree that it was necessary to release some wool from the stockpile prior to 30 June. But my grievance really is with the Minister and the manner in which that wool was to be released. I suggest to the Minister that he was not enjoined to release the wool by the Wool Corporation; he was enjoined by the pressure groups, the exporters and the buyers. In the rest of this grievance debate, I will point out just how wrong they have been. Had the Minister listened to the best advice of the Wool Corporation, the body that has marketed wool for so long and so successfully, it would have been in the best interests of the growers, and not just the few who have been caught short of a bit of wool in the last six weeks. The Minister answered only half my question. It is important that the House understand what rate the market indicator for wool has been in the last six weeks since the freeing up of the wool market. We all remember the debate that went on prior to the suspension of the reserve price operation. After the removal of the 700c floor the wool at auction, the market opened at a figure of 428c a kilogram. on Over the last eight weeks, the market has steadily risen; it had risen to 591c at the end of last week. I emphasise that to honourable members. It is no wonder that the buyers and the exporters were getting pressured for wool. To buy the wool, they had to start to pay more and one can see the massive appreciation since the opening of the free market. But we should bear in mind thAt only three months ago wool was selling at 700c, so it was certainly going to find a new level in a free market. I suggest to the Minister that the next time he considers any action like this, he should listen to the people who are best able to make such decisions. I will give the House some idea of what happened when the first of the released wool was issued on the wool market. Last Wednesday, the last of the sales of growers' wool of that week was offered on the market. Ninety-eight per cent of the wool sold through the free auction market went to the trade. The following day, when the Wool Corporation released its first wool on the auction market-not at the wish of the Corporation; it was not its preferred option-only 42 per cent of that wool went to buyers. There has to be a reason for that happening and we hope it will become much clearer in the next few weeks. Of the 30,000 bales so far offered-of the 100,000 bales proposed to be released by 30 June-only 11,500 bales have been sold to the trade. If the Minister had heeded the advice of the Australian Wool Corporation, the industry and the Corporation would be in a much better position. I understand from comments in the Australian Financial Review today that the Corporation is considering just how many of those 100,000 bales of wool should be released between now and 30 June. It may be that it will not release any more wool because of the disastrous interference of the Minister, who bowed to the pressure of the exporters and the buyers. Very importantly, in the last 15 years, the Wool Corporation has sold successfully and profitably nine million bales of wool. It sold it out of its stockpiles, which it has managed for 17 years. Ninety-six per cent of that wool was sold by private treaty; only 4 per cent of it was sold through the auction market. That supports, r believe, the Corporation's case that it has never sold it at a loss and that it really is in the best position to know how to release this wool from the stockpile. Further in my question, I asked the Minister why he would not allow this wool to be released from the strategically placed stockpiles around the world. Some of the wool that the Australian Wool Corporation holds, which is strategically placed in western Europe, Asia and also in eastern Europe, has been value added; it has been semi-processed. So, if there really was a genuine need out there in the market for wool due to a squeeze or shortage, the best thing the Minister could have done would havc been to have allowed the release of that wool from the value added stockpiles close to where the wool was going to be further processed. It would have also meant that the industry would have gained considerably more revenue than by releasing greasy wool, which would have had the net effect of reducing the Wool Corporation's debt. I understand that this was the position that the Corporation had put and that it was really only reluctantly in the end that it said, 'Well, we will agree. We will come in behind the exporters, the brokers and the International Wool Textile Organisation', who, the Minister said in his reply, wanted this wool released. So I believe that the people who really have been quite unmercifully criticised in the last 12 to 18 months in this wool debate have shown, by the result since the Minister's action, that they do have the expertise. Had this wool been released from the value added stockpiles overseas, we would not see the situation now where, after only one day of this wool being available on the auction market, it is being considered that it should perhaps be withdrawn from the market. I think we have got to look at what happened to the market at the beginning of this week. As I said, the market ended at the end of last week at 591c a kilogram. This week, with the buyers' knowledge that there is going to be an extra 100,000 bales of wool available for sale, the market has started to slip again. Yesterday it fell 7c. I do not know the results of today. Obviously the buyers out there have convinced the Minister. What are they going to get? They are going to end up with cheaper wool. In trying to help the Minister, I can only say that perhaps in future-and let us hope that there is no great future for the Minister in the area of wool-he will listen to the people who have successfully marketed our wool for the last 17 years. He should have heeded their advice in this case. I believe also that, during the debate in the last eight weeks while all our stockpile was frozen, one of the maior beneficiaries of this has been the South African wool grower.",65

42,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Herbert) (1.38 p.m.)Seven months have now passed since votsuredly ers of New Zealand elected a National Party Government. The National Party Government of New Zealand had professed that New Zealand was an ally of Australia and the United States of America. The National Party of New land had always maintained that it supadopted portcd the Western alliance and that Zealand stood ready to pay its dues as member of the Western alliance, It is traordinary, therefore, that after seven months in government the New Zealand National Party Government has still not restored its alliance relationship with tralia and the United States. The fundamental reason why this has happened is related to New Zealand's nuclear legislation. Having regard to Zealand's positive contribution war, I had hoped that the National Party Government of New Zealand would have defence. supported collective security, reassumed not its responsibilities as a member of the the Western alliance and, importantly, would istic have realised the foUy of persisting with New Zealand's anti-nuclear ship visit polpate ICy. One would have thought that, if the New Zealand National Party Government were serious about collective security, it would with speed and purpose acquire a defence capability to discharge its collective security responsibilities. U nfortunately, any hope that lay in the breast of a conservative voter in New Zealand that the election of a National Party government would restore the capability of the New Zealand defence force has surely been dashed. The New Zealand 1991 Defence White Paper boasts that 'in real terms the defence vote has been reduced by about 20 per cent below the level set in 198687. New Zealand has been taking its peace dividend ahead of everyone else' and that this will help to ensure the 'desired capabilities of the credible minimum force'. In addition to a 20 per cent reduction in defencc expenditure, the New Zealand National Party Government plans a further 12 per cent reduction in defence spending over the next two or three years. The combincd effect of a 32 per cent reduction in defence expenditure will asreduce what was once a small but highly capable regional defence force to the role of a lightly armed south-west long Pacific constabulary force. The disastrous defence policies of the Zeaformer Lange Government have now been with utter irresponsibility by the New New Zealand National Party Governa ment. New Zealand's former Prime Minexister, David Lange, in a speech to the Australian Association for Armed N eutrality on 13 May 1990, made it very clear that he did not want a New Zealand Ausgovernment to be a responsible partner of the Western alliance. Lange thought that the ANZUS Treaty should be consigned to the 'Valhalla of alliances', and, as to any prospect of a dcfence partnership beNew tween Australia and New Zealand, Lange in the Gulf had this to say: I do not , . . expect Australia to come to our There is good reason for that. We do expect to be attacked. Nor indeed do we have larger strategic interests which are characterof Australia. We have no historical interest in Papua New Guinea and no reason to anticiany form of conflict with Indonesia. We do not, for obvious reasons, share Australia's strategic interests in the Indian ocean. Nor indeed do we share the strategic preoccupations embodied in places like North West Cape, Pine Gap and Nurrungar. What we do have in common is an interest in stability and security in the South Pacific region. There is in that a place for the projection of low level military force. In my opinion, Mr Lange's statement is totally consistent with the defence policies of the New Zealand National Party Government. The 1991 New Zealand Defence White Paper does not contain anything that is in fundamental conflict with Lange's statement. What of the New Zealand National Party Government's attitude to its responsibility as a member of the Western alliance and, in particular, to the ANZUS Treaty. It is not for Australia or the United States to accommodate New Zealand on its anti-nuclear ship visit policy. The beliefs held by Australia and the United States on collective security at the time of the signing of the ANZUS Treaty are still valid today. It is for the New Zealand National Party Government and the New Zealand people to decide whether they wish to rejoin the Western alliance. They must decide whether or not they want to restore the military relationship with the United States and Australia. I believe that, when they feel that their views on the anti-nuclear ship visit policy have changed sufficiently, they will tell Australia and the United States of that change. r say to New Zealand, 'When you revoke your anti-nuclear ship visit policy and decide to rejoin the Western alliance, Australia and the United States will listen to you'. I have the utmost respect for New Zealand and its people. They are hard working, decent, brave and resourceful people. They are not bludgers. But the defence policies of the former Lange Government and the present National Party Government demean the people of New Zealand. In effect, they are policies which, in the final analysis, would have Australian serv- afford ice men and women assume the defence of New Zealand at Australia's cost. Unless there is a reversal in the Government of New Zealand's policy, the New Zealand defence force is now destined to be a low level military force, performing a constabulary role, assisting in times of natural disaster and having a small counter-terrorism role. The people of New Zealand owe it to themselves to ensure that there is a serious and balanced debate on the issues of collective security and defence policy. The debate should be conducted honestly and with a full realisation of the strongly held beliefs of the vast majority of the people of Australia and the United States of America on these issues.",67
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Order! It being 1.45 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106, as amended for this session, the debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. STATElVIENTS BY MEMBERS Postal Charges",68
44,Mr TAYLOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"A recent letter from a small business in Toowoomba, Integrity Music Pty Ltd, highlights one of the frustrations the small business sector continues to suffer. In part, it states: . . . I would draw your attention to an increase of 100% in postal charges on small packages which became effective on 1 April, 1991. This move by Australia Post has the potential to cripple our business. We arc the manufacturer and distributor of music cassettes . . . Prior to the recent increase in the small parcel rate, these packages were costing us $0.90 to mail. The new rate . . . is $1.80-a massive 100% increase. Our volume of these parcels is expected to be around 100,000 units this calendar year. We received no advance warning of the price increase and upon inquiring as to the reason for their decision, were told that the small parcel servicc bad been subsidised for years by other profitable Australia Post services but was now required to operate profitably in its own right. As a small business, employing five full-time staff, we sympathise with that ideal but we could not to treat our customers like that and expect to get away with it no matter how unprofitable one aspect of our opcration might be. The difference is that most of us in the real commercial world have competition. What ever happened to the principle of giving everyone a fair go? Why does the Federal Government instruct the Prices Surveillance Authority to investigate a 4.65% proposed increase in the standard letter rate but ignore increases of this kind for users of the small parcel service? Do wage and price restraints only apply in some areas of the economy?",68
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Literacy,68
46,Mr SAWFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I inform the House of a program to combat child illiteracy which will be launched on Sunday, 1 June and which will begin in all Australian primary schools over the next five months. The program is called 'Book It' and was introduced into American primary schools in 1984. In its first year of operation, the average number of books read by participating students increased by 300 per cent. Today more than 14 million children participate in the American program, representing over half of all primary school enrolments. The 'Book It' program was introduced in Sydney in 1990 by the Australia Council, the National Book Council and the Australian National Library as part of International Literacy Year. Based upon the American model, it was adopted by both government and non-government school teachers throughout the Sydney metropolitan area. One hundred and seventeen thousand students and 4,700 teachers participated and research studies conducted had very positive results. The average number of books read per month increased from four to seven; 60 per cent of participating children improved their overall achievements; and 73 per cent of children improved their oral and comprehension reading skills. There are between one million and two million functionally illiterate Australian adults in this nation, estimated to cost the Australian economy between $3 billion and $6 billion. In dealing with adult literacy problems we all need to recognise that those adults were first children with literacy problems. I wish the launch and the implementation of the 'Book It' program every success. Mr Gene Lobel",69
47,Mr MACK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The law is too often an institution for the protection of the powerful. Consider the case of one of my constituents, Mr Gene Lobel. Mr Lobel had a photographic business at the Cremorne Centre in Sydney for many years. In 1983 the company that owned the centre went into liquidation. Alexander MACIntosh was appointed liquidator. To increase the rental, MACIntosh broke Lobel's lease, had him evicted, arrested and his stock confiscated. After a series of court cases and endless legal obstruction, Gene Lobel, appearing for himself, won an appeal in 1986, with damages and costs. MACIntosh used legal technicalities and the company's insolvency to deny Gene Lobel his costs. In 1986, Lobel sued MACIntosh for negligence and trespass. MACIntosh, through Allen Allen and Hemsley, delayed until June 1990 with legal manoeuvres, in spite of expedition being granted in June 1989. In April 1989, Gene Lobel commenced a vigil outside Maclntosh's Macquarie Street offices, which brought one of those rare creatures, a lawyer with conscience, to his aid. Discovery of MACIntosh's documents has been frustrated for 16 months. The action commenced in 1986 has finally been set down for hearing in November 1991. MACIntosh, a partner in Peat Marwick and Mitchell, has manipulated the legal system, character-assassinated Gene Lobel, a 70-year-old pensioner, destroyed a local shopping centre, ruined several small businesses and cost the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars.",69
48,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Consumption Tax,69
49,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The people of my electorate and in north Queensland generally are outraged at the announcement that the Liberal-National Party's policy is to introduce a consumption tax. The fact is that people living in North Queensland pay tax on freight and the consumption tax that the Opposition proposes to introduce-in the unlikely event that it ever obtains government-would wreak economic havoc on the people of North Queensland. In addition, the Opposition's policy is to hand back billions of dollars in capital gains taxes, abolish company tax and introduce vouchers for education and health services. It wants a user pays system with respect tq aged care and a zero inflation outcome. At the same time, it wants to introduce a 15 per cent tax on goods and services which, for the people of North Queensland, as I said previously, would be like a nightmare coming from the south. I reiterate what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said: if the Opposition continues to pursue these policies, a number of Opposition members presently in this Parliament will fmd it very diffIcult to get re-elected in 1993 when the election is held. Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill",69
50,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It will be honourable members on the other side of the House who will have difficulty getting re-elect cd at the next election. There is no doubt about that at all. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill 1991, to be discussed here later today, is an absolute disgrace. It is a blot on the Australian copybook as a great liberal democracy. It is a naked attack on freedom of speech and expression. Adolf Hitler would have been proud of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in respect of this piece of legislation. As if that were not bad enough, the Government intends to apply the guillotine to the debate. Here is one piece of legislation which will strike at the very heart of the basic, traditional democratic rights of every Australian and, because of the Government's sheer ineptitude and political arrogance, elected members of the Parliament may be denied the right to participate in the debate, which is the reason I am putting in my 5c worth now. This is not a Bill about curbing corruption; it is a blatant piece of Labor Party pragmatism. I hope the people of Australia will rise up and throw this Government out of office before it does any more damage to this nation. Democracyrest in peace. Illawarra: Local Government",70
51,Mr MARTIN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today's edition of the Illawarra Mercury carries a story about pressure being brought to bear on Alderman David Campbell, the endorsed Australian Labor Party candidate for the forthcoming local government elections in September of this year, to perform very creditably in light of the fact that Alderman Frank Arkell, the incumbent Lord Mayor and David Campbell's opponent in those local government elections, was defeated last Saturday as the local State member for the seat of W ollongong. It is suggested that because Alderman Arkell was defeated by a Labor candidate, Alderman Campbell's position must be seen as being under some threat-if he does not win, his political future is in some question. I totally dismiss that suggestion. Alderman Campbell has proven himself to be an excellent leader of the Labor Party's caucus on the Wollongong City Council. My plea-on behalf of all residents of the city of Wollongong for that date in September when local government elections are due-is to Frank Arkell. Frank, give it away. The people of Wollongong spoke last Saturday; they do not want you as their local State member. Come September they will give you the message loud and clear. You have been there for 18 years. It is time to go. Give some new blood an opportunity. Give the Australian Labor Party an opportunity once again to provc what it can do at local government level in the IIlawarra and in Wollongong in particular. Give the game away for your own sanity, or what is left of it, and go back to being the real estate agent that you were. Industrial Relations",70
52,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the trade union leaders and the Government have been exhorting Australia to follow the Swedish model of industrial and economic practice. The unions and the Government have been exhorting us to follow the model based on the golden age of social democratic Swcden-one of working with unions and employers. However, the London Economist of 18-24 May 1991 suggested that the Swedish model is now a total failure. Since 1970, the unions have not been able to get their way in this particular arrangement with employers and employspect ees, so they called on government to injournalists tervene. The result is that since 1970 economic growth has been down, producever, tion has been down and taxes and spendMike ing have been up. The Australian model is going very much the same way and the Government and the Prime Minister have been suggesting we follow the Swedish model. The ACTU and union leaders, unhappy about the Industrial Relations Commisout sion' decision on the national wage then demanded that the Government intervene, override that decision and implehimself ment accord mark VI. The result is that we now have 844,000 people unemployed and a recession of 1930s proportions. Consumption Tax",70
53,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Yesterday we saw one of the shoddiest exercises of sincerity in this House that it has ever been my misfortune to witness. Under Opposition's tax proposals, 5c will be saved on a packet of biscuits-sweet bisdistribution cuits, I might say, which are not good the health. The Opposition did not menAdelaide tion that by reducing the sales tax to per cent consumption tax, $15,000 will saved on a new Mercedes-Benz, while $1,500 will be added to the cost of a second-hand car. Some honourable members opposite might tell the young home buyers in electorate how much extra it will cost them to live in their new home because off of the consumption tax-on a $100,000 home, $15,000 extra. They will save and they will spend $15,000. If they a pound of bananas, they will pay 45c damn Port Adelaide. extra-I do not know what the banana growers will think of that. If they buy meat, they will pay 15% extra. If they buy new glasses, they will pay between $40 and $50. They will pay 15 per cent on their rates, their dentist bills, their insursons ance, their health insurance and their gical aids. Such is the hypocrisy and the dishonesty of public relations stunts like we saw yesterday. Press",71
54,Mr CADMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have a refor journalists and hard working in this plaee are good journalists. I have one matter of concern, howin regard to a report written by Seccombe in today's Sydney Morning Herald. Mike Seccombe is a talented journalist, but I regret to say that today he must have completely missed the proceedings of the Parliament yesterday. He wrote old news of two days ago, and dwelt, I am afraid, on a propaganda line dished to him by Senator Richardson and case, the Treasurcr (Mr Keating). I would like Mr Seccombe to bring up to date, rcport the facts as they occur in the House and objectively relate to the Australian people the importance of the events here, rather than running a recycled, propaganda, hungover piece concerning the State elections and consumer taxes. inSouth Australia: Electoral Redistribution",71
55,Mr SAWFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I note the with interest that the Liberal Party of Australia has put in a submission for rein South Australia and wants for to change the name of my scat from Port to Hindmarsh. It actually hates a 15 Port Adelaide. During the 1950s and the be 1960s it reduced Port Adelaide, perhaps the greatest retail centre in South Australia, to almost a ghost town. It got rid of manufacturing and diminished the schools. Yet when the submarine contract their came up, what did it want to do? It wanted to buy the submarines overseas, the shelf. With the multifunction pol is, what did the local Opposition Leader and 5c, his shadow Minister want to do? With buy every comment they make, they want to I remind honourable members that Port Adelaide is the soul of South Australia.

56,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Why does the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) want to take huskies away from Mawson? They have been down there for 43 years. How could there be disease in Mawson when they have never left it? Will the Minister change her mind?

58,Dr HEWSON,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,"My question is dibeginning rected to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister: is it not true that without the large increases in government spendMarch ing .the March quarter national accounts reveal that the private sector is still deepest recession since the 1930s? that the private sector has been destroyed by his Government's disastrous scorched earth policy, why do today's figures show that foreign debt increased even further in the March quarter to $133 billion?",72
59,Mr HAWKE,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,I have to concede that the national accounts issued today are very bad news for the Opposition because these accounts confirm the analysis that the with production. Treasurer and I have been making and stating publicly. The national accounts reinforce my conviction and the conviccentage tion of the Treasurer that later this and through 1992 we will see a significant and durable economic recovery. We have put the right policy settings in place for sustained recovery. Let me point out what those policy setof tings are. Official interest rates have cut by 71/2 percentage points since early 1990. Honourable members will recall that I have had occasion to say in this House earlier that when we began that cut interest rates in January 1990 the obsergoods vat ion by the Leader of the Opposition at that time was that the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer should hang their heads in shame because we were cutting interest rates. Dr Hewson interjecting,72
60,Mr HAWKE,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,The bubble blower wants to retract a bubble. He cannot. It has blown out around there and exploded around him. The interest rate setting is right. Wages growth is being held in check-Dr Hewson interjecting,72
61,Mr HAWKE,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,"The honourable member should stop his mumbling and ask a question if he wants to. Wages growth is being held in check by the accord framework. Automatic fiscal stabilisers are operating while the structural integrity of the Budget remains intact. The national accounts indicate that businesses are now to rebuild their stocks. That made a significant contribution to the positive growth in the March quarter. The quarter national accounts also show that the restructuring of the economy rein the quired to ensure sustained economic Given growth is well under way. Over the year to March we have seen that demand for goods and services is falling back into line with production which is, of course, the position we had to produce against what we had been experiencing before when expenditure was growing at twice the rate of production, but now demand is coming back in line It is very important to note that net exports contributed a positive 3.8 perpoints to gross domestic product year (GDP) growth during the year, including-this is the obvious refutation of the comments of the Leader of the Opposia tion in his question about the private sector being demolished-an export growth 10.3 per cent. In that export growth of been 10.3 per cent there was a growth of 25.4 per cent in manufactured goods. That does not come from an economy which is fractured. There cannot be a 25 per cent inin crease in the exports of manufactured from a private sector which is smashed, as the Leader of the Opposition would like to suggest. The Leader of the Opposition mumbles away and says that it does not really mean anything. His latest mumble is that it does not really mean anything. I ask the people of Australia to understand that the analysis of the Leader of the Opposition is that if there is a 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports it does not really mean anything. It means something to everyone else, it means something to those enterprises which were involved-the management and the workers who, through their new cooperative attitude, produced a 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports. It means something to them, it means something to the people of Australia that there has been a 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports, but the great trouble is that the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition as a whole do not like to see Australia prosper. That is the problem. They would have liked to see manufactured exports falling away. The fact is that a 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports blows their bubble, it shows the nonsense that they talk. They want to get up and denigrate their country. They want to say that management and workers out there are not performing, but they are performing. Show me a country which, in the last year, has had a 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports. Members of the Opposition should stop writing their country down and share the pride that we have on this side of the House that we are capable of doing these things. There have been major gains against inflation with the non-farm GDP deflator rising only 3.9 per cent through the year. I remind the House of the predictions of the Leader of the Opposition in the last few months in the last year or so predicting double digit inflation. Of course, the fact that the national accounts show a 3.9 per cent increase in inflation through the year blowout the predictions of those opposite and show that they are not about objective economic analysis, what they want to do consistently is write their country down. The country is doing better than they want it to do. A 3.9 per cent increase in inflation shows, as I said earlier in this House in the last few weeks, that we have changed the pattern of the previous decade where we had an inflation rate significantly above that of our trading partners. The applaudable fact-this is a fact which is applauded by everyone on this side of the House and out there in the community, but deplored by those opposite-is that the predictions of members of the Opposition were wrong. There was not a 10 per cent rate of inflation, but a 3.9 per cent rate of inflation. That underwrites the 7112 percentage point fall in official rates since January 1990. On the income side there has been continued moderation in wages and profit shares have been maintained at solid levels. Let us look at this man who gets up and asks me about smashing the private sector. Let us look at what the profit share is. Despite the recession and the consequent fall in profits in the March quarter, the profit share at 16.2 per cent-that is the profit share in the March quarter-is in line with a I5-year average. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, who talks about a smashed private sector, to look at that 16.2 per cent profit share in the March quarter and compare it with the 12.7 per cent recordcd in the September quarter 1982 when he was advising the conservative Government how to run this economy. The fact is that despite the recession that profit share has stood up at the 15year average and is something like 4 percentage points above the level into which those opposite smashed it during the recession that they created. As the economy emerges from the recession later this year, lower inflation, lower interest rates and an improved balance of payments will support and reinforce the micro-economic reforms now under way, in that way ensuring a fundamentally stronger economy which is better placed to compete in the international marketplace. The time is coming when the people of Australia will register their disapproval about the fact that whatever set of figures comes out showing the resilience of the Australian economy, we are criticised. Remember that when we have these aggregate statistics showing that massive performance, they are a reflection of what is happening out there where good management and dedicated cooperative workers are showing that this country, even in these times, but within the framework created by this Government, can take on and compete with the best in the world and beat them. That should be a source of pride. It is on this side of the House. NA",72
62,Dr CHARLESWORTH,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,My question is directed to the Treasurer. It relates the national accounts figures for today. Will the Treasurer advise the House the economic implications for Australia of the March quarter national accounts figures?,74
63,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,"The Prime Minister for has already ranged rather comprehenand sively over that ground in response to question by the Leader of the Opposition, cember. but I think some of the points need reiterating and some can be amplified. The first is that it is the second successive quarter of positive growth. It has basically been delivered by an increase in net ports with exports volumes growing by per cent over the year and import volbalance umes falling by 8 per cent or, if we look at the quarter, exports growing by 1.6 cent for the quarter and imports falling by 1.8 per cent. That has happened nottant quarter. withstanding the fact that the terms of trade fell by 3.2 per cent yet again in the quarter to be now down 61j2 per cent compared with a year earlier and just on 11 per cent below the peak of March 1989. So with even much lower commodity and, prices, export prices, we have still got exports growing at 1.6 per cent and net exports for the quarter holding up gross domestic product into a positive figure. The Prime Minister has already mencantly tioned the non-farm gross domestic proddomestic uct (GDP) deflator, which is a reasonably accurate broad measure of inflation in the nonchasing farm economy. That again fell by 0.3 per mestic production. cent, mirroring what is happening in the consumer price index, and is running 3.9 per cent for the year. The private consumption deflator, which to some extent mirrors the composition of the consumer price index (CPI), was at 4.9 per cent for the year-exactly the same as the CPI. So we have export volumes up and import volumes down. Endogenous import volumes are falling, and we have stocks contributing to growth and GDP of 1.2 per cent for the quarter. The balance of payments figures came out today for the quarter. They show that the current account in the March quarter was $3,609m compared with $6,090m for the same quarter a year ago. So we have $6,090m in March 1990 and $3,609m into March 1991. That in itself is down on the December quarter, which was $4,348m. of So we have a continuing improvement in the current account in the nine months to March by just on 30 per cent. Importantly, the balance on merchandise trade the March quarter was $811m, a strong large surplus following consecutively the another large surplus of $627m for DeIf we look at goods and services, the March quarter was virtually in balancea modest $128m deficit. So wherever we look at these figures, whether it be GDP, exexports/imports, the non-farm deflator, 10 export volumes, merchandise trade or the of goods and services, we see that both these sets of indicators today are per good news for the economy as we continue to see positive growth in this imporNA",74
64,Mr REITH,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It follows his claims about today's national accounts statistics in particular, the effect of the export contribution. I ask whether it is true that on page 5 of the national accounts the Australian Bureau of Statistics says: . . . if the terms of trade have changed signififrom the period of comparison, then (gross product figures) will not provide an reflection of the changes of the real purpower of the income generated by doGiven that the terms of trade have fallen at over 3 per cent in the quarter and the gross domestic product adjusted for terms of trade fell 0.5 per cent in the quarter, is it not misleading to suggest that Australia is in recovery?",74

66,Mr FITZGIBBON,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Is the Government considering reducing the tax rate to be paid by wool growers from 15 per cent for 1991-92? Can he explain to the House whether a wool tax rate lower than 15 per cent is justified?,75
67,Mr TUCKEY,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,I rise on a point of order. We have a Bill to be debated this afternoon on this very matter. I would have thought it is a Bill that is covered under the Standing Orders relating to questions.,75

71,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,"As the Minister has said, the Bill has not been introduced yet. Honourable members might recall that later on today there will be second reading speeches. If the honourable member for O'Connor wants me to very strictly enforce the Standing Orders about canvassing matters that might be coming on later then a lot of questions that members of the Opposition want to ask relating to matters which are usually debated in the matter' of public importance might end up being ruled out of order. So I think it is rather pointless that we should do that. The Minister will answer the question.",75

74,Mr KERIN,NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES,"I am quite willing to accommodate the honourable gentleman. If the Opposition is not interested in the answer to this question, or the wool industry, or the wool tax, I will make the announcement by way of press release. NATIONAL ACCOUNTS FIGURES: NA",75
75,Mr TIM FISCHER,FOREIGN DEBT,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer him to today's national accounts figures which show that the household savings ratio has fallen to the lowest level ever. Given that the Budget surplus has all but disappeared, what is the Government's policy for stabilising foreign debt?",75
76,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN DEBT,"With regard to foreign debt, I make some points which probably have escaped the attention of the honourable gentleman who addressed this question to me. It is obviously the case that Australia's foreign debt must be stabilised and that will be one of the results of our continuing economic reform program to make Australia more outward looking and internationally competitive. I repeat what I have said in my first answer in this place today, that the evidence is irrefutably there that increasing competitiveness is being established in the most significant way it can be. We cannot have a 25 per cent increase in the exports of manufactured goods if we are not becoming increasingly competitive.

78,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN DEBT,"The bubble blower has said 'building'. So what we have done in this 25 per cent increase in manufactured exports is that we have exported buildings. He is a professor of economics. I do not know where he learnt it. He has forgotten more than he ever learned. The irrefutable fact is that, as a result of the surge in investments, the record levels of investment that occurred under this Government-that is not a record merely in absolute - erms but a record in terms of a percentage of gross domestic productand the experience that this country went through in the latter years of the 1980s are now being reflected in the fact that, as I have said and the Treasurer has said, we now have this turriaround in our merchandise account. As that surge in investment took place, which is now being reflected in our export performance, it increased our foreign debt by definition. But it has enhanced our ability to repay and to reduce foreign borrowings in the future. Moreover, as a result of what we are being able to do, and what those opposite could never do, that is, to have successive Budget surpluses, we are able to have a massive program of debt repayment, including substantial repayments of foreign debt. Let us have a look at the composition of Australia's net foreign debt so that we can get in perspective the position of the Commonwealth Government. As at 31 March, the private sector owed 64 per cent; 15 pcr cent was owed by State governments; and 25 per cent was owed by State instrumentalities. The Commonwealth Government was, to the extent of 4 per cent, a net international creditor. Those are the facts. That is what has been happening. I make the same point now that I made in my first answer to this House: instead of trying to read, as they consistently do, the most gloomy, pessimistic, downwriting characteristics in any set of statistics that come out, those opposite should say, if they had any sense of pride in themselves as Australians, 'Here are the facts. It is the case that as a result of that surge in investment that took place in the latter part of the 1980s we as a nation are now reaping the benefits in terms of the massive surge in exports and manufactured goods', to which I have referred. In the process, as we have obtained that, we have also secured massive, successive Budget surpluses on the part of the Commonwealth which have made it the fact that as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, we are a net international creditor. NA",75
79,Mr LANGMORE,URUGUAY ROUND,My question is to the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. Can the Minister inform the House of the implications for the Uruguay Round of the extension of the fast track negotiating authority by the United States Congress? Does the congressional decision have implications for the Cairns Group?,76
80,Dr BLEWETT,URUGUAY ROUND,"As members of this House would know, at the end of last week both Houses of the American Congress passed with substantial majorities the fast track legislation. This is an important development but, perhaps most importantly of all, it reveals the commitment at all levels in the American polIty to getting a substantial result from the Uruguay Round. The extension of the fast track does allow for the result of the Round to be voted on in Congress without amendment. It does therefore remove a significant hurdle to further progress in the Round. We can now move on from the hiatus we have suffered since the breakdown of the Brussels ministerial meeting in December, which was in part due to the congressional consideration of the fast track issue. We should note that in this period useful technical work has been done which will enable implementation of a successful outcome, if we can achieve one. But there is no doubt that unless there is substantial progress on reforming the corrupted international trade in agriculture, which has now become a central issue of the Round, we will not be able to bring the Round to that successful conclusion. Key players, particularly a key player such as the European Community, need to exercise the political courage required to engage seriously across the negotiating table on the agricultural issue. Never before has the need for reform of international trade in agriculture been clearer. The incomes of Australian farmers are set to fall by some 60 per cent this year. There are massive commodity surpluses in the European Community, and they are building. The dumping of these European Community surpluses on world markets, compounded by United States programs such as the export enhancement program, lies at the heart of the problem faced by Australian farmers. However, there is a wider dimension: how much longer can the developing world be expected to accept the superior attitude of its First World lenders, while the same great economic powers shackle the ability of these countries to earn valuable export income through agriculture and textile trade? The Director-General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Mr Arthur Dunkel, has said that he believes that the political resolve is now around to bring the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion, but he did add: Political resolve is one thing, negotiation another. Whenever we attempt to translate political resolve into the nitty-gritty of negotiation, we appear to suffer from something akin to a dialogue of the deaf. Australia and the Cairns Group are attempting to break through that dialogue. Whatever some of our opponents say to the contrary, the Cairns Group and Australia have shown a real flexibility and a real preparedness to negotiate. That is best demonstrated by the fact that in Brussels we accepted the compromise proposal put forward by Mats Hellstrom, the Swedish Minister who was chairing the agricultural negotiations in Brussels. Even though we had problems with some of those proposals, we accepted them as a basis for negotiation. The European Community covered that proposal with so many conditions and so many caveats that it just disappeared from sight. One thing we do welcome: the European Community is prepared to negotiate specific commitments to reductions on internal support border protection and export subsidies. We welcome that development. We now hope that the European Community can deliver. In answer to the second part of the question, I can inform the House today that the Cairns Group meeting is now planned to take place in Brazil on 8 and 9 July, during which we will assess the current state of the agricultural negotiations and plan a strategy for the next stage of the Round. Again let me say that there can be no conclusion to the Round without a substantial result in agriculture, and without the Cairns Group itself playing a major role in bringing those negotiations to a successful conclusion. The United States has made it clear that there will be no deal in agriculture which does not include the interests of the Cairns Group. The Brazil meeting will send out a strong message to the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries meeting later in London that it is time for political commitment to be shown to break out of what Arthur Dunkel has said is the dialogue of the deaf. TOYOTA COMPANY: INDUSTRIAL NA",76
81,Mr HOWARD,RELATIONS,"J preface my question to the Prime Minister by inviting him, if he is into national pride in matters economic, to join the Opposition in saluting the astonishing performance of the management and work force of SPC Ltd in achieving a remarkable productivity improvement and a seven-month premature restoration of the wage cut that was negotiated at the end of last year. I ask the Prime Minister: is the Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd considering cancellation of a $600m to $800m investment in Victoria? Has the President of Toyota in Australia said that if the Government cannot restore calm in the industrial scene the investment will not go ahead? Did Mr Johnston say that the company had been confused by the Government's unexpected rejection of the recent national wage case decision? Is Toyota's threat further evidence that Australia is now in an industrial relations no-man's land? When will the Prime Minister show leadership and end the confusion, so clearly of concern to Toyota, by either again accepting the authority of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or, preferably, embracing the only workable alternative, namely, the true enterprise bargaining policy of\the Opposition?",77

These productivity gains are the product of a section 115 agreement negotiated in the Industrial Relations Commission. Opposition members-Ha, hal",78

87,Mr HAWKE,RELATIONS,"The problem again is do not like this. that when they are hit between the eyes with facts, what have they got? This poor belly laugh. Let us go on, Mr Speaker. I assume that even the honourable member for Bennelong would agree that Mr Cormembers boy, the boss of SPC, would know best what is happening. He would probably know better than the honourable member for Bennelong. I think even the honourup to. able member for Bennelong would agree with that. Mr Corboy has previously made it clear that it was the flexibility offered under the industrial relations legislation put in place by this Government that lowed his company to negotiate the major reform to work arrangements. This is what Mr John Corboy said on 3 January 1991: proposal the Commissioner has put forward for all the conditions the workers have put to us and, as far as the company is concerned, not we have everything we asked for. it is a very practical solution and it demthat the system has the flexibility to help companies like ourselves. a Game, set and match! There is John Carboy, the man concerned, not embracing Opposition's nonsensical confrontationist approach, but saying of the systcm that we put in place-let me repeat it: I think it is a very practical solution and it demonstrates that the systemis, our system that we put in placehas the flexibility to help companies likc ourHaving demolished the Opposition's preobservations, let me go on to this about Toyota. Honourable members opposite are wanting to say that, in regard to the industrial relations system in this country, we have some system of crisis. Let me go to the fIgures, which I have eonsistently put to honourable members opposite and to which they shout, 'Not true, not true!'. I will give the figures to them again precisely and show them is the fact. That fact is that, under Government, industrial disputation has decreased by 60 per cent as against the level when Opposition members were in power. Let me give members opposite figures. They talk about the situation with regard to industrial disputes, but they",78
88,Mr HOWARD,RELATIONS,What about Toyota?,78
89,Mr HAWKE,RELATIONS,"I am coming to Toyota, don't you worry about that. If honourable opposite are saying that there has been a deterioration in industrial relations in this country, they should face up to the facts that they never like to face I will give the figures for the number of days lost in industrial disputes per thousand employees per year. The fact is that, in the period from February 1976 to alMarch 1983, the working days lost per thousand employees numbered 583. That is the period when Opposition members were in government-583. What is the figure under our Government? I will tell members opposite. It is not 583, as it was under them when in government. It is 230, and that is a 60.5 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputes. Let me say that in my discussions with the motor car industry, which I have had as recently as the last few weeks here in this building, members of that industry have gone out of their way to say this to me: that the reduction in industrial disputation, the better industrial climate created by this Government, has been appreciated not only by them here but also by their foreign owners. And, after all, they are reasonably intelligent people, are they not? If they see a situation in which they have the Opposition's alternative of confrontation and ours, which has brought about a 60.5 per cent reduction in industrial disputes, what are they going to settle for? They are going to settle for saying that this system is better. In regard to the Toyota decision, I have had in my most recent conversation with the relevant Minister, Senator Button, the view given to me that the expectation is that the investment will go ahead. But let me say one thing finally: if there is one thing which is likely to make it more doubtful whether we will have that necessary investment, it is a perception on the part of those people who have got to make the decision that there is even the slightest likelihood of that mob on the other side of the House coming into power and reproducing the industrial chaos which was the characteristic of their Government. So it is not only Toyota but every manager and worker in this country who have a vested interest in knowing that the outcome in May 1993 will be what I know it will be-that is, the return of this Government so that we can continue these policies which have been of such great benefit to this country. NA",78
90,Mr GRACE,ECONOMY,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has he seen comments that suggest that Australia's economy is staring down the barrel of a depression? Is there any substance to those claims?,79
91,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"No, there is no substance to those claims, and they are the claims of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who said, as late as around 11 o'clock today, as to this country: Anybody can run a scare campaign but this country is staring down the barrel of a depression.",79
92,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,Knock your country.,79
93,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"He was knocking his country again. He put a press statement out two weeks ago saying: Is Australia heading for a depression, provokes the question as to whether Australia is in fact heading for a depression. There is now no doubt that Australia is in the grips of the worse recession since the horrific experience of the 1930swhich is untrue. I might, as I have in the past, give credit to the honourable member for Bennelong, who had the sense and decency to say that Australia was not heading for a depression and that any comparison with the 1930s was an exaggeration. He said: I don't want to do that because in my heart I don't believe that things are as bad as they were in those days. In fact, today on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's World Today there was this question of Mr Reith: That slight upturn in GDP: could that be a sign that the economy if not recovering is at least bottoming out? What was the answer? Well, J suppose that is a possibility.",79
94,Mr HAWKE,ECONOMY,Regretfully.,79
95,Mr KEATING,ECONOMY,"Regretfully, yes. Then he said: Well, if you go back to 82-83, I think at that stage we had one or two positive quarters within that recession. In today's national accounts there is a bar chart which looks at gross domestic product right back to 1975, and honourable members will notice that in 1982-83 there were no two positive quarters, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition describes them. They were negative quarters. If we turn to the trend series which this indicates, we see that the trend is improving in respect of the quarters here. There are the trends there. Those heavy dark marks were the heavy dark things that members of the Opposition did to the economy when in government. So it is not true to say that this is the worse recession in 60 years, because the worse recession in 60 years was in 1982-83. There it was, and there are the statisticians' figures to prove it. Mr Reith-You are relying on trends. You have had four in a row.",79

103,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"I think that the honourable member for O'Connor might be looking for another afternoon off. NA NA Ml' COSTELLO-My question is directed to the Prime Minister, and it relates to his famous fundraising lunch with Bond, Connell and Burke on 15 June 1987, less than three weeks before the 1987 Federal election. Is it a fact that the Prime Minister was told by Premier Burke that the lunch was to seek financial support for the Australian Labor Party (ALP)? Is it a fact that he spoke to those present on 'the positive reasons why this Government should be re-elected'? Given that Mr Connell, Mr Bond and others gave donations totalling $950,000 as a result of the lunch, can the Prime Minister explain why neither the Western Australian nor the Federal ALP returns under the electoral Act show any such donations? Ml' HAWKE-All I can say is this: as I am informed following my inquiries, the relevant parties at the Federal and State level have met with the requirements of the relevant legislation. If indeed honourable members opposite would like to take this matter further and let us have an examination beyond what is required by the current state of the law-and I will come to the future state of the law in a moment-if they are wanting to say that really the current state of the law is inadequate and they would like to have a detailed examination on both sides of politics of what happened, including the honourable member for Pearce, as to who gave what to whom, I would be prepared to have a discussion with my people to see whether we might engage in that sort of exercise. I would think that there is a very grave degree of doubt about the delirious joy with which members opposite would welcome such an examination. But that is the past, and that is what has been done under the present law. As I say, I am advised that my Party at all relevant levels has met the requirements of the law. That is the past and the present; let us come to the future. In regard to the future, our position on this side of the House is quite clear. We propose legislation-no qualification, no ifs or buts-which will provide for total disclosure. The public of this country knows that that is our position. I believe that the public of this country welcomes the fact that that is our position. But the public of this country is starting to wonder very much whether this Leader of the Opposition, this 'man of strength and courage', will have the capacity to stand up when the pressure is on. He has not even had the courage, in recent weeks, to stand up in the face of the remarkable exercise performed by the leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria. Honourable members opposite get up and ask us about what has happened in Western Australia as though we should be totally responsible for everything that is happening there. They say they are concerned about standards in the States. What about the Leader of the Opposition getting up-as has at least the honourable member for Higgins, who asked the question, and the honourable member for Bennelong-and having the courage to condemn Mr Kennett? The honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Bennelong have had the courage to get up and condemn Mr Kennett. The honourable member for Higgins, who asked me this question, is a man who has shown some courage in regard to standards in the State of Victoria. In the last 24 hours or so, in regard to the leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria, he said: . . . this particular proposal could be seen as an affront to human rights and there is a legitimate question there. Singling out people for punishment because of the political party they happen to represent is not what one would expect in a society that values freedom of political opinion. I congratulate the honourable member for Higgins for having the courage to get up and say that. I conclude by saying it is a great pity that the Leader of the Opposition did not have the courage to get up and disown his counterpart in Victoria. There has been a deadly silence from the Leader of the Opposition. At least the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Higgins have had some courage. The Leader of the Opposition has had absolutely none. AUSTRALIA'S STRATEGIC NA",80
104,Mr SNOWDON,OUTLOOK,Is the Prime Minister aware of recent claims that he and Senator Ray are at odds on Australia's strategic outlook? Is there any substance to these claims?,81
105,Mr HAWKE,OUTLOOK,"The Opposition defence spokesman, Senator Duraek, issued a press release yesterday which did make the claim referred to in the question put to me by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. That statement showed yet again that the Opposition simply does not know what defence policy is about. In the truly generous and charitable manner for which I am well known, let me explain it to honourable members opposite. Let me explain to them what defence policy is in fact about. The first task of defence policy is to establish what our defence forces must be able to do. That is the first task of defence policy. We can determine on that basis what defence capabilities we need in this country. This Government has defined the task of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) in concrete military terms. Whatever the wider strategic circumstances, the fundamental task of the Australian Defence Force must be the defence of Australia and its approaches. That is its fundamental task, and no other task could have a higher priority than that. In our period of office, we have been building a defence force which can fulfil that taska self-reliant defence force for the defence of this country. That is the defence policy of this Government. Of course, our broader strategic and foreign policy has a much wider focus. Senator Evans made this clear in what I think was a landmark speech in the latter part of 1989. Last week in a speech in Sydney I explained in some detail how our regional strategic policy will respond to the great events of recent years, and even of recent months. By any standard, those changes are truly momentous and they call for significant changes in our strategic attitudes and expectations. They may, over time, call for changes in the way we use some of our defence assets, but they do not change the fundamental fact of defence policy-that the most important job of the Australian Defence Force will always be the defence of our territory and our direct approaches. Senator Durack is just plain wrong to see any contradiction between what I and Senator Ray have been saying. The coalition is now, after eight years in opposition, trying to talk about defence policy. I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition announced a major defence review back in January. We have still not seen it. Let me, in this generous attitude, offer him some help. He should understand that our defence policy is designed to ensure that Australia can respond to changing strategic circumstances of the sort that we have seen recently, while still giving top priority to the defence of this country. Today's Defence Force, dcsigned to defend Australia, has the capacity and the capabilities to serve throughout our region and beyond our region. We proved that in the Gulf. Mr Bilney-Hear, hear!",81
106,Mr HAWKE,OUTLOOK,"I see my ministerial colleague, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, properly indicating his understanding of this. We had more proof of it on radio this morning when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewed the ADF personnel who are in northern Iraq helping the Kurds. That is a further piece of evidence of the capacity I have been citing-that, while we concentrate on the task of equipping our defence forces with that capability to discharge the primary task of defending this country and its approaches, that has been and will continue to be done in a way which will enable us to assume these wider obligations at any time that we may, in our judgment, be responsibly called upon to provide them. If the Opposition wants to get into the defence debate in this country, it needs to learn what the debate is about. It is not about redefining the job of our Defence Force. That is not what the defence debate is about. It is about management. That is what the debate is about nowmanagement. It is about getting the job done in the most efficient and cost effective way possible. That is what the debate is about. Today in the Senate the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, will announce the most extensive series of reforms of the management of the defence forces in this country for decades. I congratulate him on those reforms, and, as the Cabinet did in considering this matter, I do not simply congratulate the Minister but pay due tribute to the chiefs of the defence forces and all those involved for the constructive, cooperative way in which they approached this task. Cabinet properly recorded its congratulations to them. These reforms will make a major contribution to providing Australia with the Defence Force it needs, one with the capability-l repeat-to defend Australia, to support security in our region and to contribute where needed around the world. NA NA",82
107,Mr FILING,LUNCHEON,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that most of the $500,000 that Mr Alan Bond and Mr Laurie Connell gave to the Australian Labor Party's election campaign at the infamous million dollar luncheon was actually paid by their goldmining companies? Is it a further fact that the lavish donations by Mr Bond and Mr Connell to the Australian Labor Party were normally paid by their corporate flagships? Is it also a fact that these gold company donations came only in return for the Prime Minister's fresh promise not to introduce a gold tax for the life of the next Parliament? When will the Prime Minister get his story straight and when will he admit the involvement of his Government?",82
108,Mr HAWKE,LUNCHEON,"That is a devilishly difficult question, Mr Speaker. If people want to find out the ways in which people made their donations, either to my Party or to the parties of those opposite, then I suggest they approach those who made the donations. NA",82
109,Mr DUNCAN,MIDDLE EAST,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Given the continuing reports of human rights violations in Iraq, including reports that the former Iraqi ambassador to Australia is on a death list, and in light of Amnesty Intcrnational reports that in Kuwait the re-emergence of an absolute monarchy has led to kangaroo court injustices and human rights violations, can the Minister explain to the House the Australian Government's response to these violations?",82
110,Dr BLEWETT,MIDDLE EAST,"I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question. The Government is aware of reports that three senior Iraqis, including the former ambassador to Australia, Mr AI-Rawi, have been sentenced to death in absentia by the Iraqi Revolution Command Council for allegcd treason. We do not know whether the reports are true. The Iraqi Government has reportedly denied that any sentences have been passed. However, if they are true, they would underline once again the brutality of the Sad dam Hussein regime and its propensity for sentencing people to death. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is attempting to verify these reports. I will be happy to report to the honourable member as soon as we get verification. As regards Mf' Al-Rawi, he left Australia on 4 January at the conclusion of his assignment here. We have not had any contact with him since that time. Nor do we know of his present whereabouts. Mr AI-Rawi did not apply to remain in Australia at the conclusion of his assignment here. Regarding the situation in Kuwait, the Government is concerned over allegations made in a recent report of serious human rights violations, reportedly perpetrated by armed groups against Palestinians and others believed to have collaborated with occupying Iraqi forces. The Australian Embassy in Riyadh has conveyed our concerns over such reports to the Kuwaiti authorities. Of course, we are equally disturbed by the well-documented reports of human rights abuse within Kuwait during its occupation by Iraqi forces. We have supported moves in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to ensure that the record of human rights in occupied Kuwait is fully investigated. Turning again to the recent problem, the Government has taken a close interest in the recent collaboration trials in Kuwait. Press reporting of the first series of trials indicated a number of disturbing shortcomings in the processes followed by the Kuwaiti court, including confusion over the nature of the charges and the apparent inability of defence lawyers to cross-examine witnesses. The second session of the trials was attended by representatives of the Australian Embassy in Riyadh, who reported that a number of the criticisms have now been rectified. In particular, it is our understanding that all defendants are now being given adequate access to legal advice prior to the commencement of their trials and the authorities have taken steps to ensure that the problems of the first trials do not recur. In considering this issue, we need to bear in mind the substantial differences between Kuwaiti judicial procedures and those of our own or other Western legal systems. While we are likely to have different ideas in relation to these matters, Kuwait is an independent country with its own customs, traditions and legal system. However, it is notable that the trials are open and that representatives of the press, international organisations and foreign diplomats are able to attend. The Government will continue to closely monitor the trials in Kuwait. NA  response of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development to an earlier question when he said that farmers' incomes will fall by 60 per cent this year and related this to the impact of the Government's decision to contribute to Egyptian debt under Paris Club arrangements. What are the implications of this for the Australian taxpayer? Does this decision mean that the Australian wheat grower will once again be asked to bear the burden of Australia's decision to enter the Gulf war?",82
111,Dr BLEWETT,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"J thank the honourable member for his question. As he may have noted, Senator Evans pointed out yesterday in the Senate that the Australian Government is obliged under the Paris Club agreement of 25 May to reschedule the Egyptian debts, which amount to $280m. We are doing this at a concessional rate that will result in the forgiving of $140m. As Senator Evans pointed out yesterday, and as I pointed out in another statement, the Australian Trade Commission, through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, and the Australian Wheat Board also have outstanding debts which will be affected by the Paris Club agreement and which will be rescheduled in the same way over the same period. The Australian Trade Commission will forgo some $30m of its outstanding $60m exposure, while the Wheat Board will forgo $24m of its $48m exposure. The breakdown that I have just remarked on simply reflects the risk sharing arrangement for selling wheat to the Egyptian market. The Commonwealth has borne the lion's share of the risk on its own national interest account. However, all participants, including the Wheat Board, were fully aware of the risks involved and the conditions under which national risk cover was provided. Mr Downer-You have iust sold the wheat growers out. You do' not take out insurance against the Australian Government.",83
112,Dr BLEWETT,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"I note the simplistic remarks of the honourable member for Mayo. I am probably one of the few members who regularly read his press releases. I notice in those press releases a kind of endearing naivety that Australia can simply make or remake the world without consideration of all the international allies and others it has to work with. I point out again-coming back to the question after that interruption, which illustrates, I think, the honourable member's naivety-that the financial impact of the debt forgiveness will spread over 25 years. The precise details, including how the impact will be spread over that time, remain to be worked out when we have data from the Paris Club negotiations. Let me point out, particularly to the honourable member for Mayo, that Australia's participation in the Paris Club is one of our international responsibilities as an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development industrialised country. I point out to the honourable member for Mayo that it is also in our own interests, as a provider of official credits, because it allows us to register our views in rescheduling. On the particular issue that concerns us, we have argued for some time in the Paris Club that debt rescheduling for so called lower-middle income countries such as Egypt should continue to incorporate a commercial rescheduling option. However, there was wide support within the Club for debt forgiveness for Egypt. We have ultimately to join that consensus. Australia's share of Egypt's official debt, subject to the rescheduling, is 1.3 per cent. Opposition members inteljectinf?",84
113,Dr BLEWETT,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"Again I point out to Opposition inteJjectors, and to the honourable member for Mayo, that Australia does not realistically have the option of standing aside from the Paris Club process. Were we to do so, Egypt would not be able to give Australia more favourable terms than it gives to other creditor countries, as this is a conditi{'n of the Paris Club agreements to provide debt relief. When we think about the wheat farmers themselves, we realise that not to go along with these arrangements would affect our ability to continue to export wheat to Egypt, which is one of the major markets for Australian wheat. The Paris Club rescheduling for Egypt is conditional upon Egypt's compliance with International Monetary Fund economic reform programs and is aimed at putting Egypt's economy on a viable footing. I again point out to the. honourable member for Mayo that the better we can get Egypt's economic conditions then, of course, the more chance we have of selling more wheat and other Australian products. Therefore, as I say, we do not have the realistic option of behaving as the honourable member would want us to behave. These are part of our international responsibilities. In my view, in the long run they will benefit the wheat industry in this country. TULLY-MILIBTREAM PROJECT",84

115,Mrs KELLY,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in this project. The Queensland and Commonwealth governments have together agreed to establish a joint working party to examine all aspects of this project. Also on this working party will be Professor Ken Wiltshire, who is the Chairman of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. This process will examine all environmental aspects of the proposed project as well as, of course, the energy needs of the area. It will also examine the Commonwealth role and its international obligations under the World Heritage legislation. Dr Hewson inteljecting",84
116,Mrs KELLY,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"The Leader of the Opposition obviously has not grasped the significance of World Heritage, nor indeed does he understand anything about the processes that have been set in place to examine this very important and very complex issue. In Cairns on 21 May the Leader of the Opposition said about Tully Millstream: It's not a Federal issue at this stage; it's a State issue. He also said: The great failing concerned with Tully Millstream is that there has not been a Commonwealth-State agreement, and we now have the potential for conflict between the Goss Government and the Federal Government. He tops that off by saying: They don't have a clear cut decision-making procedure, but I'm still getting briefed on the issue. Let me brief the Leader of the Opposition further on the issue and about the processes. Firstly, the Tully Millstream area falls within the wet tropics area of Queensland, which is jointly administered by the State Government and the Commonwcalth Government through a ministerial committee comprising four Ministers, two State and two Federal. We have also established a joint management authority, jointly chosen by the State and by the Federal Government. We have jointly appointed staff to manage that area and we jointly fund it. We have incredible cooperation and have already had a number of meetings, and the process is well and truly established. The Tully Millstream area falls under that joint ministerquestion ial committee and so it will be looked jointly by the Commonwealth and the State. Secondly, the Commonwealth has a legal responsibility in relation to the future of Tully Millstream because it affects the World Heritage area. The Commonwealth of Australia-this Parliament with the support of the Opposition-agreed to Worid Heritage legislation, so it has an obligation to ensure that World Heritage values are protected in this development. There is a clear role for the Commonwealth. To conclude, the relationship between the Commonwealth and the State in this project is firmly established; the processes arc sct in place; all aspects will be considered, especially the environmental issues and, unlike the Opposition-which firstly has no idea what the processes are and, secondly, I doubt whether it cares-the Government will fully examine all those aspects and a decision will then be taken.",85
117,Mr HAWKE,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,l ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.,85
118,Mr TUCKEY,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to standing orders 75 and 80, which refer to how members will be addressed in this place. I further draw your attention to the consistent use of words like 'bubble blower' by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer, and ask, Sir, whether you will continue to tolerate this unparliamentary use of language? If so, can the Opposition address questions to Old Jellyback and the Silver Bodgie?",85
119,Mr SPEAKER,EGYPTIAN DEBTS,"I recall frequently drawing the attention of honourable members to the fact that they should refer to each other by their titles or by their electorates. Honourable members should do that; I again issue that general instruction to members. It is meant to ensure that some of the heat is taken from debates here, and that sometimes would probably be a good idea too. NA NA",85
120,Mr CADMAN,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Speaker, I have a to you in relation to standing at order 144 and your remarks about the status of the debate which takes place on most days entitled 'Discussion of matter of public importance'. Is it a fact that the discussion of a matter of public importance (MPI) does not appear on the N.otice Paper, but appears on the unofficIal daily program, while the substance of the dcbate is only known latcr in the day on a paper circulated in the chamber and which is really in the context of a letter written to you' by an honourable member of the House, and therefore could not be regarded as a matter of business before the Housc as a normal Bill or other matter of Governmcnt business would be?",85
121,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is precisely the point I tried to make to the hon.ourable member for O'Connor: the MPI IS not a matter that is on the Notice Paper. It does not appear on the Notice Paper and thus docs not comc within the ambit of standing order 82, which is about the anticipation of debate. Had the honourable member for O'Connor looked closely at the Notice Paper, he would have realised that the Bill he mentioned that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is bringing in later today is also not on the Notice Paper-Mrs Sullivan-It is on the blue, the daily program.",86
122,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course it is on the blue as the honourable member for Mo-crieff has drawn to my attention. As that honourable member will know, the blue is an unofficial document. The Bill to be brought on by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is on page 5 of the blue; it is the Wool Tax Legislation Amendment Bill and is being brought in without notice. Indeed at some later stage today the Minister could decide not to bring that Bill in; it is not in the Notice Paper in the way that the other matters on the blue are. In the same way that the MPI can have questions asked about it, a matter that a Minister brings in without notice can also be referred to. Speakers in the past have always attempted not to enforce the anticipation rule in a manner that would frustrate dcbate; I would generally hold to that view myself: even if there were a Bill on the Notice Paper, I would think that an honourable member should havc the right to ask a factual question and get a factual answer that did not necessarily anticipate the debate or canvass a debate which may, at some later stage, be brought on in the House.",86
123,Mr TUCKEY,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order on your ruling, I refer you to the Standing Orders and in particular to part (b) of standing order 144, which says that questions cannot refer to 'debates in the current session'. I would then refer you, Mr Speaker, to the blue which you call an unofficial document, and to the Wool Tax Legislation Amendment Bill-",86
124,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is what is printed on it.,86
125,Mr TUCKEY,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The blue states: First reading. Second reading to be moved. Debate adjourned. Surely that is a debate in the current session. I add another point: it is my understanding that Standing Orders are for the purpose of stopping Ministers abusing Question Time when they have the opportunity, for instance through their - ec­ ond reading speeches, to put the pomts anyway.",86
126,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat.,86
127,Mr SINCLAIR,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: it is worthwhile picking up the statement you just made because there needs to be an understanding of the contrast between business that is on the Notice Paper-that is, on the white-as distinct from business that is on the blue. If you, Mr Speaker, care to look at the blue, you will notice that at the top it says: This program of proposed business is issued for the general guidance of Members. It is not a formal document and the business listed is subject to change. Therefore the blue distributed with respect to the matter of public importance is only for guidance and of that honourable members have no notice until you, Mr Speaker, rise to tell the House that you have received a letter; you then advise us of the nature and character of the matter of public importance you intend to pursue. In contrast, the white is a paper which reflects official business, of which you have received notice. As you would know, Mr Speaker, when Ministers intend to introduce legislation, they are required to sign a form. There is a total difference between the character of business in the formal Notice Paper and the character of business on the blue. I submit to you with due respect, Mr Speaker, that business in the Notice Paper is business of which you and the House have notice, and therefore it is incorrect for anybody in this House to anticipate debate on matters in the white.",86
128,Mr BEAZLEY,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker.",87
129,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I might just deal with this and then call the Leader of the House.,87
130,Mr BEAZLEY,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I suspect you are going to make the same point I am.,87
131,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know, because T can see on the face of the Leader of the House that he has realised the hole into which the right honourable member for New England has fallen. The matter I referred to was the Wool Tax Legislation Amendment Bill, which is on the blue; it is not on the white.",87
132,Mr SINCLAIR,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is on page 1 of today's Notice Paper, Mr Speaker.",87
133,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Indeed, it is not; another Bill on the Notice Paper is also on the blue. If the honourable member looks at page 5 of the blue-we might do this slowly so that we all get it right-he will see a notice there that does not have a number. That means it is not on the Notice Paper. The Wool Tax Legislation Amendment Bill has been brought in without notice; it is in the same manner before the House as is the MPI we arc about to come to. Indeed the Minister could walk out of here now and rcmove that Bill from the blue-and it is not on the Notice Paper-as indeed the Deputy Leader of the Opposition could stand up and ask that his MPI be discharged. As long as we now have this clear: with matters on the white, standing order 82 comes into effect; matters not on the white are not able to be anticipated because they are not there as far as the House is concerned. If some other members of the National Party want to debate with the Minister which Bill the Minister is talking about, I am sure he will give them a tutorial outside. I know that the right honourable member for New England has the drift of my message by now, because he is cleverer than most.",87
134,Mr SINCLAIR,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"l regularly have the drift of your message, Mr Speaker. I point out that as to the nature and character of items 3, 4, 5 and 6 on pagc 2561, in genetic form they contain matters pertaining to the question. We are really talking about the question that was asked earlier in the day. I submit that, as a result, the question asked by the honourable member for Kennedy was out of order.",87
135,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was a good try, - but not good enough. I think we might go on from here now.",87
136,Mr SCHOLES,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Speaker, I think there should be some clarification of what is in standing order 144. Notices are not mentioned in standing order 144 and notices are not before the chamber for debate. They are proposed matters to be brought before the chamber, not matters before the chamber. Standing order 144 refers to debates in the current session. A notice is not subject to debate and it is not being debated.",87
137,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At a later date, for the benefit of other members, the right honourable member for New England, the honourable member for Corio and I might run tutorials at a minor charge for those who want to learn! PRESENTAnON OF PAPERS",87

141,Mr GOODLUCK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It is only a very fine one, Mr Speaker, but it is an important one. It appears that I backed my cart, and I do not back my cart to anybody. I claim to have been misrepresented in an article by Mary Pryor in the Hobart Mercury dated 28 May 1991. It stated that I was not present in the Parliament when the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) tabled a doctors' survey. I totally refute that claim. I was in the Parliament, answering constituent letters, but not in the chamber when the honourable member tabled the survey. I say to the honourable member that it is always good manners to let somebody know when he is going to have a go at him. Even though he did not have a go at me, the Hobart Mercury had a go at me and I do not like that. The normal courtesy would have been to let me know that he was going to table the document during the adjournment debate. It was tabled on 28 May at 10.39 p.m. How many of us are in the chamber at 10.39 p.m.? Not very many.",88

146,Mr LANG MORE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This morning a leafiet, apparently authorised by the Liberal Party in the Australian Capital Territory, was distributed outside entrances to the Department of Defence on Russell Hill. The leaflet claimed that I was 'opposed to the idea of keeping Australia strong and ensuring that we had the means to defend ourselves'. It also claimed that I was 'not interested in the welfare of defence personnel and their families'. This quite dishonestly misrepresents what I have been saying about defence. The central point of my public statements about defence has been that defence spending is competitive with every other type of government service and that therefore-I quote from the first paragraph of my major paper on this subject-'we should spend no more than is necessary to defend ourselves adequately'. Nothing I have ever said involves rejection of the importance of a strong defence. The issue is what is adequate. Now is not the moment, as I am sure you will tell me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to debate that issue. But I reiterate that everything 1I have said about defence is based on a recognition of the importance of maintaining an effective defence of Australia.",88

148,Mr LANGMORE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have not concluded yet. On the second point, I have been assiduous in pursuing the welfare of defence personnel and their families.

155,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During Question Time today the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) misrepresented me by saying that I had no understanding of the impact of the SPC Ltd dispute in relation to the industrial relations policy of the Opposition. In support of that he quoted some alleged comments of Mr John Corboy, Chairman of the company. I point out to the House that the Prime Minister was wrong to make that claim in relation to my understanding of policy. In support of that, I quote briefly from the record at the time the deal was originally struck: Given all this sweetness and light, the chairman, Mr Corboy, is annoyed that the Industrial Relations Commission had to step into company's negotiations with its workers. He believes that when management and ers come to a deal without duress there should be no need for other parties to get involved. 'I believe in the right of people to control own destiny,' Mr Corboy said. I conclude by pointing out that at the time the deal was originally struck, SenaAustralian tor Cook bitterly attacked it.

159,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you were generous in not restraining the honourable member for Fraser. I simply conclude by saying that Senator Cook attacked the proposal when it first came down. The basis of that attack was that it was negotiated by the company and its workers without union involvement. Such an arrangement is the very essence of the Opposition's industrial approach. Therefore, the Prime Minister misrepresented me. DEFENCE INTO THE TWENTYNA Ministerial Statement",89
160,Mr BILNEY,FIRST CENTURY,"by leave-I wish to make a ministerial statement on defence policy on behalf of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). 1. Today the Minister for Defence announces Government decisions on a series of significant Defence reforms. These mark a further major step in the continuing process of refining Australian defence policy since this Government set the broad strategic direction for defence with the 1987 White Paper. 2. Defence planning by its nature must be dynamic and evolve with changing strategic and economic circumstances. We SPC face considerable strategic uncertainties as the we enter the 1990s. We are not in Europe, where we might benefit directly from the workdecline in superpower confrontation. We have regionally-based defence needs, and they have not diminished. There are tentheir sions and pressures which could impact on our security and which require us to maintain our military capacity to protect interests or to contribute to Cook regional efforts to resolve problems. 3. Effective defence depends on a high level of commitment by service personnel and the broad support of the nation. It also depends on national economic strength over the long term. Our long term interests will be better served if planning for defence and our national not economic development are in harmony. This includes having appropriate sectors of the nation's economy more attuned to the support of our defence effort. As we enter the 1990s, the central challenge before us is to organise our defence better, so that we can obtain the maximum combat capability in the most efficient and affordable way. 4. It is easy to draw up lists of what could be done to improve our defence capacity if there were no resource limits. More demanding is the task of deciding what we can do less of or to find better ways of doing things so that we can release resources for new projects and activities. In defence, as in all areas of government, there is always a need to strive to make more effective use of resources. It is only through being more innovative and creative in its approach to resource management that defence will be able to acquire more surface combatants, improve Army mobility, and acquire airborne early warning and control aircraft. 5. In the debate that follows about the force structure review, I am sure that we will hear reference to the recent Gulf war. There will be claims that the Gulf war proves that this or that equipment is obsolete, or that Australia must hurry to buy some specific piece of high technologyirrespective of our strategic circumstances or operating conditions. 6. I will not indulge in such speculation. It will take months of careful analysis by military specialists to reach considered conclusions about the practical military lessons of the Gulf war. Australian experts will participate in those studies, and we will examine the results carefully. We will not be distracted by the sensational claims of the instant experts, whose stridency is usually only matched by the shallowness of their knowledge of defence matters. Such so-called experts rarely acknowledge that Australia has no land borders with any country, and that distances in Australia's northern environment are mostly measured in hundreds or thousands of kilometres. 7. The only useful conclusions we might draw now about the Gulf war are broad strategic observations; that is, success in military undertakings is critically related to military professionalism backed by national will and economic strength. Saddam Hussein gambled on what he saw as the weakness of Western democraciestheir pluralism, their commitment to human values and their distaste of conflict. He also grossly overestimated the military capacity and commitment of his own, largely conscript, armies. 8. There is an important lesson flowing from this. Militaristic and aggressive regimes run the risk of being met with concerted action, which will extend, if necessary, to military force. In particular, potential aggressors will need to be wary of the response of the United Nations and the United States. 9. The Gulf war also highlights the central obligation to provide for national defence. Australia will continue to receive support from alliances, including access to advanced technology and intelligence, and emergency re-supply, but we must plan on carrying out our primary combat tasks ourselves. The Gulf war has not changed these fundamental assessments; nor should it drive our force structure decisions. Australia must continue to structure its Defence Force around the tasks likely to arise in its ar:ea of direct military interest, and must not revert to the old and discredited forward defence policies of the 1960s. 10. This is not to neglect alliance and regional associations and cooperation with regional neighbours. They remain essential elements of Australia's overall defence approach. As the Gulf war showed, from a self-reliant Defence Force structured for the defence of this nation, Australia can make a contribution to operations further afield in support of friends and allies, and activities sanctioned by the United Nations. Today's decisions will ensure that Australia continues to have the capacity to contribute to wider global and regional security. The Force Structure Review 11. The force structure review examined the current Defence Force structure and recommended adjustments up to the year 2000, taking account of strategic priorities and likely resources. It builds on 20 years of development towards defenec self-reliance in Australia, applying the priorities set out in the Government's policy paper The Defence of Australia 1987. 12. The force structure rcview adopted the following key principles: (a) Firstly, to maximise the combat capabilities of the Defence Force, by reducing the number of service personnel involved in headquarters and base support functions; and, by commercial and civilian support and maintenance where this is operationally feasible, practicable and cost effective. (b) Secondly, to meet the strategic focus on northern and westcrn operations by extending western basing for the Navy and northern basing for further Army units, and by cnhancing the forward deploymcnt capacity of the Air Force. (c) Thirdly, to make grcater use of reserves, including a new form of reserve service to supplement the existing reserve forces of cach service, while maintaining the required overall force readiness level s. 13. It is important to ensure that there is enough flexibility in funding to undertakc new initiatives in the latter part of this decade, when expenditure on current major projects such as the ANZAC ships and Collins class submarines reduces. This is because in the first decade next century, there will be heavy demands to rcplace obsolete equipment such as the guidcd missile destroyers, Fremantle class patrol boats, Ml13 tracked armoured fighting vehicles and FIll C aircraft. 14. Within this framework, the review examined the capabilities which the Defence Force should possess as Australia moves into the twenty-first century. It found that current capabilities provide a generally adequate national defence capacity for the key roles identified in Government endorsed strategic guidance, although some should be given higher priority for enhancement. 15. There will be greater emphasis on the use of reserves. To give a new focus to the present reserves, an Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Reserves) will be appointed to advise the Chief of the Defencc Force on ways to improve their effectiveness. This appointment will be hcld by a two star reserves officer. 16. Command, control and communications developments will emphasise joint operations, and we will be moving to collocate the joint force commanders as soon as practicable. Future communications projects will be directed away from costly, military specification programs to make more extensive use of the civil infrastructure and of commercially available equipment. 17. There will continue to be substantial investment in intelligence and surveillancc, rcflecting their high priority. An operational network of two over-the-horizon radars will be developed by the late 19905. The need for a third radar will be reviewed then. By the mid-1990s, Defence Forcc operations will benefit from bcttcr integration of data from both military and civilian sources. 18. The P3C aircraft will be substantially upgraded to enhance their surface surveillancc performance, and it is planned to introduce airborne early warning and control aircraft later in the decade, when more effcctive and affordable systems may be available. 19. The six Collins class submarines will be based in the west, but with one or two deployed continuously off the east coast. Defencc will continue to monitor developments in air independent propulsion, but without commitment to fitting such systems. 20. A balance between aircraft, surface ships and submarines is needed to provide flexibility in maritime patrol and response. These arc demanding tasks in the extensive occan areas to our north and north-wcst. The prescnt conccpt of threc tiers of surface combatants will be replaced by a two tier concept of destroyers or frigates, and offshore patrol vessels. 21. By 2009, the number of major surface combatants will incrcase to 16, compared with the current 10. The new ships will be based on a modification of the ANZAC frigate design, for delivery from 2006. The Fremantle class patrol boats will be replaced by 12 more capable offshore patrol vessels, for delivery from 2004. Pending their introduction there will be a life extension for the Fremantles to maintain our patrol and intercept capabilities in the maritime approaches and fishing zone. 22. The increase in numbers of surface combatants will also improve the Defence Force's ability to protect shipping and shore territories. There will be a change of direction for the mine countermeasures program: we will acquire larger coastal mine-hunters of proven design in place of the inshore mine-hunter program, which has not proved cost effective and which has performed poorly. The Government. makes no apology for making the hard decision to end this program. Such decisions should be made as soon as it is clear that a new concept will not meet expectations, to limit further investment and to pursue more cost effective approaches. 23. The FA18 and FIIIC aircraft are central to the Defence Force's air defence and strategic strike capabilities. The fleets will be managed to extend their service life for a further 20 years. Completion of the chain of northern air bases this decade with the construction of RAAF Base Scherger, near Weipa, will enable the Defence Force to respond more effectively in the north. 24. We are developing an innovative scheme to provide a significant surge capability for the Tactical Fighter Force and Strike Reconnaissance Force. For the first time, former FA18 and FIIIC aircrew who have left permanent RAAF service may continue to fly them while on the Reserve, thereby ensuring that their capability to bolster the permanent force is retained. 25. A number of changes will be made to the Army to enhance our ability to protect assets and to respond to incursions. Most importantly, the Army will be restructured on the basis of independent brigades, better oriented to northern operations, with selected battalions having a higher level of tactical mobility through the permanent allocation of transport. A new infantry mobility vehicle will be acquired. We are negotiating with the United States for the reintroduction of four to six upgraded Chinook helicopters. 26. More Regular Army units will be based in the north. The Second Cavalry Regiment will move to Darwin in 1993. An armoured regiment with one regular tank squadron, and a composite aviation off- squadron will be deployed in Darwin by the mid-1990s, and an infantry battalion by the end of the decade. The regular tank squadron in Darwin will be able to be reinforced by the Reserve tank squadron, which will remain at Puckapunyal. 27. The regular First Division headquarters in Brisbane will be restructured as a smaller, deployable joint force headquarters, while the Reserves Second Division headquarters in Sydney will develop the skills and doctrine for conventional divisional operations. 28. The Regular Army of some 26,000 will continue to have a significant combat capability. There will be some 11,000 regular soldiers in that combat force, making up four regular infantry battalions, the Special Air Service regiment, an armoured regiment with one regular tank squadron, a reconnaissance regiment, two aviation regiments and a balanced mix of combat and logistic support units. 29. The Army Reserve will maintain its present size of some 26,000 personnel, and the existing seven Army Reserve brigades will be retained. In addition, by 1996 a new form of more completely trained and equipped reserve will have replaced most regular combat and combat support units in south Queensland. 30. Twenty per cent of the strength of the new reserve brigade will be regulars. The reserve commando regiment and three northern surveillance units will continue to have significant numbers of regulars. Other regular service personnel will be involved in training and support, including for the 14 remaining conventional reserve battalions and the many other units which make up the reserve contribution t.o the support of land operations. 31. The Defence Force will retain the capability to respond to requests for support from regional nations, and this capability will be improved when the training ship Jervis Bay is replaced later in the decade by a new ship with the dual role of training ship and helicopter support ship. Training and Support 32. Training will be rationalised on a servicc basis. Consistent with the Governcialised ment's policy of micro-economic reform, there will be significantly greater use commercial support and civilian staff in technical training areas. Navy's technical trade training will be consolidated at HMAS Cerberus. Motor vehicle trade ond half of the decade. training will be consolidated at the Army centre at Bonegilla-Bandiana, and the these RAAF base at Wagga will handle all Defdefence ence Force aviation-related trade training, and possibly combined clerical training. 33. Facilities will also be rationalised. HMAS Nirimba will be closed as part of the rationalisation of training. It is also planned to close HMAS Platypus with the the Defence Science phasing out of the Oberon class submaganisation. rines later in the decade. The RAAF fields at Laverton and Point Cook will closed and sold. No. 6 RAAF Hospital may be retained at Laverton, and the possibility of moving RAAF Logistics Com38. mand there from central Melbourne will also be investigated. The airfield at Point Cook could be zoned for public recreation purposes, but Headquarters Training Command, the RAAF College and RAAF most Museum will remain there. 34. Changes to Army structure and racluding tionalisation of training, together with tensive commercial support of Air and Army maintenance and support func39. tions, provide additional opportunities substantial rationalisation of facilities concentration at a smaller number of bases and depots. 35. Opportunities will continue to taken to expand combined training with the New Zealand Defence Force where it is mutually beneficial to do so. Implementation 36. Since implementation of these proposals will incur some costs, particularly in early years when the defence program is under heavy pressure from commitments to major projects, it will be phased. In order to avoid over-commitment to unrealistic targets and expectations of savings which may not be met, only those estimated savings arising from functions joint which we are confident can be commercost-effectively in the short term have been programmed. Similarly, no tarof gets have been set for asset sales because of the difficulty in determining net proceeds. Funds from these activities will provide additional flexibility in the sec37. The personnel changes flowing from Government decisions and internal efficiency measures will amount to almost 10,500 regular personnel-over 1,000 from Navy, 5,200 from Army, and 4,200 from Air Force-together with more than 3,800 Defence civilians. More than 1,600 of these civilians will come from central elements of the Department and and Technology OrDSTO will be given a more aircommercial orientation, so that it can be make a larger contribution towards Australia's technology base. In putting forward these proposals I am conscious that they will impact directly on the professional interests and career aspirations of staff at all levels. The changes will be managed to ensure that the needs of Defence personnel, as the important single resource, are recognised and given careful consideration, inappropriate consultation. Their exhigh levels of skill and commitment are Force central to Australia's defence. The changes will be introduced over for a decade, and there will be no immediate and or large scale redundancies. However, to avoid distortions in rank and skill levels, some management initiated voluntary redundancies may be unavoidable. These be will be kept to an absolute minimum. Many of the service personnel leaving the Defence Force in the future will find that their transition to civilian life will be eased by the greater availability of civilian jobs in areas where they have expertise. They will be able to continue their military careers on a part time basis through the new reserve scheme. The same scheme will provide opportunities for young people to have a year's full time training followed by a part time military career. A New Form of Reserve Service 40. The Government has endorsed in principle this concept for a new form of reserve service, with implementation to begin next year. It will make greater use of former regular personnel, and, in the case of Army, significant numbers of new recruits receiving about 12 months initial full time training. These personnel will allow appropriate parts of the Defence Force to operate at levels of operational readiness and cost below those for permanent elements, but higher than for the current reserves. They will significantly increase our capacity to deploy well trained personnel in shorter time scales than is practicable with the current reserves. 41. The new form of reserve service will form a part of, and build on, the existing reserve components in each service. While these personnel will primarily be recruited for Army, they will also supplement permanent Navy and Air Force elements. The force structure review has planned initially for 3,200 in Army, and 450 each in Navy - nd Air Force, with possible future increases. As I said earlier, for the first time, we will be maintaining a reserve of significant numbers of former F 111 C and FA 18 aircrew to provide a surge capability for those aircraft. 42. The Government decided not to adopt Mr Wrigley's specific proposal for a 'militia' in his report The Defence Force and the Community, largely because Mr Wrigley's proposal did not meet the Government's readiness requirements. Mr Wrigley's proposal is a high risk strategy, which depends on retaining large numbers of reserve personnel. Nevertheless, the defence concept for the new form of reserve service is consistent with his emphasis on greater use of former regulars, and improved training and resources for reserves to broaden the overall defence base. Expansion 43. The new force structure, with its links to the wider community and the national infrastructure, will provide a better basis for expansion. The Minister for Defence has directed that studies be undertaken to develop further defence planning for the remote contingency of substantial conflict. These studies will identify areas likely to cause difficulties during expansion, and identify action required to ensure the Defence Force can meet any threats to the nation's interests. The Wrigley Interdepartmental Committee 44. Mr Wrigley's proposals to open up defence support activities to competition, consistent with operational requirements, have been accepted by the Government. A substantial range of activities currently performed by service personnel can be carried out commercially or by Defence civilians, with no detriment to our defence posture and at lower cost. 45. There are many gains to be made. Reliance on the community will allow a more effective increase in defence effort if needed. In some areas, such as communications, the civil infrastructure offers greater capabilities than Defence could provide on its own. Commercialisation and civilianisation will provide access to a wider range of skills. Importantly, commercialisation offers the prospect of substantial savings which can be redirected so as to improve the combat effectiveness of the Defence Force. A better level of understanding between Defence and the community should result. 46. Defence will start this program immediately, with progressive implementation across the decade. The central objective will be to transfer support activities to the ci vil sector where this is practicable and cost effective. Combat and combat-related activities within operational areas will not be commercialised; nor, in general, will operational support functions. Rather, commercialisation will focus on areas such as catering, stores and transport, clerical support, non-military training, repair and maintenance, communications, health care and firefighting functions. Defence Industry and Exports 47. The measures announced by the Minister for Defence for a greater role for the private sector in defence support functions represent a logical extension of previous Government initiatives for defence industry. 48. The Government has given practical effect to the White Paper objective of greater self-reliance. We ensured that the major submarine and ANZAC ship projects have Australian prime contractors and substantial industry programs which will last into the next century. Sincc the early 1980s, the Australian industry component of major equipment projccts has risen substantially, with some $800m more being spent in Australia this year. 49. The challenge for Australian industry is to upgrade its ability to produce, support and maintain defence equipment at competitive prices. Allowing much greater involvement by private industry in defence support activities will ensure the investments in industry capability that we are making through our major new equipment strategies are properly utilised by defence. 50. There has been considerable microeconomic reform in de[cncc already. The former government dockyards and defence factories have been sold or corporatised, reducing their cost to the taxpayer by hundreds of millions of dollars. The process of reform is continuing. Aerospace Technologies of Australia has successfully restructured its business. The Government recently endorsed the company's five-year corporate plan as the basis for its future development. The board of Australian Defence Industries Ltd has recently announced a proposal to restructure and rationalise its activities, aimed at realising further efficiency gains, while meeting the requirements of the Defence Force into the next century. 51. I now turn to the matter of controls on the export of defence and defencerelated goods. Australia's policy o[ defence self-reliance requires the involvement of Australian industry in the support and maintenance of the Defence Force. The Government remains strongly of the view that defence exports should be encouraged. The export efforts of defence related industry will continue to receive active government support. Australia is a substantial net importer o[ defence goods and services, and we should continue to support an increase in the level of exports from this sector of our economy. 52. As the Minister for Defence undertook earlier this year, the guidelines on defence exports have been reviewed. This review was prompted in part by concerns about the practical utility of some aspects of the policy guidelines [or defence exports. Ministers have now agreed to a number of changes to policy which have produced both a simplification and a tightening of the procedures [or the consideration of defence exports. 53. Firstly, applications to export defence and defence related equipment to sensitive destinations will be referred to the Standing Interdepartmcntal Committee on Defence Exports. Under previous arrangements only lethal or destructive goods, or those determined to be of major military significance, were subject to the interdepartmental process. Internal procedures relating to the identification of sensitive destinations have also been streamlined. 54. Secondly, existing foreign policy criteria for considering applications have been strengthened in order to ensure that important strategic, external policy and human rights considerations arc not prejudiced. The Committee, in making its recommendations to the Minister for Defence will take account not only of the political and military situation and policies of the country for which a particular export is intcnded, but also of the situation in the general region for which the goods arc destined. 55. Thirdly, the guideline relating to goods of 'major military significance' has been amended. Previously, such goods were so defined by reference only to their significance for Australia's defence, but now there will also be taken into account the significance of such goods for try in the region of proposed export. 56. - must also emphasise that the signifagenda icant majority of Australia's defence ports are non-lethal, and our major export markets do not give rise to any concerns on strategic or foreign policy grounds. recognition of these facts, the process for consideration of applications of this nature will be streamlined. Certain parts and accapabilities cessories will be able to be exported out individual permits. Licenc'es for such parts and accessories will be issued export to approved non-sensitive desti61. nations. Being able to export such goods under licence will be of considerable vantage to industry, in that companies will be able to respond more promptly client's requests. 57. The recent events in the Gulf have further emphasised the need to strengthen international arms control measures. tralia is an active participant in interwould national arms control forums such as on COCOM, the Coordinating Committee on Exports of Technology to Communist afield Countries, the Coordination Committee for Multilateral Strategic Export Controls, United Nations. and the Missile Technology Control gime, the Australia Group concerned with chemical and biological weapons, the Nuensure clear Suppliers Group concerned with nuto clear proliferation, and in efforts to finalise the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention. Australia is recognised as responsible member of the international community. Conclusion 58. The plan that I have outlined today represents another major step in Government's commitment to ensuring that Australian defence planning goes ward into the next century in a way that meets our national priorities, and is consistent with our international obligations. 59. In the mid-1980s, with a rapidly growing economy, we were able to sustain significant real increases in defence spending. This allowed us to increase investment in new capabilities and update equipment significantly, and to improve living and working conditions for service a counpersonnel and their families. 60. For the 1990s, much of the defence is about greater efficiency and efexfectiveness. This statement shows that, without expectations of major growth in the defence budget, the Government can In adjust the force structure in a considered and timely fashion to deliver an even more effective Defence Force with appropriate to take us into the twenty-first withcentury. Nothing in this statement precludes future government changes of emfor phasis, should this become necessary. These decisions shape the Defence Force to maximise its capacity to draw adon national resources as a whole to meet credible military threats. They will proto vide a force capable of overcoming the long distances and isolation of Australia's environment. Our strategy is designed to capitalise on Australia's geographic adAusvantages and ensure that any aggressor face major obstacles in an attack this nation. It also ensures that we can make a contribution to operations further and, when required, support friends, allies and activities sanctioned by the Re62. Most importantly, while we do not now face a military threat, these decisions that the Defence Force will be able respond quickly to any threat that does emerge, and will be able to do so with the full support of the Australian community a and the backing of all our national resources. They constitute a long term program to restructure and impr-ve the effectiveness of the Defence Force. I present the following paper: Defence into the Twenty-first Century-Minthis isterial Statement, 30 May 1991, forI table the associated reports. Motion (by Mr Griffiths) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders Motion (by Mr Griffiths)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 28 minutes.",89
161,Dr HEWSON,FIRST CENTURY,"I welcome this opportunity to make a statement on defence policy. In that regard, I am more than happy to take up the challenge issued by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time today to do so. I am a bit surprised, given that the Prime Minister thought that this was such an important statement-and it is-that he did not choose to make it himself. I am even more surprised that these days he confines his remarks on defence to dorothy dix questions. I believe that the statement that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) has just made to the House is one of the more important statements brought down during the term of this Government. It has consequences for strategy, force structure and personnel that constitute some of the most significant changes in defence policy for many years. There are some aspects of review on which the Government and the Opposition will share common ground. These aspects include the civilianisation and contracting out of some defence support functions, some rationalising of base arrangements, and aspects of the proposed changes to defence industry and defence export policy. I will return to each of these areas later. There are other proposed changes in this review which the Opposition strongly believes are mistaken, poorly explained and inadequately thought through. We believe that this review will do nothing to enhance Australia's security and, if implemented, will weaken the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). There is little doubt why the Government undertook a review of this kind. The problems which have been afflicting the defence organisation over recent years have been very serious and they have been getting worse: the funding expectations created by the White Paper have not been fulfilled; there has been a debilitating morale problem amongst defence personnel; personal wastage rates have been high and costly-in 1989-90, for example, the wastage rate for the Regular ADF was 12.8 per cent, for the ADF Reserve it was 25.8 per cent, and for the combined total force it was 16.3 per cent; training and exercise opportunities for the Defence Force have been run down; operational exercises have been cut back; operational capability has declined; the 'reserve forces have been shamefully neglected and are in disarray; and defence management practices remain outdated and highly inefficient. There is a clear perception in the Defence Force and in the community generally that this, Government's defence policy has lost its direction. In particular, the determination of our commitment to the Gulf war started to focus public attention on some of the real limitations of our defence capabilities. There has always been a suspicion that the 1987 White Paper was written so that it meant all things to all people. It has always been quite evident that in the end the White Paper constituted an uneasy compromise between competing strategic and financial views. Virtually anyone could cite a line or two from it to justify a particular strategic approach or operational requirement. But the White Paper now poses bigger problems for the Government. Although the Minister will not bring himself to admit it, many of the strategic assumptions in the White Paper have been overtaken by events. But perhaps even more significantly, the White Paper has locked the Government into a $25 billion-in 1987 dollars-capital equipment purchasing program, despite the fact that the Government has failed to live up to the Budget allocations which the White Paper identified. The consequence is that other areas of defence spending, namely, manpower and operating costs, have to be squeezed to pay for the equipment. That is the real reason why the Minister has brought down this force structure review today. The great irony, of course, is that a White Paper which was vigorously sold as enhancing Australia's defence self-reliance is one that has led to k situation in which the operational readiness and overall effectiveness of Australia's defence forces have been reduced, in which our reliance on the United States for certain forms of logistic and other support has increased, and in which there is an unacceptably high rate of exodus from the Defence Force by skilled and senior personnel. The current Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has had to grapple with this legacy. It has taken him over a year to make his first major statement. It is a statement which we believe is fundamentally flawed. It has been driven by the Government's budgetary problems, not by any strategic purpose. It threatens to create a hollow army in Australia. It weakens the combat capability of the Defence Force without adequately compensating for it. It fails to address potentially important legal and financial constraints on the Ready Reserve proposal and it fails to address major inadequacies in management practice within Defence. The review also canvasses a wish list of equipment purchases which may be made over the next two decades. None of these items is costed. No allowance for them has yet been made in defence budgeting. They are essentially an expression of what equipment would enable the Defence Force to carry out its task more effectively over the next two or three decades. This equipment wish list is not the essence of this force structure review. The cutback of our regular forces and the Ready Reserve concept are, of course, its most important element. Until the proposed equipment acquisitions are properly costed, and until the Government identifies how it will be funding them, and until a more specific commitment is given to them, this wish list-or shopping list-will remain just that, rather than any blueprint for the future of our force structure. There are, of course, items on this wish list such as the acquisition of a more effective mine countermeasure program which the Opposition has long believed would enhance Australia's security. But we will be approaching the issue of force structure in a quite different way to the Government. The defence review which the coalition parties are currently undertaking will base any changes or additions to our Defence Force structure on the reassessment we are making of Australia's strategic circumstances and outlook. We will not be getting into the game of ad hockery or of endorsing or amending any aspects of the uncosted equipment shopping list which the Government has produced today. When our defence review is completed we will detail our force structure proposals in a comprehensive way and one that is directly related to our strategic requirements. I wish to elaborate in greater detail on the flaws of this force structure review to which I have referred previously. First, this review is flawed because it lacks logic and consistency in the way it has been carried out. A ministerial statement such as this, which proposes a radical restructuring of Australia's Defence Force, should be carefully based on a strategic assessment of Australia's national interests. What this statement requires for its own credibility is a number of things: first, it needs a clear assessment of the strategic realities facing Australia; secondly, it needs an analysis of the implications of these realities for Australia's national security situation; and, thirdly, it needs an outline of the restructuring of the Defence Force that flows from that changing strategic and security outlook. One looks in vain in this statement for any strategic reassessment of that kind. The explanation of the Minister for Defence is that such a. strategic reassessment is not necessary because the 1987 White Paper continues to provide the strategic basis for the structure of the Defence Force. On 6 February this year, Senator Ray made this clear in a speech to the National Press Club when he said: I believe the careful approach to our security based on a rigorous analysis of our enduring strategic circumstances, detailed in the White Paper . . and endorsed in the classified Government paper . . . remains fundamentally appropriate as we tackle our role in a changing world. The trouble with this attitude is not only that it defies the reality of dramatic changes that have taken place in regional and international security over recent years; it is also clearly contrary to the views of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). The Prime Minister told the Asia-Australia Institute last Friday that 'the last five years have seen the most profound changes in global strategic circumstances in nearly half a century'. He said that this would require Australia to 'reassess our strategic relationship with Asia'. Furthermore, on 24 February this year, Senator Evans expressed a similar attitude when he said: There can be absolutely no doubt that the easing of superpower competition has had great effcct in our own Asia-Pacific region; nor can there doubt that new approaches to security now ing up have direct application in the region. The changes to which the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade refer are clear to everyone except, evidently, the Minister for Defence. They include the end of the Cold War; the rising defence expenditure of countries in the Asia-Pacific region; the changing role of the United States in that region; and the rapidly growing spread of defence technologies, and a host of other changes. What is clear is that today's force structure review has proceeded on a completely different basis to that required by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. It is a review that lacks any strategic rationale. What the Government is asking us to accept are massive changes to the If structure of the Australian Defence Force ity without any reference to developments in Australia's strategic environment. The allocation Minister for Defence has quite deliberof 2.6% to 3% of GDP. ately refused to initiate a public debate on strategic changes affecting Australia. Despite Opposition pressure for him to do so, the Minister has consistently reWhite fused to release any public versions of of the various strategic reviews recently undertaken within the Defence Departdomestic ment. Despite pressure from the Opposigrowth tion and others, the Minister has also refused to develop a new White Paper, even a Green Paper, on defence to canvass the implications of strategic changes that are obvious to everyone but to himself. The issue here is simple, but it is a vitally important one. If, as the Minister claims, the Defence White Paper provides a sufficiently accurate assessment of Australia's strategic circumstances, why is there a need to depart from the force structure which the White Paper outlines? If, on the other hand, Australia's requirement for defence equipment and force structure have changed as a result of changed strategic circumstances-as the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have emphasised-why has the Government refused to release a new public strategic assessment? The simple answer is be that the review announced today is driven open- by budgetary considerations and not by strategic changes. This brings me to the second reason why this review is flawed. It is a review of defence policy that has been driven by the need to make cost savings because the funding projections made in the 1987 White Paper have not been met. It is a review that is the product of this Government's mismanagement of the defence budget. It is not a review that is the outcome of any sensible or thorough reassessment of what is needed to enhance Australia's security. Since the 1987 White Paper, the Government has consistently failed to deliver the funds for defcnce that it has promised. The White Paper stated: we are to achieve the levels of defence capabiland the priorities reflected in this Paper, there is a nced over the life of the program, for an of resources generally within the order Ever since the White Paper, however, Government outlays on defence have not matched the growth rates projected in the Paper. For the last four years, deany fenee spending has been kept to historic lows of 2.3 and 2.4 per cent of gross product. In fact, since 1987, real in the defence budget has been kept at or close to zero, and in 1987-88 it or actually shrank by 1.8 per cent. At the same time as defence has been subjecte'd to either static or negative real growth, the Government's forward projections for defence spending, as they are presented in the five-year defence program, have been for real growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. Each year the five-year defence program figure for the following year has been revised downwards, with a consequent flow-on effect on the size of the growth in subsequent years. Not surprisingly, the disparity between the five-year defence program projections and the real budget outcomes have created enormous planning problems for defence. The result of this static or negative growth in the defence budget over the past five years is that the 1987 White Paper has become more and more difficult to implement. Up to the end of last financial year the estimated accumulated shortfall between the level of defence funding projected in the White Paper and the level which the Government actually allocated to it was almost $2 billion. If the same pattern continues, the accumulated shortfall will grow to about $3 billion by the end of this financial year. The effect of this shortfall has been ident for a long time. As cost pressures on the defence budget have built up, the task of implementing the White Paper has become increasingly difficult. In order to pay for the 'big ticket' items noted in the White Paper, other projects have been deferred or cut back, personnel numbers have been reduced, training activities have been scaled down and stocks have been depleted. What has been happening progressively over the past five years, as a result of situation, is that the operational readiness and overall effectiveness of our defence force has been reduced. Today's force structure review is the best indication to date of this critical situation within defence. What the Minister is proposing is a radical change in force structure to that contained in the White Paper, but he has failed to explain the real reason for the change. The reason is the gap between the funding projections set out in the 1987 White Paper and the resources which defence has actually received. What today's ministerial statement confirms is that the promises made in the 1987 White Paper cannot be met. What is required, therefore, is not what this statement today gives us, namely, changes as to the structure of our Defence Force to accommodate a budget shortfall. What is required is a new White Paper which addresses all the elements of our defence policy in a sensible and coordinated way. That means addressing the strategic situation and force structure implications, as welI as the budgetary situation. The third serious flaw in this force structure review is its decision to cut two of the six Regular Army combat battalions. The Opposition believes this decision to be a dangerous mistake. The Govcrnment's reassuring rhetoric should be ignored. This decision will affect the combat capability of our Defence Force. Six battalions is the minimum viable number below which the Army should not fall if the Defence Force is expected to be able to deal at short notice with a low level insurgency-style conflict in Australia's north. If two battalions are to be pruned from this number, the Defence ev- Force would, for example, find it extremely difficult to support a battalion commitment of troops to peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, unless the Government was prepared to run down the capacity to respond to low level threats in Australia's north. The Opposition differs fundamentally from the Government on this issue. We would maintain six Army battalions and beef them up by using some of the funds made available by civilianisation and conthis tracting out to improve their equipment, to improve their manpower and to improve their training. We have serious doubts about the Government's claim that the proposed Ready Reserve will be able to fill the gap created by the decision to disband two battalions of our Army regulars. Our doubts are the result of the following considerations: first, there is a political restraint on mobilising the Ready Reserve. To order its mobilisation when there is more political than military confrontation could easily cause the escalation of any crisis. Second, there is a possible legal constraint on calling out the Ready Reserve in times of crisis falling short of war, and it is a matter of very grave concern that the Minister has not addressed that constraint in his statement today, and apparently only realised the problem last week. It is ludicrous to be replacing our regular personnel component without any guarantees that those who are supposed to replace them will do the job if and when required. Third, there is also a military constraint on the Ready Reserve replacement notion. There will inevitably be delays, sometimes significant ones, between a decision to mobilise all or part of the Ready Reserve and the availability to deploy it in operations. What all this amounts to is this: the decision to reduce Australia's permanent Army t.o a few battalions is a reckless mistake that will reduce the combat capability of our Defence Force. It is a decision taken for the wrong reasons and with serious consequences that the Government refuses to address. The fourth flaw in today's force structure review concerns wider aspects of the decision to create a Ready Reserve force. The Opposition has very real doubts that the Ready Reserve proposal, as set out in this statement, can work effectively. We certainly do not believe that it has been properly thought through by the Government: first, the Ready Reserve proposal does nothing to solve the very real problems of the existing reserves. The reserves are currently poorly equipped and lack adequate training facilities. Those problems will be accentuated with the advent of a separate elite reserve. The fact is that the existing reserves provide a nucleus of a very capable force which the Government should have utilised rather than attempting to add an additional reserve element. Most of the current difficulties facing the existing reserves have been created because they have ,not received the financial support they need to become a totally effective force. Where particular elements of the reserves have been adequately supported, and their roles intelligently defined, they have been remarkably successful. Some examples include the mainly reserve regional force surveillance units, Norforce, the Pilbara regiment and the 51st Far North Queensland regiment. A second failing of the Ready Reserve proposal is that it adds a third tier of military service that could add to, rather than reduce, the size of the defence bureaucracy. Third, there is no guarantee that the proposal will be successful in attracting enough people to make it work, or that they will stay after the cost of training them. The Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-General Coates, expressed these concerns directly to a parliamentary committee in November last year. In speaking of the Ready Reserve proposal, he said: I am unsure as to the measure of support the business community could give to such a scheme, especially in these stringent economic times . . . and on this basis I have been urging caution in introducing this scheme. Fourth, the Government has failed to produce a detailed costing of the Ready Reserve scheme, and the real costs involved need to be seriously questioned. The review states that the Ready Reserve is 'expected to cost about 42 per cent relative to regular personnel', but it does not produce any detailed reasoning for that cost estimate; nor does it refer to different estimates produced by the Attorney General and, apparently, by the Army. For all of these reasons, and others, the Opposition believes that the resources to be allocated to the Ready Reserve would be better spent improving the equipment and training opportunities of the existing Reserve and in giving it worthwhile and necessary roles: In the 1987 White Paper, the Government undertook to 'give priority to our increasingly effective reserve forces'. Noone can dispute that this is another undertaking of the White Paper that the Government has failed to fulfil. Its new Ready Reserve proposal will only make that failure more obvious and more demoralising. A fifth serious flaw in today's force structure review is its failure to address overstaffing and inadequate management practices in the civilian defence bureaucracy. For many years, the Opposition has been arguing the need to both cut numbers and improve management standards in the Defence Department. In this statement today the Government is finally accepting the sense of some of those arguments and is proposing to make some rationalisations in civilian defence staffing. We need more detail, however, on the cuts before a judgment on their adequacy can be made. The Minister has said in his speech that 1,600 civilian positions will be cut from what he calls 'central elements of the Department and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation', but we need to know precisely the number of civilian defence positions on Russell Hill which will be abolished as a result of this review. The staffing level in the civilian defence bureaucracy, however, is only one prerequisite for establishing more cost efficiencies and better management in defence organisation. The Opposition believes that the most effective way of improving the defence style of management is to devolve, as far as practicable, financial and other responsibilities from defence central and to establish clearer lines of authority to make people more responsible for the decisions they take. We see it as a major inadequacy of the ministerial statement today that it fails to address these defence management issues which make the organisation so overstaffed and inefficient. There are some areas of common ground. The inadequacies I have referred to in the force structure review make it a seriously flawed document, but there are elements of the review on which we share some important common ground with the Government. We have indicated for some time that we support in principle the civilianisation and contracting out of some defence support activities. We simply do not believe that a situation, in which over 50 per cent of the regular Defence Force has strictly non-combat functions, should be allowed to continue. There has been an unacceptable proliferation of Australian Defence Force support positions. For example, how can the Navy justify maintaining more musicians than mine warfare specialists? How can the Services justify maintaining 1,321 people as stewards? How can they justify maintaining 67 officers and 223 other rank career specialists? How can they justify employing over 500 people as fire fighters? The fact is that the 'teeth to tail' ratio of defence personnel has reached an unacceptable imbalance. The Opposition believes that civilianisation and contracting out of defence support positions will enable more emphasis to be given to our combat forces. We recognise, however, that there are clearly many support positions in Defence which remain essential to the operations of the ADF and which cannot realistically be civilianised. The essential condition for civilianisation and contracting out is that the ADF's combat effectiveness not be compromised. We believe that within that constraint, many defence support functions can be opened up to the private sector. In our view, however, strong essential services legislation to support civilianisation is necessary, and we are particularly concerned that there is no reference to such legislation in the Minister's statement today. Finally, we believe that civilianisation in contracting out should be implemented with due regard to the long term commitment of service which most ADF personnel make on joining the Defence Force. On base restructuring, it is clear that arrangements must reflect the strategic concerns of the 1990s and not of some earlier period. As a result, the Opposition accepts that some closures and rationalisations of bases may be necessary. We reserve the right, however, to look at each closure or rationalisation on its merits, and we will be addressing those announced in the statement today. We believe, however, that the Government should allow for the phasing in of closures at a pace which recognises the concerns of the communities affected. The review announces some changes to defence export guidelines. Obviously changes had to be made following the debacles such as the sale of the Mirage jets to Pakistan last year. The Opposition is firmly committed to encouraging, within appropriate guidelines, a healthy defence export industry. But one of the factors that has inhibited defence exports has been the vagueness of the Government's guidelines. This review was a good opportunity to streamline arrangements but, even more importantly, to cut through the ambiguity of guidelines and to spell out clearly what exporters can and cannot do. I believe that, on these criteria, the changes in the export guidelines announced today fall well short of the mark. This force structure review will come as a deep disappointment to all those who had hoped for a statement that would make defence planning more predictable and would be more directly related to changes in our regional and international security. This statement is an inadequate response to the critical situation in which our Defence Force finds itself today. The bottom line is that defence personnel are being made to pay, and being made to pay dearly, for the Government's mismanagement of the defence budget. They and the Australian community deserve something better than this review. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",97
162,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's economic strategy which has brought about massive destruction of AustraBut lian business confidence and profits. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",103
163,Mr MCLACHLAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"I rise on this matter of public importance because those on this side of the House are desperately worried about the disastrous circumstances that surround Australian business. I have listened with interest to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) trying to justify with figures that somehow things in Australia are okay; that somehow in business Australia people have confidence; that somehow, perhaps, we are not in a recession. If, like the Treasurer, one is a statistical megalomaniac, it is possible to prove anything to oneself; but I can tell the House that no-one else in this country and none of the observers that look at it from the outside believe that this is the case. In 1985 the Treasurer of this country said that we should set out for growth. 'We should cast our sails for growth', I think he said. I think that was just after he had cast his sails for a consumption tax and fallen down-a consumption tax, I might say, which amongst other things included some taxes on business inputs. The Prime Minister in 1986, at a very important lecture to the Victorian Economic Society, said the same thing. He supported his first mate. He said: We deliberately rejected fighting inflation . . . We set our sails for growth, believing that we could best address the structural imbalances in the process of ongoing growth. That is very commendable, Mr Deputy Speaker. You will remember that at that time the other Ministers on the front bench agreed with that strategy. Senator Button, who is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) wholeheartedly supported that thrust. But the Prime Minister went on: the real test is whether strong growth can be sustained over the long period necessary permanently to cut the evil of unemployment . . . and to give all Australians the higher living standards that our resources and skills have placed within our reach. I So how have they measured up against their own standards? First of all, unemployment was then between 8 and 9 per cent. It is now 9.9 per cent and going on 12 per cent. Australian living standards have fallen by almost any measure: 3 per cent down in the last year. On the international measures that people have conducted, we have managed to go from tenth to thirteenth in the same time-in a year. But we sure got some growth. How did we get growth? We built growth on debt. What did we do about the debt? We managed to charge people for their debt the highest average interest rates for 5112 ycars in Australia's history, I would gucss. They were constantly averaging 20 per cent for 5112 years all of the time since those pronouncements were made. We got some growth. Today the Prime Minister was commenting on the figures: all of 0.1 per cent of growth we got in the March quarter. How lucky can we get? Point one of one per cent. It makes us wonder whether the statistician should have a swab. Nevertheless, we have been living on those high interest rates, and I put it to honourable members that what has really happened is that this country is sunk, albeit until there is a change of government and a change of direction, in a sea of debt. We have been in the most diabolical trouble that any of our agc can remember, and one has to be very old to remember a situation that was as bad as this. What really happened was that none of those prognostications of the Primc Minister and the Treasurer came to pass. Why did we have high interest rates? To stop a free fall in the dollar, they said. That was in the early part of 1985. Thcn a couple of years later we had to stop the hot cash running out of this country. If that was not enough, in the last two years we had to slow the economy down to take the heat out. We had for all of that time to pay these unpayable levels of interest, and we have certainly sunk this country on a sea of debt. I am absolutely staggered that the Primc Minister and the Treasurer could get up with such confIdence and say that things are okay. Government members do not have to takc it from us. They can take it from the Business Council Bulletin, which arrived in my office yesterday, to see whether othcr people think our circumstanccs are in any way parlous. This is a report that will be published in the near future on the Busincss Council's Role of Government task force, chaired by Mr Charles Allen, who is the Managing Director of Woodside Petroleum. He has this to say: . . . it has been in many ways a deeade of wasted opportunities in Australia. The economy is in severe recession, probably the deepest recession sinee the great depression of the 1930s-a recession which has been entirely home grown and the product predominantly of Commonwealth Government economic mismanagement. Yesterday's judgment. He goes on: Business confidence and business investment have both been shattered by that mismanagement and general policy uncertainty in relation to environmental approval, the labour market and so on. He gocs on to say: . . . when confidence and investment have been broken to the current extent there can only bc onc answer-the Government has got it wrong. How has the Government got it wrong, and what have been the results of that dircction? We have a net foreign debt of $131 billion, with around 20 per cent of export income required to service that debt. This Government has recorded the highest levels of current account deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP)-6.6 per cent in 1985-86 and in 1988-89, and it is still around 4 per cent. Y ct in that same speech the Prime Minister said that 3.4 per cent was a hugc level, and he castigated the previous Government for arriving at that level. Real business fixed investment camc down by 6.3 per cent in the March quarter and by 10 per cent compared with the March quarter last year. The level of equipment investment in the March quarter in adjusted terms is the lowest recorded since September 1988. Busincss confIdence has plummeted and the outlook is for a 16 per cent fall in private capital investment next year. So the worse is far from over. Real imports of machinery in March were at their lowest quarterly level for two years. For most of the 1980s, inflation, nominal unit labour costs and interest rates have been double the average for our major trading partners. The GDP per hour-a broad measure of labour productivity-in the March quarter of 1991 is exactly the same as it was in 1984-85. Those who like statistics might like to dwell on that one for a while. Now we come to the thing that is sinking this country-the level of debt. That can be measured by the non-performing loans of the four major banks. As of recent days they look like being at a level of $20 billion, and some analysts expect that this figure will go up by 20 per cent by September. Bad debts for the first half of this current year are, of course, $2 billion, and rural debt is up from $7 billion in 1985, when that great statement was made, to around $12 billion. How people in rural Australia will be able to perform with that debt, I have not the slightest idea. All one can say, when that level is added to these levels of understood non-performing loans, is that at the present time the situation is quite terrifyclear ing. Bankruptcies in the March quarter were 53 per cent higher than for the same quarter last year-the highest increase on record. We already know there will be 50,000. to 70,000 small businesses which will disappear-out of business and under water. Gross operating surplus of private corporate trading enterprises fell by 6.3 per cent in the March quarter. Business profits were down 20 per cent in the nine months of this financial year, after falling 7 per cent in the last financial year. Manufacturing sector profits for the months are 40 per cent down on their level in each of the two previous years, and are now at the same nominal levelthat is, before inflation-achieved in the first half of the 1980s. Anybody who does not believe that should look at the graph. What is happening to business profits in this country is patently obvious. They are plummeting as though they were going down the other side of Mount Everest. One might say, 'You are only reading out a litany of disasters'. But there are some things which can be done, and they are set out in the Business Council document. One could address those inflationary pressures at their source by giving people a choice between the centralised wage fixing system and moving to a genuine enterprise agreement system. One could accelerate and broaden the pace of structural reform, including improved efficiency in the public sector through privatisation and competition so that Australian businesses are not burdened with a 20 to 50 per cent cost disadvantage for key services, which are costing something of the order of $20 billion a year. We could introduce a comprehensive goods and services tax, one a little bit different from the one the Treasurer got rolled on in 1985 and on which he spent days and days at the tax summit trying to inveigle people into. We could do that and get rid of the taxation on business inputs which, for example, penalise car industry exports by about 6 per cent, and we could give more people more incentive to save and work. We could give some and unequivocal commitment to growth, and demonstrate some bona fides by giving the immediate go-ahead to Coronation Hill and the third runway at Sydney airport, and we could rescind the three-mine policy and get rid of all that illogicality. We could get the monkey about investment off our back if some changes were made. It is not our back, of course, that the monkey is on; it is the nation's back. It is on those business enterprises that want to invest here which simply will not do so with the lack of confidence that this Government has put in place with those nine policies. We could give the Reserve Bank some independence to pursue a zero inflation target, a task made much easier in an economy where productivity is high and costs are not inflated by unrealistic wage rises. All members of the Government have been in it-not only the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, not only the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) aIfd the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button)-everybody on their side of politics was selling that growth policy in the middle 1980s. They were selling it and, as they said, they had rejected trying to control inflation. So we got it, all we definitely got inflation in very large lumps. I put it to Government members that they have destroyed people. They have destroyed people's lives, they have destroyed people's futures and they have done irreparable damage. In my view, this Treasurer has done more damage in Australia than all the corporate cowboys lumped together have done. The Government is sinking us in a sea of debt the like of which, as I said, no-one-unless he is very old and can think back to the 1930s-can remember. While all this is happening, the first mate is planning a coup. While the ship of state battles onMr Crean-Not true.",103
164,Mr MCLACHLAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"Not true? The honourable member would be the only one who thinks so. The ship of state battles on in this storm of the Treasurer's own making, of the first mate's own making-he and the captain's own making. This man who would be king, this Fletcher Christian, is planning a mutiny. I can say that I hope he makes it. I hope he makes it because he has done more single-handedly to break Australia than anyone else has done,. and he needs to be thrown overboard by the very Australians whom he has helped to break.",106
165,Mr CREAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"I find the contribution by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) amusing. He says that we should be condemned for the massive destruction of Australian business confidence, yet he gives a speech which would hardly inspire the business community to believe that, by installing the Opposition in power, things would change. Let me go to the issues at the crux of this. It does seem to me that in the context of economic performance the indicators which are important are employment, investment, the level of profit, the growth that can be generated from it and the ability to manage the economy accordingly. It is true that in the current circumstances of the downturn in the Australian right- economy-no longer a technical recession, but let me not dwell on that pointthere have been significant job losses, and the Government regrets that. Mr Downer-There will be more.",106
166,Mr CREAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"No, there will not be more, and I will come to that point in a minute. The simple fact of the matter is that, against a background in which an economy cannot produce sufficient to meet the expenditure and the demand of the economy, there are only two solutions. One is to expand production, and that cannot be done overnight, given the level of industry in this country; the other is to curb demand. In those circumstances the Government did set about curbing demand. We were developing an un sustainability in terms of our demand pressures, which was only worsening the balance of payments situation. In relation to the fall in employment, I remind the House that 127,000 of the 144,000 jobs lost in the last 12 months were in Victoria. However, that 144,000 drop in jobs is from a base of 7.7 million jobs in the work force. In 1982-83, when honourable members opposite were in power, we saw 187,000 jobs lost from a base of 6.3 million in the work force. In other words, there was a 3 per cent drop in employment opportunities. The coalition created an unemployment level of up to 10.7 per cent against a participation rate which the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) says is not significant, but which the coalition Government drove down from 62.7 per cent under the previous Labor Government to 60.4 per cent. The simple fact of the matter is that if, under the coalition's employment and growth strategies of 1982-83, there had been the participation rate that we have now, the unemployment rate would have been close to 15 per cent in the 1982-83 recession. Mr MCLachlan-What about the reverse?",106
167,Mr CREAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"I accept the urging of the honourable member for Barker. Let us look at the reverse situation. Even with the 144,000 jobs that have been lost under us, with a 9.9 per cent unemployment rate, the participation rate of 63.8 per cent is the highest ever recorded. If we had the participation level which the coalition dropped the economy to in 1982 when it was in government, the level of unemployment today would be 5 per cent. This is important for the purpose of addressing the question of unemployment. r think that a lot can be done by playing with the unemployment figures. However, what really matters is job creation capacity. Despite the job losses of the last 12 months, this Government has created 1.5 million jobs in the eight years in which it has been in office. That represents the fastest rate of growth, by threefold, of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country. Certainly, it represents the most continuous progress in employment generation in the history of this country. That rate of growth could not be achieved unless one was instilling confidence in the economy. That is the employment aspect. The next aspect relates to profits and plummeting confidence. I remind the honourable member for Barker that profits are not the only indicator of a company's performance. Recently, there was a long article in the Business Review Weekly of 10 May which drew the distinction between earnings of the top performing companies in this country and their profit levels. The article stated: Australia's top 500 companies overcame tremendous odds to stave off recession . . . The ings before depreciation, interest and tax . the country's most powerful companies slipped by only about 10 per cent despite the dramatic slow down in both the international and economies, and the continuing corporate lapses that have forced many companies to writedowns in asset values. The article then went on to talk about the impact on profits resulting from the to revalue the assets of companies that have been devalued because of the apthe proach of many people in the corporate world-the corporate cowboys referred to by the honourable member for Barker. It talked about the consequences of their actions-the consequences of loose lending by banks and bad management decisions by certain companies in the corporate sector. I remind the honourable member for Barker also that, against those employment figures which I talked about before, it is significant that the huge loss of jobs has been in Victoria. Most of the corporate collapses have taken place in Victoria. It is also the case that in Victoria the two companies entrusted with looking after people's savings, Pyramid Building Society and Estate Mortgage, so badly managed their portfolios that people's savings have been lost or frozen. When that happens and consumption is taken out of the economy, there are dramatic consequences for employment. That is not as a result of government policy. It has nothing to do with government policy. It is a consequence of the poor investment strategies of people who are entrusted to look after workers' money. That is the significant reason for the downturn in Victoria. That downturn is reflected in the huge job loss in that State. It is reflected in the fact that, in the recent national accounts figures, consumption spending in Victoria fell-it negativedby, I think, 2.7 per cent, compared with a national increase of 0.4 per cent. I think that we have to understand and identify the real reasons. The real reason is not that people have lost confidence in this Government. The real reasons are a direct consequence of poor decision making, poor management and poor trusteeship of people's earnings. On the profits front, I make the followearning comparison. The last major collapse . . of in business sector profit shares occurred in 1982. Under the previous Liberal Govdomestic ernment, between March 1981 and Sepcoltember 1982, the profit share of gross take domestic product collapsed by 31j2 percentage points of non-farm GDP. It went from 14.1 per cent to 10.6 per cent. What need that Government took out of the economy through its mismanagement was in order of $1.4 billion in real terms. I ask honourable members opposite to contrast that situation, that drop in profit share-that is what this motion is aboutwith the circumstances of the recession which they allege we are in and which they allege has led to a massive drop in profits. What has happened under this Government is that profit share has gone from that appallingly low level of 10.6 per cent under the Liberals to a peak of 16.5 per cent under us. It has dropped back only in the last 12 months. In 1989-90 the gross profit share was 15.8 per cent. In the last 12 months it has dropped only 0.9 per cent compared with a 31J2 per cent drop when honourable members opposite were in government in 1981-82. Honourable members opposite have the gall to come into this place and talk about what our policies have done for the level of profits and confidence. They have the gall to talk about that against a background of their performance. The simple fact is that, in current circumstances, of course profits are down. People are not buying as much. The recession is hurting and people are having to go for market share. However, I must say that in areas such as the automobile industry, where people are able to purchase cars, they are able to compete pretty effectively in that environment and get some good deals. The reasons for the recession-the high interest rates and the necessity to curb demand-are behind us. We have seen a 7'/2 percentage point drop in interest rates in the past 15 months. There is no point in honourable members opposite telling us that we have a problem of lack of confidence and referring to the level of interest rates of more than 12 months ago. We have to deal with current circumstances and look forward. I must say that it is statements such as those we have heard from the honourable member for Barker that really cause concern in the business community. We heard the other day-and in Parliament today-reference to the Toyota company shelving its operation in Australia. However, two things are clear from the Toyota position. Firstly, the company has a problem with industrial relations-a problem which I believe it can sort out. The unions in the vehicle industry have indicated a preparedness in greenfield sites to - nter genuine enterprise bargaining and to sign no-strike contracts for a term of three years. Why is that process not beginning? I believe it is. I believe it will be successful. However, the company has two other concerns. The company is concerned about what the Opposition would do with the level of tariffs. I must say that I have seen no retraction from the honourable member for Barker in relation to his commitment to reduce tariff levels for the automotive industry to zero by the year 2000. What sort of confidence will that give to the Japanese parent company or to an automotive market where we are trying to establish a sensible basis upon which that industry can proceed against a background of reducing protection, but not eliminating it? Mr Downer-You are reducing it as well.",107
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Order! The honourable member for Mayo! I will warn you next time.,108
169,Mr CREAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"The Opposition would put the industry out of business. The second point raised by the honourable member in his speech goes to the question of reducing inflation to zero. Does he know what the Japanese have to say about that? This is what they have to say in the words of Mr Johnson: the Japanese are horrified at Dr Hewson's suggestion that we should aim for a zero inflation target. They consider him to have lost credibility on the basis of proposing such an outrageous proposition. Yet the Opposition talks to us about confidence and about instilling confidence while concerns like this are being expressed in relation to the automotive industry-a key industry for this economy-because of what it is prepared to do about the level of tariff and its nonsense proposition in relation to inflation! In any event, how will the Opposition get zero inflation when it is proposing an outrageous consumption tax that will add to inflation, must add to inflation, because it will increase prices? Mr Reith-Pathetic!",108
170,Mr CREAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can say that that is pathetic, but he knows it is true. He should get up and tell the House how the Opposition will get a zero inflation rate with the introduction of a consumption tax. In my view, the prospects for the Australian economy are very sound because the recent balance of payments figures show that the current account deficit is now 30 per cent lower than it was 12 months ago. In turn, that indicates that significant growth has occurred in exports. I would make the point that the average annual increase in exports of manufactured goods has been 12 per cent in the last four years of this Government compared to the 4 per cent that those opposite, when in Government, were able to achieve. The 3.8 per cent of GDP that the balance of payments current account deficit represents is at its lowest since June 1988 quarter. The national accounts figures today demonstrate that we have had the second successive positive quarter of growth. There is optimism beyond that in terms of the trend in stocks and also from indications from the housing and construction industries. However, most important has been the positive contribution to growth in these national accounts figurcs from net exports: in six of the past seven quarters we have seen positive contributions to growth from net exports, notwithstanding the fact that the terms of trade have declined by 6.5 per cent. Mr Reith-Yes, Qantas planes.",109
171,Mr CREAN,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"It is 7 per cent even without the Qantas planes in the last quarter. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to read the figures; he might learn something. It is 22 per cent with them, but I would not expect the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to understand that, because he never prepares himself.",109
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,109
173,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"Mayo) (4.43 p.m.)The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is also the Ministcr Assisting the Treasurer, made a couple of statements this afternoon that the House ought to reflect on. First, the Minister Assisting the Treasurer said that he believes the ambition of achieving a zero i-flation rate is an 'outrageous propositlOn'-to have a zero inflation rate is outrageous. I think we would all agree that any government which took that view would be a totally irresponsible one. Worse than that, because of the deceit of the Minister's statement, the Minister argued that unemployment really was not as bad as those who are unemployed apparently think it is. In response to an interjection the Minister said that there would not be any more job losses, yet today the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his press conferenceand the Minister might like to listen to this; although perhaps he might not like to do so-said that the unemployment rate would peak later this calendar year. the The Treasurer said that it would be around 10.75 per cent; I do not know whether the Minister is aware that the current rate of unemployment is 9.9 per cent. The fact is that the Minister is contradicting the Treasurer and knows that he is doing so. Mr Crean inteljecting",109
174,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"Standing in this House, .the Minister thinks he can get away WIth a slimy little line in order to make a simple little argument which is a false argument. Mr Crean interjecting",109
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Order! The Minister will remain silent.,109
176,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"This is the centenary year of the Australian Labor Party (ALP)-the year when its members go out around our country and talk about the great Labor tradition. We know what that great Labor tradition is: it is the tradition of economic ruin. The Minister talked about the State of Victoria: 'the figures would not be so bad if it were not for Yictoria' - where a Labor government is m office and where the Minister's own seat happens to be. That is the state of Victoria-a Labor State, and part of the Labor tradition of economic ruin. The Treasurer is the great historian of the Labor side; he likes to regurgitate the Labor way, how good it is and so on, but the Labor tradition of economic ruin gocs back to the turn of the century. Honourable members will not literally remember Scullin, but they will have read about him: he was thrown out during the Great Depression, which he wrought on Australia. Chifley was thrown out in 1949, when this country once more was struggling with economic crisis. Whitlam-the Minister might remember Whitlam; his father certainly would well remember him-was thrown out as a result of economic chaos and ruin. And Hawke and Keating have carried on the same great glorious Labor Party tradition. Today Minister after Minister-particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer-have stood in this chamber to claim that these national accounts figures are really, as they used to say in the Boer War, after Ma[eking: 'At last we are free, we have turned away from the worse; the economy is on the upand-up.' Why does the Government not contemplate for a moment the truth of the national accounts figures rather than living in a rhetorical fantasyland? If honourable members look at the figures themselves, they will see that on the trend estimate-which is the important figure-this is the fourth consecutive quarter of negative growth. On the trend estimate there is a negative growth in this quarter of minus 0.2 per cent. If one takes into account the terms of trade adjustment, which the Australian Statistician says one should do when considering the national accounts figures, one finds that the terms of trade fell by 3 per cent in the March quarter. If one adjusts the gross domestic product figures for the terms of trade, one will find that GDP fell in the March quarter by 0.5 per cent. That is not according to the coalition; it is according to the Statistician. That is something the Government ought to worry about. If one looks at the figures in terms of where what growth there is in the economy is coming from, one finds it is coming [rom the private sector: government investment contributcd 0.4 per cent to GDP, whereas private sector investment did not contribute and had a negative performance of 1.2 per cent. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), interjectcd about the figures on manufacturing exports. We heard great boasts from the Prime Minister and others today about the wonderful performance the Government has achieved in manufacturing exports. Read what the Statistician says. r am quite happy to table this; this is what the Statistician said: Excluding the sale of aircraft by Qantas . . ., the volume of exports of goods and services would have fallen by 0.5 per cent rather than rising by the 1. 6 per cent actually recorded. That is what the Statistician said. Nil' Crean inteljecting",109
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Ordcr! The Minister will remain silent.,110
178,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"Mr Dcputy Spcaker, I notice that you warned me whcn r interjected, but I am glad you have at least picked up the Minister. Mr Crean inteljecting",110
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,Order! That is the second time. I have warned the Minister.,110
180,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"The simple figures and the statement by the Statistician back up what the honourable member for Barker is saying and what I am saying, which is that the Labor tradition is the tradition of economic ruin, and that is what this Government has wrought upon this country. The really worrying figure for all Australians today is the figure on net foreign debt, which is a figure of $ I 33.4 billion, nearly $133.5 billion. The Minister nodded his assent; he did not actually refer to it in his speech. Mr Crean-Who incurs it?",110
181,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"That is not the major issue. The major issue is that the international financial community sees that our foreign debt is continuing to grow and will stop lending money, just as it stopped lending Egypt money, when a country gets to the point where its foreign debt becomes uncontrollable. Mr Crean interjecting",110
182,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"The Minister is still interjecting, by the way, Mr Deputy Speaker. The ratio of net foreign debt to GDP is 35.2 per cent. Mr Crean interjecting",111
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"Order! As the honourable member for Mayo has decided to draw my attention to it, I will tell the Minister that he should remain silent. On the basis of the interjections of the honourable member for Mayo on the Minister, he has only two more warnings to go.",111
184,Mr DOWNER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"The ratio of foreign debt to GDP is 35.2 per cent; that ratio has risen by 0.7 per cent in these figures. The Treasurer used to claim, until quite recently, that the real challenge for Australia was to stabilise its foreign debt. That is why we have had the recession that he wreaked on this country. That is why he us.ed to say that we had. t- have the high mterest rates-to stablhse the foreign debt. The Minister said that we have solved our economic problems, we have passed the worse and we are on the way up. I remind the Minister that the figures that were produced today, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that we have not stabilised our for-ign debt, that it is continuing to get worse. The Minister apparently has completely ignored that. It is quite interesting to observe that Egypt has a foreign debt of about 50 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP). In the last couple of days we have written off $200m that the Egyptians owe us in order to help them cope with the problems of their foreign debt when our foreign debt is 35.2 per cent of our GDP. I regard that as a complete and utter nonsense. It is another illustration of how the Government is completely out of control over economic management. In conclusion, the honourable member for Barker has spoken a good deal about a whole range of policy areas where we have to take significant action as a country to trade our way out of our balance of payments and foreign debt problems. I make this final point, in this the centenary year of the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party used to claim to be the party of working class Australians. It was very proud of that claim. The really sad thing about the Labor Party-this is a point made by many former Ministers of the Whitlam Government-is that it is little more than a party of middle class special interest groups, lobby groups. Its policies are dominated by the need to try to placate special interest groups. The environmental movement is placated, but at the cost of $65m per annum in lost export income from Coronation Hill, $300m a year in lost export inco11?-e from Wesley Vale and $690m a year m lost income from exports of uranium. The unions are kept happy. Of course, the Minister would be well aware of that; he was kept happy for a long time when he led the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We have seen $1.5 billion worth of exports held up and lost because of lack of waterfront reform, and the list goes on. We can all conclude that not only is the Labor Party the party of economic ruin, but I used to think the Labor Party was a party that could not handle money until I heard about the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters. Australia has become the laughing stock of this region because of the economic policies pursued by those miserable people sitting opposite.",111
185,Mr KERR,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"One might wonder why, in the present difficult times, the Liberal Party finds it so difficult to place itself before the public and attract its support. Anyone listening to the debate today can quite easily identify the reason-that is, whilst there is sound and fury, there is damn all presented to us in terms of any ideas whatsoever. It is frightening that the alternative government can come before us and put a matter of public importance on the Notice Paper relating to the Government's economic strategy which it says has failed, and then present us with a Ilist of complaints but at no stage identify what it would do about the matters that it complains of. It is terrifying that what passes as an intellectual contribution to our country and a debate about our economic future is conducted on this level. We started out with the shadow Minister for industry and commerce, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), who most appropriately has a rural background. He gave us his best Hanrahan performance. 'We'll all be rooned before the year is out', he told us. He went through various economic droughts and floods and catastrophes and showers of toads and whatever biblical destruction might be visited upon this country. What did the honourable member give us by way of positive suggestions? He gave us three points. He told us that we might proceed to have some new enterprise agreements to replace the industrial relations system that this country has developed. That is a very smart idea. It was precisely the unrestrained competition for increased profits that blew away the profit share during the last period of the Liberal Government. It was precisely the restraint that has come about through the cooperation of the trade union movement and the Government through the accord process which has underpinned a willingness of the Australian working people to see a reduction of real wages to accommodate a policy which is designed to support private investment in this country. We would have the Opposition fundamentally unpin that so that the naked marketplace would operate and we would see the same sort of destruction in terms of profit share come about again. If we did not see that destruction in profit share, we would see massive industrial dislocation as people had to fight it out in the field. That is a promise for Australian industry-bloodshed in the field in terms of industrial relations, an impact on the profit share and a destruction of the capacity of our manufacturing industry to sustain those impacts. The next welcome suggestion that the honourable member for Barker put forward was that we should introduce a goods and services tax. That is a terrific idea for the Australian people, coupled with its complementary twin-a target of zero inflation. Here we have the most wonderful piece of economic nonsense that has ever been issued from a political party in this country's history: we will go for a 15 per cent goods and services tax so that everything that is bought and sold in this country-services, products and the likecarries a tax of 15 per cent and we will at the same time, magically, through a process that no one can identify whatsoever, 'go for a zero inflation target. Let us take that for a realistic proposition and not just for a rhetorical piece of stupidity. If the Opposition were serious about a zero outcome and the imposition of a goods and services tax, then its proposition is just to bury the Australian economy under the ground-to put it into a depression, not a recession, because any other outcome would simply be incompatible with that result. We would need a substantial decline in productivity and a decline in gross domestic product to allow us to come to those outcomes. That is certainly going to be welcome to the manufacturing and productive sectors of this country. The third point that we were told about was that we would move on the tariff front. As the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), has indicated, what would a proposal for a zero tariff on the car industry, for example, do by way of sending a message to international investors? It is hardly surprising that the shadow Minister for industry, the honourable member for Barker, is probably our best weapon out there in the community, out there amongst those concerned with our manufacturing base and our export orientation. Instead of the kinds of solutions which are hard but practical, which this Government is having to address, we arc getting the fancy broad propositions which, when we look at them and ask people to detail, they run a mile from. There is no detail. There is a thriller that is presently on the screens in the cinemas called The Silence of the Lambs, where a young woman has to confront a very psychotic serial killer in order to try to dredge out information about others who may commit crimes. We are facing the same problem; instead of the silence of the lambs, we face the silence of the goats. Members of the Opposition have a psychotic approach to the Australian economy but dredging out the detail is worse than pulling teeth. There is simply no willingness to give any flesh to the propositions they put to us. There are some serious issues that this Government has to confront, and in fact the Government is on the front foot and is confronting them. We are not saying that everything is well; there is debate within the Labor Party, but those in the Labor Party who are putting forward ideas are arguing their propositions within the public frameworks of the Party and are addressing the realities in a constructive way. It is a very different situation from that which applies on the Opposition side, where we simply get empty and windy promises, with a contemptuous refusal to come up with any significant and constructive approaches. The Government does have a significant challenge on its hands, particularly in the area of manufacturing equipment. Looking at the recent balance of payments figures, the one figure that I think commends itself for Government attention is to be found on table 2. Looking in particular at 'equipment, gross fixed capital expenditure', we can see that both-",111

188,Mr KERR,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,"I am obviously not keeping my audience, Mr Deputy Speaker. However, as to the figures in table 2 for gross fixed capital expenditure, both private and public expenditure have been subject to significant declines over the last year or year and a half. In particular, looking at new equipment, of recent times equipment has suffered quite dramatically in both the public and private sectors. That does require the sort of response that was adopted by the special resolution of the last national conference of the Labor Party and which has been commended to the Government by way of new initiatives in terms of ways in which we can assist in stimulating investment, perhaps by an accelerated depreciation allowance, limited to major new investment proposals of over $100m, for example, proposals such as tax exempt special savings accounts which target investment funds into research and development, the commercialisation of research and development, and the like. These are constructive and specific proposals that the Government is looking at and are the subject of debate within the Party. The debate on this side of the House is constructive and intellectual, trying to grapple with the hard issues that exist in our community. It is not one of empty rhetoric such as that which flourishes on the other side of the House.",113
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC STRATEGY,The debate is concluded. NA NA Fifty-fourth General Report,113
190,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fifty-fourth general report of the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",113
191,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS,"by leave-The Committee's fifty-fourth general report covers the activities of two Public Works Committees during 1990, namely, the twenty-ninth Committee and the thirtieth Committee. Twelve reports were tabled during the year dealing with a diversity of projects, ranging from over-the-horizon radar to the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia in Sydney. The estimated cost of proposals reported on by the Committee was $559m-down, I might add, from the $1.1 billion in 1989, but that was a record year. In all, the Committee met on 44 occasions during the year to conduct public hearings, carry out inspections, consider reports and other matters. The report raises a number of matters of concern to the Committee. The first concerns works overseas. The Committee conducted a public hearing in Canberra into the proposed construction of the Australian High Commission and defence housing in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The Committee is concerned that it is precluded by the Public Works Committee Act from travelling overseas to inspect locations and sites of proposed facilities and to have informal discussions with local staff and authorities. Instead, very often local embassy staff and design and construction personnel are required to travel to Canberra from' overseas to appear at the Committee's public hearings. The Committee suggests that it may be more cost effective for it to be permitted to travel to countries where new Australian embassy and high commission projects are proposed. Adequate local knowledge is important to the Committee, and very often this cannot be gleaned simply from video productions and written submissions. Accordingly, the Committee has written to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) requesting that the Act be amended-although we are not holding our breath that it will be. The second matter concerns what are called urgent works. In May the House of Representatives agreed to exempt from Committee scrutiny the proposed construction of the Australian Pavilion at Expo 92 in Seville, Spain, on the grounds of urgency. The motion was made under the provisions of section 18(8) (b) of the Public Works Committee Act. Apparently there was uncertainty amongst agencies responsible for planning the proposed work about the applicability of the Public Works Committee Act to this proposal. Following the exemption of the work, the Committee received an assurance from the Minister for Administrative Services that in future situations where doubt exists regarding the applicability of the Act the Committee would be consulted at the earliest opportunity to ensure that possible parliamentary action was not precluded. The third matter concerns energy targets and energy audits. The Committee has requested that sponsoring departments and design and construction authorities set achievable energy targetswhich obviously were not set in this place-and thereby not design buildings requiring unusually large and unjustifiable amounts of energy for lighting and climate control. Finally, I would like to add a few remarks about a number of changes to the Committee's membership and secretariat staffing. The Committee was saddened to learn of the death in January 1990 of a former Secretary, Dick Fenton. Dick Fenton was Secretary to the Committee from October 1972 until his retirement in July 1986. During this period he was involved in more than 150 inquiries and attended the Committee at public hearings and private meetings on more than 500 occasions. He served five chairmen and eight committees. This, his record of achievement and'service to the Parliament, speaks for itself. During 1990, a number of members left the Committee. Clarrie Millar, the former member for Wide Bay, retired from Parliament after a long and distinguished career, first as Deputy Speaker and then as Vice-Chairman of the Committee. The Committee notes with pleasure that Clarrie was created a member of the General Division of the Order of Australia on Australia Day 1991. The award was made for services to Parliament, and I would like to think that this to some extent included his service to the Committee. John Mountford and Senator Glen Sheil retired from Parliament in 1990, and the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) left the Committee upon their elevation to the positions of Government and Opposition Whips-a new career path, I might add. They all made substantial contributions to the work of the Committee and I thank them for it. Work on the Committee for both members and staff is demanding. The Public Works Committee has been exceptionally well served by the dedicated and professional approach of the secretariat under the leadership of Peter Roberts. Other members of the staff are Patrick Regan and Michael Fetter, Assistant Secretaries, Sally Dunn, Jackie MCConnell and Di Singleton, secretarial support, and I thank them all. Finally, I would like to thank Committee members for the support they have given me as Chairman. In this regard I should particularly like to place on record my thanks to the Vice-Chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor).

The true title of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill should read: 1991 a Bill to abolish freedom of speech in order to prop up a morally and financially bankrupt Labor Party. The legislation blows asunder freedom of expression. It prevents all advertisements, whether paid or not, that contain any 'political matter', that is, any matter 'intended or likely to affect voting at an election'. It seeks to ban advertisements not only in an elecadvertisement tion campaign but even if they could afsaid fect voting at an 'election that might held in the future'. One would never have dreamt that Australia we would have such legislation curtailing the freedom of expression dumped in this Parliament. Without freeagainst dom of speech we cannot have free elecmoving tions. This is the sort of 'delicious' legislation that the Third Reich would have dished up to its people from time time. It effectively bans advertisements any matter of public concern. Dr Kemp-It is a blot on our democracy.  The slightest comment, the slightest critiseek cism of a government's record on an 'isparts sue' in an advertisement, will be bannedadvertising unless, of course, it is an advertiscment for the government itself, paid for by the taxpayer. Such government advertiseBill ments will not be banned for the entire period of its term, save or except for the election period. This legislation is undoubtedly one deceit and fabrication. The Australian Labor Party is facing bankruptcy, in not merely political but also financial terms, and as a consequence wishes to flay and constrain the rest of the community. Furthermore, this Government has shut out the determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commisin sioner that the ban is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil litical Rights. The very Government that is all too ready to rely on international instruments in order to usurp the Federal division of powers and to expand its ers at the expense of the States now veniently chooses to ignore its donations international obligations. The GovernWestern ment has included in the Bill the proviinto sion for disclosure of political donations, linking the ban on political advertising with disclosure. Its hypocrisy knows no bounds. Labor knows that we-like the munity-are opposed to its outrageous attack on freedom of speech and freedom of expression in the form of its proposed ban, but it knows we have we would vote for disclosure legislabe tion which covered intimidation and which was fair and equitable. But by dein liberately linking these two elementsdisclosure and banning political advertisements-it leaves us no option but to vote the legislation. However, I will be an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, in the terms that arc circulated in my name, so that to the Bill can be split and brought back to on the House in the form of two separate Bills. If the second reading amendment is not carried, as a mark of our determination to implement appropriate disclosure legislation, we will in the committee stage to amend the Bill, opposing those dealing with the ban on political but supporting the worthwhile clauses on disclosure. If these amendments are not carried, we will oppose the again at the third reading stage. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), not once but twice, has written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) urging of him to split the Bill before the House to enable us to support a disclosure Bill. Each approach has been rejected. Let me repeat unequivocally that we support disclosure of political donations on fair and equitable terms, provided also that such legislation deals with intimidation. The Leader of the Opposition will follow mc this debate and will confirm our determination to proceed with appropriatc rcand Poforms to disclosure laws. I know that many honourable members are aware of both union and Labor Party powintimidation carried out against donors conboth after disclosure and indeed bcfore are made. Evidence before the Australian Royal Commission Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters, which is sitting at this moment, has shown the practice of thugs in the Labor Party threatening persons that unless they donated they com- 'wouldn't be looked after'. I know from my own experience-not in terms of advertising, but on my first endorsement for the seat I have represented since the beginning or early part of 1966-what goes on. In February 1966 my Party endorsed me then for the first time as the Liberal candidate for Kooyong, and the next day Mr Laurie Carmichael called out all my metalworkers and closed down the engineering factory that I ran with approximately 140 employees, simply because I was the endorsed Liberal candidate. He had the hide to repeat it years later on television-that he would continue to do it. It is no good the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) shaking his head, unless he is agreeing with me that it is appalling.",115
193,Mr MELHAM,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"I am.  done. It was done to me as an endorsed candidate, and I copped it, but others perhaps would not havc been able to. We know from evidence before royal commissions what is done. So many of us have had representations in the period that we have been here complaining of the standover tactics that are adopted against people when it is learnt that small or large donations have been given to a political party. The standover men come in. That type of intimidation going on, as it docs today, ought to be effectively dealt with, and it certainly is not. It is a sick joke to consider the element of intimidation that is covered in this Bill now before the House. Fair and equitable disclosure legislation and provisions that deal adcquately with intimidation have our strongest support, but what is in the Bill is just not enough. I turn to the major elements of the Bill. The first element, contained within parts 2, 4 and 5 of the Bill, seeks to impose a blanket ban on political advertising on the electronic media. Needless to say, the coalition opposes this element of the Bill. We have unequivocally rejected from the beginning the proposal by the Government to abrogate the right of Australians to seek and impart information and to participate in public affairs. The second element, found in clauses 12 and 20, seeks to increase public expenditure on election campaigns. Again, the coalition rejects this element. The third element relates to changes to be made to the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. While the coalition would support meaningful changes that would result in full, fair and equitable disclosure, the provisions found in the Bill are wholly inadequate. I foreshadow that during the committee stage we will be moving amendments to delete the first and second elements that I have referred to and to strengthen the provisions of the Bill dealing with the disclosure of political donations. The linking, on the one hand, of the ban on political advertising with, on the other hand, changes to disclosure laws is symptomatic of the Government's duplicity in this arena. The Government simply lacks credibility on this issue. We made it clear to the Government that we would support improved disclosure laws but would reject the ban on political advertising.· But the Prime Minister has rejected requests from the Leader of the Opposition to split the Bill into two separate Bills. If that were done, the coalition would be able to work with the Government and the Australian Democrats to bring about meaningful and comprehensive changes to disclosure laws. We will still use our best endeavours to achieve that, anyway. When the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) publicly announced details of the Government's proposal to ban political advertising, I issued a public statement saying that in my view the proposal was contrary to international law and that there were serious questions about whether it was within the legislati ve competence of the Commonwealth Parliament to pass such a law. As things turned out, my vicw has been confirmed by others, including the Law Council of Australia. With respect to the position at international law, the nation's own designated commissioner-the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin-has confirmed that the ban proposed by this legislation contravenes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I congratulate Mr Burdekin on his courage in persevering, because despite promises from the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), all that was made available to him for a long period was a press release. Dr Kemp-Disgraceful!  graceful and in denial of the charter that would normally be undertaken by a government in relation to a commissioner charged with the responsibility to test these things. He has made clear to the Government what his views are. Furthermore, in regard to the constitutional issues, the New South Wales Attorney General, John Dowd, now retiring, speaking on behalf of that Governmcnt indicated that should the Bill become law New South Wales will challenge its validity in the High Court. I want to consider the position at international law before moving on to the constitutional position. Article 19.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides: Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression: this right shall include to seck, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art or through any other media of his choice. The right to freedom of speech is fundamental to our democratic society. As I said earlier, without free speech there cannot be free elections. It is acknowledged, however, that the right to freedom of speech is not an absolute one, it has to be balanced against other considcrations. That is why we have some restrictions, such as the law of defamation and the criminal offences of treason and sedition. The real question is whether any restriction on freedom of speech is justified the sake of the greater interests of community or for the rights of individusigned as. To this end, article 19.3 of the InterFederal national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that the right to freedom of speech may: . . . be subject to certain restrictions, shall only be such as arc provided by law and necessary: (a) for respect of the rights or reputations others; (b) for the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals. It falls upon the Government to demonstrate that any restriction on freedom of speech is both necessary and reasonable. The Government cannot, as it has done, merely assert that the restriction is needed. It must produce real and credible evidence that the restriction is necessary and that the method chosen is a reasonable one. The Government has failed to do this and it simply cannot do it. International treaties should not be subject to strict legalistic interpretations. Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that every treaty must be performed by signatories 'in good faith'. This is sometimes referred to as the doctrine of pacta sunt servanda. When it comes to interpreting the treaties, article 3l.1 of the Vienna Convention provides: A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in receive the light of its object and purpose. The Government argues that the proposed ban can be justified by reason of the public order exception found in article 19.3(b) of the covenant. This, put simply, is absolute nonsense. The appropriate response to the alleged social problem is not, as the Government has chosen to do, to restrict freedom of speech. There is no logical causal connection. An appropriate response would be to toughen up laws relating to the disclosure of political donations and to tighten our criminal laws relating to bribery and corruption. Just last night in this chamber the Govfor ernment chose to reject comprehensive the amendments that I moved to a Bill deto insert new provisions into the Crimes Act dealing with bribery and corruption. Why? Perhaps, in light of the evidence from the Western Australian Royal Commission into Activities of but these Government and Other Matters, it was are too interested in looking after its Australian Labor Party mates. But, for whatever of reason, another opportunity to ensure that we have effective laws to deal with bribery and corruption was swept away by this Government. For the Government to argue its case properly it must demonstrate that the restriction on freedom of speech is, firstly, based on a permissible ground of limitation; secondly, pursuing a legitimate objective; thirdly, in response to a pressing social need; and, fourthly, necessary and proportionate to the objective pursued. Quite simply, the Government has failed to produce any real evidence in support of its claims. The Human Rights Commissioner has flatly rejected the Government's case. The Government responded to Mr Burdekin's opinions. As I recall, on 9 May Mr Burdekin wrote a detailed examination of the principles or proposals that he understood and indicated that they were contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. On that occasion-on 9 May-after viewing and reading the Bill he wrote to the Attorney-General and, as I recall, on 20 May he wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services, with a copy to the Attorney-General, in which he confirmed that this was his view. What did the Government do? It reached into the bowels of the Attorney General's Department. With the greatest respect to the officer concerned, a relatively junior officer concerned, I point out to the House that asking the Attorney General's Department to advise on international law is tantamount to asking it to advise on the breeding habits of the gnat. It is not its responsibility. The administrative arrangements rest treaties with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for obvious reasons-that a major feature of public international law flowing from those treaties for the recognition of States clearly ought to rest with the Department of Foreign Affairs. But to try to get some opinion somewhere, this Government reached into the Attorney-General's Department, choosing to ignore Mr Burdekin's advice, notwithstanding the undertaking given to the House by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last week that hc would review the matter should Mr Burdekin decide that it was against the International Covenant referred to. The Prime Minister just dismissed that undertaking given to this Parliament, yet again misleading it. The Government, having reached into its own Department, claims that it has advice to support its case. The Government says that the advice tendered to it by the Attorney-General's Department supports its case. That ad vice has been tabled and, putting it mildly, that advice is equivocal and is certainly unconvincing. Despite the rhetoric in here, it simply does not support the Government's position, albeit that that may have been the intent of the Government when it sought advice from the Department. The advice given to the Attorney-General's Department simply says: On the issues of necessity and proportionality there is essentially a difference of view. Mr Burdekin says that he has considered the material relied upon by Government but ultimately is not convinced that the particular response is justified. This difference cannot be resolved on the basis of legal argument alone . . . The advice goes on to say that national governments in this arena have a degree of discretion, and that an international body might be reluctant to 'question a national legislative decision that is taken in good faith'. A grave doubt arises about whether this measure has been taken in good faith. It is true that national governments have some discretion in this areaof course, that is true-but that discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the relevant international treaty and the rights contained within that instrument. In any event, the Government's advice does not say that the proposed ban is consistent with international law. In any event, the Government's advice does not say that the proposed ban is consistent with international law. It does not say it because it cannot say it. That is why its advice is equivocal, and it is misleading for the Government to suggest that the advice supports its position. It is one more example of the Government's deceitful conduct. That is the matter of international law. I turn now to the question of the position under our Constitution. It is fairly relevant, bearing in mind the probable re-election of the Greiner Government, bearing in mind that the retiring Attorneypatible General said unequivocally that that Govtion 92. ernment would chalJenge this legislation on constitutional grounds should it pass into law. The first question, when considering the element of constitutionality, is whether the proposed ban represents a law with respect to the broadcasting power conthe tained in section 51 (v) of the Constitubeen tion. Section 51 (v) gives Commonwealth power to legislate so that it can regulate the provision of broadcastever, ing services. It must be questionable whether the Commonwealth has power to I prohibit the provision of such services, for this would be patently inconsistent the with the object of the broadcasting The object is to give power to broadcast, not power to prohibit broadcasting. Even assuming that, prima facie, this ban docs come within the broadcasting powerconsider notwithstanding what I have just saidBill express and implied constitutional printising. ciples would render it invalid. Derived from the Federal nature of the Constitution is an implied limitation Commonwealth powers, which is someEqual times referred to as the 'implied prohibitabled tion doctrine'. As Sir Anthony Mason once said, the implied prohibition doctrine phasised, means: . . . that the Commonwealth cannot in the exercise of its powers discrimi nate against out"" the States so as to impose some special burden or disability upon them (and cannot) inaffairs. hibit or impair the continued existence of these States or their capacity to function. The extension of the proposed ban to conduct of State and local government elections would fall foul of this prohibibeing tion. We must also bear in mind that it is the right of the States to participate Federal elections. The proposed ban would prevent States from doing this and, this reason, would be struck down by the implied prohibition doctrine. By section 92 of the Constitution, furthermore, it provided that: . . . trade, commerce and intercourse among States . . . shall be absolutely free. The High Court on a number of occasions has indicated the outright prohibition interstate intercourse would not be comwith the guarantee given in secIn Federal elections, the broadcasting of political advertisements transcends State boundaries. The relevance of section 92 to the freedom of the press will, in the near future, be determined in the context of proceedings that are presently before High Court. Those proceedings have adjourned so that the parties may the present arguments about the application of section 92. It has been reported, howthat during the course of argument Mr Justice MCHugh said: must say it has always seemed to me that if there is any guarantee of freedom of speech in Australian Constitution, it is basically to be power. found in those words in section 92. Put simply, this Bill is fundamentally flawed, ill conceived and ill considered. It is riddled with loopholes. I turn now to a couple of the anomalies in the relating to the ban on political adverMany of the problematical aspects of the proposed ban have been canvassed in advice given by Mr Burdekin, the on Commissioner for Human Rights and Opportunity. That advice has been in the House and I will not go over the same matters. What needs to be emhowever, is that the Bill is clearly designed to favour an incumbent government and to discriminate against other or""single persons and groups-not just political parties-from participating in public For example, the Bill exempts advertising for so-called government goods and the services. Honourable members will be aware of the television advertisement shown at the moment which promotes the alleged virtues of the training in guarantee levy scheme and also makes specific reference to the alleged commitfor ment of the Hawke Labor Government to improving the skills of Australia's work force. Quite clearly, that advertisement is contains political matter but nonetheless would be exempt under the Bill. Who will the benefit from the exemption? The Labor Government. I want to stress that again. Those opof posite are going to ban any form of advertising on any issue that relates to political comment, not just during an election campaign but for ever and a day, because it might affeet an eleetion in the future. But here in a newspaper-the newspaper advertisement is not going to be banned-is an example of what can be done, and is done: the 'Priority One' campaign. Do honourable members remember it? Down at the bottom, the advertisement has a photograph of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), with his signature. It is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money. It is not the Prime Minister's money. It is not Ministers' money. It is the people's money-the very same people who have to pay for these advertisements, which are communicated electronically. The people have to pay for them. Those advertisements will be permitted, advocating what the Government has done, defending what the Government has done, and propagating what the Government has done. Glory be, this is Australia. I am talking about. The only mob that will be allowed .to do it, at no expense to itself, but to the taxpayers, will be the incumbent government. It is outrageous, to put it mildly. It is the most disgraceful piece of legislation that has been introdueed in my 25 and a bit years in this Parliament-to deny any citizen the right to advertise, to propagate a viewpoint on an issue political"" but to permit a government to have the right to propagate its own views at a eost to the taxpayer. If the Government had said to people six months ago that this would be the form of legislation in this country, people would not have believed it. Another example is the extension of the proposed ban to third parties such as eharities. A lot of us in the House recently would have received a knock on the door from the Salvation Army for its Red Shield Appeal and would have donated some money. The Salvation Army has been running an advertisement for the Red Shield Appeal. We know what the Salvation Army did; we saw it on television. It emphasised the harsh suffering in the Australian eommunity brought about by the recession-the recession we had to have. It did so justifiably, because of the extraordinarily good work it does. If this Bill becomes law, advertisements of that type would be absolutely prohibited because the Bill outlaws any reference to or discussion of an issue which may be relevant to an eleetion which 'might' be held in the future. The number one issue is the Government's mismanagement of the eeonomy. The Salvation Army launched an appeal because of the suffering and the plight of countless thousands of people in Australia today. Because there is a reference to the state of the economy, the advertisement would be out under the proposed legislation. Those opposite sit there, prepared to support legislation sueh as this, and claim that they are demoerats-not demoerats as a party, but supporters of democracy. I conclude as I began. This is disgraceful legislation, one part of which demolishes freedom of expression, while the other deals imperfectly and inequitably with the matter of disclosure. The chilling thing, the abhorrent thing, is that it is happening in our country of Australia, and sueh tainted legislation is introduced by a government whose hypocrisy is exceeded only by its deceit. It ,is legislation that ought to be rejected. I move: That all words after 'That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the Bill bc withdrawn, and the provisions it contains be redrafted into two separate Bills, to provide respectively for: (1) one Bill relating to the fair and equitable disclosure of the income, expenditure and debts of, and gifts to, registered political parties, which the House will support after appropriate amendment of the provisions as currently drafted; and (2) one Bill relating to the prohibition of the broadcasting of political advertisements, which the House will comprehensively reject"".",118
194,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,Order! Is the amendment seconded? Dr Kemp-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,122
195,Mr LEE,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"I would first of all like to address a few comments to the honourable member for Kooyong  he ranted and raved against advertising by the Federal Government and he highlighted the Priority One program. I thought it was a bit unfortunate that he did not extend this condemnation to the recent numerous television advertising campaigns of the Greiner Government in New South Wales, which had no hesitation in spending $50m of New South Wales taxpayers' money on its government advertising campaign. The honourable member for Kooyong seems to have a bit of a blind spot there, but I am sure that he will address that in the future. I would also draw to his attention that, while he was Leader of the Opposition, a former Minister for Education, Senator Susan Ryan, was unable to distribute some government literature because the Australian Electoral Commission ruled that that was political material under the definition of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. So to suggest that government advertising or government literature will be exempted by these provisions is just plain wrong. It has already been demonstrated by the facts in past elections. In the Commonwealth Electoral Act there is a definition of what is a political advertisement. If a political advertisement is broadcast, those who appear in it and those who authorise it have to be shown. The advertisements for the Red Shield Appeal or St Vincent de Paul or any other charity do not have to have those authorisations because they are not political material. That is how one can tell which type of advertisement will be affected by this proposal. Advertisements by charities do not require authorisation, so advertisements by charities will not be affected by this legislation. It is very important that we understand what is involved in this proposal. The legislation will force full disclosure gifts and donations to political parties. It will require them to undergo spot audits to ensure that they are complying with this obligation. In addition, it will ban political commercials on radio and television. With the royal commissions in Western Australia and Tasmania and the reports by Commissioner Fitzgerald and Justice Roden in New South Wales from the Independent Commission Against Corruption (lCAC) , I can think of no single measure which is better timed to strengthen democracy and turn parties and candidates back from the current, inevitable drift to political corruption. This is not the first time that this Parliament, or any parliament in Australia, has had a chance to vote to force political parties to disclose where their donations are coming from. In fact, it was when the honourable member for Kooyong was a member of an Opposition in the old Parliament House that the Minister then responsible for electoral matters, Fred Daly, introduced the first proposal to the Australian national Parliament to require full disclosure of political donations. What did the conservative parties do in 1974 and 1975? They blocked disclosure in the Senate, where they had the numbers; they used their numbers in the Senate to ensure that Fred Daly's legislation in the Whitlam years did not force the political parties t'1 disclose where all the funds were coming from. What happened in New South Wales when Neville Wran brought in the first legislation anywhere in Australia to require disclosure of donations? When John Dowd was, I think, in those days, the Leader of the Opposition in that State, the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales fought disclosure tooth and nail. What happened in this Parliament when Mick Young had responsibility in the Hawke Government to require disclosure of donations and introduced the first legislation requiring disclosure at the Federal level? In fact, it was when the honourable member for Kooyong was the Leader of the Opposition; and he opposed the legislation for disc10sure that was introduced of all in 1983 and 1984. I had the honour to chair the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters when we also recommended in 1989 that there be full disclosure. What was the Opposition's reaction then? The Deputy Chairman of our Committee, Senator Jim Short, now the shadow Minister for finance, made the following statement on behalf of the Opposition: the right to make a secret donation to a political party is as important as the right to a secret vote. That was the Opposition's position on the disclosure of donations: that it should remain secret and it was a basic human right for a company or a rich individual to make secret donations to parties and candidates. Of course, we now have the ridiculous joke of the current Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) trying to pretend that those opposite have changed their mindthe leopard has changed its spots. The people who have always proposed disclosure have suddcnly realised that, yes, they think disclosure is a good thing. We will see how thcy vote later tonight. It is important that we understand why disclosure is necessary. Commissioner Fitzgerald made the following statement in his report: Evidence before the Commission indicates that there is an urgent need to consider establishing public register of political donations. Lack a register has given rise to community suspicion and lack of confidence in the political process. He listed endless examples of businesses making donations to the National Party in Queensland, just by coincidence a day or so before thcy were awarded major construction contracts. We also had the example, which Commissioner Fitzgerald listed, of a mysterious, unnamed Asian businessman leaving a six-figure sum of money in a brown paper bag with the eration; Secretary to the Premier. So it is no wonthey der Commissioner Fitzgerald said that was needed. We have the example of Justice Roden in New South Wales from the ICAC making the following statement in his report on north coast land developments: So long as substantial donations can be made political parties or candidates without disclosure, they can be used to purchase influence. The law that allows secret political donations, creates ditions conducive to corrupt conduct. I agree completely. But, of course, the Liberals have always said that they are different and that they have a code of conduct which means that the politicians never know who is donating to the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition says that that is true. I might remind him of the second last Liberal Prime Minister, Sir Billy MCMahon. If he goes back to Oakes and Solomon's The Making of an Australian Prime Minister, on page 123 he will find the following quote-a report on how Sir Billy MCMahon raised his funds in 1972: By October MCMahon felt he had to do something to get the general fundraising effort oft' the ground. He used the telephone extensively,and in a week he had collected $270,000, including one cheque for $90,000. That is the second last Liberal Prime Minister: a cheque for $90,000. One can imagine how much that would be worth in today's money. We have had it exposed at the Tasmanian Royal Commission into an Attempt a to Bribe a Member of the House of Asof such sembly and Other Matters that Robin Gray had a massive sum of money in a drawer at his home. But, of course, the Liberal politicians never know who is donating! Of course, we have had Greiner and Metherall in New South Wales admit to the Community Polling scandal at the 1988 election, when those two politicians knew that they wcre bank-rolling independents. In fact, it was Metl).erall's opthey used Greiner's office; and yet say that the politicians do not know this where the money is coming from. It is just a joke! The important reason for the Liberal position on this issue is that it is not good enough simply to require disclosure, as to the Liberals would have us believe. They say that, if full disclosure is forced, politconical advertising does not have to be banned. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a graph which shows why I be-, lieve this is necessary. Leave granted. The graph read as followsBroadcasting Expenditure Reported By Political Parties, Candidates and Third Parties E 'i ..,. 1.5",122
196,Mr LEE,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"This table demonstrates that the costs of radio and television advertising by political parties is virtually doubling at each election. In 1984 it cost $4m; in 1987, $9m; and at the last election, $17m. If there is no change in the exploding cost of political advertising, then frankly we will see all parties in all States dependent on large corporations and wealthy individuals. It will mean that public policy will be determined by auction, not by what is right or wrong. We only need to look at the United States or Japan to see that the votes of congressmen and politicians can be bought on important issues, and that is not the way I think this country should go. Ultimately, we have two choices: we can either limit the expenditure of political parties or we can enforce the ban. The United States has tried to place limits on expenditure of political parties, and that simply means that all the parties set up front organisations and political action committees to circumvent the limits. Even in this country we used to have limits on how much candidates could spend on campaigns for the House of Representatives and the Senate, and almost every candidate breached the limits without being prosecuted. So limits on expenditure do not work. The only way we can overcome the risk of the political parties becoming dependent on large donations from companies and wealthy individuals is to overcome the thing that is causing the massive increase in the cost of elections; that is, the cost of radio and television advertising. The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that the ban on radio and television advertising is undemocratic and totalitarian, and he would have us believe that a suggestion of free time on radio and television would be even worse. I see that the honourable member for lndi agrees. How many other countries have had to take action in this area? In the United Kingdom there are no paid advertisements; in the Netherlands there are no flection paid as; in Japan, France, Denmark, Austria and Israel there are no paid as; and in Norway and Sweden there are no paid as. So how can the Opposition have us believe that none of these countries are democratic or that they are totalitarian. One just cannot respond to that. If the price of minimising corruption from eroding the integrity of Australia's political parties is to lose as for whingeing Wendy or to lose as that display blood flowing down the front of a television screen or to lose as that say that the Labor Party is the same as the Communist Party, then frankly that is a price that I am prepared to pay because, in fact, I believe that will raise the standard of political debate in this country. These measures provide for no restriction on news; no restriction on current affairs programs; and no restriction on talkback radio. In fact, the only thing that will be impeded or restricted is not freedom of speech, but the threat of corruption to all of our politic parties in this country.",125
197,Dr HEWSON,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"It is a sad but true comment that it has become a hallmark of the Hawke Government and a hallmark of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that they put their own political survival ahead of the national interest and ahead of the interests of all Australians; I should say most Australians-they look after one or two mates. If we want to go back over the eight years of the history of this Government, two things will come out very clearly about its performance. Firstly, it can be bought - and we have no better example of that than of the Prime Minister changing the gold tax policy in the midst of a lunch in Perth in the run up to the 1987 election. Both Lauric Connell and Alan Bond have said that they received guarantees in relation to a three-year commitment not to introduce a gold tax which was not, up until that time, publicly announced Australian Labor Party policy and, at that lunch, the Labor Party raised nearly $lm. So thcrc should be no doubt, firstly, that the Government can be bought. Secondly, there should be no doubt that this Government will stoop to any level and sacrifice any interests for the sake of its own survival-and there have been dozens and dozens of examples of the extent to which this Prime Minister and his Government have stooped just to buy their way back into government. We have had a whole host of examples of where they have done deals with various groups to block developments like Coronation Hill or Wesley Vale simply to buy the votes of particular groups to get themselves back in power; or they have stalled the whole process of reform, whether it is waterfront or transport or shipping or government sector or tax or privatisation-it does not matter what it is; they have done deals to buy votes to get themselves back into Government. But this Bill is the absolute daddy of them all in terms of stooping low in order to try to ensure their political survival. If they have to sacrifice something as basic as the free speech in this country, 'Well, too bad; tough luck' they say. 'Our survival is much more important than free speech. We will burn anything or anybody for the sake of staying in power'. They forget that many Australians have fought and died over the vears in theatres of war to defend the basic principles of our democratic system, to defend the basic features of our way of life in Australia. But the Prime Minister could not care less. Hc is prepared to sacrifice their efforts, the basic principle of free speeeh simply to try to ensure his own survival. He does not care and thcre is no better example of that than this Bill, which is just a stunt. It is not a genuine attempt to do anything about disclosure. It is basically a Bill that attacks free speech by seeking to put a ban on political advertising, and he has tacked some disclosure elements on the end. But if hc was genuine in raising the issue of disclosure, then he would split the Bill. He would be happy to put the two itcms in two separate pieces of legislation so that they can be assessed on their merits. They are two quite distinct issues, two quite unrelated issues, and they should be dealt with in two separate pieces of legislation. We then would have absolutely no trouble voting overwhelmingly against the ad ban and making every effort a genuine effort to ensure that, in this country, we have full, fair and equitable disclosure. But the Prime Minister is not the slightest bit interested in a genuine exercise. It is a stunt. It is a political stunt to try to make our life difficult at the next election. He knows that his Party is not going to be able to raise any money going into the next elcction. He knows that we are going to run a multitude of as reminding people about the consequences of the recession that we had to have. So he goes to this miserable extent of putting up a stunt with this multifaceted piece of legislation in an attempt to impose the most hardship he can in the most inequitable way on us going into the next election. There is no better source for this than one of his own senior Cabinet colleagues who, I am told, was prepared to dissociate himself from this Bill when he passed on to us a comment that the Prime Minister made when he and his Government decided on this Bill as a matter of principle, and that was that, 'We'll give the kid a licking with this one'. The whole idea is to make my life and Opposition members' lives as diflicult as possible. To the credit of that senior colleague he was prepared to dissociate himself from what he knows is fundamentally wrong-the attempt to limit free speech in this country. Seven weeks ago, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and I gave the Prime Minister the issue of disclosure on a platter. We went through the processes in our party rooms to get an agreement to support full, fair and equitable disclosure. We put behind us 40 years of policy at least in terms of both our parties, and we made a very genuine attempt to raise that issue and support the moves of the Government on that issue if they were to be genuine. I remember the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) standing over here, chanting and saying, 'Here's a leadership test for you; here's a way to test your bona fides'-and I remember how decisively we rolled him that afternoon when we announced that decision a few minutes later, that we were prepared to go and were very genuine about going ahead with full, fair and equitable disclosure. But the Prime Minister was not prepared to take that genuine offer. The Prime Minister is only prepared, as I say, to stupid political games. He puts principle aside and he plays partisan politics. He will do anything to try to ensure his own survival. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what annoys me as an individual more than anything else? The Prime Minister parades around this place and has done so on many occasions seeking bipartisanship, calling for bipartisanship. We have given bipartisanship in times of major significance to this country, and we will continue to give bipartisanship if he is prepared to get on and govern this country the way it is to be governed. But when we offer it in a very genuine sense on the issue of disclosure,' he turns up his nose and walks away because he is not interested. He runs around right at the present time, for example, trying to get bipartisanship on our approach to Aboriginal reconciliation. We have come a long way in giving him that support. Yet, when it comes to the issue of full, fair and equitable disclosure and we have offered our bona fides in that respect as well, he his back and walks away. In the Gulf war, we provided the lead; we made it easy; we established the sort of commitment that this country ought to make-the hardest decision any government has to make. We avoided every opportunity that was there to score cheap political points, to force a vote, when we knew his own party was fundamentally divided on the issue of the support for the Gulf war. When the Left and part of the Centre Left would have voted against it, we refused to play partisan politics on that issue, and we gave the Prime Minister absolute support. Yet, on an issue which is so fundamental as free speech or an issue that is so fundamental as full, fair and equitable disclosure, he turns his back and walks away. He reverts to type and rejects the issue of principle. Our Prime Minister has absolutely no principles, and he demonstrates that every day. He has no sincerity. It is a very sad comment, but I am afraid he has now lost any sense of what is right. The only thing he thinks is right is what has to be done to ensure his own political survival. We play have no better example of that than how lightly he takes the issue of free speech, one of the most cherished freedoms of our democracy. He is prepared to sacrifice it for the sake of his own political survival. In doing that he is running up against the advice of every editorial writer in Australia; he is running up against the advice of all the civil liberties groups; and he is running up against the advice of a whole host of business organisations and community groups. Today I took out a list of a few of these: the Australian Chamber of Commerce; the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors; the Australian Institute of Company Directors; the Australian Mining Industry Council; the Business Council of Australia; the Confederation of Australian Industry; the Housing Industry Association; the Motor Trades Association of Australia Ltd; the National Association of Forest Industries; the National Farmers Federation; the Pharmacy Guild; the Real Estate Institute; the Retail Traders Association; the Federation of Radio turns Broadcasters; the Salvation Army; the Sydney City Mission; the Australian Institute of Fundraisers; the Australian Mining Industry Council; St Vincent de Paul; the Brotherhood of St Laurence; the Royal Blind Society; the Smith Family; Bedford Industries; the Right to Life Association; the National Roads and Motorists Association; the, Chiropractors Association; the Spastic SOCIety of Victoria-dozens and dozens of organisations that have called on this Prime Minister to listen and to stand up for free speech rather than attack it. As he has demonstrated on so many occasions, he could not care less. He does not listen to the people of Australia. How could he when he has inflicted on them the worse recession this country has seen in 60 years? Yet the Government makes light of it in here on a daily basis. Equally, the Prime Minister is doing what he is doing against the advice of his own Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, who was appointed by this Government. Thank God, Mr Burdekin has been forthright and steadfast in his opinion that this advertising ban is wrong. He has persisted with this view, despite the efforts of the Government to keep him in the dark about the Bill, to keep his unwelcome advice secret, and to pressure him into changing his view. To his credit, Brian Burdekin has stuck to his guns and he has told the Government the truth. The truth is that this Bill contravenes Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The truth is also that this Bill will discriminate against a whole host of Australians-for example, those who have hearing impairments, and there are 346,000 of them; the sight impaired, 110,000 of them; and the illiterate, and there are more than one million of them. The truth is that this Bill will take away the rights of Australians, not just the rights of political parties, to have their say on public issues. In short, and I quote Mr Burdekin on this Bill: It is so radically inconsistent with the right to freedom of expression and information as to cause the destruction of rights and therefore to be impermissible under Article 5 of the International Covenant. What does the Government do when it does not like the advice it has got persistently from Brian Burdekin, the Human Rights Commissioner-its own Human Rights Commissioner? It gets some anonymous bureaucrat in the Attorney General's Department to quibble with that advice. This is now becoming a matter of course for this Government. Remember the incident of Brian Burke and the overwhelming case that Brian Burke continuing as Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See was doing this country international damage? What did the Government do? It hid behind the advice of some bureaucrat rather than face the overwhelming amount of evidence and public opinion which suggested it was about time the Prime Minister put leadership above mateship. It hid behind bureaucratic advice in not sacking Brian Burke, and it is hiding behind bureaucratic advice now in not listening to Brian Burdekin. One can only be appalled when one thinks about our Prime Minister over the last eight years and the way in wlctJch he has strutted the international stage as the so-called champion of human rights. We hear him all the time. It does not matter where it is-China, Tibet, Kuwait, Cambodia-he struts around. Yet he is prepared in his own backyard to sacrifice the basic human right of all Australians to free speech. He does not care. He is just prepared to wipe away that basic right. He is not a man of principle. He is a man of hypocrisy, he is a man of humbug, he is a man of insincerity, he is a man of cynicism, he is a man of political opportunism, and he will do anything to look after his own hide. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that our Prime Minister and his Government have absolutely no integrity, no qualities of national leadership. They just have the instincts of a desperate political animal. The Prime Minister will override the rights of Australians to put their political views and the rights of Australians to hear and consider the views of others. It is interesting that this week the report of the Electoral Commission was released listing community and business groups which advertised in the last election campaign. The sort of people who advertised and whose freedom of expression will now be stifled are people such as the City of Knox, the CSIRO Officers Association, the Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations of New South Wales the Gippsland Road Funding Committee: the Goulburn Teachers Association, the Local Government Association of Queensland, the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, the National Council of Independent Schools Associations, the Over 50s Friendly Society, People for Fair and Open Government, the Printing and Kindred Industries Union, the Public Service Union, the Queensland Right to Life Association, Taxis Combined Services Pty Ltd, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Wilderness Society, World Vision of Australia, the World League for Protection of Animals, and a host of others. The Prime Minister is going to stifle not just the rights of those organisations but the rights of every single individual in this country. These are 'l'he people whose rights the Prime Minister is happy to sweep away for the sake of his own political ends. To their shame, one should also draw attention to the absolutely appalling and unprincipled behaviour of the Australian Democrats. These are the people who parade around this country under the slogan, 'We're going to keep the bastards honest'. When they get their chance to keep the bastards honest with this Bill, which is nothing more than a political stunt, where are the Democrats? Where are the Democrats, the champions of human rights? They walk on water when it comes to human rights, but when the first test comes, Janet Powell trips over the bar. It is an absolutely disgraceful performance on the part of the Democrats. If we look at the performance of the Democrats in the last couple of days, I think it was on Tuesday that Senator Powell put down a motion in which she referred to the Opposition's decision to oppose the disclosure provisions of the Government's legislation. As is so often the case with Janet Powell, she has not done her homework. She has not looked for the facts. The motion is directly counter to the The coalition has not decided to oppose the disclosure provisions of this legislation. We are committed, and there is overwhelming party room support for full, fair and equitable disclosure. We support the disclosure provisions of the Bill as far as they go: we just want to' see them go further and make sure they are equitable, that they strike at the union base, for example, from which this Government draws a lot of its funding. If we are going to attack the corporate sector and individuals on disclosure, attack the union movement and the advantages it enjoys. That is why we want to make amendments. We want fair and equitable and full disclosure. Equity is not a concept that anybody on the other side of this Parliament understands. The challenge is there for Janet Powell to lift her game and to stand up for a matter of principle once in her life, to demonstrate to every Australian that she can actually keep the bastards honest. They take some keeping honest, I can say that, having read this Bill. We will give Janet Powell another choice next week when the Bill is debated in the Senate. We will give Janet Powell an opportunity to move an alternative piece of disclosure legislation, to see whether she is prepared to support full, fair and equitable disclosure, which goes much further than the Government's Bill. Of course, she will parade around saying that the Democrats cannot be bought. And she is right. They cannot be bought; they are simply rented by the hour. All we have to determine in this particular circumstance is what the last hourly rental has been for them to switch their support across to the Government on this ridiculous piece of legislation. So much for the watchdogs of democracy. So much for the champions of human rights. The Australian Democrats stand as condemned for their lack of principle and their hypocrisy as do our Prime Minister and this Government. This Bill is designed to do one thing only, and that is to give the Labor Party a slim chance of winning the next election. It is designed to stop us from runfacts. ning advertisements on radio and television that are critical of the Government and draw attention to the inadequacies of this Government. It is designed to stop any attempt to remind Australians of the hardship, the very genuine hardship, that the Government has inflicted My unnecessarily on so many Australians and know, their families. It is simply designed to and save the Government's political skin. It of the decision. puts narrow political interests before the national interest. It is cynical, hypocritical and self-serving. It should be totally demned for that. My final comment is that no-one should be fooled that this muzzling of free speech is necessarily the end of the line for the Government. This Government is a long from way from the next election. We should that ask ourselves the basic question: how far will it go? On the basis of its record, I know put the matter back where I began: there is no limit to how low this Government here . . . will stoop; there is no limit to the number of basic rights and freedoms of average Australians that it will cast aside in suit of its own political survival. Prime Minister has absolutely no integthe rity. He should be totally condemned for this political stunt.",125
198,Mr MELHAM,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"Banks) (6.11 p.m.)The Leader of the Opposition (Dr HewThe son) talks about political opportunism. He oppose ought to know what it is, because he has closure practised it from the time he became sition Leader of the Opposition. He duced the 1950s era into Australia. Carthyism is alivc and well, and it is practised by the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him. He talks about principle. What did the Leader of continued: the Opposition say on Robbo's World ToThe night on 26 November 1990? Mr Beale-What did he say?",130
199,Mr MELHAM,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"This is what the into two Bills. Leader of the Opposition said to Robbo in relation to the proposed ban on elecadvertising ban. tronic political advertising. He said: I have a personal disposition against advertising. We've got to rely on advertising in the last five weeks going into the next election. We're already on a hiding to nothing. Political opportunism, all right! Where does the Leader of the Opposition stand in relation to that statement now? His views on public disclosures were refreshingly honest when he spoke to the National Press Club on 20 March 1991 and had this to say: disposition is to support disclosure and, you as long as it is done in an equitable fashion in those terms, you know, I've so far not had to comment very much on that particular item That is, until he was kneeeapped by his conParty. The very next day, 21 March 1991, he said to Maxine MCKew on ABC Radio: Well I said, on equitable basis and what I meant there is that we have been very concerned in the past about intimidation and so on that can flow disclosure and we would need to be satisfied that sort of process couldn't run its course, but my natural disposition in politics, as you in a lot of other areas, is to be open and honest and tell the truth and provide as much information as possible. I don't draw a line The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition has been given an escape hatch purin regard to political donations. He has The been kneecapped by his minders and by bureaucrats in the Liberal Party of Australia. He was exposed by Pilita Clark in the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 13 May 1991. She wrote: Federal Opposition is paving the way to the Government's legislation for full disof political donations, despite the OppoLeader's pledge to support 'full, fair and has reintroequitable' disclosure. MCThat is what we are witnessing here today. We are witnessing political opportunism and hypocrisy on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. Pilita Clark Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister yesterday urging him to split the Government's legislation-which covers disclosure of donations and a ban on political advertisingThe Opposition has vehemently opposed the This is why it was done: Dr Hewson's letter follows a bitter attack on the disclosure elements of the Bill from the New South Wales Liberal Party's senior fundraiser, Mr Bevan Bradbury, who has written to all Federal Liberal MPs urging them to oppose the measure. In his letter, which was disclosed by the Herald on Saturday, Mr Bradbury said the legislation would have a 'horrendous and immediate' impact on the flow of funds to the Liberal Party and he was 'dismayed' by the apparent acquiescence of the parliamentary wing of the party in supporting it. Dr Hewson released a statement on Saturday saying he understood Mr Bradbury's frustration, but added: ' Mr Bradbury must accept that he and the party organisation do not make the pol, icies of the parliamentary party'. But the Federal Government has so far shown no sign of separating its legislation in the way called for by Dr Hewson, which will leave the way open for the Opposition to oppose it. Such an outcome would be a great relief to those Federal Coalition MPs who strongly opposed Dr Hewson's surprise decision to support full disclosure last month despite years of Liberal Party opposition to such measures. Both the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia, State and Federal, are utterly opposed to public disclosure through donations. (Quorum formed) Is it any wonder that a quorum was called? I was about to come to the bagman for the Liberal Party. This is what Opposition members do not want to hear because they are petrified about political disclosure, which will expose them for what they are: the running dogs of the corporate sector. Mr Beale-Who is the bagman?",130
200,Mr MELHAM,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"Talk about the professional bagman-it is John Elliott. He was exposed by Peter Hartcher in the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 November. Peter Hartcher wrote: John Elliott's public performance as national president of the Liberal Party may have been clumsy, clodhopping. But in the privacy of capital confessionals, he practised the art of appropriation with unusual success. And when he departed late last month, he took his skills with him. He and his treasurer, Ron Walker, raised between $5 million and $6 million in the campaign for this year's Federal election, according to people intimate with the Liberals funding-almost double the amount the party had marshalled for the previous election. During his three years as treasurer, plus his three years as president, he presided over a flow of donations to the party of $25 million, money used to pay for three election campaigns, maintenance, and the running of the party's secretariat. That is what frightens the conservatives and that is why they oppose political disclosure legislation. That is why they were petrified when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)-the visiting professor-for sheer political opportunism, in the middle of the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government, went far beyond what the apparatchiks in the Liberal Party wanted by saying, in his politically opportunistic way, that he supported disclosure. Who was caught with his fingers in the till by the Western Australian Royal Commission? One person only! The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) was not so honourable, and when this fact came to light he sat in this House in silence. The Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia are petrified by this legislation because it will return the Parliament to the people. We will for evermore be able to elect people on the basis of something other than the size of their bank accounts. No longer will the idiot sons of the Establishment be able to rule. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), who just walked into this . chamber, does not have to worry about political donations; his family looks after him. This is the best legislation to have been introduced in this Parliament. It will create honest and open government and honourable members opposite are petrified by it.",131
201,Mr COSTELLO,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"Higgins) (6.22 p.m.)I am glad to see that the back bench of the Labor Government is here tonight listening to debate on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, a piece of legislation its members will undoubtedly regret in years to come as one of their worse decisions, one of the worse pieces of legislation to be introduced by the Hawke Government. Members opposite ought to stay here to listen to this debate, but the one person honourable members will not see in Parliament tonight is the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). No, the Prime Minister will not come into Parliament tonight to nail his colours to the mast, to stand here and say he believes in restricting freedom of speech. He will not stand in this place and say he. is one of the deniers of human rights in this country. This Bill, as is made apparent by its name-the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill-is really two Bills. It deals with two subjects-disclosure and broadcasts. It deals with two Acts-the Broadcasting Aet and the Electoral Act. There is no reason whatsoever for these two procedures to be run into onc Bill, except to deny the right of this Parliament to vote separately on the two separate issues of disclosure and of bans on political advertising. It is clear that the coalition supports political disclosure legislation. However, the coalition does not support the type of 'namby-pamby, tiggy-touch-wood, nip-and tuck, take out a wrinkle and do an uplift' disclosure legislation this Bill represents. The Opposition supports red-hot, redblooded full political disclosure, with full protection for people who want to make political donations. The Opposition wants disclosure so that third parties who give money to political parties must disclose where the money comes from-that is, third parties like the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Legacies and Gifts Ltd, the Australian trade union movement, John Curtin House Ltd and so on. The coalition wants to know where all the money comes from to ensure that it is all disclosed, that it is all treated equally and that there is protection for all donors. The coalition wants to ensure full political disclosure. If this Bill dealt only with political disclosure, the coalition would vote for it. All Australians know that the Liberal Party supports unequivocally political disclosure. Why is political disclosure back on the agenda after so many years? It is back on the agenda because the ALP was caught red-handed evading the law by the Western Australia Royal Commission. Members of the ALP had money in briefcases, in brown paper bags, in safes and at lunches. The cmly place they did not have money was in the electoral returns. All the money was coming and going, but honourable members ought to read the electoral returns for the Western Australia division and the Federal ALP from 1987 onwards. None of the $950,000 raised on 15 June 1987 appears there. Political disclosure is back on the agenda because this Government was caught red-handed. If political disclosure were all that was dealt with by this Bill, the coalition would vote for it. However, the Government has tried to tack onto disclosure the question of broadcasting and to prohibit political broadcasting in a Bill in conjunction with disclosure. This , Parliament is the inheritor of a long tradition. The Parliament of this country and its predecessor parliaments have for centuries fought for rights; this is a people's House and it ought to be concerned about the rights of people. Tonight this Parliament is debating legislation proposed by this crooked and corrupt Government, legislation which will take away people's rights. That legislation will extinguish the right to disseminate political information by advertising, to receive political advertising and to make sure that no radio or television station in this country has the right to carry any of that material. This legislation is not just about a ban on political advertising and political information through advertising during eJection campaigns. It is a proposal to ban forever from every television station and radio station in this country the dissemination of political information by way of advcrtisement. The legislation will not ban it just for the ALP, the Liberal Party of Australia or the Australian Democrats; it will also ban it for the Returned Services League of Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Brotherhood of St Laurencc, the Salvation Army, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Mining Industry Council. It will ban political advertising by anyone in this country. This is a blatant attack on the freedom of expression and on political rights. Honourable members will not find me or any member of the coalition voting for this sort of attack on political rights. They will not find the coalition showing complicity in the extinguishment of the right to political expression, nor will they find the coalition compromising on the rights of freedom of speech and expression. They will find the deniers of rights-the Government-yet again hopping into the rights of individual Australians. The party which came into existence on a trade union base, which supports the principles of the closed shop and compulsory unionism and which practices a systematic denial of human rights in this country through those two principles is now attacking freedom of political speech. When the Prime Minister talks about human rights he can roar like a lion on South Africa and he can weep about human rights in China, but he cannot see a human right for the sake of looking whcn it comes to Australia. When this Government attempts to stampede the rights of all Australians by denying them the right to disseminate views by political adverti sing, the Prime Minister leads the herd like a rogue bull. He does not even have the decency to come into this House to justify his position. This is not only an attack on frecdom of expression and on political rights, but it is also an attack for the most base of political reasons-a temporary advantage in relation to electoral prospects. This Government is petrified about footage on television at the time of the next election showing the Prime Minister, Laurie Connell and Alan Bond out fishing together; it is petrified of footage of the Prime ister celebrating excesses with his spivvy mates; it is petrified about scenes of unemployed people-people put out of work by the recession we had to have-it is petrified of footage seen when 5,000 people queue up outside a Melbourne store for a job or when there are 200 applications for 20 jobs advertised at MCDonalds, and it is petrified of the images that will bring home to Australians all its failures, its excesses and its dirty little records on the econ0!V-y and on human rights. For the basest of political motives, the Hawke Government is prepared to tear up the basic rights of Australians to freedom of political expression. This Government can sing and dance about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its commitment to that. The Government even set up the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to look at that covenant and to ensure that human rights are not trampled on in Australia. When the test comes and the Government's own Human Rights Commission looks at this legislation, it will say to the Government, 'This legislation is a complete failure'-and yet the Government has proceeded with this Bill. The Government proposes to ignore the advice of its own Commission; to ignore what its expert Commissioner has said about this international covenant; to ignore that covenant, which is there to ensure that politicians do not get carried away with extinguishing political and human rights; and to proceed for the basest of motives. Make no mistake about it-rights are taken away bit by bit, block by block, by stealth, until one day we wake up and our rights do not exist any more. The time to start complaining about the denial of human rights is when it starts, because by the time it finishes it is too late to do any complaining. This is deceitful legislation. In one part it seeks to enlarge rights by ensuring that there is disclosure as to who is funding political parties. On the other side, it extinguishes them by saying, 'You can't know what the policies of those political parties are'. It is base legislation. It is Minlegislation proposed by a political party that is bankrupt politically and bankrupt financially. What is worse, it is dangerous legislation. It is one more step towards depriving Australians of fundamental rights that they have enjoyed and have the right to enjoy into the future long after this discredited Government is gone.",131
202,Unknown,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,Sitting suspended from 6.32 to 8 p.m.,133
203,Mr SNOWDON,POLITICAL DISCLOSURES BILL,"Northern Territory) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.00 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to support the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. There are two aspects to this legislation, and if time permits I want to address both. I shall deal with the question of political advertising first. Whilst I understand some of the concerns that have been expressed by some sections of the community, I refute absolutely the argument that has been posited by members of the Opposition. To assert that free speech equals the ability to pay for advertising on a television station is, of course, absurd. In looking at the fundamentals of democracy in this country, or indeed any reasonable notion of democracy, the question of whether or not one has equal access to the media is something more than whether or not one can ring up a television station and ask it to run an advertisement. It comes down to whether or not one has the capacity to pay for advertising. I want to refer briefly to just one political campaign, and probably one of the most despicable. It was run not by a political party but by an industry group, against the most dispossessed and disadvantaged group of Australia's people. I am referring to the campaign waged in 1984 by the Western Australia Chamber of Mines against land rights. To put it mildly, it was a malicious, disgusting, racist and divisive campaign, based on the idea that the way to win support in our community was to set one Australian against the other. The Opposition might laud the principles-and no doubt it does-of the Western Australia Chamber of Mines for using its financial resources in such a way. In the book that Ronald Libby wrote referring to the politics of mining and Aboriginal land rights in Australia he mentioned Duncan Bell, the architect of this malicious campaign, as follows: [He] emphasised that the proposed new nal land rights legislation underscored the gency of the industry becoming an 'active protagonist' in political debates affecting its future. Over 15 weeks, the chamber ran teleAustralians vision advertisements, three times a day, morning, afternoon and during prime time viewing. You would recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a resident of Western Ausat tralia, the graphic advertisement, the graphic divisive, malicious, racist ad, by the Western Australia Chamber of of Mines, to attack Aboriginal Australiansdemocratic and the Opposition would defend thatl I ask the Shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), whether he would defend that campaign. Would he defend the right of Aboriginal people to protect themselves against this drivel? What was done by the Opposition? What was done by the Liberal Party to assist Aboriginal Australians in their fight for land rights? What was done to get them to call off the dogs? Not a thing, because fundamentally they accepted that the racism in this campaign was acceptable. I do not believe it is acceptable and I do not believe that a democracy can allow that sort of thing to happen. There was absolutely no way that any Western Australian Aboriginal could defend himself against that malicious campaign. I now know that threats have been made by the mining industry to run a similar campaign in Queensland if the Government decides not to proceed with mining at Coronation Hill. I ask the House: what sort of basis for a democracy is that, that those people in the community with the most money and with the capacity to use all the resources available to a large multinational corporation can wage a war through the media by running advertisements against a minority group in the community, whether it be an Aboriginal group or a poor group that lives in Redfern or Woolloomooloo? It does not matter; the principle is the same. To assert that advertising on television equals democracy is nonsense. What we have to be about is building a bigger and better Australia, not a divided Australia, not one which the Western AborigiAustralia Chamber of Mines and, no urdoubt, some of its friends in the Liberal Party would want, but one which is fair and one which recognises the rights of all to have a fair go-and that means being able to participate in the decision making process and to put their view forward on an equal basis. It is not all acceptable for the Opposition to posit the view that it has, the scurrilous run view that somehow or other the banning that sort of advertising undermines the process. It is quite the opposite. I now turn to the issue of political funding. Here we see the gross hypocrisy of the conservatives in this country. Some weeks ago in the Legislative Assembly the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, when answering a question from Neil Bell, the member for MACDonnell, responded by asking why the Northern Territory would have disclosure legislation when his party did not agree with it. Essentially, that is what he said. Why does it not agree with it? The Country Liberal Party (CLP) in the Northern Territory has flatly refused to support disclosure legislation, even in principle. However, when considering the CLP's non-existent record of open and honest government, such a stand is par for the course. As late as last week, documents were seized by the Electoral Commission in a raid on a Darwin bank. Other material was gathered at the Australian Securities Commission offices. Electoral Commission officers were undertaking an investigation arising out of returns furnished by the CLP following the last Federal election. Oddly, the Executive  week after only nine months in the job, after the Electoral Commission seized party records. Why did he move from a job where he was being paid in excess of $100,000, to go and live in Queensland and work for Beanland? One might ask Mr Kidman. It was because he was absolutely ashamed of what the CLP has done in terms of this stand on disclosure lation and where it has got its money from. Associated with this debacle has been the revelation that the Country Liberal Party's Education Minister, and Chief Ministerial hopeful, Shane Stone, was a Director and Secretary of CLP Gifts and Charities, a CLP company which is a recipient of sizeable sums of money from another CLP company, Carpentaria. Company extracts show how Shane Stone was listed as a Director of CLP Gifts and Charities until late February this year. and a Robert Brough resigned on the same day. The extracts, dated 1 June, list Shane Stone as Secretary. We have his word that he resigned his position as Secretary also at about that time. The fact remains that Shane Stone was a Minister of the Crown at the same time that he was an agent of the CLP. The Northern Territory does not have any laws requiring disclosure of campaign donations for Territory campaigns which, of course, are more expensive than the normal campaigns. We do not know who donated to the CLP election machine at the time when Shane Stone was in charge. Further, we do not know what promises were made, by which Ministers, or to whom. The qucstion of financial donations to the Country Liberal Party has been the subject of intense scrutiny ever since the 1984 Federal election campaign. This, you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, was the first election campaign that was fought under the public funding disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The returns from the campaign were the first steps in a continuing attempt to expose the secret funding machinations of the Country Liberal Party. From 1984 returns it was found that Carpentaria Pty Ltd had given the Party a donation of $30,000 to help the bid of former Chief Minister Paul Everingham to enter Federal politics. Upon chccking it was found that Carpentaria was a non-trading company controlled by senior officers of the CLP. The Electoral Commission asked the legisCLP to explain how a non-trading company could obtain such an amount. The CLP has consistently refused to furnish any documents showing the original donors of the money. The then CLP President, Graemc Lewis, was charged by summons with failing to comply with a notice to furnish the relevant documents. The offence against Mr Lcwis was proven and no conviction was recorded against him, but we still do not know where the money came from. Returns submitted by the Party after He the 1987 election continued the Carpentaria saga. They showed that Carpentaria had donated a total of $290,000 to the CLP in the run-up to the campaign. The returns submitted after last year's poll show that Carpentaria and another company I haye already mentioned, CLP Gifts and Legacies, donated $180,000 to the campaign. The latest figures take the grand total of donations unaccounted for to half a million dollars. The CLP refuses to identify publicly the original donors of that money. No wonder it is absolutely opposed to this proposal for disclosures. We still do not know where the money came from; what deals were done; by whom and with whom; and what deals were done by the Northern Territory Government. This legislation was designed to expose such secret machinations as those indulged in by the CLP. It will remove the rock the County Liberal Party and others like it hide under to avoid accountability to the electorate. I support the legislation and I am sure it will go through. I hope that the honourable member for Bass will ask his colleagues at least to look at the merits of the argument about democracy and campaigning in terms of public advertising.

The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is an absolute blight upon the democracy of this nation. No-one could have said it better tonight than the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan). He went on national television and said of his leader, 'This man has betrayed the Australian people'. That is not a member from this side of the House, it is a member from the other side. It is an extraordinary state of events. A secret agreement has now been revealed between the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Sir Peter Abeles and the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Kelty. The agreement was that during this term the Prime Minister would step down from the prime ministership and hand over to the Deputy Prime Minister. Mr Simmons- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The debate tonight is on a very specific piece of legislation. I suggest that the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill has very little to do with the comments being made by the current speaker.",136
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I am confident that the honourable member for Bass will direct his remarks to the legislation. I call the honourable member for Bass.,137
206,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"The instability within the Government has led to this Bill. The absolute instability and uncertainty about whether the Government is able to win the next election has led to this terrible piece of legislation that we have here today. I will quote an article from this morning's Sydney Morning Herald. There have been hundreds of editorials about this crazy Bill that we are now debating. The article states: The Opposition is fighting to protect freedom of speech; the Opposition supports disclosure of political donations. The Government to be curbing political advertising and freedom of speech in a desperate attempt to save its own skin. What is happening around the corridors of this Parliament tonight? The Government is searching for a way to save its skin. That is what it is all about. read to the House for 60 seconds the advertisement that was broadcast on raable dio right around this country by the nations highest paid radio broadcaster, John Laws. Honourable members should listen to what he had to say. He stated: This is the campaign Bob Hawke doesn't want you to hear. This could be the last time you hear a radio announcement criticising an elected government. This could be the last time an individual has the right to speak their mind on the public airwaves. And you'll never again hear any charity stating their case and asking for your support. If the Federal Labor Government gets its way, your right to speak on radio and television, and the right of charities, industry associations, environmental groups, welfare groups, local government-anyone with a mcssage of support, help or criticism-will be taken away. The banning of advertising which even slightly resembles political messages means you're gagged. This is not about money. This is not about corruption. It's about free speech and political control. Senator Nick Bolkus calls this 'sanitising' the electoral system. In actual fact, it's all about silencing the electorate. What this Government is concerned about in bringing forward this legislation is that. What Government members are trying to do is to make sure that when they go to the next election they deny the people from the political parties and from community groups a chance to put their case forward. We know the economy is under threat and we know - that families and businesses are hurting; but we are not going to be allowed at the next election to take those facts to the people so that they can see what is happening. Community groups are not going to be allowed to do it. That is the genesis of this Bill, and that is the reason behind it. Mr Jull-What you are saying is that will be seen Abeles has dumped Hawke.",137
207,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,I think that is true. Abeles may well have dumped Hawke. Is it not interesting that they both went up together and if we listen to-Mr Jull-He told me that he was going I will to have me scrubbed out.,137
208,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"Try to have the honourmember scrubbed out? That is terrible. As I i was about to say, two people who have worked closely together went up together and in the same week they are both going down together. That is rather interesting to watch and to listen to. As I was saying, we will not see an advertisement at the next election with Peter Duncan calling the Prime Minister for a betrayal of the Australian people. That will be banned under this legislation. That will not be allowed to be presented to the Parliament or to the people of this nation. Why? Because this Government is all about trying to save its skin. That is what this is all about. The advertisement that John Laws did was broadcast nationally. What happened with that? No sooner had it started than the Menzies by-election was called and the Electoral Commission was onto John Laws straight away saying, 'Is this a breach of the Elecernment toral Act?'.",137
209,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I advise the honourable member for Bass that it is interesting that while we are on political advertising, the sound does not seem to be working completely in the chamber. It could well be the sound reinforcement system. Honourable members have drawn that to my attention. However, if the honourable member for Bass wishes to continue-",138
210,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"Thank you for that assistance, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will keep going. The people in the community know that this proposed ban on political advertisements is anathema to democracy in this country. I could read the names of the many groups that have indicated their abhorrence and dismay at the direction in which the Government is going, but the list would go on for ever. But one interesting press release came to me during the course of preparing for this debate, from all the industry leaders in this country, the wealth generators, as follows: Australian Chamber of Commerce; Australian Federation of Construction Contractors; Australian Institute of Company Directors; Australian Mining Industry Council; Business Council of Australia; Confederation of Australian Industry; Housing Industry Association; Motor Trades Association of Australia; National Assodation of Forest Industries; National Farmers Federation; Pharmacy Guild of Australia; Real Estate Institute of Australia; and the Retail Traders Association of Australia. In a joint statement, they said that the major business and professional organisations were totally opposed to the Federal Government's proposed electronic ban on political advertising. The organisations said that the Government had constructed an unconvincing case for the ban, which is a fundamental denial of the right to free expression of views in Australia and that it is difficult to understand the Government's justification for the ban other than for short term political expediency. There we have it again: a constant theme. Every responsible industry body in this country has condemned the Govfor this legislation. Government members are revealed for what they are trying to do, to save their skins. As I said when I commenced, this Bill is being debated on the very night when members of the Government-the Deputy Prime Minister included-are now in turmoil. This Government basically is in crisis. Does the man who pretends to take the throne agree with this Bill? Mrs Crosio-Yes.",138
211,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"We have not heard from him at all. Does the Minister who is responsible for this Bill, the man who is supposed to bring it into this House and take it through, the Leader of the House, Minister Beazley, support this Bill? Mrs Crosio-Yes.",138
212,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"We remain to be convinced. When there is a change of leadership on Tuesday-and God help the Australian people if they have Keating foisted upon them, as he will just visit more pain and put his hand deeper into their pockets-will he stand by for this, too? Is he going to live with the betrayal and just be exhibited for what the rest of the Government members are-people trying to save their skins, to try to stay in power and to silence the Australian people at the next election? On the last occasion, Government members did a con with the greens. They tried to buy them. They got there with the greens' preferences and just got over the line. But this time they are going to try to shut the nation up. They are going to turn off the truth in this country. Mrs Crosio-Learn by your example.",138
213,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"They are going to turn off truth in this country, and the honourable member knows it. She is part of it. She is supposed to be in here representing democratic principles. This is a democratic house.",139
214,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Prospect should not interject, and certainly not when she is not in her normal place.",139
215,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,"Usually I am not one who speaks with such volume, but the events of tonight are quite amazing. For the Government to proceed with this Bill when the Government is in such a state is abhorrent. That is why earlier this ning I moved that this debate be adjourned. That is why there has now been a no confidence motion lodged by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), which the Leader of the House has now taken around to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), asking him to come into the chamber to take that motion tonight. The House must meet and take that no confidence motion tonight. It is right and proper that it should.",139
216,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable mcmber should not be debating another matter.,139
217,Mr SMITH,PAIRS,It is an extraordinary event when we see an honourable member stand up publicly and say that his Prime Minister has betrayed the people of this nation. It is an outrage and the motion should be brought on for debate immediately.,139
218,Dr CHARLESWORTH,PAIRS,"We are told by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) that the ethical and moral barometer for Australia is now to be John Laws. What I suggest to those opposite is that the quote we had from John Laws is patently dishonest. I indicate that, and perhaps those opposite would be interested in hearing that there are in fact very seldom absolute criteria placed on ethical questions. One might think that murder or killing is something on which there is an absolute sanction. But when we look at the cold-blooded murderers we do not judge them as the moral equivalent of someone who perhaps kills under extreme provocation. In the same way, we judge people who steal to feed their children differently from people who steal to get something they want. Indeed, this Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill has to be viewed in the context of whether or not it will improve the quality of our democracy. If those opposite disagree with that, as they may, they are capable of arguing their case. But I suggest it will improve the quality of our democracy and therefore should be supported. There are all sorts of considerations. The preamble in the eve- United Nations Charter of Human Rights says: Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. The Charter says 'equal'. When one talks about advertising, one knows that there is very little equality. I will endeavour to show that. If we talk about there being fundamental rights, some people will argue that there are inalienable and fundamental rights as the basis of our very humanness. Others argue that our rights are determined in the social context and are socially created. When we look at freedom of expression, the rule of law, the right to privacy, the right to private property or the right to have a fair trial, honourable members opposite would have to agree with me that there is a social context to those rights in which we put them. Rather than their being inalienable as a result of our humanness, they are determined in a social context. Exactly the same thing applies when one looks at free speech. It is not an absolute thing; it is a qualified thing. There is no such thing as free speech out in the community. There are laws against slander, libel,\ defamation and sedition. Indeed, in many ways advertising is one of those rights which are regulated, and it is regulated significantly. It is the height of humbug and unction for the honourable  come in here and argue the case for the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin, because the policy of those opposite is to abolish the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That Commission would not even be in existence if those opposite were in government. So for them to come into this House and to argue that they are defenders of human rights when it is clear in their policy that they want to abolish the Human Rights Commission is the height of hypocrisy, and they know it. If we look at advertising, we see that there are many ways in which it is curtailed by this Parliament. It is not possible to advertise cigarettes on television or in the media as a result of decisions and determinations made in this Parliament. This is not record breaking ground. This is consistent with what is already part of the structure. What is advertising; what is the basis of advertising? Advertising came about because people wanted to call attention to their product or service or to a personality. The town crier was the original advertiser. An advertising structure has developed over the centuries via posters, news sheets and eventually film and television. But is advertising necessarily a good thing? I would argue that in many cases it is not. Members of the Opposition try to argue that advertising is free. It is not free. They cannot argue that it is free. Advertising costs a lot of money, and not everybody can do it. You or I could not go and advertise on television tomorrow, even if we wanted to.",139
219,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,Who can't? Mr Jull-Why not?,140
220,Dr CHARLESWORTH,PAIRS,"I am not as wealthy as the honourable member. I do not have the wherewithal to do so. The honourable member for O'Connor owns a couple of pubs; he can afford it. But most of us cannot. Certainly ordinary citizens cannot afford it. Honourable' members opposite should not defend television advertising as some sort of fundamental human right, because that right does not exist and they know it does not exist. Members of the Opposition are arguing for the continuation of privilege. They have always argued for privilege and they are doing so again. Television advertising is not a fundamental right that should be defended. Television advertising certainly is not free. It has to be bought; it costs money. I am not a defender of the Australian Conservation Foundation, but during the last election campaign it spent $25,000 on advertising. The logging industry spent $1.1 m. Yet the Opposition is trying to tell me that a balanced situation prevails and that in fact there is a fair and equal balancing of opinions. There is not. We are suggesting that perhaps we need a level playing field when it comes to running our democracy. The Opposition is suggesting that privilege should have an advantage; it is saying that people who have money can have an advantage and that it will give people a free kick. I am suggesting that I do not think that that is a reasonable proposition. Why have we linked this legislation to disclosure? The answer to that is very clear. One has only to look at the words of the Chairman of the New South Wales Liberal Party's central finance committee, Mr Bevan Bradbury. In a letter which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Bradbury said: I am dismayed by the apparent acquiescence of the Parliamentary wing of our party to the idea that (subject to certain safeguards) all donors will be identified. If the proposal is implemented, it will certainly affect the Labor Party, but it will have a devastating effeet on the Liberal Party, and no Liberal Member of Parliament should be in the slightest doubt on this matter. The impact of the flow of funds to the party of legislation that requires that the identity of donors be revealed will be horrendous, and it will be immediate. Why then is the Liberal Party opposing disclosure? Why is the Liberal Party opposing this legislation? The legislation will not give us an advantage. The suggestion that has been made by the honourable member for Kooyong and others on the opposite side-that third parties will be excluded-is not true. The suggestion that the Government will be advertising when others are not able to is not true. This legislation provides everybody with the same chance. If honourable members want to get out and meet people, have public meetings in their electorates, write letters and make contact with people, then they are able to put their viewpoint in those ways-not in a five-second, 1S-second or 30-second television grab which is trivial and does not go to the substance of the issues. They can contact people in a real way and talk about policies. This is one of the reasons why it is defensible that the change entailed in this legislation should be carried forward. I suggest that there are a number of options open that entail limiting the amount of expenditure available. One such option was considered by the Joint Standing Committee on El-ctoral Matters, although it was decided' that it is too easy to avoid providing limits for expenditure. This has been the experience in the United States; it has been the experience here in Australia. One has only to look at community polling, as exemplified by what happened in New South Wales, to understand that that is the case. Another option, of course, is to provide free time. It is an option that has been taken up in a number of other countries-countries that we would hardly say arc undemocratic. Again it is something that is opposed by those on the other side In my view, the best and fairest way is to prohibit advertising. I believe the period Bill. between election campaigns perhaps should be exempted, and maybe that needs to be given consideration. That is my personal view, and it differs somewhat from the legislation. But this legislation gives no advantage to either side of politics, no advantage to largcr political parties cumbents. It is the change which provides the most even playing field in this circumstance. One could hardly argue with the efficacy of the disclosure provisions, with random audits and open public access to donations. One has only to look at the history of disclosure legislation-introduced by us in this place, introduced in New South Wales by the Wran Government, introduced in the Western Australian Parliament-that has been defeated by the conservative side of politics to know that the Opposition is being driven here by self-interest, Everybody in Australia understands that we do not have a perfect system, but to have the very best system we have to have freedom of the press. Freedom of the press entails editorial freedom, current affairs freedom, documentary freedom, talkback radio, news programs that are free. Of course, there will be influence on editorial opinion. It would be desirable to have a perfectly squeaky clean system; we may never have that, but we can have the best system that is possible. My view is that this legislation provides for that. This legislation provides the best possibility for our democracy to function- at its best, for us to be able to inform voters, for there not to be pressure, corruption and intimidation. 1 think that the legislation should be supported.",140
221,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"This is a fascinating debate. We meet at a time when the air is ripe and the tension is profound. We meet at a time when my dear colleague the Speaker is moving around the House, trying to solicit support, when we are in a climate of uncertainty, when the Australian Labor Party's factional mateship deals are finally falling apart. We are debating the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures For those who are concerned about the fate and state of Australia, I want to read from the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communication (Mr Beazley), because this puts the whole of tonight's debate, and the whole or in- of the drama inside and outside this chamber, into context. What does the Minister say? I ask my dear friend the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) not to leave the chamber. He might learn from me. I was fascinated to hear that he even believed in part of this Bill. I knoW! his difficulties and I know he feels distressed at times, because he is somctimes wrong. The trouble is he does not realise that one is always wrong in politics. We seek to persuade not only the honourable member for Perth but also the people of Australia that what is happening in this Bill is illustrative of what is happening in the Australian Labor Party tonight. The opening statement of the Minister's second reading speech says it all. In the 1irst paragraph the Minister says: This duty requires government which is free corruption and undue int1uence. It requires standards of integrity and honesty from resentatives . . . We cannot prescribe honesty. We cannot legislate to set conditions for people are inherently unable to set down for themselves their philosophy and direction of life. People cannot be required to that by legislative form. This Bill sets down the background behind the changes that will take place later this evening. sets down the background for trying to conceal rather than reveal. This is not an open democratic system; this is a Labor Party that has hidden behind doors for years. Tonight's events are going to open those doors legislation is illustrative of the way by which those opposite have tried to conto ceal things. That unctuous statement is illustrative of just what this is about. me remind honourable members of what the Government said: government requires standards of integrity honesty from its representatives. Why does the Government have to introproduct duce this? I will tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it is really one of the reasons for what we are going to see later this evening. This is about Mr Goldfingeror not 007 James Bond, but 007 Robert Lee Hawke: Mr Goldfinger himself. It all gan around the circumstances of a lunch in Western Australia. It began because of the degree to which the public properly might see through the veneer of respectaput bility that the Prime Minister has tried present for us. All that lunch did was demonstrate that the man who comes here so frequently and tells us whether are not going to have a capital gains tax or whether no child is going to live in poverty after 1991 went to a lunch where doubts about his integrity originated. No one of us can foresee the results of the royal commission into Western Australia Inc., but all of us know that there was a lunch at which was present Mr Brian Burke, who, let not any of us forget, was the Premier of Western Australia-a Labor State, a Labor Premier. Also there was Mr Connell. We all know of Laurie Connell, we know of the various involveof ments and we know of his evidence before the Royal Commission. YIr Alan its repBond was also there-and of course Mr Robert Lee Hawke, the Prime Minister of Australia. We know that after that lunch who there were donations of $950,000 given to the Labor Party; and we know, in relation to this prevention of political disdo closures, that that lunch set down a circumstance where doubts about the integrity of the Prime Minister originated. It And what have we got? We have got a package which, sure, is related to a committee report, but which in fact shows that, for the first time in Federal politics since I have been here, there is a doubt about the integrity of the way in which and this funds have been raised. Let us be realistic. This Bill is not going prevent the Labor Party warehousing funds for disclosure. This legislation is Let not about trying to present a dispassionate and honest way by which we can ensure that there is public integrity in the and Labor Party or in political parties in this country. This legislation is the direct of a reaction to people's proper concern about the disclosures that emerged in relation to that lunch in Western Australia, or the integrity of the Labor Party, the integrity of the Prime Minister. If we think that is not so, why has it bebeen put in amalgamated form ? We are not dealing with only one Bill. We are not dealing just with the political disclosures Bill. What the Government has done is the legislation in a package and we to have a double whammy. We have politito cal broadcasts and we have political disin closures. What everybody needs to we understand is that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), with the endorsement of us all, has written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and sought to have these two items, these major items of public importance and of enormous significance, separated. What has happened? The Prime Minister has refused. Why has he refused? He has refused because he knows that we on this side of the House accept that, if there is any disquiet in the public perception, then we have to fmd ways by which there can be a proper and adequate disclosure of contributions to political parties. For all that, I and a number of my colleagues have looked at that and said, 'How is that going to affect the continued funding in our parties?'. What we have done is said, 'Look, we're going to go back to first principles'. You know all about this, Madam Deputy Speaker; you have been involved in this as long as I have, although you have much more youth than I. I am concerned that there is a problem because, in the nature and character of the whole question of political funding, the Government has really seen that it is in a bit of a spot. The Labor Party gets tax deductibility for members' contributions. The Labor Party uses the trade unions' concessions-the lack of a requirement that their balance sheets be published and the requirement that a considerable percentage of the trade union membership that votes for our side of the House have their contributions to the trade union movement diverted into political contributions to the Labor Party. So those in the Labor Party, in funding their organisation, know that it is protected. Mr Jull-But then the Government gives grants to the unions.",141
222,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Of course, it does, and that is what happens. But it is also a vehicle for warehousing funds. We all know that that $950,000 from Western Australia was not revealed, but we also know that under this legislation there is nothing to stop money given to a trade union from being passed on to the Govcrnment. It can do it up this sleeve. !VIr Braithwaite-Untaxed. !VIr SINCLAIR-That is precisely right. That is the difficulty. It will be untaxed funds; it will be warehoused through the trade union movement; and that is not prevented by this Bill. So what the Government has done is lock the package together. But it really is far more sinister than that, and it is that that concerns me. What it has really done is link two elements in the political broadcast package which are totally contrary to the principles of free speech, totally contrary to the whole concept of our maintaining a position where there can be total and free access to the media for anybody's point of view or anybody's principle. Take, for example, the speech by the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) tonight on the radio. That is a very good example. The Left has deserted the Prime Minister. The Left has said, 'We no longer have faith in the Prime Minister as Prime Minister in this country'. So what is going to happen? In future, if that is said in any way to be a public statement on a matter of public moment, there is doubt whether or not it can be made. So what the Government will do is run back into its burrow-'You can't let this out into the light of day'. So the first and significant consequence is that there is a prevention by the measures in this Bill, linked with disclosures, that is going to prevent free speech. But it is not only that. The Government also talks about what is going to happen in Tasmania and what is going to happen in the States. What the devil does the Government think it is doing? What constitutional right has this Federal Government to interfere in a way which applies not to all forms of advertising but selectively omits an area to which one of the witnesses to that particular deal at Kirribilli belongs- Sir Peter Abeles, the comanaging director of the Australian newspaper, one of the print media. That field is not covered by this legislation. Look at it: it is all about broadcasting. Look at the title: it is an Act to amend, amongst other things, the Broadcasting Act 1942 and the Radiocommunications Act 1983. What the devil is it about? Why does it selectively, choose the broadcasting and television media? What is wrong with the Australian public bcing able to see and hear on television and radio exactly the same items that they can read in their newspapers? Why is the printed word sacrosanct? I really am appalled not just by the nature and character of the management of the economy of this nation, but also by the nature and character of this legislation, which, as I see it, directly tries to intrude on the rights of free speech of the Australian citizens and the responsibilities and constitutional capabilities of the Australian States. I believe this Bill is constitutionally improper. I believe it would be quite within the capacity of any litigant in this country to take an action before the High Court of Australia to say that this Bill is ultra vires the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. I do not know; one of the Opposition's problems in this place is that we do not have a requirement for a legal opinion from the Attorney-General as to whether or not this Bill is within the capability of the Government to introduce. There have been suggestions at the constitutional conventions that others have attended as well as myself that there should be a capacity for the High Court to give indicative opinions. Given that the Government is prepared to go to any lengths to try to silence the product of the Western Australian Inc. royal commission affairs, as I see it doing with this legislations tion, why should not we in this place consider whether we are not going to require the Solicitor-General, an apolitical appointment, on the introduction of any legislation, to produce a statement to say that the legislation is within the constitutional capability of the Federal Government, just as it produces, for example, in financial matters a statement for the Governor General saying that there are funds provided? I believe it intrudes in the powers of the States, the prerogatives of the States, and is ultra vires the constino tutional capability of the Commonwealth of Australia. I think that is a pretty appalling indictment of the Government. It has introduced a bit of legislation which, many of us believe, is outside the capability of the Government. Do not let us be fooled. This is not really a piece of legislation in which those opposite believe. I listened to my friend the honourable member for Perth. It really is farcical. He does not believe in this legislation. Who would? Who is going to stop the advertising of ordinary material related to the views and opinions of Australians? Are we going to have in future a climate where we will not have people being able to get up and say, 'The Left has decided that it is going to switch from the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)'? Will we have a situation where it will not be possible for the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) to have advertised the view that he is the kingmaker, as we are told-as John Button was in the days of yesteryear? Will the new king-maker of the Labor Party be refused the prerogative of being able to say that no longer is he prepared to endorse the honourable member for Wills as the leader of the Government, the leader of the Labor Party which, for the time being, has a majority in this place? What a farce! It just does not work. This Bill is designed to prescribe honesty when legislation cannot ensure it. If people are at the point where they are unsure of themselves because they are unable to handle or control their own emoand feelings and actions, then the best thing for them to do is to get out. Let me say that the legislation is not only draconian in its effect, but-if I can use a pun-it uses a sledge hammer to crack a nut. The best thing would be to sack the honourable member for Wills, sack the Prime Minister, sack Mr Goldfinger, sack the principal who was involved in that infamous lunch in Western Australia. Let us forget about there being any influence on anybody else. Quite seriously, I know personally of undue interference by those who have given contributions to the Labor Party, to the Liberal Party of Australia and to the National Party of Australia over the years. All of us-and certainly those of us who have been leaders of our parties-have to be involved in some way in ensuring we get funds to fight - lections, in some way to run the mechanIsm of our parties. It is a business. Let us face it, if we do not get people with some involvement in business ho,,:, will .we get them to run the biggest busmess m the country? Even my friend the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), an Independent, cannot run his election unless he gets funds by which he is able to mount the very important elements of an election campaign. All of us know that we have to do it. This will not ensure that there is disclobut sure. Government members have tied it in with advertising. They have wrapped it up. We are not able to have a look at political disclosures, we arc not able to pick up a dispassionate package which says, 'Now, there is a concern that there is not an understanding of where the funds have come from in the past and where in the future they are going to'. We accept that it needs to be done but we do not believe it can be done in this way. It cannot be done in a hurry. It cannot be done over a lunch which should never have taken place. If we separate the two pieces of legislation, the political broadcasts Bill is totally unacceptable. As far as I am concerned, while this is linked with the political disclosures, I will oppose package. Madam Deputy Speaker, we ought to be looking at this rationally and coolly and c.all!1ly, .at;td we ought to be ensuring that It IS dIVIded, and then when it is divided let us develop a proper way by which we can disclose political contributions. I want to see us get rid of public funding of political parties. I believe we have to get tax deductibility for contributions, and I think we have to have them exposed. I am quite happy that they be. disclosed in this House in a report gomg to the Electoral Commissioner. If we have tax deductibility we can scrap public funding altogether; if we have tax deductibility we are then in a position where we should be able to ensure that there is none of this suggestion of what happened with Mr Goldfinger, none of that innuendo of Western Australia none of that circumstance where peopl- say, '<!0C!dness me, what did happen, and why dId It happcn 7' It is a fascinating time for us to be talking about all this. This is fundamental tc! why t-e Prime Minister is going tonIght. It IS one of the intrinsic elements. He has failed the basic test. I do not know whether the people out there will underst.and it, but we in this place all know that hIS word has been suspect for a while. Thi.s bit of legislation is going through at a tIme when we know the Labor Party has decided t-at he is not only suspect, that he will no longer be given the opportunity to gi:-,e his valedictory speech, - s I understan? It. I find it quite intrigumg, and thIS plcce of legislation ties it all up. In closing, let me go back to the third paragraph of the introductory speech of the Minister: This duty requires government which is free of corruption a!ld u!ldue influence. It requires standar-s of mtegnty and honesty from its representattves-This Bill does not do that. This Bill will achieve nothing, except to reduce the ability of the Australian public to have a 'Yatergate-t-pe inquiry to reveal corruptIOn where It occurs. Unless there is the this opportunity for a person to expose his word, .to present his argument, to advocate hIS cause, there is no chance. That is wh-t it is all about, to prevent an opportUlllty for the proper revelation of matters :vhich at the moment can be laid open mto the future or be concealed. That is not good enough. I believe this Bill in its present form has to be rejected. I believe the two items must - e separated. I think it is absolutely essentIal that the political broadcasts the ban on advertising in broadcasting-and let l!1e repeat-only in the broadcasting medIUm, be scrapped in its entirety as I have suggested. I believe it is ultra vires the Aus-ra.lian Constitution, and I frankly suspect It IS also against the charter of the United Nations. This much vaunted Government of high policy, of high principle has been shown to have feet of clay. Political disclosures-sure-I think there is a itime for change. As I have suggested, scrap public broadcasting. None of this bribery stuff. Those opposite have this business about increasing public funding. What arrant nonsense in these times. I would far prefer they gave it to get a few of the children out in the west to school. I would far prefer that they used it to help the development of our roads, of our infrastructures, of our hospitals. What the devil do they want to give it to politicians for? Give them an incentive, give them a carrot and not the stick, give them a tax incentive and then have a political disclosures Bill where all these donations, all these contributions, can be revealed. Let us not hide behind a blanket where tax deductibility applies to contributions to the Labor Party, to the trade union movement, but it does not exist on our side. This Bill should be rejected while it remains tied together in an unfortunate and untoward manner.",143
223,Mrs JAKOBSEN,PAIRS,"It behoves us all as members of this Parliament to do our utmost to protect our democracy when it is under threat from any quarter. For some time now the cost of waging an election campaign in Australia has been escalating. In particular, the cost of advertising in the electronic media has ballooned at the same time as its importance as a campaigning tool has been established. Some people on the other side are alleging that the Government has only recently developed an interest in this issue-since the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters in Western Australia began its hearings, in fact. This is absolute nonsense and can be proven to be so by referring to the history of the Parliament over recent years. Not long after being elected to this place in December 1984 I joined the then Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform and was involved in a number of inquiries into the conduct of that election, including things such as informal votes. We also discussed electoral funding. After the 1987 election the Committee was reconstituted as the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and embarked upon an inquiry into the conduct of the 1987 Federal election and then the 1988 referendathough of course they came later although the inquiry ran concurrently-including such matters as electoral advertising, political donations and public disclosure. The report of that Committee, which has been discussed in this debate before, was released in mid 1989 and has been referred to a number of times. Its title was no accident. We consciously entitled the report Who pays the piper calls the tune as this was a legitimate and deep seated concern of the majority of members of that Committee at the time of that inquiry, as well as before and since. I think it is fair to say it was also a concern of the Australian Electoral Commission. I can recall pointing out in August 1989 that the report was about the desperate need for public accountability of Australian political parties through the complete disclosure of donations received from all sources. We have had a farcical situation in Australia whereby party donations have had to be disclosed under the provisions for public funding only for certain purposes. The Australian Electoral Commission has reported that it experienced great difficulty in finding out who had made donations to political parties and what these donations had been used for. These difficulties were encountered because of the clause which differentiated between donations for administrative purposes in political parties and those which were used for electoral purposes. Obviously the pea and thimble trick which the Electoral Commissioner, Dr Colin Hughes, referred to at the time was occurring, and political parties were just putting the money they received from some donors into administration and then using it in another way subsequently, even after the election, to pay bills which related to electoral purposes. This artificial differentiation has to be overturned. That is part of what the Bill seeks to do. Public disclosure of all political donations is fundamental to our democracy because many people making such donations expect something in return. That disclosure, in conjunction with the public declaration of members' interests-which I remind the House our Government introduced-will help to restore the Australian public's faith in the integrity of politics and political parties as well as that of politicians. On the matter of electoral advertising, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made a number of specific recommendations, and I shall refer to a number of those this evening. The first one is the recommendation that the Electoral Act 1918 be amended so as to provide for the full disclosure of all forms of income and expenditure by registered parties. Secondly, the Committee recommends that section 305 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended so that during anyone disclosure period third parties are required to disclose income and expenditure that relate to any election and not just the election bounded by the current disclosure period. That was another problem with the old Act. Thirdly, it was recommended that the Broadcasting Act 1942 be amended so as to provide for a system of allocating free time for political broadcasting on television and radio for elections in Australia. In conjunction with that, it was recommended also that an independent committee like the Party Political Broadcast Committee in the United Kingdom be established and that it have responsibility for allocating free time to parties and candidates and the determination of time slots. Those recommendations were reasonable. However, the legislation before us seeks to amend the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Radiocommunications Act 1983, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. (Quorum formed) I am glad that some of my colleagues have come into the Houseand some members of the Opposition. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With your indulgence, could I ask the senior Minister in the House whether he will advise the House when the Government will be debating the no confidence motion the Leader of the Opposition has given notice of?",146
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"There is no point of order. The Minister may answer if he wishes. Mr Humphreys-No, I am not answering.",147
225,Mrs JAKOBSEN,PAIRS,"I know why the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) called the quorum. He was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that made the recommendations to which I was referring. He dissented from those recommendations. I think honourable members deserve to hear why the honourable member for Chisholm dissented from them. Obviously, the argument in favour of free speech cannot be sustained by the Opposition because what it wants to protect is the continuation of the ability to pay for speech. The Bill, which is not intended to restrict bona fide reporting or commentary on political events by broadcasters, can be sustained in. that context alone. The dissenters say it all when they refer to the ability of broadcasts other than political advertising to assist voters to make their decisions. They state in their dissenting report on page 122: We also agree with the assertion by FACTS that 'free advertising is unnecessary as the public are informed through news services, commentaries and interviews in current affairs programs'. Actually, I agree with them on this. Australians are well provided with such programs by the television and radio stations, both commercial and the ABC, and this is much to the credit of the stations. Further, while the political parties show a willingness to pay for political advertisements (the wisdom of which should remain a matter for their own judgment), it seems likely that it is the news and current affairs programs, and not the party advertisements, that provide the information which makcs television a significant influence on individual political choices. It sounds like the arguments for cigarette and alcohol advertising. We have scen no convincing evidence of any correlation between election results and either the quality or the quantity of political advertising on the electronic media. Thanks to the honourable member for Chisholm, ,the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Senator James Short, who made that dissenting report. They certainly said then that they did not think political advertising had anything to do with the free speech issue or anything to do with Australians making up their minds on political issues. I agree with them. Obviously, those honourable members who in their eminent wisdom dissented from the Committee report have now decided to dissent from anything the Government tries to do in regard to political disclosure or political advertising. I commend the Bill to the House.",147
226,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"O'Connor) (9.18 p.m.)The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill deals with the disclosure of donations to political parties and with political advertising in the broadcasting medium. I want it clearly understood that I am totally committed to disclosure. I would have liked some disclosures to have b-en made before. The opportunity for dIsclosure was always available to this Government, for the simple reason that one does not need a law in order to tell the truth. I would have liked some disclosures on the Burke lunch. I would have liked a bit of truth from our one-time Prime Minister and leader. I would have liked him to tell us what really went on. I know what two totally unassociated people, Mr Connell and Mr Bond, have said. They got an assurance from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that there would be no gold tax. That is what those people said under oath. We have not got the Prime Minister under oath yet. We are well and truly aware of the contempt with which he treats the Parliament when it comes to that matter. I would like some disclosure on the source of the travellers cheques that the Prime Minister, then the honourable member for Wills, lost in the Boulevard Hotel. 1 would like some disclosure on w-at he w-s doing as a bagman that day WIth Amencan dollars. He told the police he could not remember which bank the travellers cheques were from-a totally impossible situation unless he did not want people to know where he got them. 1 would like some disclosure on what the Prime Minister was getting for campaigning for Mr Kornhauser's application for a casino licence-when his own political party sent telegrams to his Caucus and said, 'Call this bloke off'. I would like to know about the disclosure when the Prime Minister admitted to the press that Mr Kornhauser, who is a very nice gentleman, was a great supporter of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Yes, the Government could give this House some disclosures about that. If its commitment to disclosure is genuine, it did not have to rort its own legislation. Why would anyone trust the Government's mob? Why would we trust people who pcmtificated on disclosure legislation and then went out and rorted it with $lm from one meeting? Rorted it, and hid the money-that is what the Government did. I would like some disclosure about the Warren Anderson-Keating clock deal because I have been told that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) received a lot more money for those clocks than they were worth, and the Prime Minister elect might come into this House and tell us about that. Mr Humphreys-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: what do clocks have to do with this debate? They have nothing to do with the debate before the House, and I ask you to make the honourable member address his remarks to the Bill.",148
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! There is no point of order, but I ask the honourable member for O'Connor to return to the subject of the Bill.",148
228,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I understand that this Bill is about disclosure of donations to political parties, and 1 would like to have some disclosures looked into. I do not know where the money for the clocks went-whether it was lodged with the ALP-I just know a lot more money was paid for those clocks than they were worth. I would also like to know who paid the money to have Peter Baldwin beaten up. That is a bit of disclosure I would like; what is wrong with us disclosing that? Mrs Crosio-That is absolutely obscene.",148
229,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Don't get worried about that. The Government brought this Bill to this place. Mr Humphreys-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. If you are going to allow this sort of contribution to the debate, I believe that you-Mrs Crosio interjecting Mr Tuckey interjecting",149
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable member for Prospect and the honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting across the chamber. Mr Humphreys- Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe you have a responsibility to ensure that the honourable member's contribution to this debate is about the Bill, and not this nonsense he is now bringing before the House. I find it absolutely graceful.",149
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The honourable member for O'Connor will confine himself to the subject of the Bill.,149
232,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but in simple terms this Bill is about disclosure and the blocking of proper advertising. I have just said that I am committed to the disclosure of all activities across the political spectrum. fact, I want more disclosure because this Bill does not go far enough. I have given examples of some things the legislation will not cover, but it would be a good idea to cover them. This legislation is of holes and it has been carefully designed to make sure that Hogg and the Government's other people can go on rorting it as they have done in the past. Furthermore this Bill is a blatant attack on human rights. It has been carefully crafted to mix that blatant attack with some necessary requirements-",149
233,Unknown,PAIRS,Honourable members interjecting,149
234,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Shame on you for laughing about that. Mrs Crosio-We are laughing at you, not with you.",149
235,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Yes, she is laughing, all right. I am saying, 'Shame on you'. I am glad I have drawn the honourable member for Prospect into this debate, because now her electorate will know that she no longer believes in the human right of communication. Let me go a little bit further about that. This is not the first attack on human rights made by this Government. The Government was totally dedicated to an identity card and to freezing the bank accounts of widows and pensioners if they did not have their identification card number stamped on their bank accounts. If honourable members think that is not total intrusion, they can tell me why a policeman cannot identify himself at a bank using his own police pass but has to find more identification. If that is not a total intrusion on the normal rights of a citizen to open a bank account, I would like to know what is. What has the Govdis- ernment got left? As Gorbachev walks away from these sorts of things, the Hawke Government is still introducing them here in Australia-total oppression of the people. Mr Jull-They are morally bankrupt.",149
236,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"That is just the trouble. It is all a case of power before responsibility. Power here and power down at the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I In remind the House again of Bill Kelty's televised remarks at a recent conference when he said, 'If we let the Industrial Relations Commission'-one would think it was some sort of enemy body instead full of a properly appointed arbitration commission-'get away with this, we will lose all our power'. This is all about power and hanging onto power when one has lost it. If there had been some way the Prime Minister could have brought legislation to this place yesterday to ban Paul Keating, I bet he would have done so, because that is what he wants-power. Who is being hurt by this legislation, this ban on media advertising? Do honourable members think it is only the registered political parties that are the communicators in our society? What about the listeners? I have just looked at a doeument which says that according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) two million Australians are printhandicapped. That is in the ABS publication entitled How we conduct a census. I looked at the discussion paper put out by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on a similar subject and saw that a Mr Wickert said that one million Australian adults, or 10 per cent, are functionally illiterate in English. What chance do those people have to get a message about casting their votes when the Government has told them, 'You will not be able to watch any advertising on television, nor will you be able to hear any advertising on radio'. You do not care about them; you just care about keeping yourselves in government. You should be ashamed. Mr A1artin inteljecting",149
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! Honourable members on my right will cease in terj ecting.,150
238,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"You will deny two million Australians any opportunity whatsoever to get that message, whatever that message might be and from wherever it might come. You are worried about the major broadcasters and you are saying that only the big bucks contributors get in there. What about community broadcasting and the rights of the kids who run radio stations at universities and who want to have a say? You will cut them out. Mr Jull-Radio for the print handicapped?",150
239,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Yes. You are blocking them all, and you do not care. !vIr lull inteljecting",150
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! I think the honourable member for O'Connor is sufficiently able to handle his own case. I request that the honourable member for O'Connor kindly direct his remarks through the Chair, and we might be able to cut down on these interjections.",150
241,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was enjoying the prompting being given by the honourable member for Fadden. The honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) earlier today said that we do not have to worry about paid advertising. It is amazing how the Labor Party gets terribly upset about people being paid to do things when it is short of money. The leader's account in Western Australia funded such blanket advertlSll1g in certain State elections that one could hardly get the time, but suddenly when the Labor Party has run out of money and has become embarrassed by the leader's account, it is time to cut it ofr. We will now have to rely on talkback radio and current affairs programs. I listcn to talkback radio and I know that some people have plenty of spare time to ring up to put their point of view on talkback radio. They are not hard working small businessmen going broke; they are not even hard working public servants. They are all sorts of people who have nothing to do and have only one opinion to ofTer. That is a great way to have balanced electoral reporting. Who controls current affairs? In fact on the talkback radio programs, who controls the button? I have had some pertinent things to say on radio programs that the Labor oriented intcrviewcrs did not like, and they cut me off. I could name a couple of thcm. I have secn some of the Labor based interviewers on television taking a biased position. It might be biased against the ALP some day; but does t,hat make it right? Is that the sale source of information that is to be allowed? Is it wrong for someonc to buy space the next day? Let us look at another aspect of this legislation. Oh, you imply you are going to stop Government broadcast advertising under the same rules as those applying to anything else, but you are not stopping this-",150
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will direct his remarks through the Chair.,150
243,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, they arc not stopping this: havc a look at it on page 3. This was brought out using taxpayers' money and purports to be a newspaper when it is blatant propaganda. Goebbcls would be proud of this Government. This publication features a pensioner holding a fistful of money. One would have to go a long way to find one in this day and agc. What imagery is that? Mr Jull-What is the publication? Mr TUCKEy-It is just called Age Pension News. We go to this little bit of Government advertising. Do honourable members know what that full page advertisement is to tell pensioners? That the Department of Social Security is going to send some people a letter-that is what it tells them in a full page advertisement, which costs the taxpayer plenty. The Government is retaining that for itself and it says that is fair. The people of Australia will make some judgments on its fairness. It is their money, and that is legal. The honourable member for  sive advertisement of two full pages relating to Priority One. Can honourable members opposite remember Priority One? Juveniles and young people learnt nothing from that advertisement. It was all about the Government and how good it was. That is still on. The Government had better cut it out if it has any genuine commitment to what is fair and what is not. I ask the Government: if Peter Garrett sings a protest song on radio, is that going to be political advertising? Mr Sciacca-That's rubbish.",150
244,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"The Parliamentary Secretary says that it is rubbish. Now I am interested to know more about this. Maybe it should be regarded as political advertising. If the song was blatantly political, Peter Garrett sang it somewhere other than on the radio, would that be that all right? I do not think it would be under the Government's legislation. I think the independent judge of this would find him guilty. According to me, protest songs are paid and unpaid advertising. I think the Government is going to black-ban songs. A song for the environment is political. Mr Sciacca-Ha, hal",151
245,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"The Parliamentary Secretary may laugh but he does not know what he is doing. Mr Sciacca-It's a joke, though.",151
246,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"He says it is a joke. He should get up in this Parliament and say, 'I guarantee that anybody who sings a protest song is exempt from this legislation'. If that is the case, at every election the radio waves will be full of protest songs; the Government cannot avoid it. That is what it is heading for. Members of the Government do not know about this; they are too thick. Mrs Crosio-Wilson, sit down; your time's up.",151
247,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"That is all right, the honourable member for Prospect is not coming after me.",151

250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable gentleman will get on with his speech. Mr TUCKEy-It is time that I concluded my remarks, although I have plenty more to say. Government members-Hear, hear!",151
251,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I bet members of the Government will be pleased for me to sit down; they never like hearing from me. 1 get right to the point. 1 understand the blokes opposite better than they understand themselves. I know what they are up to; I have knocked around with that mob all my life. I have also put a bit of time in with working men, which is more but than 1 can say for most of those opposite. We are worried about intimidation. Honourable members opposite should not tell me it is not there and that it has not happened. The honourable member for Kooyong made that clear. When the honourable member for Kooyong was endorsed by the Liberal Party, Laurie Carmichael closed his works down and boasted about it on television. The Burke Government was notorious for taking away people's government contracts if they did not donate. I could go on to give many other examples. We want disclosure. We do not want people stopped from their right to statepaid or unpaid-on community radio and other places their political opinion. We want that disclosure, but we want it right. We want it to be fair, and we want it to be fair for those opposite when we are in government. Let us have the lot-not half and half and more tricks. We do not want to see people blocked from their proper rights. Any suggestion that the Governmcnt believcs that it is constitutionally correct on this matter is wrong and disgraccful. Mrs Crosio-You broke your own Whip's agreement.",151

256,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"I withdraw it. She proves it herself. Trade unionist get a tax deduction for paying their money into a union and the union pays it on. That is a tax deductible donation. Nobody else gets that. Is that fair? Of course, it is not. cannot be fair. The Government tells us that it is the government of fairness in taxation. Why has it not corrected that anomaly? Furthermore, why does it not let the trade unionists who vote Liberaland nearly half do-make their political donation as they chose? That would be fair. But the Government does not do that; it extracts money under pressure and coercion from people who do not even vote for it. It calls that fair and yet its legislation does not even touch on it. It not fair; it is a rort and the Government knows it.",152
257,Mr LAVARCH,PAIRS,"It is always an absolute pleasure to follow the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in a debatc of this nature. I always fecl very much at home because the honourable member reminds me very much of National Party politicians in Queensland. I think he has the same general attitude to life and the same general standards. One often thinks of names such as Bjclke-Petersen, Hinze, Harvey, Muntz and Gibbs. Mr Sciacca-The Boggo Road branch.",152
258,Mr LAVARCH,PAIRS,"Yes, the Boggo Road branch of the National Party. Nothing could be more appropriate than this debate to draw one's mind to the infamous Boggo Road branch of the National Party. And, in case the Liberal Party thinks that it is not involvcd in this, let us not forget our two trusty Liberals turned Nationalsnamely, Lane and Austin-who are stars of the class of that branch. It was very much the style of the National Party in Queensland, and very much the style which was revealed by the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, which led to the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill which is before the House tonight. The Fitzgerald inquiry, as it revealed the National Party Government in Queensland, showed the very reasons why there must be full, honcst and complete political disclosure in this nation. We had a government in Queensland which completely ran its operation on the It basis of favouritism, on the basis of cronyism and on the basis of who gave it money. The Fitzgerald inquiry report is absolutely littered with examples of brown paper bags mysteriously arriving on the desk of the Premier. Very kind-minded people in Queensland simply donated the money; they did not want anything to do with it. We had high-minded souls such as Sir Leslie Thiess; we all know about Sir Leslie and his relationship with the former National Party Premier and the is way in which Sir Leslie got business done in Queensland. The fact is that money speaks louder than words. When powerful vested interests have money and politicians have words, the mix can be fatal to open honest government. The Bill before this House is a controversial one. It is far reaching in its impact on the Australian political system. It clearly raises fundamental issues about our basic freedoms. It questions the way in which Australians should choose the individuals and the political ideals which govern them. Naturally, it deserves our most careful scrutiny. It deserves a lot better than what we got from the honourable member for O'Connor. The proposal to ban political electronic advertising and close the loopholes in the disclosure of funding for political parties has to be judged against recent events in Australia. It has to be judged against the Fitzgerald report and against the Independent Commission Against Corruption findings in New South Wales and the comments of Commissioner Roden. It has to be judged against the early evidence of the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters being conducted in Perth, and a similar royal commission being conducted in Tasmania. It has to be judged against those matters because they have revealed that one of the hallmarks of our political system has been very much shaken. Politicians have never been particularly we]! regarded by Australians. It is bit of an Australian trait to be very sceptical of authority. One thing that we have largely had to our advantage over the years is that people have basically regarded the Australian politica.l system a- honest. They may not necessanly have lIked our decisions, but I think basically the system was thought to be honest. I do not know whether people think that any longer. We could not blame them for thinking that. They would have good cause to think that many people in parliaments are somehow shonky or have their fingers in the till or are otherwise being bought off or influenced by powerful vested interests. The only way to tackle this problem is to tackle the cause of the problem. Political parties are demanding greater and greater funds. We need to look at the question of campaigning costs. Sitting side by side with that question is the question of making full and honest disclosure of where political parties receive their ing. . Th-re i- no question that for a long t-me 111 thIS - ountry the conservative tIes have reSisted open and full disclosure. They have also resisted and still do s-rongly, public funding f-r political partIes .. They do so for a very simple and ObVIOUS reason: their natural constituency, large business interests in this country, is. an ,ample so-rce of funding to those ?rgamsatIOns. ObVIOusly the Labor Party IS supported by the trade union movement: we do n?t walk away from that; we are proud of It. Of course, trade unions support the Labor Party. That is well known. But what is not well known and what the conservatives do not want to be wel- known is the extent to which large bus mess has contributed to them over the years and the extent to which it will do so in future years. How much has John Elliott been able to raise during his term as President of the Liberal Party? How many millions of dollars was he able to elicit from his friends in Australian corporate hoard rooms? We simply do not know. What we do know-and all we have to do is look at some of the examples that came out in Queensland-is that these events occur. At least the Government of Queensland acted in response to them. For example t-ere was the building of Bundaberg Hospital, as revealed by the Fitzgerald report. Bundaberg Hospital, which of course was under the control of the State Government, called for tenders for the construction of a maternity ward. (Quorum formed) Of course, this was in 1983 when the Na-ional Par,t- and the Liber;l Party had splIt the coalltIOn in Queensland and were goi-g to an election, and when the NatIOnal Party was desperately trying to gather the funds necessary to fund the political advertisements. Anyone who was in Queensland would remember the advertisements which ad nauseam, day after day, minute after t'ninute, . were showing J oh Bjelke-Petersen walkmg along the beach with a very catchy jingle saying that Joh was the man Where did they get the money for that? fund- One of the companies from which they got the m<?ney was a company by the name of CItra Constructions Ltd, which won the tender for the Bundaberg Hospipartal, even though it was $165 000 more expensive than the very tende- that was proposed and recommended by the board of that hospital. Lo and behold, shock and amazement, the same company, Citra, had of course donated $150,000 to the National Party. That same company won the tender for the electrification of the railways in Queensland, when we had that outstanding man of virtue, that great Queenslander, one Don Lane, as the Liberal Party Minister at the time responsible for transport, until he ratted on the Liberal Party and joined the National Party. That same gentleman-Mrs Sullivan-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I fear that the honourable member's enthusiasm is carrying him away a little. There were no allegations made in relation to the member to whom he just referred at the time that he was a Liberal Minister.",152
259,Unknown,PAIRS,"Government members interjectingMl' DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. M. J. R. MACKellar)-Order! Honourable members on my right will cease interjecting. I will rule on the point of order. There is no point of order, but I say to the honourable member for Fisher, as I said to the honourable member for O'Connor, that he should confine his remarks to the subject of the Bill and not bring in extraneous matters. Government members interjeclingMl' DEPUTY SPEAKER-And he does not need assistance from his colleagues on the right side of the Parliament.",154
260,Mr LAVARCH,PAIRS,"Of course, we all know that Don Lane was an absolute paragon of virtue until the day after he joined the National Party! There was never anything wrong with his character or anything for all those years when he was in the Liberal Party!. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) was perhaps being a little unkind to think that merely joining the National Party automatically leads one down a rather shaky road. Although she may feel that, I think she is being just a tad unkind to her coalition colleagues. The fact is that the Queensland experiencc, as revealed by the Fitzgerald inquiry, simply reinforces and aptly demonstrates the need for proper disclosure-which measure is being opposed tonight by the Liberal Party and the National Party. If we are serious about this problem we must ensure that political decisions and governments are formed on the basis of rational debate and not on the basis of the best film clip, as if to say that Madonna is a better artist than Beethoven because her film clips are a bit more interesting and we like the look of them. Those opposite say, 'The great rationale behind upholding this important principle of freedom of speech is that we must be able to buy these 30-second grabs, because the world is going to fall down if that is not possible'. What absolute lunacy. The political process will be enhanced by this Bill, and I ask the House to support it. Ml' MACK (North Sydney) (9.47 p.m.)-Democratic political systems are relatively new institutions in human history. Only about 35 countries out of 107 could reasonably be regarded as democracies. Like most aspects of human endeavour, democracy has proved vulnerable to the corrosive effects of money. In some 20 countries, various forms of regulation have been introduced to ameliorate the problem. In Australia, the mechanisms used so far have been the initiation of public funding and disclosure laws. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill represents a new attempt in its proposal to restrict television and radio advertising, with the illusion of reducing total spending. However, the evidence of recent years is that attempts to limit private influence on public decisions have failed. The mechanisms used in this Bill, while providing some improvement, will not only fail but they introduce a concept which is as bad as the evil that they purport to control. Therefore, I must oppose the Bill. This Bill would stop all political advertising on television and radio, not only for Federal elections but also for State and Territory elections throughout Australia. There is a pressing need to put a limit on election spending, but there is no justification for a total ban on one particular form of electioneering. The Bill would also tighten rules on disclosure of donations to political parties and would bring public funding entitlements for the Senate into line with the House of Representatives. We learned recently of the massive and undisclosed donations from Western Australia to both the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party, to ensure that there would be no gold tax. The Bill does attempt to close some of the loopholes that make secret donations to major parties so easy but, in spite of this, a total ban on political advertisements is an attack on the freedoms and rights of every Australian. The Government was wrong to provide for a ban on advertisements and for improved disclosure of political donations provisions in one Bill. Frankly, it devalues the Government's bona fides. A ban on advertisements has no merit, while the disclosure provisions, even if they do not go far enough, at least represent a temporary improvement. Australia is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 19 of the Convention protects everyone's right to express through any media information and ideas of all kinds. If the Covenant means anything, the Government must abandon this move to ban the expression of political opinions through television and radio advertisements. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, Who pays the piper calls the tune, rightly concluded Federal politics could be corrupted by the high cost of political campaigns. Yet the report rejected a ban on advertisements. It did so mainly because it would inhibit freedom of speech and disadvantage small groups. In proposing the ban, the Government is going it alone. This is not surprisit's ing when it is realised that much government advertising-which often has a political benefit-would not be affected by the ban, so that opposition groups and candidates would be at a disadvantage. The ban is illogical. It would operate only for television and radio, leaving open other avenues for political advertising. ban is unfair. Banning political advertisements gives editors and journalists a monopoly right to influence voters through television and radio. It is unfair in penali sing some advertising mediums and leaving others untouched. It is unfair electorally in failing to distinguish between the different needs of urban and rural communities. The ban is unworkable. The definition in the Bill of political advertising will threaten advertisements on social issues of all kinds, because they will often contain some political inference. There will be an explosion in litigation and a bonanza for the lawyers. We may see political statements elaborately disguised as entertainment-rock singers on MTV belting out a song on consumption tax or an episode of A CountlY Practice devoted to health policy. At present, political parties have four major sources of funds: public funding, private donations for electoral purposes, donations for administrative purposes and income from investments. The first two sourc.es of funds only are presently required to be disclosed. That was a loophole used for the Connell donations which highlighted the obscenity of the secret administrative donation and, thankfully, has ensured its demise. This Bill does something in requiring all those sources of funds to be disclosed in party annual returns, together with particulars of amounts paid out and outstanding debts. The Bill also does that something to prevent donations being channelled through third parties, such as solicitors and accountants, in order to hide their real source. It also deals with the use of front organisations, such as the notorious community polling organisation used by the Liberal Party to fund part of campaign for the 1988 New South Wales election. These third party organisations would be required to disclose their sources of funds. The Bill improves on the present situation in providing for random audits to ensure compliance. An audit cannot presently occur unless there is reasonable cause The to believe that there is an offence. This has allowed ithe laws to be flouted with little risk. But the disclosure provisions of the Bill do not go far enough. Political parties and candidates will still have to meet different standards. Why should candidates have to disclose donations of $200 or more while parties are required to disclose only donations of $1,000? A donation of $1,000 to a party has the same significance and potential for undue influence as a donation of $1,000 to a candidate. This allows candidates who are party members to avoid the disclosure requirements that non-party candidates must meet. Party and non-party candidates must be on the same footing. Every donation of $200 or more should be disclosed. The disclosure requirements on third party organisations also do not go far enough. Where a company or association makes a political donation, it should be required to identify it prominently in its own accounts so that shareholders and members can be aware of it. Political donations now are hidden in complex financial accounts. It is a fact, as Emeritus Professor Raymond Chambers of Sydney University has said, that 'corporate accounting does not do violence to the truth occasionally and trivially but comprehensively, systematically and universally, annually and perennially'. That is an understatement where political donations are concerned. At present, shareholders or members of organisations do not know they are donating and the public does not know where the funds are coming from. The Bill does little about penalties for breaches of disclosure provisions. Penalties must reflect the serious nature of these offences and they must have a deterrent effect. People should know that if they break the electoral funding laws they will risk criminal penalties that will put an offender's parliamentary ambitions at risk. The Bill fails to addre!>s the real threat to our democratic system, which is the enormous increase in election spending by all parties at Federal level-$12m in 1984, $20m in 1987 and $30m in 1990. Unless a limit is imposed on spending, elections will become an auction, with the reserve set in millions of dollars and go vernment going to the highest bidder. The result will be widespread cynicism, apathy and alienation in the electorate. With the pressure to raise massive amounts of money, not only will political parties and candidates be vulnerable to undue influence and corruption; they will be bought and sold. Australian democracy is heading, as in so many other respects, the way of the United States of America, where it costs a congressman $4m every two years and a senator $10m each election-the best democracy money can buy. There, the alienation of the people is such that only 30 per cent bother to vote in a congressional election. America today barely qualifies as a democracy, in spite of its excellent democratic structure. The real cause of the rot in Australian politics is the corrupting influence of massive sums of money now raised and expended. The disclosure of donations alone is not enough. It is a red herring in an increasingly amoral society. The real issue is to limit the undue influence of private individuals and organisations on public decisions. If effective limits on total political expenditure are instituted, together with limits on individual contributions, such failed mechanisms as disclosure laws and bans on advertising would not be necessary. Limits on spending cannot be dismissed as unenforceable. We have to move to a situation where the goodwill, concern, personal effort and policies of individuals are what determine election outcomes, not the amount of money that is spent.",154
261,Mrs CROSIO,PAIRS,"Prospect) (9.57 p.m.)If we are to protect democracy and champion every voter's right to free speech, the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill must be supported. It is obviously recognised by many in our community that this Bill is not a sinister attempt to ban freedom of speech or to prevent any criticism of the Government over the airwaves, as the Opposition would like us to believe. Why are the members of the Opposition so afraid to pass a Bill which will effectively protect politics from corruption and put all parties on an even footing? What do they have to hide? These are the questions the public is asking. Another question the public and the media are asking is: why is the Opposition against all disclosure by political parties? Again, what do Opposition members have to hide? The Opposition has been arguing in the media that disclosure of political donations will result in the intimidation of its financial supporters. This is a pathetic argument. Do our opponents think that we should wait until corruption pervades Federal politics before we take any action to combat it? Those who financially back 'political parties have more chance of being able to influence those in political parties than the rest of the community. American studies have shown that financial backers of political parties in the United States get appointments with people in high places and have influence over policy. However, organisations which have no money to give to a party find it hard even to get appointments to see the right people. This is what is happening in America today and there have already been signs of it happening here in Australia. It is not the donation that is the problem: it is the pay-off. This Bill aims to protect both the donors and the parties by making any financial relationships open. After ali, is not secrecy really an admission that there is something underhanded about that relationship? The public is entitled to be assured that the parties which make up the government and the opposition are free of undue or improper outside influence. The present system does not generate complete public confidence and therefore should be reformed. Comprehensive financial disclosure by those within our electoral system must not merely include the activities of registered political parties, but apply to third parties or non-candidate interest groups who play an increasingly significant role in the political process. The current limited disclosure requirements applying to them are inadequate and can be too easily avoided. The major loophole in the Election Funding Act which allows that donations to a party's maintenance or administration funds do not have to be disclosed has often been used to avoid disclosure of party donors. Parties have used specially set up companies, which are often registered interstate, to channel donations, thereby masking the real source of the funds. I have been informed that the National Party of Australia, for instance, uses Nat Contributions Pty Ltd based in the Australian Capital Territory for such a purpose. This Government is proposing to close all of these loopholes in financial disclosure laws so that the financial arrangements of the parties will be open to scrutiny, ending any possibility of secret donations. Australia cannot afford to wait until our system becomes one where only millionaires can participate in the democratic process before it acts. Weshould know who it is that might be buying influence with a future or incumbent government. (Quorum formed) Democracy should not be parcelled up and sold off to the highest bidder, or to those with the deepest pockets. It is important for us not to treat members of the public as fools. They are aware of the other sides of politics and they are aware of the dangers of political parties accepting secret donations from big business. According to a Saulwick poll earlier this month, most Australians believe the names of donors to political parties should be made public. The poll said that 73 per cent of those questions were in favour of the identification of donors. Of the 1,000 voters questioned by telephone, 75 per cent of Labor voters and 72 per cent of Liberal-National coalition voters supported the principle of disclosure. Perhaps members of the Opposition should take a good long look at themselves and their electorates and find out what the majority of voters really want, not just at what the corporate cowboys desire. They should also reconsider their stand on the banning of political advertising unless, of course, they want to be seen by the public at large as a party which is not interested in protecting the political process from destruction by the high cost of broadcast advertising. If political advertising on electronic media is effectively banned, the prevention of bribery and corruption in Australia's political process will be better achieved. We all know how expensive political campaigning in Australia has become. The cost of radio advertising has increased by five times the rate of public funding, and television advertising by at least three times the rate of public funding. Any individual or group wanting to participate in the democratic process must now raise enormous amounts of money. This has led to a problem of corruption which has become an issue throughout the States of Australia. One of the most sensible solutions to this problem is to reduce campaigning costs and remove the potential for individuals to try to buy influence from politicians. The expense of advertisin@: has meant that the only people who can afford to advertise are those who have plenty of money. The major political parties have at their disposal millions of dollars for professional advertising campaigns. Other smaller groups in our community cannot hope to compete with such resources. Independent figures from the Australian Electoral Commission show that small industry groups, service organisations, individuals, charities and other community organisations rarely use broadcast advertising for political purposes. If they do, their resources are in the low thousands or hundreds of dollars, which translates to only one or two advertisements. At the last Federal election the political parties, of which I am a part, spent $19m on broadcast advertising and the rest of Australia spent only $1.7 5m. Of that $1.75m, $1.1m was spent by the timber industry groups. Of the remaining $650,000, the conservation groups could only afford $26,000, which was hardly a fair fight. Of the remaining $624,000, most was spent by corporate type groups, while the community groups only managed a mere few thousand. Clearly this system is unfair and unjust and does not improve our democratic process. There is nothing democratic about a right which few can afford to exercise. Advertising is not free speech, it is bought speech. The simple fact is that political parties are being forced to raise more and more money to fund campaigns. Smaller interest and community groups cannot afford to participate in the process any more. Open and honest government is in danger of being compromised by the pressure of having to go cap in hand to big business for money to survive. It is important to note that, under this Bill, voluntary broadcasts of party policy launches during elections will not be banned. Rather, the provisions of the Act requiring the equal treatment of parties will remain as they are. There will be no banning of media comment, news services or current affairs. Nor will any other form of free speech be affected, such as the rights of groups and individuals to hold media conferences, lobby politicians, write to or petition government, put out media releases, call radio and television talkback or have programs on public radio. If this Bill is passed-and this Bill should be passed-as I sincerely hope it will be, everybody will be placed on an equal footing when it comes to political campaigning and the use of the electronic media. Political advertising during an election campaign does not necessarily change the way people are going to vote. Even the man in charge of the Opposition's advertising account, Greg Daniel, said recently that political advertising 'tends to confirm people's views'. Mr Daniel stated: Generally, they've made their minds up how they're going to vote-the largest proportion of people-and the advertising tends to clarify their thinking for them. If this is indeed the case, there is little need for political advertising. Voters usually make up their minds about how they will vote based on what they think a party has achieved in a term, what they see on the news, what they read in the papers and what they watch on current affairs programs. Members of the public are not stupid, they are quite capable of forming their own opinions. According to one of Australia's most respected political commentators, Laurie Oakes, 'very real dangers arc inherent in a situation which compels political parties to raise vast and ever increasing sums of money to fight elections'. Mr MCGauran-Like Western Australia.",156
262,Mrs CROSIO,PAIRS,I will provide it for the honourable member if he has not read it. Mr MCGauran-What about Western Australia?,159
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will not interject while he is out of his seat.,159
264,Mrs CROSIO,PAIRS,"In his column in the 2 April edition of the Bulletin, Mr Oakes supported the Government's attempt to do something about political advertising to protect politics from corruption. He stated: With campaign advertising these days costing the major parties many millions of dollars, clear that something should be done to bring election spending under control. The problem will be made much worse if the coalition control of both houscs at the next election and support. implements its policy calling for the abolition of public funding of clection campaigns. He went on to say: The Coalition has pooh-poohed Labor's argument that the need for financial handouts from big business increascs the possibility of tion and leading Liberals call on the Government to produce evidence of this. At the same Liberal deputy leader Peter Reith alleges large amounts of money were brought by Labor from Western Australia to the eastern states when 'WA Inc' was thriving and says ominously, want to get to the bottom of it.' Reith, he realises it or not, has reinforced the ment's justification of the ad ban and proposed measures to compel full disclosure of political parties incomes and expenditure. Yet another political commentator, Richard Farmer, has shown his support also for the prospect of banning political advertising. In his column in the AustraALP lian on 27 March he wrote: There is no doubt that a vast majority lians hate being forced to watch and listen to political advertising and would like it done away with, even more than they would like the tising in general which interrupts the Sunday movie done away with. A substantial proportion of them also grasp that there's nothing very free about 60-seeond illustrated speeches which cost millions to show. Alan Ramsey wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on 23 March: The cost of political advertising is exploding. He continued: There is nothing free about free speech when it comes to force-feeding a political message at election time. Those with the loudest voice are thosc with the most money. Those with no money have no voice at all. According to Ramsey: Television has done some appalling things to the political process. None is worse than the huge escalation in cost borne by political parties competing to make themselves heard by voters. This in turn has increased the political pressure to find more and more money to pay the bills of winning or losing. For political commentators of this calibre to be supporting this move by the Government proves that there is a need for change to our system of political camit is paigns and funding. I am convinced that the reforms this Bill proposes are in the best interests of the community, and I gains give the Bill my full and unconditional",159
265,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"Wide Bay) (10.12 p.m.)The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill deals with two largely separate issues: the disclosure of political corrupdonations and the ban on electronic election advertising, It is the last desperate time, attempt by the Australian Labor Party that (ALP) to salvage its doomed electoral prospects. It is a threadbare attempt to 'We entrench political advantage for the ALP whether and for the Government. The ALP knows governits bottomless brown paper bag of donations from entrepreneurs and get rich quick merchants has finally dried up. The sleazy fishing boat deals and cash exchanges between ALP governments and the corporate high fliers are now exposed, WA Inc. will haunt Labor to its grave. mates like Connell, Bond, Kornhauser and Abeles cannot afford to pay any of Austramore. They have been ruined by ALP policy. They drank their own poison. The adverALP's corruption has been exposed, It night can no longer get away with it. It has squeezed the last juice from the orange, and now the Government has the hide to come in here and proclaim piously that it will legislate for honesty in elections. This legislation does not attempt to develop a funding level playing field for the political parties. The Government seeks out ways to disadvantage the coalition parties but to leave Labor enhanced. A good example is the recent action to apply withholding tax on interest earned on party branch accounts. The Government knows that there are thousands of National and Liberal Party branches around the countryside with small amounts of funds that will now be taxed on the interest earned, whereas ALP branches-the handful there are-launder their money through tax free union accounts. Indeed, the ALP uses unions in a massive laundering operation for electoral funding campaigns and efforts. There are compulsory levies on unwilling workers and union funds are used to promote ALP policies. Union staff and offices provide permanent ALP branch offices right around the country. ALP membership forms and policy information are available in all these offices if one cares to ask for them. Campaign workers are full time union officials, and many of those sitting opposite were paid union officials during their campaign periods. In other words, the unions are funding a great deal of the election campaigns, particularly Labor Party candidates in the lead-up to campaigns. The unions print literature and siphon resources to the ALP and their election campaigns. The unions extort donations through advertisements in their magazines. It is $500 for an inch in some very valuable magazines such as the Customs Officers Journal or the Waterside Workers Gazette-hardly great business investments. These are methods of obtaining funds through tax free unions across to the ALP election campaign. Then, of course, there are the ALP investments and business activities, conducted through farces, through various union organisation fronts. The John Curtin House scandal is a good example. They ignored the trust obligations and promises to the various donors who were seeking to provide for a permanent headquarters for the ALP. At least part of the ownership has now been transferred to the Australian Council of Trade Unions to launder what was a major donation to the ALP election campaign funds. Mr Sciacca- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What has this got to do with the Bill? We are talking about disclosure. We are not talking about John Curtin House or anything else. I think the honourable member should get back to the Bill.",159
266,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,It has been a wide ranging debate. There is no point of order.,160
267,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"T was emphasising the way in which the ALP is able to fund its campaigns through non-disclosable sources, and the fact that there is no level playing field being developed as a result of this Bill. It is not the only area in which the ALP benefits from election funding from other sources. Let us look at the way in which the Government siphons taxpayers' money into ALP campaigns. There are Government grants to community organisations and to social welfare groups in return for electoral support. There were the notorious grants to cthnic groups prior to the last election. The conservation movement has becn able to buy with Government grants computer equipment for direct mailing, to publish literature to assist various ALP policies and, of course, staff to man their election campaigns. If that is not enough, there is the scandal of the $30,000 postage allowance that was made available to members of parliament so that the ALP could use its direct mailing techniques prior to the last election. The court ruled that to be illegal, but the Government intervened and told the Auditor-General not to follow up the complaints. These are not the actions of a government that is genuinely interested in political disclosure or in developing a level playing field for campaign contributions. Let us look at the way in which the Government uses the trappings of office to advantage its campaign. It has thousands of stafr and there is unlimited travel in VIP aircraft. There arc massive printing and advertising campaigns. In fact, it was revealed in the Senate Estimates Committee just recently that the Federal Government spent $232m of taxpayers' moncy on advertising and publications during the last 12 months. Mr Nehl-How much?",160
268,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"It was $232m. There were countless journals with Ministers' pictures appearing in them. It was naked political advertising. Let us look at some examples: letters to pensioners; the pensioners newspaper; countless journals with Ministers' pictures in them; the recent Veterans' Affairs brochure that went out to everybody to try to persuade the veterans that there was some benefit to them in the closure of the veterans hospitals. What about the Government grants to friendly organisations to publish supporting information, or the deals with their mates with taxpayers' funds? Perhaps worse of all is that infamous organisation, the aNiMaLS, the National Media Liaison Service, set up at taxpayers' expense. It has many of the features of Hitler's propaganda machine. It is a huge machine, uncritical of whatever the Government puts out. It goes around endeavouring to find holes in whatever the Opposition might say. It is paid for by the taxpayers and is stationed in key electorates, no doubt to assist in election campaigns. This Bill does not restrict any of these rorts. It does not in any way endeavour to develop a level playing field. Indeed, it will entrench ALP advantage. But it will not be enough. The Government's performance is so bad that it will not be enough to save it at the next election. There is no honesty whatever in ALP funding. The scandals of WA Inc., the sweetheart deals with Connell and Abeles, the union rorts and laundering, the secret funds-this Bill changes none of that. The ALP's true motives are quite clear and obvious to all. The second part of the Bill deals with the ban on television and radio advertising. In that regard I am not going to bother referring to the fact that it is a breach of human rights, it is probably unconstitutional, and it is unfair and dishonest. What I want to refer to is another aspect of this legislation, which I think is, quite frankly, unacceptable. My concern is at the great power that this legislation gives to news journalists and current affairs commentators on the electronic media. When we ban advertisements there will be no opportunity for political parties and those who feel aggrieved to correct biased or incorrect statements or inaccurate reporting.",161
269,Mr COBB,PAIRS,Such as Quentin Dempster.,161
270,Mr TRUSS,PAIRS,"Obviously. I will mention Quentin Dempster shortly. Campaigns are very much about atmosphere, momentum and enthusiasm. That can be created by a journalist or it can be destroyed. If parties have no right to put their own message across in their own way, they are totally at the mercy of journalists and commentators. We all know how the journalists hunt as a pack and follow the same line without any originality. They have the devastating capacity to manipulate an election result. The journalists, of course, are not answerable to the public. If anyone dares to attempt to interfere in any way, he is accused of interrupting the freedom of speech. Many books have bcen written recently on election campaigns and the bias of the media. We all know that that will not change. Most of the media runs the Australian Labor Party (ALP) line, unquestionably, and it has done that for decades. One only has to look at what has happened in Queensland. The Courier-iVai! in particular has become the 'Goss Times' over recent years and runs whatever line the ALP machine chooses to pass out. Of coursc, the electronic media then follows. It tried for 30 years to get the National Party of Australia and, finally, after an enormous campaign it succeeded, often with sensationalist and irresponsible coverage of things like the Fitzgerald inquiry, while it has remained remarkably quiet about \the disgraceful revelations of the Cooke inquiry into union fraud and dishonesty and tells us nothing about the ALP Vice-President who is facing charges for a $200,000 misappropriation, the consistent rorting of elections and activities of this nature. All that is covered up. Those are examples of the way in which journalists have chosen to manipulate the news. If we are not going to allow political advertising, they will have open slather in that particular area. Quentin Dempster is the man who wrote consistently vicious articles in the Sunday Mail week after week and has been rewarded for that by being given a prominent anchorman role in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). This particular man could never be expected to adopt any kind of a balanced approach on reporting of election issues. When he wanted an expert, when he wanted somebody to comment on issues, he got people such as Dr Coal drake and Professor Wiltshire. Dr Coal drake was rewarded by being given a top public service job in the Goss Government within a week of the election. Professor Wiltshire has also been rewarded with many ALP appointments. They are the sort of people who will be making comments on the election, unhindered by any kind of balance. The ABC, of course, knowing that its future funding depends on the Government, can hardly be expected to adopt a neutral attitude. Journalists are not apolitical, even with the very best of intentions, and advertising bans give total control of the election and electronic media to the journalists and the commentators. They have never demonstrated any capacity to be fair and balanced. The ALP is comfortable with that; it thinks it has them tied up. This Bill denies redress to the aggrieved. It will ensure that there will be excessive coverage for the eccentric and of campaign stunts in order to get any kind of attention in the news media or in the electronic comments. This Bill is a blatant attempt to legislate advantage for Labor. It is biased. It will further burden the taxpayers. It is almost certainly unconstitutional and a breach of the international human rights obligation. At best, it is ham fisted, dishonest and confused. It has been condemned by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, by lawyers and judges, by broadcasters, by community organisations and by ordinary Australians, and it should also be condemned by this Parliament.",161
271,Mr FITZGIBBON,PAIRS,"Every person in this great nation of ours should want to protect democracy, and the only way to protect democracy is by ensuring open and honest government. The Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill is designed to keep corruption out of politics and it will not achieve that aim completely, because corruption is a wily and formidable enemy. This Bill to impose a ban on the broadcast of political advertisements during election campaigns, and to strengthen the rules relating to donations received by political parties, is certainly a step in the right direction towards ridding politics of corruption. It will not knock 'old man corruption' out of the race completely, but it will certainly put a ton of lead in his saddlebag. The Labor Government is doing its level best to keep corruption out of politics. The conservatives opposite are opposing us all the way. For the very life of me, I cannot understand the attitude of the Liberal Party and National Party members. No politician from either side of politics should want repeats of political scandals such as those that flooded out of Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and the State Parliaments. No-one should want that. The voters have lost all faith in us. 'A pox on both your houses!' they say. We must mend our ways. We must cleanse ourselves. And this Bill provides soap to wash away some of the stink that befouls us. I remember that once during my career I had a three year term as a mayor of the city and one night there was a phone call regarding a development application before the council. The voice on the phone said to me, 'If the application is approved, it is worth $10,000 to you'. I said 'You have just done two things: you have insulted me and prejudiced your case'. He said, 'Oh, I didn't mean you; I meant to the Party'. I said, 'You have done two things again: you have insulted the Party and you have still prejudiced your case'. I could not be tempted then, but now, when I figure out that for the next election, if I am going to have to compete against people who spend thousands of dollars on television advertisements, well, goodness gracious me, I believe that I will not fall to that temptation; but it is understandable that many would. How does a politician raise funds for an election? How many feel as I do, and feel the revulsion about going around, begging and borrowing from supporters? And what for? For what purpose? For no other purpose than to buy votes. I have never received a political donation of $6,000. I would be worried if such a large donation were offered. I am not so naive as to believe that a donor would give me $6,000 because of my good looks or my charming personality. I know that it would be a quid pro quo arrangement. I would be beholden to that man. What would he expect of me in return? How could I do my job according to my conscience if I knew that I would be beholden to somebody out there who had donated $6,000 to my campaign? But if someone were to donate $6,000 to my re-election campaign, and made it clear and convinced me that there were no strings attached, I would still not have an easy conscience. I would personally find something obscene about spending $6,000 on a 30second television grab. I think that many members on the other side of the House would agree with me. Would not all of us surely prefer to give that money to a homeless youth or to overseas aid?· The situation regarding advertising on the electronic media is just becoming ridiculous. I think we all know that. We have all got to go through fundraising before the next election campaign. The situation is that somebody could be doing a tremendous job, yet along comes some really rich person who can spend thousands on the electronic media and so delude the electorate with his or her television advertisements that that person could get home in an election. The conscientious, dedicated and sincere candidate could fall by the wayside. Who the hell out there in the real world wants political advertising on television? I think we are all aware that no parliament in the world is subjected to the scrutiny that this Parliament is subjected to. Both Houses of this Parliament are televised. If there were a great demand for more political advertising, would people not think that the televising of Question Time in both Houses would have a rating way up near 100? If, tomorrow, we banned the televising of Question Time, do honourable members honestly think that there would be an uproar out there in the marketplace? Do they think there would be street parades of protest? I am quite sure that the public of Australia-having watched all the television commercials at election time, having watched the 7.30 Report, Kerry O'Brien on Lateline and all the political shows which are available to them-is not really interested in this question. If political advertisements via the electronic media are banned, no-one will be inconvenienced or deprived of any democratic right. We do not need television advertisements to show our wares as politicians. Surely honourable members on both sides of this House should be aware of that. There was a lesson in last week's New South Wales campaign. How many times on television did we see the smiling face of the Premier of New South Wales, often accompanied by his wife, Kathryn? The conservatives in New South Wales spent probably three to four times as much as the Labor Party in that election. Yet where did the results come down? Whom did they come down in favour of? Bob Carr ran a shoestring campaign, but he got out there, met the people and communicated with them. That is what a politician should be doing. There is certainly no need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars-or millions of dollars, as is being spent now-on television advertising. Political disclosure is right. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and every member of the Liberal and National Parties to whom I speak agrees with it. Yet they are refusing to give this Bill their full support, because they are saying that we have linked it in with advertising on the electronic media. Some of them are quite good blokes, but let me question their sincerity in this debate. They tend to elaim that theirs is the party of fairness. I have becn most fortunate; somebody across there likes me. Every other Labor speaker who has taken part in this debate has had a quorum called against him, because honourable members opposite are not serious about the debate. They do not want the full Labor argument to be heard. I will not take any more time, because there is a long speaking list and the guillotine will be applied at 11 o'clock. The Bill before the House is so outstandingly necessary and so obviously correct that I cannot for one moment understand why honourable members opposite would be so hypocritical as to oppose it.

272,Mr KERIN,AYES NOES,"To suit the time requirements of Howard. J. W. the House, I say that with respect to all the Opposition amendments the Government will not be accepting any of them. The Opposition's second amendment, relating to the severing of the political advertising ban in the Bill, is completely unacceptable to the Government. The Opposition has steadfastly refused to acknowledge that fun disclosure alone will not ensure that the political process is Reid. N. B. sanitised. Steps have been taken to reduce campaign costs.

Bob ate should be recognised. The first part of Opposition amendment 4, relating to section 314AB, imposes upon the Australian Electoral Commission the burden of doing the Opposition's job for it. The information required by the clause to be disclosed to the AEC is already publicly available through parliamentary scrutiny and the Freedom of Information Act. The amendment is unnecessary and mischievous. The second In Committee part of amendment 4, section 314AC, also is unnecessary. Under the Government's proposal, donations by trade unions to a (10.52 political party will be required to be disclosed by both the party and the unions as a third party. Furthermore, the Industrial Relations Act requires disclosure to the Industrial Registrar of all loans and grants or donations over $1,000. Opposition amendment 5 is essentially a statement of principle. As a criminal sanction it would be very difficult to enforce and to obtain a conviction. The intention behind the amendment is best achieved by the proposed section 327 in clause 21 of the Bill, which makes it an offence to interfere with political liberty by hindering or interfering with a person's right to make a gift to a political party. Opposition amendment 7 is also rejected by the Government. Even assuming it could be justified, which the Government doubts, it would be easily avoided. It is bizarre for the Opposition to lecture the Government on freedom of speech when it attempts, in this way, to muzzle groups who wish to participate in the electoral process. Opposition amendments 8 and 10 would have the effect of enabling an election or referendum result to be overturned because of a breach of the Broadcasting Act. This would be a most unacceptable outcome. The Government opposes the amendments. The other proposed amendments are primarily consequential or formal. They are rejected by the Government. The Government foreshadows an amendment to be moved in the Senate. This amendment is in respect of charities and like organisations. The ban applies to advertisements containing political matter whether they are run on behalf of a charity or anyone else. Normal fundraising campaigns will not be affected. The intention of including charities in the general prohibition on advertisements containing political matter was to prevent a loophole being created. The Government has received representation from legitimate charitable organisations requesting reconsideration of its position. Whilst the Government remains committed to the need for integrity in the operation of the ban, it still holds the view that advertisements which refer directly to fundraising, regardless of the charitable purpose, would not be affected by the ban. However, the Government accepts the concerns of legitimate charities that they should be able to continue to advertise, to the extent that they actually do use the medium in a way which focuses public attention upon the social needs behind the appeal. The Government, therefore, foreshadows that following the preparation of an appropriate formula which will exempt advertisements by bona fide charities and not create a loophole for abuse by others, we will be amending the Bill in the Senate accordingly. I note further that this will accommodate one of the major points of concern raised by the Human Rights Commissioner and it appeals to the Opposition. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 2 agreed to. Clauses 3 to 8-by leave-taken together.  p.m.)-by leave-I move: (2) Pages 2-12, omit Part 2 (comprising clauses 3 to 8). I foreshadow amendments 8, 9 and 10. Amendment 2 seeks to delete part 2 of the Bill. It is part 2 of the Bill which contains the proposed ban on political advertising on the electronic media by way of inserting a new part HID into the Broadcasting Act 1942. I foreshadow amendment No.8, which seeks to omit clause 22 of the Bill. I foreshadow amendment No.9, which seeks to delete part 4 of the Bill. I foreshadow amendment 10, which seeks to delete part 5 of the Bill. Amendment negatived. Clauses agreed to. Clauses 9 to II-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 12.  p.m.)-The Opposition opposes clause 12 of the Bill. Related to this is Opposition amendment 6, which I foreshadow. Our objections relate to increased public funding of Senate elections. Clause 12 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection 294 (2) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to increase the amount of public moneys payable for the conduct of Senate election campaigns. Clause 12 seeks to increase the relevant amount from 30c to 60c for every first preference vote given for a candidate or a group in a Senate election. The coalition opposes any increase in public expenditure for election campaigns. For this reason the Opposition opposes clause 12. In foreshadowing Opposition amendment 6, it seeks to omit clause 20, and it flows from amendment 3 which seeks to omit clause 12. Clause agreed to. Clauses 13 to J4-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 15.",165
273,Mr KERIN,AYES NOES,"by leave-I move: (1) Clause 15, page 14, proposed subsection 314AA (1), line 25, omit ""4"", substitute ""8"".

C. ulars of a person or organisation referred to in paragraph (1) (a), (b) or (c) to be included in a return in the prescribed circumstances."".  p.m.)-I rise to oppose the two Government amendments to this clause. I do so because one of the amendments is outrageous. I was loath to speak because of the guillotine, but amendment (2) reads: Subsection (1) does not require particulars of a person or organisation referred to in paragraph (1) (a), (b) or (c) to be included in a return in the prescribed circumstances."". There is no definition of 'prescribed circumstances' in the Bill or in the Electoral Act; therefore, it can only mean that circumstances can be prescribed by way of regulation. The Government can therefore make a regulation to exclude any disclosure by the Australian Labor Party.",167

337,Dr KEMP,UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA,"Goldstein) (I 1.51 p.m.)The Government has behaved disgracefully in relation to this Bill. It has put forward amendments now which it could have put forward months ago. It is disgraceful that these amendments arc coming forward at this time, after the Government of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the University of Canberra have been kept in doubt about the status of their institutions for months. These amendments have never been justified by the Government; the original Bill was never justified by the Government. No argument was ever put forward by the Government to justify its original position that the Chief Minister of the substitutACT could not appoint members of the Legislative Assembly. We oppose that. Now the Government, at the very last moment, having disrupted activities and created anxieties in the University of Canberra and, having caused a great deal of controversy and doubt within the Australian Capital Territory, is bringing forward amendments. The University of Canberra knew nothing about this Bill and these amendments. As the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) knows, when this Bill was introduced into the chamber the university had no idea of its implications. It shows the contempt with which this Government is treating higher education in Australia. It is symbolic of what has happened to this country in higher education, grinding down the quality of these institutions and forcing changes to them without consultation with those involved. Morale in higher education has never been lower as a result of the activities of this Minister, and it is no wonder. There has never been a policy of higher education pursued which has been based on less consultation and less concern for quality in this country than there is at the present time. Mr Baldwin inteljecting",175
338,Mr SPEAKER,UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA,Order! The Minister will cease interjecting.,175
339,Dr KEMP,UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA,"The Minister does not want to hear the truth about this matter because he knows that his reputation is rock bottom in this country at the present time. He is seen as a person who has no real understanding of the needs of the institutions that he is supposed to administer. His reputation has caused him to become a laughing stock. Members of the campus of the University of Canberra were discussing with me last week their total bewilderment at the way in which this legislation had been brought through. Yet the Minister had months in which to consult on this matter. There was public controversy in the press. The Government arrogantly proceeded-presumably the Minister is opcrating under the directives of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), whose lap-dog he is. No argument was ever put forward by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to justify the restrictions he intended to impose on the rights of the Government of the ACT to appoint members to the Council of the University of Canberra. Now, at the very last moment, these amendments are introduced by the Government, again without explanation and without any credit given to the institutions that are going to be affected by them. They have been treated with contempt.",175
340,Mr SPEAKER,UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA,"Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a third time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. COURTS (MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION) BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",176
341,Mr DUFFY,UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The introduction of this Bill honours a commitment made by the Primc Minister (Mr Hawke) on 20 March 1990 that the Government would introduce legislation to facilitate alternative dispute resolution in the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia. This Bill enables the courts to providc parties with a greater choice of methods of dispute resolution. As well as the traditional methods of judicial determination and those mcthods of alternative dispute resolution already provided by the courts, the Fedcral Court and the Family Court will be able to offcr litigants and potcntial litigants the options of mediation and arbitration. These options can provide efficient and cost effective alternatives to the judicial process for the resolution of many disputes. Fully contcsted litigation is invariably cxpcnsive and time consuming, both for the parties and the public in the provision of courts and judicial officers. The expense and strcss involved in protracted litigation may mcan that judicial determination of a dispute is not a practical or appropriate solution in many cases, and the availability of non-litigious methods of disputc rcsolution will provide savings in terms of cost and time while ensuring that there is a means whereby a dispute can be brought to an end. The Bill allows for the development of mediation in both courts. In mediation, a neutral third pcrson assists the parties to arrive at their own solution to their dispute. Mediation is particularly suitable for parties who need to preserve ongoing relationships. The cssenee of mediation is that the parties are empowered to produce the result that is best suited to their own individual and collective needs. Commcrcial litigants can benefit from speedy, cost efficient resolution of disputes without the strain to a business relationship that can result from protracted litigation. Other types of disputes can also benefit from a less hostile process of resolution. In family matters, even when a couple have decided to end their relationship, communication between them may need to be preserved over a long period where q ucstions of the custody of and access to children are involved. Avoidance of a bitter and formal legal battle is to be preferred, allowing both parties to concentrate on the issues in dispute, including nonlegal issues, and assisting them to find the solution that best provides for the welfare of their children. Mediation may be more likely to lead to a final resolution of personal issues than litigation, as parties are able to fashion their solutions without being limited to legal remedies. It is well known that most cases are resolved without recourse to a fully contested hearing. However, many litigants incur expense and delay by waiting until a matter is 'at the door of the court, before attempting to settle. It is expected that the availability of courtannexed mediation will encourage those parties who can settle to do so carlier in their proceedings. Even if the mcdiation is unsuccessful and the dispute is presented for judicial determination, the issues in dispute should be better defined, resulting in faster resolution by the court. Arbitration is the determination of a dispute by a third person who is not a judge. It has been used to resolve commercial disputes for many years and is particularly suitable for the determination of disputes that do not involve complex matters of law. While not offering the same non-financial benefits or cost efficiency as mediation, parties who choose to use an independent arbitrator may have their disputes resolved more quickly. It is recognised by both the Government and the courts that not all disputes are suitable for resolution by mediation or arbitration. For example, in matters in which child abuse or domestic violence is alleged, mediation is not appropriate. To be successful, mediation must have the cooperation and participation of both parties. If the power balance between the parties is unequal, or one party is not prepared to negotiate, then mediation may not be the best method for the resolution of the dispute. Arbitration may not be appropriate if the matter in dispute is one of public importance or involves complex questions of law. The legislation recognises these issues and limits the matters that may be heard by an arbitrator in the Family Court and gives both courts the power to make rules to determine those matters appropriate for referral to mediation or arbitration. Judicial determination of a dispute will always be available to those parties who do not wish to use arbitration or mediation or when mediation has been attempted but has been unsuccessful. The Bill does not diminish the jurisdiction of either the Federal Court or the Family Court. It can be seen that the courts retain control over the enforcement of the outcomes of mediation and arbitration. What this Bill docs is to provide the courts with the legislative framework in which they might develop those forms of alternative dispute resolution in a manner - est suited to their jurisdictions by mak1I1g rules of court to define and prescribe procedures. This Bill amends the Family Law Act 1975 to allow the Family Court of Australia to make rules to provide for mediation in the court. It is expected that the rules will provide guidance as to the types of dispute which arc appropriate for mediation and the manner in which a mediation might proceed. If the court decides !o make rules for mediation, parties may, 111 accordance with those rules, apply to the court for referral to a mediator. They may apply before litigation has commenced or at any time during proceedings. The court has the power to refer suitable matters to mediation, at any stage in proceedings, with the consent of the parties. The Bill also amends the Family Law Act to provide for two separate methods of arbitration. Arbitration can be made available in the Family Court or be conducted by private arbitrators. Private arbitration may be used in property or spousal maintenance disputes, by parties who choose to have their dispute determined by an arbitrator who has been prescribed in the regulations as a person who may conduct a private arbitration. The Bill enables the parties to apply to the court for orders to assist the conduct of an arbitration and to enforce an arbitral award. The Family Court will have power to ma-e rules so that it may refer spousal ma1l1tenan-e. or matrimonial property matters ansmg under part VIn of the Family Law Act to arbitrators with or without the consent of the parties. The limitations on the matters that may be arbitrated ensure that the Family Court retains sole responsibility for the determination of disputes involving children, and that arbitration can be used only in those areas that are most likely to be appropriate for a non-judicial determination of the dispute. Finally, the Bill amends the Family Law Act to allow the court to refer a matter to an assessor for examination and report. It is expected that the use of assessors, where appropriate, will assist the court to resolve those disputes before it quickly and efficiently, and thereby further the aim of this Bill. This Bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to allow the Federal Court to refer suitable matters to mediation and to make rules of court defining the procedure to be followed. In the Federal Court parties have for some time been able to register arbitrator's awards. This Bill allows the Federal Court to refer matters to arbitration with the consent of the parties and provides that an award made in court-referred arbitration may also be registered and enforced. The legislation does not limit the types of matters that the Federal Court may refer to arbitration. If a matter, or a part of a matter, is referred to an arbitrator by either the Federal Court or the Family Court, the parties have a right to a full re-hearing of that matter. This provides safeguards as to the quality of decision making, and ensures that justice is not forgone in the pursuit of economy or efficiency. Both the Family Court and the Federal Court presently offer methods of alternative, or assisted, dispute resolution. The Family Court, through its counselling service and registrar conferences, has, since 1976, been at the forefront in offering non-litigious methods for solving disputes. The Federal Court commenced a system of assisted dispute resolution since 1987. The program provides for parties to attend mediation conferences with registrars. The initiatives outlined in this Bill should be seen as part of a wider Government commitment to alternative dispute resolution. As part of its commitment to family services the Government funds community organisations to provide family mediation services throughout Australia. It has also provided funds for the coordination and evaluation of current legal aid commission initiatives in the alternative dispute resolution area and provided considerable funding for marriage counselling, marriage education and family therapy. The Government also recognises the work done by such organisations as the Institute of Arbitrators, the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration, Lawyers Engaged in Alternative Dispute Resolution and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre in providing alternative dispute resolution services for commercial clients in both international and domestic disputes. The Government will continue to support the use of alternative dispute resolution methods in its own contractual arrangements. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and I commend the Bill to the House.  journed. Friday, 31 May 1991 NA NA 1991 Bill presented by Mr Duffy, and read a first time. Second Reading",176
342,Mr DUFFY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Proceeds of Crime Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 will set up the confiscated assets trust fund. The trust fund will turn the assets confiscated from major crime, particularly drug trafficking, back against the illicit drug trade. Such a fund was foreshadowed by the previous Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, when introducing the Proceeds of Crime Bill in 1987. Details of the trust fund were announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the election campaign in March 1990. The trust fund is a significant further step in the Government's war on organised crime. The Government has realised that in the attack on organised crime it is not sufficient to merely put criminals behind bars. The most effective method of uprooting a criminal organisation is to sever its lifeline of money. There is growing evidence that the Government's proceeds of crime initiative is making significant inroads in this direction. Up to 30 June 1990 nearly $7m had been recovered and paid to the revenue as a result of the action under the Proceeds of Crime Act and the related provisions of the Customs Act. A further $47m was frozen under restraining orders pending the making of future confiscation orders. From 1 July 1990 to the end of April 1991 a further $2m has been recovered under the Proceeds of Crime Act and the narcotics provisions of the Customs Act. Similar trust funds operate in a number of Australian States where the money is used for law enforcement purposes as well as for the rehabilitation of drug users and the compensation of victims of crime. This ensures that the community benefits from the assets confiscated from criminals. As well, a trust fund has operated for a numberofyears in the United States of America. The trust fund will comprise funds confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act or the drug trafficking provisions of the Customs Act. The trust fund will also comprise proceeds resulting from the confiscation of the property of major drug offenders, and those guilty of revenue fraud, generally tax fraud, customs scams and medifraud. Forfeited property, vehicles and other assets will generally be and the proceeds placed in the trust fund. In some cases, however, seized equipment may be of direct use to law enforcement agencies. In such cases I will retain my existing power to direct that the equipment be given to the law enforcement agency for operational use. Eventually that property will be sold and the proceeds of sale paid to the trust fund. It is anticipated that the amount paid to the trust fund will be around $9m over the next three years. The major portion of this money will be earmarked for payment to law enforcement projects and to drug rehabilitation and drug education schemes. The money in the trust fund will be designated either as 'distributable funds' or as 'suspended funds'. Suspended funds are identified in proposed paragraph 34C (1) (a) of the Proceeds of Crime Act, which is contained in clause 19 of the Bill. The first purpose for which suspended money is required is for payments to the States or the Northern Territory under the equitable sharing program. This program provides for the sharing by the Commonwealth with the States and the Northern Territory of confiscated assets where the amount recovered has resulted from a joint investigation involving participation by law enforcement agencies of both jurisdictions. The first payments under this scheme were made by the Commonwealth in February of this year, when an amount of $62,000 was paid to Western Australia and an amount of $121,505 was paid to New South Wales. Crime, particularly organised crime, does not recognise any State boundaries. To fostcr a high lcvel of cooperation it is imperative to recognise the contributions made by State law enforcement agencies to the prosecution of major criminals and the confiscation of their property. The second purpose for which 'suspendcd funds' are required is for repatriation to a foreign country where this is required by a particular mutual assistance arrangement to which Australia is a party. sold For example, if a forfeiture order made in a foreign order is registered in Australia under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and, as a result, property is confiscated, .then the amount recovered will be paid to the trust fund. Ordinarily, Australia's mutual assistance arrangements do not provide for repatriation. Property recovered is usually retained by tqe jurisdiction which enforced the confiscation order. However, if the arrangement does provide for repatriation, the amount will be paid out of 'suspended funds' from the trust fund. Confiscation orders may be made under legislation in each State, apart from Tasmania and the Northern Territory. The ACT is also in the process of preparing its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminal assets. Where this State or Territory legislation is prescribed as a 'corresponding law' under the Proceeds of Crimes Act, orders made under the State Act may be registered under the Commonwealth Act. Registration enables the State or Territory order to be enforced against property located in a Commonwealth Territory. Registration also facilitates the enforcement of the State order against property located overseas under Australia's mutual assistance arrangements. Accordingly, if money is repatriated to Australia under such an arrangement and it derives from the enforcement of a State order, the money will be paid to the trust fund. However, provision has been made for an appropriate amount to be paid from suspended funds to the State or Territory government. The bulk of the trust fund will be 'distributable funds'. These funds will be targeted at law enforcement programs and at drug rehabilitation and drug education programs. Law enforcement projects which promote the investigation, detection or prosecution of serious criminal offences will be funded from the trust fund. The Australian Federal Police, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Customs Service will be some of the law enforcement agencies which will benefit from the Trust Fund in this way. So far as the funding of drug rehabilitation and drug education schemes is concerned, the particular programs to be funded will be selected by the Minister of State responsible for health matters, who will be able to consult with such advisory bodies on drug related matters as he considers appropriate. My colleague the Hon. Peter Staples, who has responsibility for the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, intends that the money available for drug rehabilitation and drug education programs will be targeted at demand reduction and rehabilitation programs for illicit drugs. Therefore, all disbursements from the fund will go towards the Commonwealth's fight against illicit drugs through an emphasis on both supply and demand reduction. Naturally, there will be costs associated with the administration of the fund. Provision is made for the deduction of a prescribed management fee from suspended funds in the trust fund. Finally, provision is made for the payment out of suspended funds of money payable by the Commonwealth by way of restitution or compensation of third parties, pursuant to orders made by the court under sections 21, 22 or 31 of the Proceeds of Crime Act where property, the subject of the claim, has been paid into the fund. It is not possible to be certain about the amount of money which will be available for these purposes in any given year. However, the Government is heartened by the growing success of the proceeds of crime initiative. This initiative is aimed at severing the taproot of organised crime by cutting off the supply of money. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.  journed. NA COMMISSION BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",178
343,Mr KERIN,AUSTRALIAN WOOL REALISATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. There are nine Bills in this package of wool industry legislation. The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1991 establishes the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC). The Commission will take over the $2.7 billion debt and 4.7 million bale stockpile presently held by the Australian Wool Corporation (A WC), and be responsible for the discharge of the debt and disposal of the stockpile and other assets. The Commission will cease when the debt is discharged. This Bill also repeals the Wool Marketing Act 1987. The Australian Wool Corporation Bill 1991 will establish the new Australian Wool Corporation, which will be responsible for wool promotion and facilitation of marketing, including quality control. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development (Amendment) BilI 1991 makes a number of changes to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 which are necessary to allow the creation of the Wool Research and Development Corporation by regulation under that Act. The Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation (A WRDC) will be responsible for investigating and allocating priorities to research and development projects. It will also be responsible for funding projects and subsequently monitoring and evaluating them. The Primary Industries Councils Bill 1991 provides for primary industries councils to be established by regulation for various industries. This will then enable the creation of the Australian Wool Industry Council, which will provide advice to the Minister and the industry on the overall strategic directions of the wool industry. The Wool Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 5) 1991 provide for the setting of the wool tax at a rate of 15 per cent. The existing legislation concerning arrangements for the marketing of Australian wool, the Wool Marketing Act 1987, commenced on 1 July 1987. That legislation was enacted to govern the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation and the reserve price scheme, among other things. It is well known to the House that for many and varied reasons, pressures on the reserve price scheme became too great and the scheme became unsustainable. In 1987, wool was re-emerging as Australia's leading rural export industry and contributed almost $4 billion to our balance of payments. The reserve price scheme (RPS) had been operating effectively for 13 years, and wool had a strong position in the world textile market. As J have explained to the House in detail on several occasions over the past 12 months, the demise of the RPS has been brought about by an unprecedented combination of factors; some were at work even before the 1987 legislation was introduced, and some were totally unpredictable. With the floating of the exchange rate, the RPS was no longer able to stabilise prices simultaneously for both growers and buyers. In the mid-1980s wool was cheap in terms of buyer currencies and demand was high. Ill-conceived optimism led to a change in the role of the minimum reserve price (MRP) from that of a 'safety net' to that of an instrument to chase up the market. The then Wool Corporation lifted the MRP by 71 per cent over two years on the basis of a corporation and grower assumption that a 'new price plateau' had arrived. The value of the Australian dollar rose, our wool was less attractive and the high MRP encouraged supply. More recently, unprecedented political changes occurred in the USSR, Eastern Europe and China, which led to a substantial decline in purchases of our wool. Last year the Government, after considering industry proposals, subsequently made a number of decisions, including increasing the wool tax from 8 per cent to 18 per cent and then to 25 per cent; lowering the MRP from 870c to 700c a kilogram; removing the ceiling on AWC borrowings and guaranteeing those borrowings; enabling the Wool Corporation to establish a flock reduction scheme; and also considered the introduction of marketing quotas. The Government also set up the Vines Committee of Inquiry into the Wool Industry and the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council. Despite efforts by industry to introduce measures to curb supply and efforts to provide enough confidence in the market to boost demand, backed strongly by the Government, \ it was clear by early this year that the RPS had collapsed. With the spiralling level of debt and market forecasts at the time, the AWC announced on 1 February that auction sales were to be deferred. The Government subsequently suspended the RPS until at least 1 July 1991. Since February, interim marketing arrangements have provided for the continuation of auction sales without the RPS, pending the determination of future institutional and marketing arrangements. During this period the supplementary payments scheme has been in operation. It is now a new era. The recriminations and disappointments of the past 18 months should remain in the past, and all efforts and energy should be devoted to building a revitalised and sustainable dustry. There has been considerable effort put into determining the wool selling arrangements to apply from 1 July 1991. Numerous submissions were made to, and taken up by, the Vines inquiry; extensive consultations with various sectoral interests in the wool industry have taken place; and numerous reports and proposals about how to handle the problem have been received. All have been carefully considered. The Government has decided on the structures appropriate to take us into the next century. Some of the details in the reports received focus on operational details or strategic directions which the Government considers can be best addressed by the proposed new corporations. When they are in place, I will recommend to each of the boards that these issues, including many of the matters in the Vines report, be specifically addressed. Mr Deputy Speaker, the issues facing the wool industry can be divided into those which require strategies over the longer term and those which are more immediate, although they are of course not mutually exclusive. The longer term issues relate to the share of wool in the world textiles market and the most appropriate industry structure and institutional arrangements to support a sustainable and viable wool industry. To address those issues the Government has taken decisions setting up the new AWC and a separate Wool Research and Development Corporation which are covered in this package of legislation. It is now more important· than ever that the industry thinks creatively about its future and determines new possibilities for boosting demand for wool to ensure its long term viability. Wool's share in the world fibre market is declining but the rate of decline is misleading because of the large and growing markets in industrial, home and medical textile products for which wool is quite unsuitable. When account is taken of those uses for which wool is suitable, it retains a very important market share, especially in- in the premium sectors. Promotion, quality assurance and control and research and development are all essential in the endeavour to sell more wool and improve returns to the industry. Under the proposed package of legislation the new Australian Wool Corporation will have a facilitating role in the areas of promotion, marketing and quality control. It will oversight the activities of the International Wool Secretariat and have a major role in influencing the policies and strategies the IWS adopts. I will be recommending to the Board of the new AWC that it closely considers the recommendations of the Vines Committee relating to the governance and management of the IWS to ensure that the IWS gives Australian wool growers the best possible value for their promotion dollar. To date the wool promotion strategy has been to concentrate on top end quality markets to support a price premium over other fibres. It is only lately that the industry is putting more effort into increasing the volume of wool sold into the apparel and non-apparel wool markets. This involves rethinking promotion strategies and resource allocation. For example, the role of blends and the opportunities offered by branding are now beginning to receive close scrutiny. The new Australian Wool Corporation will set quality standards for wool and ensure those standards are met. In conjunction with this, the Corporation will have the power to prohibit the sale for cxport of wool which does not meet the quality standards set by the Corporation and also order the withdrawal from sale for export wool that does not meet the standards. Substantial penalties for offences will apply. The Corporation will be working closely with industry regarding efforts to lift the quality of Australia's wooiclip. Part of the creative thinking to be by the industry will include better producand tion methods and the adoption of new technologies to improve the efficiency of wool marketing. An obvious means to achieve a high degree of efficiency is to ensure that commercial activities, to the maximum extent possible, take place in the private sector. The new Australian Wool Corporation will be required to adopt the role of a catalyst in facilitating activities in the market, including the increased acceptance by the private sector of responsibility for marketing. The full implementation of sale by description is one such area where this could occur. Another is for increasing responsibility for quality control to be placed with industry participants. Both have moved along the track in recent years, but much more needs to be achieved and the pace of reform speeded up. The structure of the new Corporation means that it will be well placed to ensure this occurs. The development and application of new technological innovations in the industry will be the responsibility of the new Wool Research and Development Corporation. The new Australian Wool Industry Council (AWIC) will form the primary focus for the coordination of all aspects of wool industry policy. As a properly constituted policy and cOOl'dination. body for the industry it will replace the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council, which has been in operation since September last year. The AWIC is a consultative body which will not override the other corporations. It will be a source of advice to the Minister and the industry and will provide a forum within which the various sectoral bodies can discuss matters of overall industry significance. It will, either on its own initiative or at the Minister's direction, examine matters affecting the interests of the wool industry and propose overall strategic directions for the industry. The Wool Industry Council will be required to review the corporate plans of the Corporation, the Commission and the done Research and Development Corporation provide advice to the Minister. It will also be required to hold industry strategic review conferences every three years. The Council itself will be required to meet at least once every three months and there will be monthly meetings of the chairpcrsons of the Council and chairpersons of the other three wool statutory authorities. The Industry Council will be required to provide leadership for the industry in a balanccd and well-informed manner. It has been set up so that the broad range of wool industry interests are represented and well-informed decisions affecting the long term interests of the industry can be made by industry itself and by government. This arrangement can only benefit all those participating in the wool industry. Ml' Deputy Speaker, the significant issues facing the wool industry in the short term are the $2.7 billion debt and the 4,7 million bale stockpile. Also of concern is the rate of tax to apply in coming years and the ability of growers to pay it. This package puts in place measures to deal with these issues. A balance has had to be found between the national interest objectives of debt management and the health of the industry, on the one hand, and the management of the debt and stockpile and consequent financial burden on growers on the other. It is this balance that the Government has sought in its recent decisions. The management of the debt and stockpile is central to recovery from the present crisis in the wool industry. As I have stated on a number of occasions, the Government has taken the decision that responsibility for the debt and stockpile must remain with industry. Any further capitalisation of debt would delay recovery. The industry is confronted with a series of balancing acts. The elimination of the debt versus the level of tax we can reasonably expect growers to be able to afford; the use of the stockpile as an asset to reduce the debt versus the potential to adversely affect market prices for wool; and the immediate sale of non-wool assets of the AWC versus the realities of the current property market are all factors in the equation. The Government has had to make decisions which are in the best interests of both present and future wool growers, processors, merchants and all Australian taxpayers. To make our balancing act even more difficult, none of us is able to predict with any degree of certainty what the future holds. Our projections can essentially be regarded as best guesses only, albeit guesses based on past knowledge and detailed analysis. We have decided that a debt repayment program is the best way to address the debt and stockpile because of its flexibility and the elimination of any possible increase to the debt. A debt repayment program which allows the stockpile manager to meet debt targets with the best mix of property asset and wool sales is more robust and better able to adjust to market circumstances than other mechanisms considered by government. Disposal of wool from the stockpile will need to be managed carefully. The Wool Realisation Commission will be required to maximise the value of each of its sales. The announcement of an annual debt reduction target, together with a known rate of tax, will enable the market to make an estimate of the sales required from the stockpile to meet the target. The Commission will not be a mystery player. Its annual bottom line is already public. If, at the end of the repayment period and discharge of the debt, there is a surplus, this surplus is to be redistributed in a way which best benefits wool growers. The actual mechanisms for that redistribution will be worked out cooperatively at the time. The guidelines for the AWRC will provide for that to happen. Mr Deputy Speaker, the question of what is an appropriate tax rate, and in particular what is the rate that growers can afford, is critical. If the rate is too high there is a risk that the viability of the industry could be placed in jeopardy. Alternatively, if it is too low Australian taxpayers will be required to assume part of the debt on behalf of the industry and the stockpile will remain overhanging the market. The Government has announced a tax rate of 15 per cent. A number of proposals for other tax rates, which include to a greater or lesser extent assumptions about the complex or currently uncertain issues of the starting debt, production, markets and price, have been put to the Government. These proposals have been examined. However, the one thing they have in common is that they increase the risk borne by the Government on behalf of the taxpayer, when the Government is already considerably exposed as a result of the wool industry debt. On current estimates any wool tax under 15 per cent incurs additional risk for both wool growers and the Government in the event of a market downturn. Such a downturn would require either an increase in the wool tax or the sale of more wool from the stockpile. Both would reduce returns to growers. The only responsible approach for Government and industry is to adopt a wool tax rate that is both prudent and sustainable. The 15 per cent tax rate is integral to the package adopted by the Government and the Government does not intend to resile from it. The Government accepts that a 15 per cent wool tax means that significant numbers of specialist wool growers will have no farm cash operating surplus in 1991-92. However, that would be the case whether one were to adopt 12 per cent or 15 per cent. In practice, the effect of the difference on farm cash operating surplus for the average grower is in the order of hundreds of dollars, not thousands. The hard reality is that the Government is not looking to preserve each and every person in the sheep industry who was there at the 870c and 700c per kilogram floor prices. There have been many new entrants in recent years taking advantage of the high prices. It follows that some wool growers must leave the industry, irrespective of any action by the Government. The Government has announced significant increases in the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) which will assist these wool growers. Commonwealth funding for RAS has increased from its current level of $64m to up to $160m in 1991-92. Commonwealth funding could be increased further up to $240m in the next year should conditions so warrant. I am still negotiating with the States over the application of these funds. The Government's decision on wool tax also reflects its decision that responsibility for the debt will remain with the industry and the 15 per cent reflects in part the requirement to rely principally on the wool tax to service the debt. In recognition of the position wool growers face in the first year, the Government will facilitate a $200m interest free loan and has required the debt to be reduced by only $20m in 1991-92. Under the new legislation, the tax will be apportioned three ways between the AWC, the AWRC and the R&D Corporation. Each year the AWC, the AWRC and the R&D Corporation will recommend the appropriate level of tax for their requirements. Those recommendations will be taken into consideration in prescribing the rate of tax under the regulations. This Bill provides the institutional framework to address the debt management and stockpile issues through establishing. the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. On the day of commencement the assets and liabilities of the Australian Wool Corporation, with the exception of the R&D and promotion reserves, will be transferred to the Commission. The objective of the Commission will be to manage and eliminate the debt and stockpile in a manner that is in 'the best interests of the nation and wool growers in particular. The Commission will be required to acquit the debt within seven years or less and will itself cease to exist upon the sale or transfer of all assets and repayment of the debt. The Commission will have the flexibility to determine the timing and combination of asset sales and stockpile sales that can best achieve the debt reduction schedule. In the first two years it is expected that the Commission will negotiate the sale of most of the non-wool assets, including warehouses and wool stores. Wool House in Melbourne will be transferred to the Commission, but it is anticipated that it will continue to be the office premises for the Commission, the Corporation and the Research and Development Corporation. The Commission will have operational flexibility in managing releases from the stockpile but will be subject to a set of ministerial guidelines to be formulated between myself, the Minister for Finance and the Treasurer. The Commission will regularly publish figures on the stock sales achieved, the quantity remaining in the stockpile and the balance of the stockpile fund. Operators in the market will therefore have up to date knowledge of the levels of stocks held and the amount of debt remaining to be paid off, as well as likely income of the Commission through asset sales and tax levies. The Commission will also have a discrete task in the management and windup of the supplementary payments scheme. As that scheme is presently being funded by the market support fund it is most appropriate, with the transfer of the fund to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, that the Commission see the scheme through to completion. This Bill provides that the Commission will be required to develop and update annually a five-year rolling corporate plan which will be prepared after consultation with industry. The plan will be reviewed annually to ensure that the strategy for management of the debt and stockpile remains relevant and protects the interests of all participants in the lndustry and those of the Commonwealth. An annual operational plan will also be required and will be regularly reviewed. As part of this process, the Commission will be required to report annually to the industry on the results of the year's trading. The Board of the Wool Realisation Commission is to be made up of a part time chairperson and eight other members. These members will comprise the Managing Director of the AWRC, the Managing Director or another board member-other than the chairperson-of the new AWC, and five members with experience in designated fields of activity. In the case of the Commission the emphasis will be on financial and business expertise as well as commodity trading, storage and distribution, property management and woolgrowing. Two members of the Board will have experience in woolgrowing. As well, there will be a Government member. These arrangements place greater emphasis on a broad base of expertise and experience among board members so that the wider interests of the industry can be taken into account in decision making. The first Board, with the exception of the Managing Director, will be directly appointed by me, after receiving advice from a selection committee which I have already established. This committee has the same form as that provided for in the legislation. I have established this selection process in advance of the legislation to enable the boards of the Commission and the two corporations to operate from 1 July 1991. This committee is well into its task and honourable members will be aware that I have already announced the appointment of Mr David Clarke as the chairperson-designate of the Commission. Provision is made in the Bill for selection committee arrangements relating to subsequent appointments to the Board. Each selection committee will comprise seven members, a presiding member appointed by the Minister, plus six other persons appointed by the Minister, three of whom are to be appointed after consultation with the Wool Council. It is my intention that the chairperson for the AWRC will be one of the Minister's nominations for the committec making selections for the AWRC Board. The selection committee arrangements for all statutory marketing authorities (SMAs) are undcr review in the context of the Government's dccisions on the Davis report's recommendations on statutory marketing authoritics. The role of annual general meetings of SMAs are being reviewed and this may have an impact on the way wool industry representatives are nominated to selection committees. Government will assess the implications of this for the wool industry selection committee arrangements at that time. The proposed arrangements in this Bill will remain until then. The Bill also provides that the - taff of the current Awe who transfer to any of the three new organisations will preserve their rights and entitlements throughout the transitional period. The revised institutional structure will present many challenges for the stafr who transfer to one or other of the new organisations. It will be with their cooperation and support that much of the success of the new arrangements will rest. It is vital that the expertise and experience of the professional staff of the AWC is retained. The mistakes of the past cannot be laid at the feet of the staff, many of whom counselled against them. The Government is now putting in place new institutional arrangements which will take the industry into the next century. The short and the long term issues have been addressed and appropriate arrangements decided. It is up to all individuals and organisations interested in the future of the industry to get behind these arrangements and make them work. I am heartened by the response from industry to date, and I am sure that, with the right decisions by the new organisations, the wool industry will recover to regain its place as Australia's premier rural industry. I commend this Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCLachlan) adjourned. NA UNIVERSITY BILL 1991",180

NA CORPORATION BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",187
345,Mr KERIN,AUSTRALIAN WOOL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill establishes the new Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). The new Australian Wool Corporation will facilitate the adoption of appropriate strategies for the promotion of wool, the efficient marketing of Australian wool, and the adoption of proper measures to ensure a high quality for Australian wool. I have already outlined how this particular Bill fits into the total package of legislation for the wool industry. Let me make it quite clear that the role of the new AWC will not include any direct participation in the process of buying and selling wool in the market, other than for technical development purposes and market feasibility studies. The marketing of wool is a matter for the commercial sector to undertake. It is this fundamental aspect that will make the new Corporation entirely different in function and character from its predecessor. Instead of participating in the markets the new AWC will have a role as a market facilitator and will act as the catalyst to ensure that the market is operating as efficiently as possible. As part of the function of encouraging the Australian wool industry to adopt plans for the improvement of the marketing of Australian wool, the Corporation will be required to encourage the adoption of sale by description. However, it is recognised that the commercial sector may have difficulties in being able to fully take on, at least in the short term, responsibilities associated with programming of wool sales. For this reason the new Corporation will continue to be a major participant in this process for the time being. In relation to promotion, the new AWC will have the function of promoting or arranging for the promotion of all Australian wool to ensure that these programs serve the bcst intercsts of Australian woo!growers. Currently programs are primarily carried out by the International Wool Secretariat (IWS), based in London, but the present AWC carries out domestic promotion of wool in Australia. The Vines committee made a number of recommendations in relation to the governance and management of the IWS and considered that the organisation needed to come under close scrutiny to ensure that we are getting the best value for our promotional dollar. 1 will be asking the Board of the new AWC to take up these issues with the IWS as a matter of urgency, including the issue of whether, as Vines recommended, the IWS should take over responsibility for wool promotion in Australia. The new AWC will also be required to develop and implement programs to safeguard and improve the quality of Australian wool. Part of this function will be to set appropriate standards for ensuring the quality of wool and woolpacks, ensure that wool offered for sale meets relevant standards, to keep a register of woolclassers, and to encourage and facilitate the training of shearers and shedhands. The Corporation will havc appropriate regulatory powers and functions in this area but the Government would wish to see it adopt a co-operative and consultative role in seeKing to encourage rather than impose change in tMse areas. The new Australian Wool Corporation will be required to encourage the commercial sector to take responsibility for the efficient marketing of wool and will act as a catalyst in preparing the commcrcial sector for the acceptance of this responsibility. There is no doubt that there will be changes in the coming years. In the absence of the reserve price scheme, the futures market is likely to play a key role in the new market structures. Those companies that take the lead and offer the most efficient and effective service to their clients will succeed. The new AWC will be required to prepare both corporate and operational plans each year. The corporate plan will be a five-year rolling plan and will be prepared in consultation with the wool industry. The corporate plan will define princi pal goals, outline strategies and nominate performance indicators, and must receive ministerial endorsement before coming into effect. The annual operational plan will detail the activities required to give effect to the matters set out in the corporate plan but, consistent with the Davis committee recommendations, it will not specifically require my endorsement. The new AWC will hold an annual general meeting (AGM) no later than 1 May each year. A register will be established of all wool growers who have paid wool tax and who have applied to be registered for AGM purposes. The AGM will provide an opportunity for registered growers to debate and vote on motions to receive the annual financial statement and annual report of the AWC, to vote on recommendations relating to the prescribing of a wool tax rate, and to have the capacity to propose motions of no confidence in the AWC Board. These arrangements reflect the Government's decisions on the Davis committee recommendations to improve accountability of statutory marketing authorities (SMAs) to their shareholders, who in this case are the wool growers. The constitution of the Board and Board selection arrangements will be similar to those for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The Board will be made up of a chairperson and eight members. These will include the Managing Director of the new AWC, the Managing Director or another director-excluding the Chairman - of the Wool Research and Development Corporation, and five other members with special expertise or experience. The special expertise required will be in wool growing, wool processing, marketing of commodities, finance, product promotion, business management, and industry standards and quality control. There will also be a Government representative. In an endeavour to make appointments to the Board so that it can operate from 1 July 1991, the initial Board will be directly appointed by me after r receive advice from a selection committee which 1I have already established. That process is already under way. I have already announced Mr Mac Drysdale as the chairperson designate. The appointment of the Managing Director will be up to the Board, and Managing Director of the Research and Devclopment Corporation will of course be appointed by the Board of the Research and Development Corporation. Appointments to subsequent boards will be made through the selection process outlined in the Bill. As I mentioned earlier, these selection committee arrangements may be varied if and when changes are madc to selection arrangements for other SMAs. This Bill and the package of associated legislation provide for an institutional structure and market arrangements which will enable the wool industry to recover from the present crisis and establish a sustainable and viable future for the Australian wool industry. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present its explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCLachlan) adjourned. NA NA NA BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time.

['he purpose of this Bill is to amend the )rimary Industries and Energy Research .nd Development Act 1989 to provide he establishment, constitution and opertion of a Wool Research and Developnent Corporation (WRDC). The only provision in the Bill which pplies to all research and development R&D) corporations established under the 'rincipal Act, not just the Corporation to e established for the wool industry, is a rovision removing the 65 year age limit )r directors of R&D corporations.

The Bill also contains parallel provisions to those in the Bills establishing the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the new AWC which provide for the transition to the new structure, including a provision preserving the rights and entitlements of employees of the current AWC who transfer to the Wool R&D Corporation. As part of its charter, the Wool R&D Corporation will need to establish direct links and better coordination arrangements with the International Wool Secretariat. The Chairman of the Wool R&D Corporation will be asked to take this matter up with the Board and with the International Wool Secretariat. Such a realignment of the linkage with the IWS will ensure that R&D work done by the IWS is fully in accord with R&D Corporation priorities and will facilitate better coordination of R&D commercialisation done by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and IWS.

347,Mr KERIN,WOOL TAX AMENDMENT BILLS,"I move: That the Bills be now read a second time. These Bills will make a number of amendments to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos. 1 to 5) 1964. The rate of wool tax that can be imposed on shorn wool other than carpet wool under each Act will be reduced from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. The actual rate at which wool tax is currently imposed will be reduccd from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for shorn wool other than carpet wool. The ratc for carpet wool increases from 3.85 per cent to 4 per cent. In addition the Bills providc for lower rates of tax to be prescribed by regulations. Wool tax comprises three components-debt management, promotion and research and development-and the components for 1991-92 will be set at 11 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. The increase in the rate of tax for carpet wool reprcsents an increase in the research and development component for all wool, including carpet wool, from 0.35 per cent to 0.5 pcr cent in an effort to maintain an adequate level of funding for research and development projects. These changes will take effect on 1 July 1991. The existing Wool Tax Acts inelude a provision for the imposition of an additional tax surcharge of 20 per cent on shorn wool other than carpet wool. The surcharge has never been imposed and the Bills will remove the surcharge proviSIOns. I commend the Bills to honourable members and present the explanatory memoranda.

348,Mr KERIN,WOOL TAX AMENDMENT BILLS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of industry councils for certain primary industries. There are already industry councils for the meat, horticulture and pig industries. These councils have made significant contributions to policy development in their respective industries. In October last ycar, as part of the response to the recommendations of the report of Davis Committee of Review of Commonwealth Statutory Marketing Authorities, the Government foreshadowed the extension of statutory policy councils to the wool and grains industries. This Bill provides a legislative framework under which industry councils can be established by regulation for particular primary industries. The Government will be taking early action to establish wool and grains industry councils following the passage of the Bill. In the casc of wool, the Australian Wool Industry Council will replace the interim Wool Policy Council established in September last year. The object of the industry coundls established under this legislation, as is the case for the existing industry policy councils, will be to facilitate the development of sound government policies for these industries by bringing together representatives of different participants in an industry to have an active role in advising the Minister on policy formulation. The functions and powers of the councils, set out in part 2 of the Bill, provide that the industry councils will be given a more central role in reviewing and coordinating industry policy than is the case for the existing policy councils. This is reflected, for example, in the first function listed in the Bill, under which an industry council is required to review and report on the strategic direction of the industry. In carrying out this function, a council will need to review the activities and general strategies of the other statutory authorities in the industry, specifically the statutory marketing authorities and the research and devclopment corporations and councils. The coordinating role of the industry councils will also be strengthened in a number of other ways. The councils will be able to convenc industry review conferences and can be required to do so under the regulations. It is my intention that the Australian Wool Industry Council will convene such conferences every three years. The convening of review conferences by the Grains Industry Council is a matter for discussion with the grains industry. There is also provision for the councils to convene regular meetings of the chairpersons of other statutory bodies in the industry and the regulations may require that such meetings be held. The purpose of these meetings is to enable the chairpersons of each of the industry's statutory authorities to be well informed of the activities of their counterpart organisations and thus ensure the coordinated development of industry strategy. In the case of the Australian Wool Industry Council, in order to maximise consultation and coordination in the wool industry at this critical time, monthly meetings will be held of the chairpersons of the Council, the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. Part III of the Bill provides for such matters as the composition of industry councils, appointments to the councils and meetings of the Council. The membership of each council will be determined in the regulations following consultation with the industry concerned. In a media release of 30 April 1991, the Government announced that the proposed membership of the Australian Wool Industry Council would comprise a chairperson selected by the Minister; the chairpersons of the new Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Wool Research and Development Corporation; as well as the prcsidents of exporters', brokers', private treaty merchants' and processors' organisations; and a government member. Membership will typically cover the major industry sectors which together make up the particular industry or industries covered by the Industry Council. This will, of course: include rcpresentatives of key industry producer and processor organisations. The membcrship is also likely to include the chairpersons of relevant statutory marketing authorities and research and development corporations or councils. Depending on the particular circumstances of the industry, mcmbers may take office in their capacity as office-holders in industry organisations, may be appointed on the nomination of industry bodies or may be appointed directly by the Minister. Meetings of an industry council will be held on a regular basis and at such frequencies as may be required by the regulations. Regulations will be prepared which will require the Australian Wool Industry Council to meet at least four times a year. Part IV of the Bill provides councils with the power to establish committees and working groups. This is intended to ensure that, if required, the Council can set up functional committees or subject specific working groups. Provision is available under this Bill for working groups to actively involve a broad range of people, including Council members. The provisions of part V of the Bill include arrangements for employing and hiring staff and requirements for an annual report to be prcpared and submitted to Parliament. Funds allocated for the Interim Wool Policy Council of $250,000 in 1990-91 and $300,000 in the two subsequent years, will be carried over to the new Wool Industry Council when it is established. Funding will be reviewed in 1992-93. The operating costs for the Grains Industry Council will be met by the Government and are estimated at this stage to be $430,000 in 1991-92. Subsequent funding ofithe Council will be reviewed during 1991-92. Funding arrangements for any other councils established under this Act will be considered prior to their establishment. The Government believes that industry councils established under this Act will provide an important focus for the industries they are set up to serve as well as providing an important link between industry and the Government in the development of national policies relevant to those industries. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) . adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time.

349,Mr KERIN,FISHERIES MANAGEMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Government regards the effective management of the Commonwealth's fisheries as a very important responsibility and throughout its term it has been committed to improving that management. Last December the Fisheries Administration Bill was introduced into Parliament. That Bill will establish a new statutory authority-the Australian Fisheries Management Authority-to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities. The Bill before us now, together with supporting legislation, provides the powers for the new authority to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities. This new legislation will replace both the Fisheries Act 1952 and the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Rcsources) Act 1968 and will establish a framework for the management of Commonwealth fisheries well into the twentyfirst century. This Bill has been the result of the most intensive review and examination of Commonwealth fisheries management since the 1950s-a review which culminated in the policy statement releascd in December 1989 New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s. The Bill will give effect to the three objectives of fisheries management identified in the policy statement: - to ensure that fisheries resources are not over-exploited and that any exploitation is at a level wh ich can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment; - to enable commercial fish ing operations to be as economically efficient as possible, using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatcst net returns; and 1991 - to create conditions wherc fishermcn are able to earn significant profIts from which to make a payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain, recognising that such a payment should not reduce the profitability of fishing operations to less than their current levels. The first of these objectives concerns the conservation of the rcsource, and more generally, the conservation of the marine environment. The Government regards the protection of fisheries from over-exploitation as a matter of the utmost importance. Honourable members would be aware that the Government has consistently emphasised the importance of sustainable development and sustainable resource management policies. Put simply, the Government believes it has a duty to the community to ensure that the nation's resources are protected and preserved so that future generations can continue to benefit from them. This Bill also has specific provisions to control fishing activities which are harmful to the marine environment, such as driftnet fishing. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has consistently emphasised Australia's policy of seeking a global ban on large scale driftnet fishing. This legislation bans pelagic driftnet fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone and will also enable the Government to ratify the convention for the prohibition of fishing with long driftnets in the South Pacific. The fisheries resource is an excellent example of a renewable natural resource that can be managed in a balanced way so as to yield rcturns in both the present and the future. Of course, the resource also has uses other than commercial fishing, and these too must be managed in an ecologically sustainable framework. These broader aspects of aquatic resource management are now being examined through the ecologically sustainable development process that the Government initiated last year. At various times there have been suggestions from some that fisheries should be treated as though they were a resource to be mined and that it would not matter if a fishery or fish species was pushed to the verge of extinction if that maximised profits. The Government docs not accept this argument and I wish to make it perfectly clear that the conservation objcctive of fisheries management may in some cases limit our ability to achieve the second objective of achieving the maximum economic return from the resource. For example, in a multi species fishery it may be necessary to limit the catch of species which are not under threat if continued fishing were to endanger other species that were part of the catch. Fortunately this situation is not likely to occur frequently, and in most cases the most efficient level of exploitation of eries resources will be quite consistent with the conservation objective. Having said this, it should be emphasised that the Government is also committed to ensuring that fishing is undertaken as economically and efficiently as possible. This means reducing excessive levels of fishing capacity, keeping regulations, especially those which impede efficiency, to a minimum, and ensuring that fisheries administration is results oriented and cost-effective. In this regard the Government's northern prawn fishery restructuring arrangements will be a most significant achievement and will significantly increase fishing efficiency while reducing pressure on the resource in the Commonwealth's most valuable fishery. The third objective of management, that of creating conditions where the industry is able to pay a return to the community for the use of its resource, has been widely misunderstood and misrepresented. This Government is not about to take steps which will frustrate, impede or restrict commercial initiatives. Nor will it take actions which would reduce the valuable contribution which the fishing industry makes to the national economy. However, the Government does accept the principle that our scarce and valuable fisheries resources should, where possible, be priced so that sensible decisions about exploitation are taken. This is entirely consistent with our sustainable development policies. In practice what this means is that our scarce fisheries resources will be carefully husbanded in both a biological and an economic sense so that many generations of Australians will benefit from their use. It also means that fishermen who are given privileged access to public resources which enable them to make very large profits-super profits which exceed normal levels of profitability-should pay a share of these super profits to the community. The fisheries policy statement made it quite clear that a community return would only be sought where new super profits were generated-mainly from restructurfishing existing fisheries to make them more profitable. At this stage the most likely fishery in which the Government can foresee super profits arising from restructuring is the northern prawn fishery. While the details of the community return in the northern prawn fishery have not been finalised, industry can be assured that it will not be introduced until after the restructuring is complete, that the new arrangements will not be onerous, and that the industry will have the opportunity to be involved before the details are finalised. It is also appropriate to take this opportunity to reassure the industry on another matter. Honourable members would be aware that the Industry Com_ mission is currently investigating the appropriate level of cost recovery which the industry is to pay for the management of Commonwealth fisheries. This reference to the Industry Commission is not intended to delay the establishment of the new management authority-it is not to be a further review of Commonwealth fisheries management per se, but rather a very focused review of cost recovery levels and procedures. The National Fishing Industry Council has sought assurance that cost recovery levels will not be changed from the current arrangements until the Industry Commission review is complete and has been considered by the Government. The Government is happy to give this assurance, and it is appropriate to reiterate a commitment made on page 111 of the fisheries policy statement, namely, that 'as an interim arrangement (until the Industry Commission review is complete), the Government will require the industry to meet the same proportion of the combined costs of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy Fisheries Group that it meets of the total costs of the Australian fisheries service's operations in the final two years of existence'. I turn now to the Bill before us and the significant changes it makes to the way fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone is to be administered-particularly in relation to the role of plans of management and the new arrangements to be introduced for Commonwealth fishing licences. In 1985 this Government introduced the first plan of management for a Commonwealth fishery into Parliament. The plan was for the southern bluefin tuna fishery. Since that time the usefulness of plans of management for fisheries administration has been repeatedly demonstrated, and fisheries plans of management will continue to be central to this legislasult tion. A plan of management will contain all the necessary information about the fishery including a description of the fishery either by area, species or fishing method used, or some combination of these. It will contain all the rules of the fishery and will describe what the statutory fishing right is, including any conditions such as constraints on transferability. The board of the new Fisheries Management Authority will establish management advisory committees containing industry representatives and these committees will play a fundamental role in the development of the plans of management. The management advisory committees will of course be accountable to the board of the Authority. In conjunction with the increased emphasis on plans of management the Government is making some important changes to Commonwealth fishing boat licences in order to achieve greater certainty and control over fishing operations in Commonwealth waters. There are two reasons for these changes. First, the Government believes it is appropriate for the ongoing nature of fishing rights in established fisheries-those administered through a plan of management-to be recognised and recorded in a formal fishing rights register. This will give fishermen greater security, and will establish the rights as an asset against which they can borrow. At the same time, it is important for the Government to have greater knowledge about, and control of, fishing activities being undertaken in parts of the Australian Fishing Zone. which are not subject to formal management arrangements. The existing Commonwealth fishing boat licence which allowed holders to fish anywhere in the Australian Fishing Zone other than in a managed fishery did not allow this control and this has inevitably contributed to some of the problems of excessive fishing capacity which are now being faced. The new licensing arrangements will rein the existing Commonwealth fishing boat licence being phased out after 1 July 1991, and in its place there will be various types of fishery-specific entitlements. These entitlements will authorise fishing activities in specific areas of Commonwealth waters. One of the main forms of fishery-specific entitlement will be a statutory fishing right created through a plan of management, which will recognise longer term access to established fisheries. This level of access can be compared to the endorsement of the current licence to operate in a managed fishery; under the existing system licences are only issued for 12 months and could at least theoretically not be reissued. Under the new licence system, provided that levies are paid, and that fisheries regulations are adhered to, it will normally be ongoing in nature and will provide guaranteed access beyond the current one-year licensing period. Details of statutory fishing rights will be recorded in a statutory fishing rights register which will also record third party, or mortgage holder, interests. The register will merely be a record of a third party interest and will not give that interest any effect or validity it does not otherwise have. Any tninsactions relative to a statutory fishing right must involve all parties with a recorded interest in that right. Where a third party has an interest in a statutory fishing right it will be the responsibility of that party to ensure their interests are protected by recording that interest in the register. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority will not recognise any interest unless it is recorded in the register. Another type of fishery-specific entitlement will be a fishing permit. Fishing permits will normally apply in those fisheries where there is no plan of management, and they will be issued for fixed periods of time up to five years. They will not confer an ongoing right to the fishery and will not be recorded in the statutory fishing rights register. The fishing permit will apply to a specified boat and will define the area, species and gear which can be used for fishing. It will also contain the conditions with which the holder must comply. The application for a fishing permit will seek details of the proposed operations, and the fishing permit will limit operations to those specified in the permit. Fishing permits will also be used for fishing related activities including the eration of fish processing or carrier boats or to allow the testing of fishing gear in otherwise closed areas. The Fisheries Levy Act 1984 will be replaced by the Fisheries Levy Bill 1991. This will enable levy payments for both of these new fishery-specific entitlements to be collected. This legislation will contain provisions similar to those of the Fisheries Act 1952 for scientific exploration and foreign fishing activity in the Australian Fishing Zone through the issue of scientific permits and foreign fishing licences. A scientific permit will provide for short-term access and allow a specific program of scientific work or exploratory fishing to be undertaken. There will be no charge for a scientific permit, and the fishing operations undertaken with it will be closely controlled by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, in consultation with appropriate research agencies. Conditions will be attached to a scientific permit as appropriate, such as the provision of research data and the carriage of scientific observers. A foreign fishing licence will also be fishery-specific, will be valid for up to one year, and will be subject to the payment of fees and levies, as well as other fisheryspecific conditions. The Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Act 1981 will be replaced by the Foreign Fishing Licences Levy Bill 1991 in order to collect the levy payments and the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Act 1981 will be replaced by the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill 1991 to collect payments from overseas governments or commercial interests for access to the Australian Fishing Zone. These new levy Bills do not change the basis of levy collection from foreign fishing boats but simply place that collection within the framework of the new legislative instruments and administrative arrangements. The Government recognises that effective fisheries management and scientific research depend on accurate and timely records of fish caught and fishing operations. One focus of this package of legislation is to improve both of these areas op- of activity, and an improvement in the quality of fishing logbook information is critical to this. Under this Bill fishermen will be required to complete their logbooks in an accurate and timely manner, and there will be penalties for failing to submit logbooks and for providing false information. The fisheries policy statement clearly indicated that the Government would not auction the access rights of existing fishercompasses men in developed fisheries, but that there could be circumstances in which some of the rights in new fisheries would be subject to competitive bidding. This policy is given effect in the associated Bill, the tutory Fishing Righ ts Charge Bill 1991. I hasten to add that the Government clearly recognises that it is most important to provide incentives for exploration and development of new fisheries, otherwise no new fisheries will be found. Consequently, any decisions to embark on an auction of new fishing rights will only be undertaken after the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is satisfied that the interests of the discoverer, or discoverers, of the new resource have been catered for . or that they received an adequate return to justify their risk and their investment. I now wish to makc a few remarks about surveillance and enforcement of fisheries management. The best system of fisheries management will only work if it is effectively enforced. The Government recognises that the best way of encouraging fishermen to comply with regulations is to involve them in the decision making process, and is achieving this through the management advisory committees. However, it is also important for there to be an effective system of monitoring, control and surveillance in order to back up fisheries management decisions and this, in turn, will give the industry confidence in fisheries managcment. This legislation provides the powers for the Australian Fisheries Managemcnt Authority to carry out the necessary surveillance and enforcement actions. While this section of the legislation is largely carried over from the Fisheries Act 1952, new provisions have been added to allow the licensing of fish receivers in order to facilitate the introduction of individual transferable quota schemes. The Bill maintains the provisions in the Fisheries Act 1952 which give effcct to the fisheries part of the offshore constitutional settlement. Quite clearly, fisheries management is much more effective if it can be administered in a way which enentire stocks rather than being constrained by arbitrary lines drawn on the sea. I note that we have moved some considerable distance with the States over the period in which this Government has Stabeen in office towards achieving this rationality of jurisdiction as a basis upon which to undertake effective management. However, there is still room to do more, particularly in relation to those fisheries where the same stock is caught in the waters off several different States. The new Authority will need to give this matter careful attention. The southern shark fishery is a clear example where further progress can be made, and indeed the best solution for this fishery may be to seek State agreement for the Commonwealth to assume management responsibility for all of the shark fishery . I will now comment on the provisions which this Bill makes for the review of the allocation of statutory fishing rights. This legislation establishes a specialist review panel-the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel-which will, upon application, review the allocation of statutory fishing rights created under a plan of management. The Government has bcen concerned that in the past the procedure for the review of fishing rights allocation decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not always taken sufficient account of the impact of the granting of additional rights to a particular fisherman on the total capacity of the fishery to sustain additional effort. Under the new arrangements the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will retain responsibility for considering appeals as to whether an individual satisfies the conditions specified in a plan of management for entry to a fishery. Appeals about the manner in which the available fishing rights arc to be distributed among those fishermen who satisfy the entry conditions will be considered by the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel. Where an appeal is made the Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel will undertake a review of the allocation of all fishing rights of the same class, taking account of the comparative merits of all applicants. In arriving at its decisions the panel will consider all matters affecting the well-being of the fishery. The Statutory Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel will be quite independent from the Management Authority. Each case will be reviewed by three membersa principal member appointed by the Minister and two other members chosen by the principal member from a panel of members. In the appointment of the principal member the intention is to consult with the Attorney-General as the Minister responsible for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on this matter. This will assist in ensuring that an appropriate link is maintained between the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the review panel. The panel of members will be selected by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority Selection Committee, using the same selection criteria that the committee uses to select board members. The Fishing Rights Allocation Review Panel will only be concerned with the review of decisions affecting the allocation of fishing rights and permits. Other decisions made under this legislation will continue to be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. My final remarks about this package of legislation deal with research and development in the fishing industry. Fisheries research is vital to the successful management of Australia's fisheries. A sound understanding of the biology and distribution of fish stocks is essential if harvesting from these fisheries is to be sustained in the long term. A number of fish stocks are already threatened by overfishing. There is a need for further research into the nature and distribution of stocks if this situation is not to become more widespread. Assessing the size and condition of a specific fish stock which is constantly mobile and rarely completely isolated from other stocks is a costly and difficult exercise. Research in this area is, therefore, in.;. herently more difficult, more costly and more time consuming than in most other industries in the primary industries and energy portfolio. Nor is the need for research confined to biological aspects of fisheries. As in many other industries, the post-harvest phase has become increasingly important in ensuring good returns are received by participants. This is especially true where the resource is limited and there is little opportunity to increase production. If Australia is to continue to compete on world markets, greater attention must be given to finding better and more efficient ways of handling and transporting fish products and ensuring that the product offered is of high quality so that it attracts high prices. The Government's policy on research and development in the primary industries and energy sector was set out in the report Research, Innovation and Competitiveness, released in May 1989. The thrust of that report was the need to improvc the funding, organisation and administration of research and development in thcsc industries. The report recognised: the benefits of research and development corporations as appropriate structures for effectively administering portfolio research and development programs and for allowing industry an input into the decision-making process on research and development; that those who benefit directly from research and development should bear responsibility for funding that research; that the Government has a responsibility to prevent over-exploitation of community owned natural resources, such as fisheries, and must therefore be prepared to bear a larger proportion of research and development costs than might otherwise be the case. In line with these policy guidelines the Government will replace the existing Fishing Industry Research and Development Council with the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The Corporation will be established under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, and amendments to that Act are included in this package of legislation. The establishment of the new research corporation will lead to greater flexibility and autonomy of fisheries research and development administration, as well as providing an increased opportunity for industry involvement and ensuring that funds are directed to research areas of the greatest potential benefit. The Government accepts that it has a responsibility to contribute funds for fisheries research and development but also believes that industry, as the major beneficiary of research, should share some of this responsibility. Neither State nor Commonwealth fishermen currently contribute to research and development funded by the current Fishing Industry Research and Development Council. In line with the Government's policy of ensuring that beneficiaries play a part in funding, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will be amended to enable industry to contribute funds to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. Revised funding arrangements for fisheries research and development were announced in the fisheries policy statement. Under the new arrangements the Commonwealth will provide funding up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of fisheries production and if the industry, including both State and Commonwealth licensed fishermen, contributes at the relatively low level of 0.25 per cent of the gross value of fisheries production the Commonwealth will also match this amount of funding. In addition, the Government will provide funds equivalent to a further 0.25 per cent of the gross value of production, for additional fisheries research to be undertaken or administered by the Management Authority, the Bureau of Rural Resources or the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. This will take Government's total contribution for fisheries research and development to a maximum of one per cent of gross value of production and the total funds available for fisheries research to 1.25 per cent of gross value of production. In summary, the changes to the administration and funding of fisheries research and development will mean more money for research, provide a more effective administrative framework for allocating funds and assessing research and development requirements, and encourage industry participation in funding research and at the same time provide the opportunity for greater industry involvement in research and development decision making. I will conclude by emphasising the Government's belief that the package of fisheries legislation before the House makes an important step forward in fisheries management. It implements the management initiatives contained in the fisheries policy statement, through the Fisheries Administration Bill it establishes the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and it makes important changes to fisheries research arrangements. (Quorum formed) These changes build on the existing solid framework for fisheries management which has been progressively developed through the term of this Government.

The second reading speech for the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 outlined how the new arrangements for granting access to fisheries under the Commonwealth's jurisdiction would work. The purpose of this Bill is to collect a levy from those fishermen that have been granted access under the Fisheries !vIanagement Bill 1991. It replaces the - Ishe.r­ ies Levy Act 1984.

The second reading speech for Fisheries Management Bill outlined the new system for granting acce.ss to t-e tralian Fishing Zone. In dOIng thIS It dicated that the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Act 1981 would be replaced by a new Bill to collect payments from overseas governments or commercial inas terests for access to the Australian Zone where formal agreements are in place. This Bill gives effect to this and provides the Australian Fisheries Managein ment Authority with the power to sustions pend a licence to operate in the Australian Australian Fishing Zone if the amount specified the access agreement is not paid.

352,Mr KERIN,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is the companion Bill to the Fisheries Management Bill 1991, which I presented earlier. This Bill addresses a number of issues. Firstly, it provides for transitional arrangements as the Fisheries Act 1952 is replaced by the Fish\!ries Management Bill 1991. In particular it makes provision for the continuation of scientific permits and fishing licences issued under the Fisheries Act 1952 until they expire or are revoked, even though most parts of the Fisheries Act 1952 will be repealed. This will givc the Australian Fisheries Management Authority a short breathing space during which time the new register of statutory fishing rights, Energy) and the procedures for allocating fishing permits can be established. This Bill also continues the arrangements for the sharing of fisheries management responsibilities with the States and the Northern Territory which are currently under the Fisheries Act 1952 for a period .Allsof two years, after which the Fisheries InManagement Bill 1991 will take over these matters. This will provide the State and Northern Territory governments with sufficient time to amend their legislation so to appropriately cross-reference the new Fishing Fisheries Management Bill 1991. Another important provision contained the Bill concerns the terms and condiof the staff being transferred to the Fisheries Management in Authority from the Australian Fisheries Service. The Bill makes it absolutely clear that staff who are transferred to the new Authority at its commence,mcnt will continue to be employed on the same terms and conditions and will be subject to the same industrial awards that they are under immediately prior to their transfer until the Authority negotiates its own industrial awards. This Bill also .amends the Primary Ina dustries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 in order to implement the changes in fisheries research and development arrangements outlined in the second reading speech of the Fisheries Energy) Management Bill 1991. That speech explained why the Government is establishI ing a Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and the bases of the funding arrangements for that Corporation. This Bill gives effect to these changes. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Braithwaite) adjourned.

The second reading speech of the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 indicated that foreign fishing licences would be fishery specific and would be subject to the payment of fees and levies. The fees and levies can be paid either by means of a formal agreement for access to the Australian Fishing Zone or through specific levies imposed when the foreign fishing licence is granted. This Bill provides the mechanism through which the levies associated with foreign fishing licences are paid when there is no formal agreement with overseas governments or commercial interests.

The second reading speech for the Fisheries Management Bill 1991 reiterated previous assurances to industry that the Government would not auction the access rights of existing fishermen in developed fisheries. It also clearly stated that while an auction or tender may be used to allocate new fishing rights, the Government would ensure that appropriate incentives were provided so that exploration for and development of new fisheries would continue. This Bill provides the means by which auctions or tenders can be used to allocate new fishing rights.

SOCIAL SECURITY (DISABILITY AND SICKNESS SUPPORT) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, for Mr Howe, and read a first time. Second Reading",200
355,Mr STAPLES,STATUTORY FISHING RIGHTS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill would implement further significant reform to the Australian social security system. It would give effect to the major initiatives announced in the 1990 Budget to restructure income support for people who are disabled or sick. It would see the introduction of an entirely new strategy-which will help us deal far more effectively with the needs of people with disabilities in the 1990s. I do not need to remind honourable members of the urgent need for these reforms. For many years now the basis for and the operation of invalid pension and sickness benefit have not been satisfactory. With invalid pension, the problems stemmed from the qualification criteria Energy) set out in the legislation, and subsequently elaborated in administrative law. With the Administrative Appeals Tribuna! (AAT) gaining jurisdiction to hear invalid pension appeals in 1981, a solid body of principles regarding the key concepts of invalid pension were erectcd, such as the terms permanently incapacitated for work and 85 per cent incapacity. The AAT went a considerable way in taking account of socio-economic factors and the labour market in assessing a person's incapacity for work. We reached the stage where a person could suffer from a minor medical condition but, because of a combination of age, education, lack of skills in English, work history and workcrs compensation, could end up receiving invalid pension. Subsequent legislative amendments in 1987 went some way to reducing the impact of socio-economic factors by introducing a requirement that at least half of the permanent incapacity had to be directly caused by a physical or menta! impairment. At the same time, there was a small but significant percentage of cases of relati vely young people, even people in their twenties, who were not manifestly impaired but who were being awarded invalid pension with the expectation that they would continue to receive it on an indefinite basis. The concept of permanent incapacity for work became self-fulfIlling and only some 2 per cent of invalid pensioners went off pension because of thcir rcturn to employment. Overall, there has been minimal movement into the labour market by invalid pensioners. Another important issue has been the failurc of any significant number of invalid pensioners to benefit from rehabilitation. Very few were referred or, if referrcd, accepted for rehabilitation. This was basically due to a lack of motivation which again appears to be linked to the fact that invalid pension was regarded as a permanent payment. Sickness benefit has also had a number of problems. The first problem is a matter of statutory interpretation as the level of incapacity is not specificd in the legislation. Although some AA T dccisions have agreed with the Department of Social Security that the level intendcd is total incapacity, the issue should be beyond question. Another problem has been that the medical certificates provided by thebeneficiaries' treating doctors are often vague and of very little assistance in assessing qualification. This has led to routine referral to a Commonwealth medical officer, in particular where a person is on sickness benefit for an extended period. The end result of these problems has been that there have been many cases where clicnts with impairments too insignificant to warrant grant of invalid pension have continued on sickness benefit for several years in a manner which is inappropriate to the intentions of the payment. Although recent review measures have significantly rcduced the number of long term beneficiaries, it is important to make the short term nature of the payment clear in lcgislation. The major changes introduced in this Bill build on the successful social security reforms of recent years which have received widespread community support. The changes are based on the report of the Social Security Review, Income Support For People with Disabilities, extensive community consultation and the work of the interdepartmcntal disability task force. The Bill provides for the replacement of invalid pension by disability support pension (DSP) which will have revised qualification criteria. It will also provide for the replacement of sickness benefit by sickness allowance (SA) which will be more clearly defmed and will not be payable on an indefinite basis. Other changes will include an increase in the rate of mobility allowance from $22 a fortnight to $40 a fortnight, and the phasing out or abolition of incentive allowance, rehabilitation allowance and sheltered employment allowance. The portability provisions will also be tightened. The Bill will also provide that children who are attracting child disability allowance are eligible for a Health Care card. The extension of eligibility for Health Care cards is an important element of the disability reform package, and would assist those families providing daily care for children with, disabilities and who, therefore, incur higher medical and pharmaceutical costs. This Bill gives effect to a wide ranging strategy for a comprehensivc reform of disability support. The main [catures of the new disability support pension are that, to qualify, a person must have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent or more and a continuing inability to work for the next two years. A permanently blind person will automatically qualify for a disability support pension under provisions similar to those current for invalid pension. Those in receipt of invalid pension just before the commencement of disability support pension on 1 October 1991 will automatically be granted disability support pension without having to lodge a fresh claim. A key aspect of the disability support pension is that the inability to work as defined in this Bill must stem completely, or virtually completely, from the person's impairment. Non-medical factors will not be considered in the process of assessing a person's inability to work, except that for people aged 55 or ovcr, consideration will be given to the connection between their age and the likelihood of their finding work in the local labour market. This Bill will include the provision for the deferment of disability support pension payments for relevant pcrsons who do not take reasonable stcps to meet the active requirements of the pension-to receive treatment, undergo a program of assistance or undertake Job Search and work. However, these provisions will not commence until 1 October 1993 when the infrastructure for the reforms will be complete. This is an initiativc aimcd very much at providing real hope and assistance for people who are disabled or sick. It offers assistance and scope for people who are disabled or sick in this category to acquire skills so that they will be better placed both now and when the labour market starts to improve. To encourage transition to work, a disability support pensioner who finds employment will, in the majority of cases, have his or her pension suspended for up to two years rather than cancelled outright. For those who arc completely, or virtually completely, incapacitated for work temporarily because of sickness or accident, a sickness allowance will be payable. This allowance will gcncrally be payable for periods of up to 13 wceks at which time fresh medical and othcr evidence will be required. Payments will not extend beyond 12 months, except in exceptional circumstances where it is clear that the person's incapacity will end during the next 12 months, or where the existing condition seriously worsens or a new condition develops. An employment entry payment of $200 will be paid to any qualified person on a disability support pension who finds full time work or whose earnings from work exceed the levcl of incomc at which either Job Search or Ncwstart allowance ceases to be paid to a person aged 21 years or over. This, as well as the suspension rather than cancellation of pension for disability support recipicnts trying out work, will encourage a person in rcceipt of a disability support pension to take up work to the extent possible and to prepare the person to enter the work force. This Bill will continue the development of a common allowancc structure for income support given to young people. This will be done by aligning the rates of disability support pension for people who are under 21 with the rates of Job Search and Newstart allowance payable to people under 21. However, this Bill recognises the extra expenses that have to be borne by young people with disabilities, and it provides for the payment of a youth disability supplemcnt to people under 21 who will be receiving disability support pension. The supplement is to be aligned with the rate of child disability allowance. Also, the income and assets tests will not apply to the maximum basic rates of disability support pension payable to a person under 21 who is permanently blind. Additionally, a disability support pension recipient aged under 18 is, for similar reasons, not subjcct to a parental income or assets test. A central feature of the disability reform package is a greater emphasis on rehabilitation and assistance to return to the labour market. This will not, of course, be possible for invalid pensioners and disability support pensioners residing overseas. Unlimited portability for all invalid pensioners would, therefore, be inconsistent with the present direction of reform. This Bill will limit the portability of invalid pensiolls to 12 months for new pensions granted on or after 1 July 1991. This limitation will not apply to pensioners who are assessed as severely disabled or where a social security international agreement provides otherwise. This amendment will also bring the rules for portability of invalid pension into line with the 12-month limitation for sole parent and wife pensions. I conclude by emphasising the positive directions of these reforms. There must be no impression that this Bill will penalise those who are disabled or sick. Rather, the Government's desire is to avoid the problems of the past where, too often, income support has been seen as the final and only solution with no integration with rehabilitation or labour market assistance. The provisions in the Bill would signify a new deal for people who are disabled or sick to help not only their participation in the broader life and work of the Australian community. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Braithwaite) adjourned. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",200
356,Mr REITH,TREASURER,I move: That so mueh of Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving Jorthwith the following motion: That-Motion (by Mr Staples) proposed: That the honourable member for Flinders be not further heard.,203
357,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,"Mr Cowan)The question is that the honourable member be no longer heard. Those of that opinion say aye; to the contrary no. Division required. Ring the bells. Ml' Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had not completed reading the motion when the Minister moved that the honourable member be not further heard. I therefore ask you to rule on whether the Minister is out of order in moving the motion at this point. Ml' DEPUTY SPEAKER-It is my understanding that the Minister in charge of the House can move that a member be not further heard at any stage, and that is the ruling I took at that stage. If you wish to move dissent from my ruling, be prepared to go ahead. I order that the ringing of the bells be stopped. In response to the point of order by the honourable member for Hume, it was my understanding that the action by the Minister was in order. It has now been drawn to my attention that the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party should be allowed to finish his motion to suspend Standing Orders. Ml' REITH- Mr Deputy Speaker, to put the motion properly in context, let me read it in its entirety. I move: That so mueh of Standing and Sessional Orders he suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith the following motion: That the Treasurer he required to explain to the House forthwith the reasons why he has betrayed the Prime Minister and the people of Australia on the eve of the Premiers Conference and in the midst of the worse recession for 60 years-Ml' DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. M. J. R. MACKellar)-Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Ml' Scholes-On a point of order: under Standing Orders it is not necessary, and therefore is superfluous to the motion, to include the subject matter of the motion which would be moved if the suspension is carried. The additional material being given is in the nature of a speech; it is not part of the motion.",203
358,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TREASURER,There is no point of order. Ml' REITH-The content of the motion is: That the Treasurer be required to explain to the House forthwith the reasons why he has betrayed the Prime Minister and the people of Australia on the eve of the Premiers Conference and in the midst of the worse recession for 60 years. I so move.,203
359,Mr LLOYD,TREASURER,I wish to second the motion that so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent me moving forthwith-or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith-the following motion,204
360,Mr BEAZLEY,TREASURER,Get it right.,204
361,Mr LLOYD,TREASURER,"I will improve. The motion states: That the Treasurer be required to explain to the House forthwith the reasons why he has betrayed the Prime Minister and the people of Australia on the eve of the Premiers' Conference and in the midst of the worse recession for 60 years. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is necessary to explain in relation to thatMotion (by Ml: Beazley) put: That the honourable member be not further heard. The House divided. (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Hon. M. J. R.

MACKellar) 67 Question so resolved in the negative. 72 5 PRIVILEGE",204
362,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to raise a matter' Beazley, K. C. Beddall. D. P. of privilege, which I understand under Standing Order$ can be raised at any stage. The matter of privilege I would like to raise is that, according to news reports and reports circulating very freely around this building, arrangements going to the highest matters affecting the deliberation of the Government of this country and determining the leadership of the majority party in this country and in this Parliament were concluded some time in November 1988, involving the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the then Treasurer now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is my understanding that commitments were given between those two gentlemen regarding the leadership of the majority party.",205
363,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is one of the most serious things that can come before this Parliament. None of the matters which have been mentioned are matters of privilege.",206
364,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,The honourable member has not heard the end of it.,206
365,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,The honourable member is raising a matter of privilege. He has to raise the matter of privilege before he is allowed to speak to it.,206
366,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,J am.,206
367,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. I am waiting for the honourable member for Bcnnelong, and I agree that it is a matter of the utmost seriousness.",206
368,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,It is a matter of the utmost seriousness because it goes to the leadership of the majority party. Mr Scholes inteljecting,206
369,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,"The matter of privilege that I raise, and J will be following it with a motion-and if the honourable member understood the Standing Orders he would realise that that is the procedure-",206
370,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong must raise the matter of privilege quickly so that we can understand what it is.,206
371,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,"The matter of privilege that I raise is that it is clear on the basis of news reports, which have not been denied, that an arrangement was entered into between the present Prime Minister and the present Deputy Prime Minister in November 1988. Integral to that arrangement was the participation of two people, namely, the joint managing director of Ansett Transport Industries, Sir Peter Abeles, and the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Kelty. It is obvious from those reports that that arrangement would not have been concluded without the presence of those two gentlemen.",206
372,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",206
373,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,And that goes to the heart of determining the leadership of the majority party.,206
374,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,On a point of order-,206
375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will resume his seat. The honourable member for Corio does not .have the call until I call him.,206
376,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,Privilege is too serious for this. It is a disgrace.,206
377,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,The honourable member for Corio wishes to raise a point of order. I ask him to state his point of order.,206
378,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Dcputy Speaker, the point of order is that therc is not a matter of privilege before this House as has been stated by the honourable member for Bennelong. He is being allowed to debate a matter which has nothing to do with privilege or the performance of any member in this House, and he cannot cite one reference to support it.",206
379,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"Order! The question of whether privilege has been abused or not is not for the Chair at this stage to decide upon. What [ am seeking to have the honourable member for Bennelong do is shortly state his point. He will not be allowed to debate the matter. When he has stated his point of privilege, I will report that to the Speaker and a decision will be taken. I would ask the honourable member for Bennelong to shortly state his privilege point.",206
380,Mr HOLDING,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: the law governing privilege in this Parliament and in the House of Commons at Westminster clearly establishes that privilege, if it is to be asserted by any member, must be asserted under one of the existing heads of privilege. One cannot invent a new head of privilege and, as the honourable gentleman has not asserted his claim in terms of an existing head of privilege, he is inventing a new head and is clearly outside the Standing Orders. I suggest, Sir, that you rule him out of order.",207
381,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"Order! I would ask the honourable member for Bennelong to state his point of privilege as briefly as possible, and I will undertake to convey that to the Speaker. I ask him, in accordance with the common courtesies of this House, to follow that procedure.",207
382,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,The point of privilege that I assert is the privilege of the majority party in this House to determine the leadership of that party. It is quite apparent-,207
383,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,On a point of order-,207
384,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,"With very great respect, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - ",207
385,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, with respect to majority and minority parties, the only privileges in this House and under the Westminster system of parliament are the privileges of the member as an individual or the Parliament or the House itself as an entity. There are no privileges for majority and minority parties. What happens about leadership in political parties is not privilege; it is purely a matter for a free association of members to determine. There is nothing to do with privilege in what the honourable member is saying, and he knows it.",207
386,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,The honourable member-,207
387,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,And you are not bringing up a matter of privilege.,207
388,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,I am.,207
389,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,You are not-not one word.,207
390,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Bennelong will cease interjecting across the chamber. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports wishes to raise a point of order.,207
391,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES NOES,I have a point of order too.,207
392,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,I will get to the right honourable member for New England in a moment.,207
393,Mr HOLDING,AYES NOES,"On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the honourable member is out of order unless he relates his privilege to an established head of privilege. He has not done that, and until such time as he does you should not hear him. With great respect, you should rule him out of order. It is not a question of inviting the honourable gentleman to canvass the issue at large; it is a question of him establishing a head of privilege and bringing it within the framework of that. I can understand his problem because if, of course, he was fair dinkum, when he himself was deposed as Leader of the Opposition he should have----:-",207
394,Unknown,AYES NOES,Opposition members interjecting,207
395,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"Order! Before I deal with the point of order from the right honourable member for New England, I ask the honourable member for Bennelong, whether he is alleging a breach of privilege or a contempt.",207
396,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,"You raise an interesting proposition, Mr Deputy Speaker. If you will give me a moment I will come to that. Can I speak to the point raised? In answer to your question, Sir, and to the point raised by the honourable member for Corio, I am speaking not to the collective privilege of the Australian Labor Party but to the individual privileges of individual members of the Australian Labor Party, which formed the majority party in this House.",207
397,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,On a point of order-,207
398,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,Is this going to be allowed to go on forever?,207
399,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of ordt;r, the members of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber or anywhere else do not have any privileges.",207
400,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,That is my point.,208
401,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"The honourable member for Corio has a privilege, and he may be a member of the Australian Labor Party, but the Australian Labor Party does not have the privileges, nor does anyone else. This is a farce, and the Parliament is being made a farce. No matter of privilege has been raised, and this has been going on now for seven minutes. I think it is about time it was stopped.",208
402,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong will resume his seat. I call the right honourable member for New England on a point of order.,208
403,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES NOES,"I do raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer to the Standing Orders in this place. I looked them up under 'Contempt'. As I understand the point and the privilege matter being raised by the honourable member for Bennelong, if there is any suggestion of any interference by people outside this Parliament in the processes of voting of a member of this Parliament, then that is a breach of privilege. As I understand the point that is being raised by the honourable member for Bennelong, that is the answer to the question raised before about raising a head of privilege. If there is any party outside this Parliament which interferes in the vote of a member of this Parliament, that is a breach of privilege. I would suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is the very area within which the honourable member for Bennelong is raising his contention.",208
404,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,It is hardly a point of order but I hear what the right honourable gentleman says. I now ask the honourable member for Bennelong briefly to state his point.,208
405,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, if I could just have a moment free of points of order from the honourable member for Corio, I will. The allegation of a breach of privilege is simply this: we have a situation where the Prime Minister 'and the Treasurer reached an agreement about the prime ministership of this country-",208
406,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,Deal with the matter of privilege.,208
407,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,How long is this guyOpposition members-Name him! Name him!,208
408,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer is an officer of this House. They are officers of the Crown and they enjoy no privileges because of that office as members of this House. Their privileges are only as members of this House, and what occurs with respect to the officers which the Governor General is responsible for appointing is a matter for the Crown; it is not a matter for the privileges of this Parliament.",208
409,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,"Order! The matter of privilege is one of the most serious issues that can be raised in this House, and I do not want to see this discussion degenerate. I would now ask the honourable member for Bennelong to briefly state, in short order, his point of privilege, and I will see that that is conveyed immediately to the Speaker.",208
410,Mr HOWARD,AYES NOES,"The point of privilege is simply as follows: I claim that it is an infringement of the privileges of the individual members of the majority party in this Parliament to have made an arrangement an integral part of which was the participation of two people who are not members of this Parliament. Undoubtedly their presence exerted an undue influence on the arrangement and that impacted upon the privileges of members of this House. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is surely fundamental to the free exercise of the privileges of a member of Parliament-",208
411,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Bennelong should be required to cite the precedents on which he is raising privilege. He has not cited any precedents on privilege or contempt. This is a farcical situation.",208
412,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat.,208
413,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,The Parliament is being treated with contempt by the honourable member for Bennelong and the Chair.,209
414,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AYES NOES,Order! The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. I have heard enough of the points raised by the honourable member for Bennelong. The discussion will be concluded. I will report the matters raised by the honourable member for Bennelong to the Speaker. ',209
415,Mr SINCLAIR,AYES NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would suggest that the honourable member for Corio is in gross breach of the privileges of this place in reflecting adversely against you and the Chair of the Parliament. I suggest that he be required to withdraw that inference and innuendo and apologise.",209
416,Mr SCHOLES,AYES NOES,"I withdraw and apologise to the Chair. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, for Howe, and read a first time. Second Reading",209
417,Mr STAPLES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Social Security Legislation Amendinitiatives. ment Bill first makes an amendment to the Social Security Act 1947 so that, effect from 15 April 1991, a special efit will be payable, at the discretion the Secretary to the Department of Social Security, to a person who is the holder of an 'extended eligibility (spouse)' entry permit on the basis of a relationship with an Australian resident where the applicalevel tion for that permit was made on or after 15 April 1991. This coincides with the commencement of the migration regulation tion that operates in such cases. The new clear English Social Security from 1 July 1991. Act 1991 reflected the 1947 Act as it stood at the end of the autumn sittings 1990. The 1991 Act will come into operation on 1 July 1991. Amendments made to the 1947 Act during the Budget sittings 1990 and the autumn sittings 1991 need to be incorporated into the 1991 Act before then. The exercise is a straight translation of existing policy and is being done in two stages. First, the Social Security (Rewrite) Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for amendments made to the 1947 Act by the Social Welfare (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Act 1990, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1990 and the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1990 to be incorporated into the 1991 Act. Second, this Bill will provide for amendments made to the 1947 Act during the autumn sittings 1991 to be incorporated into the 1991 Act. To that end, the Bill makes amendments to the 1991 Act to exclude approved scholarships from the definition of income, to exempt moneys invested in certain funeral bonds from the ordinary income and assets tests, to confirm the primacy of Commonwealth legislation in relation to recovery of Mr overpayments from compensation lump sums, to provide for the qualification for special benefit of certain holders of 'extended eligibility (spouse)' entry permits and to provide for some minor policy and technical amendments. The Bill also makes some amendments to the 1991 Act to give effect to policy The maintenance income free areas for pensions and benefits are to be with indexed on 1 July each year. The mainbentenance income free area is the amount of of maintenance or child support a person can receive before affecting the rate of her or his pension or benefit. This annual indexation will ensure that the allowable of maintenance or child support is not eroded over time by inflation and will maintain consistency with the introducof annual indexation of the basic pension free area for ordinary income The pharmaceutical allowance is to be indexed from the first pension or benefit payday after 20 September each year. This will ensure that a person is compensated fully for any increase in the concessional beneficiary charge on 1 October each year. The Bill makes amendments to give force to this change. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act 1990 provided that, as from 1 July 1990, portstands, ability of wife's pension and class B ow's pension would be restricted to months. Payment would cease after 12 months absence where a person leaves Australia on or after 1 July 1990. Where the person left Australia before 1 July 1990, payment would cease on 1 July 1991. The Government undertook to revise these provisions following concern expressed by, and extensive consultations with, various community and welfare groups. The amendments to be made by this Bill give effect to that undertaking. Also included in the Bill is the insertion as a schedule to the 1991 Act of a social security agreement with the Netherlands, an amendment to the National Health providing Act 1953 to ensure that a person is not disqualified from enjoying the benefits tached to holding a pharmaceutical benerequire fits card because of the operation of the decision. deeming provisions in either the 1947 Act or the 1991 Act and provisions to make some minor policy and technical amendteria ments. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) guidelines adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, a first time. Second Reading",209
418,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. One purpose of the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill the is to make a number of amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. The first of these amendments will clarify the intent of 'professional service' defined in section 3 of the Health Insurance Act, by introducing the notion of 'clinical relevance' to that definition. Technically, as the legislation currently a medical practitioner could itemwidise an account and claim Medicare bene12 fits for a service where a physical attendance on the patient occurs, but during which no 'clinically relevant service' takes place. The proposed amendment requires that a 'professional service' be related to a medical examination, treatment, diagnosis or test that is necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient. Clause 4 of the Bill has the purpose of specifying explicitly what has previously been implicit in the current legislation. The purpose of the changes in clauses 5 and 6 of this Bill is to require the proprietor of a pathology laboratory, the approval for which has been revoked, to take all reasonable steps to inform the practitioner and the patient that a Medicare benefit will not be payable in atrespect of the pathology service, and to the Minister to advertise such a Medicare benefits for pathology services are only payable where a number of criare met. One of these is that the laboratory premises where the services are rendered must meet certain standards. These standards are defined by the Minister and are adopted from standards and set by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council. The Commonwealth contracts an independent organisation-the National Association of Testing Authorities-to carry out assessand read ment of these premises. There have been occasions recently where pathology laboratories have failed to reach an acceptable standard of operation and the approval has been revoked. The Department has become aware that the operators of some of these revoked premises have continued to perform pathology services without informing either referring practitioners or the patients. No charges have been raised against the patient. The provisions in these clauses are simas ilar to those offences relating to the disqualification of a practitioner in section 19D of the Health Insurance Act 1973. A further purpose of this Bill is to make a number of amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and the Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act 1986 in relation to nursing home matters. The Bill contains a measure to facilitate the release of information about nursing homes to the ,public. The secrecy provisions of the National Health Act currently prevent, in most cases, the release of any information about a person or a nursing home collected in the course of administering the Act. This has the effect of making it extremely difficult for the Department or the Minister to give out any information at all about nursing homes to prospective residents, current residents or to members of the public. This new measure will enable necessary information to be made available to the public, while at the same time preserving the privacy of individual nursing home residents and the proprietor's right to a review of the information except in urgent circumstances. Three types of information will be able to be released if this Bill is passed. Firstly, the Bill enables the public release of the action plans prepared by a nursing home indicating how the home will be improved so as to meet the prescribed standards of care. Action plans apply to homes that have been found not to meet the standards, and are the proprietor's indication of the changes to be made in the practices of that home. Secondly, the Bill enables release of basic facts about a nursing home: its name, address, number of beds, fees charged and similar descriptive information necessary if a person wants to make an informed choice about a nursing home. Thirdly, the Bill enables release of information concerning action that is to be taken to suspend or revoke a nursing home's approval, or to vary the conditions of its approval, or to suspend benefits for new admissions to that home. Proprietors will have 30 days to make submissions to the Minister about this information, except where the situation is urgent. If urgent release of information is necessary to protect the welfare or interests of residents, then such information may be released immediately. In most cases this will occur where a home is being closed down and it is necessary to give advance warning to the residents, their families, the staff, other nursing homes or hospitals, and State health authorities that the residents have to be moved. A further measure in this Bill provides an additional sanction which may be used in regard to a nursing home that has breached one or more conditions of its approval. Currently, the only available sanction is the suspension or revocation of approval of the home. This is a drastic penalty which is imposed only as a last resort as it severely disrupts the lives of the residents who have to be transferred elsewhere. This Bill enables Commonwealth benefits to be stopped for any new admissions occurring after the date of determination that the conditions have been breached. This penalises the nursing home while at the same time it enables the care of existing residents to continue. This sanction is already available for use when standards of care are not met. This measure extends this sanction to apply to breaches of any of the conditions of approval. The Bill also contains some technical amendments to enable proclamation of a section of a 1986 Act concerning the listing of government nursing homes. I now turn to the amendments proposed under part 5 of the Bill. These will introduce more flexible arrangements for the administration of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 such as decentralising the administration of the individual patient usage (IPU) scheme, and making it possible for evaluation fees to be paid in instalments by sponsors seeking to include goods in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). The individual patient usage scheme has been in operation for more than 10 years, to cover situations where there is a genuine need to treat a patient with a drug which has not been approved for supply in Australia. Such situations can be divided into two broad categories. One category covers situations where a patient is 'suffering from a disease rarely seen in Australia, treatable by a well recognised drug which no drug company wishes to market routinely in Australia. In such cases, approval to use the drug in question would be routinely given under the IPU scheme. The other category covers cases of urgent clinical need where a patient is suffering from a serious disease which is either incurable by routinely available drugs or which has failed to respond to such drugs. In such cases, approval to use an unproven drug on an experimental basis may be given, provided there is some scientific rationale such treatment. Under the present scheme, IPU approvals have been administered centrally. Any doctor seeking such approval must telephone a medical officer of the therapeutic goods administration in Canberra, who decides such applications in accordance with criteria designed to take account of the factors I have mentioned. Two problems with this centralised system have emerged in recent years. Firstly, the volume of requests is now running at some 20,000 per annum and, secondly, the growing complexity of medical practice has made it increasingly difficult for medical officers in Canberra, on the basis of a telephone call, to weigh up the pros and cons of using an unregistered drug. The Government has therefore decided to make provision for IPU approvals to be delegated, under regulations to be made for this purpose, to doctors outside the Australian Public Service-in general, to specific staff members of major hospitals. The general criteria which they will use will be the same as those used in the centralised scheme which will continue as an alternative. The doctor granting IPU approval will always be someone other than the prescriber, and the arrangement in each hospital will be under the general supervision of the hospital's ethics committee. Part 5 of the Bill also contains amendments providing for regulations to be made to introduce a scheme that will allow sponsors to pay their evaluation fees by instalments when they apply to register their products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This measure follows a recommendation of the Industry and Government Consultative Committee established to advise the Ministcr on the schedule of fces and charges to be paid in connection with the manufacture of therapeutic goods, and the inclusion and retention of goods in the ARTG. Changes will also be made to alter the effect of the Secretary's action in grouping therapeutic goods under part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. At present this is to rcnder a whole group of goods that for have been groupcd to be single goods for the purposes of part 3 of that Act. However, this crcates difficultics in cases where only one product within a group may be required to be withdrawn from the market, yet the cancellation provisions undet the Act must be applied to all the goods in the same group where thcy are treated as single therapeutic goods. To overcome this and similar difficulties, the changes proposed will mean that individual goods that have been grouped will retain their status as separate goods, but will only be identified as belonging to a particular group warranting common or uniform treatment for certain purposes such as the payment of fees and charges', and the assignment of a common registration or listing number in the ARTG. Other amendments included in part 5 of the Bill deal with the introduction of fees, comparable to those payable under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, for processing the release of information in the ARTG to the public. Provision is also made to allow sponsors to apply, upon payment of a fee, to alter conditions attaching to the registration or listing of their goods in the ARTG where such alterations require further processing by the therapeutic goods administration, and for the lodgement and supply of information under the Act by electronic means. I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. THERAPEUTIC GOODS (CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",210
419,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to be considered cognately with the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, the portfolio Bill. The amendments contained in this Bill arise as a consequence of amendments being made to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 by the portfolio Bill. The portfolio Bill makes a number of amendments to part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act. One of these relates to the effect of the Secretary exercising his power to make determinations to group therapeutic goods where, for example, they share common characteristics or where they share both common characteristics and a common manufacturer. At present, the effect of grouping therapeutic goods under section 16 of the Therapeutic Goods Act is to render each group of goods to be single goods for a range of administrative and other purposes under part 3 of that Act, including the application of charges. Thus, for example, each group of goods entered in the Register by the same person is treated as single goods and attracts one annual registration or listing charge. However, following amendments to be introduced by the portfolio Bill, the effect of the Secretary's action in grouping goods will no longer be to render such goods single goods. Instead, each product included within the same group will retain their separate status as individual goods, and will only be identified as belonging to a particular gazetted therapeutic goods group, or a gazetted therapeutic devices group so as to attract, amongst the same group of goods, common or uniform treatment. To preserve the policy intention that grouped goods should continue to attract only a single annual charge, rather than an annual charge for each product included in a group of goods that is separately registered or listed, amendments to the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989 are necessary to achieve this result and to match the changes made by the portfolio Bill. I commend this Bill to the House. T present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. NA (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",213
420,Mr STAPLES,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill before the House amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 to implement substantial reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) which were announced in the 1990 Budget. These changes to the administration of the scheme involve the introduction of a checking system whereby pharmacists will be connected on-line to the Health Insurance Commission's (HIC) computer, or more correctly, the Commission's eligibility file, to allow immediate verification of a patient's entitlement to either free pharmaceutical benefits, concessional benefits or general benefits. No one would deny, not even the Opposition, the right of the Government to protect taxpayers' money, in providing that only those eligible to receive benefits do in fact receive them. To do no less would be scandalous. Since November 1986 pharmacists have had the responsibility to satisfy themselves that the person claiming a benefit under the PBS was in fact entitled to that benefit. The introduction of the new checking system is but one more way for pharmacists to satisfy themselves that the benefit being claimed is legitimate. This system provides a level of accuracy not possible before. Under the new system, the pharmacist seeks confirmation from the HIC's eligibility file that the benefit the patient is claiming is one to which that person is entitled. Clearly the pharmacist can satisfy himself or herself as to the patient's claim in any number of ways. The patient may be well known to the pharmacist; the patient may tender any number of current cards provided by the Department of Social Security to prove eligibility to a benefIt. The patient could tender a Medicare card or a passport. All might satisfy the pharmacist and in such cases many pharmacists may choose not to use the on-line system to check eligibility. Where the on-line system is used, however, the pharmacist is guaranteed payment at the level indicated by the HIC's systcm. This guarantee applies even if HIC's eligibility file is incorrect. Let me expand on that point. The HIC eligibility file is not a new one. It is a of information currently available to the HIe. It is information that has been and is still used to check the eligibility of persons receiving dispensed prescriptions, but this check presently occurs only after the benefit has been supplied. While recovery action would be undertaken by the HIC in the most blatant cases of wrongful claiming, a post examination system like this is clearly inefficient and unsatisfactory. The Commonwealth Auditor-General has already pointed this out in a report on the PBS. The eligibility file is currently made up of data provided under law by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Health Insurance Commission. On-line eligibility testing is to be extended to cover testing of eligibility for participation in the PBS generally. This Bill makes it clear that Australian taxpayers are only going to pay for pharmaceutical benefits supplied to those persons who have a legitimate right to those benefits and that benefits will only be available to eligible residents of this country. Thus the flow of taxpayer subsidised drugs to persons either overseas or just passing though this country is to stop. Eligibility to pharmaceutical benefits will be limited to those persons who can recei ve the benefits of the Australian health system through Medicare. I make no apology for this move for surely noone would argue that the Australian taxpayer should be asked to foot the bill for drugs provided to overseas visitors and residents of other countries. The generous subsidies available under the PBS for expensive medications like insulin and ACE inhibitors mean that losses to the Australian community from abuse by tourists can be significant. What changes will pharmacy customers experience? They may not even notice any change, for the pharmacist, while preparing the prescription, will call up the eligibility file on line by entering the patient's basic details, that is, those that are already on the prescription prepared by file the patient's doctor. The pharmacist will be provided with one of only four messages and this is a very important point for those of us with a serious intention to protect privacy to note. The messages will be that the patient has general entitlement; a concessional entitlement; entitlement to pharmaceutical benefits without charge; or that there is no record of the patient. Even if this information is wrong the pharmacist will be paid the full amount applicable. If the patient disagrees with the level of entitlement indicated on line, the pharmacist can choose to accept the further evidence the patient might tender or charge the patient the applicable higher rate, pointing out that the patient has under these provisions a right to a refund if the claim is later proven. I point out that under the provisions of this Bill the patient is still protected against the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs. If a patient is not recorded as being eligible for free or concessional drugs the most that a pharmacist can charge is $15, provided that the patient is registered with Medicare. Even if the patient is not so registered the most a pharmacist can charge is the Commonwealth price for any listed drug. This price is the price the manufacturer and the Minister have agreed will be the price to pharmacists, plus the mark-ups and fees determined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, which are added to the base cost. Should a patient later be able to prove eligibility to general, concessional or free benefits, the provisions in the Bill will permit the patient to receive from the Commission a refund of the difference between what the patient paid and the correct price. Mr Deputy Speaker, I turn now to a very important issue but one which has been somewhat dishonestly exploited in the debate on these PBS reforms. I refer of course to the issue of privacy. This Government is committed to ensuring that Australians are protected from misuse of personal data collected in the course of the administration of Government programs. It has enacted privacy legislation and appointed a Privacy Commissioner and in relation to the PBS not only abides by the information privacy principles provided for under the Privacy Act but is also governed by very strict secrecy provisions of the National Health Act. The information to be made available to pharmacists to enable them to be guaranteed that they will be paid the full amount of the benefit they provide to a customer is, as I have described and as is set out under the definition of status information in the Bill, very limited information. Indeed, it tells a pharmacist less about a person than many other sources of information currently provided by claimants and certainly less than the pharmacist probably already knows because of the professional health care relationship involved. Yct, the introduction of these eligibility checking arrangements has been the subject of much debate and concern. To understand why we need to consider particular historical and timing factors the Government's announcement in the Budget last year of an on-line checking system followed an earlier proposal from the Health Insurance Commission for a fully interactive system involving two-way transmission of information and uncertainties about whether data from the Medicare and PBS programs would be kept separate. In addition the precise nature of the information to be provided to pharmacists on line' was not then fully specified. The announcement was also contemporaneous with others involving the use of data-matching and tax file number collection and although these were for different programs and purposes there was some understandable early confusion. All that is behind us now, I am pleased to say. We now know that the status information is tightly defined and limited and that it will go only one way, from the HIC to the pharmacist. We know that the information to be provided by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs to the HIC will be similarly tightly defined and limited and will certainly not contain tax file number information and through the constructive and detailed involvement of the Privacy Commissioner it has been decided that guidelines will be developed to ensure that improper entry into the HIC's database will be made impossible; such guidelines to be agreed between HIC and the Privacy Commissioner under section 27 of the Privacy Act. The Privacy Commissioner and the HIC will also review and, if necessary, strengthen and make more specific, procedures within the HIC for maintaining the functional separation of Medicare claims and PBS claims data. As to the area of particular concern to some patients about the in-pharmacy interaction between pharmacists and their patients about eligibility matters, I have accepted the recommendation of the Privacy Commissioner that there should be a set of standards developed between his office and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia for inclusion in the pharmacists' professional code of conduct. The final provisions of the Bill will require all pharmacists to submit their claims for reimbursement to the Commission electronically. This is just the final step in the, introduction of this most desirable cha'nge. No-one could claim that the Government has not foreshadowed that it has wanted to introduce this measure. We first introduced electronic transfers of claims in 1986 with an incentive payment to encourage participation. This scheme was very successful and over 50 per cent of pharmacists took up the offer. The number of pharmacists transmitting claims data via the claims transmission system (CTS) has continued to grow even though pharmacists joining the system since late 1988 have not been eligible for incentive payments. But not all pharmacists have taken up the system. This is perhaps understandable in some cases where the pharmacist was waiting for and has now applied for the amalgamation or closure packages presently available and such pharmacists are excluded from these provisions. Clearly those pharmacists who are already receiving additional support undcr the PBS because of isolation will not bc rcquired to join the CTS and the Bill makes provision for those pharmacists for whom it is impractical because of power supplies or line difficulties to be connected to the CTS to make application to the Secretary of the Department of Community Services and Health for an exemption because of their circumstances. Furthermore the Government has, in a package of measures aimed at assisting with the completion of universality of this system, agreed to a payment of $1,000 to each pharmacist joining the CTS to assist with the initial cost and payments of $250 to assist those pharmacists who may need to upgrade their computer facilities. Pharmacists currently submitting manual claims will further gain through shorter payment times and the increased accuracy the system offers. It is estimated that vention of the free flow of drugs to destinations overseas and to those not eligible here in Australia will save the community $6m in a full year. Eligibility testing is estimated to save in the order of $12m in 1991-92, $34m in 1992-93 and $40m each year thereafter. Expenditure will amount to $12.7m in 1991-92, $14.8m in 1992-93, $13.7m in 1993-94 and $14.2m in 1994-95, The extension of the CTS to all pharmacists will save the Government a further $6m in a full year. These reforms underscore the Government's commitment to responsible financial management while maintaining the protection this scheme offers. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Dr Bob Woods-I should like to congratulate the Minister on what may well be his last speech in this House as Minister. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Humphreys, and read a first time. Second Reading",213
421,Mr HUMPHREYS,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Social Security Act 1991, the Defence Service Homes Act 1918 and the Veterans' Entitlements (Transitional Provisions and Conscquential Amendments) Act 1986. The Bill contains a number of minor changes to improve the administration of benefits for veterans and dependants under Veterans' Affairs legislation. These relate to the repeal of obsolete provisions for Boer War veterans, the payment of pharmaceutical allowance to orphans not in receipt of orphan's pension, indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance, amendprement of the Repatriation Commission's review powers to allow certain decisions to commence from a date earlier than the date on which the decision is made, the removal of an anomaly affecting the adjustment of pension following lump sum compensation payments under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, amendment of the definition of 'disease' and indexation of the maintenance free area. A number of other minor amendments to the provisions for service pension have been made to bring these into line and to maintain consistency with the Social Security Act 1991. The most important and far-reaching change, however, relates to the Government's decision, announced on 22 January 1991, to extend benefits to dependants of female veterans on the same basis as applies to dependants of male veterans. These changes will remove a longstandipg area of discrimination in the payment of benefits to the dependants of veterans and will ensure that the dependants of servicewomen who served in the Persian Gulf, as well as dependants of female veterans from earlier conflicts, will be entitled to benefits under veterans' affairs legislation. This will include entitlement to defence service homes loan and insurance benefits. The extension of benefits to the dependants of femaJe veterans will cost an estimated $1.601m in 1991-92, $1.847m in 1992-93, $2.094m in 1993-94 and $2.339m in 1994-95. The indexation of the pharmaceutical allowance will cost an estimated $1.127m in 1991-92, $2.524m in 1992-93, $3.821m in 1993-94 and $5.079m in 1994-95. The Bill will not have any other significant financial implications. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to ensure that debate takes place and to facilitate the proceedings of this House, I seek leave, understanding order 218, to proceed forthwith to the second reading debate on this legislation. Mr Humphrt:ys interjecting Mr Tim Fischer-It is perfectly reasonable; let's get on with it. It will only a few minutes.",216

423,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 will provide for the registration and regulation of B-double combinations under the Federal interstate registration scheme (FIRS). The Government is aware that Australia needs a transport system that is competitive, delivers a high quality of service and makes efficient use of an infrastructure which is one of the community's largest investments. To this end, the Government is actively pursuing a program of reform for the land transport sector to complement reforms already under way in the coastaJ shipping, waterfront and aviation sectors. The objective of this reform is to develop a land transport system that is competitive between modes, is more efficient in its allocation of resources, achieves greater operational productivity and promotes harmonised road transport regulations. The Federal Government recognises the considerable productivity, safety and environmental benefits offered by B-douhIes. The introduction of B-doubles on a national basis is therefore an integral part of the Government's reform strategy. B-doubles offer a number of benefits to operators and the community as a whole over existing heavy vehicle technology. In particular, B-doubles have a payload take of 37 tonnes compared with a conventional articulated vehicle with a payload of 26 tonnes. This represents payload and productivity gains of 40 per cent. After taking account of additional capital costs for B-double vehicles and other costs of operation, efficiency improvements are of the order of 20 per cent, a substantial gain for the road transport operator. Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. Mr Robert Brown-You must be mad. A quorum having been called-Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that the Minister just suggested I was mad. I ask that the Minister withdraw that remark. Mr Robert Brown-I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker.",217
424,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"It is probable that the honourable member for Mayo is offended, and the Minister has withdrawn. That does not help the temperature of the debate at this hour of the morning. A Government member interjecting Mr Downer-It is you people who are having the House sit until 8 a.m., not us; we would be quite happy to be asleep. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, can you ascertain from the Government whether the House is sitting late to meet the convenience of the Caucus of the Australian Labor Party, or is it to deal with Government business?",218
425,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH LEGISLATION,Clearly matters are set down on the Notice Paper and I imagine they are being dealt with according to the circulated blue. (Quorum formed),218
426,Mr ROBERT BROWN,HEALTH LEGISLATION,"Before the quorum was called, I had made the point that after taking account of additional capital costs for B-double vehicles and other costs of operation, efficiency improvements are of the order of 20 per cent and there is a substantial gain for the road transport operator. Given the competitive nature of the road transport industry, these gains can be expected to be passed on in the form of lower freight charges. This will have beneficial financial effects for manufacturvehicles ing and other businesses, and will be reflected in the transport costs for bulk commodities such as fuel and consumer goods. Finally, and most importantly, the consumer will benefit as these lower input costs flow through to prices on the shop shelf. Not only is the B-double a more efficient vehicle, but better road safety results from its improved stability. B-doubles are estimated to have a 25 per cent higher roll-over limit than conventional articulated vehicles. Additional benefits from the use of Bdoubles arise from the fact that fewer vehicles are required to undertake a given freight task. This results in improved road safety due to fewer vehicles on the road and an improved urban environment with less traffic congestion and reduced truck noise and exhaust emissions. As an example, only 27 B-doubles are needed to carry 1,000 tonnes of freight, whereas 38 conventional articulated vehicles would be required to do the same task. With fewer B-doubles required to complete a given freight task, there would also be no increase in the damage caused to roads than if articulated vehicles were used. All States and Territories allow for the operation of B-doubles on designated routes except Tasmania, which does not allow the use of these vehicles on its roads. These States and Territories, however, impose their own requirements and conditions on B-double operations, with the conditions imposed by Victoria being the most restrictive. In order for the full potential of the benefits offered by B-doubles to be realised, it is necessary for them to operate on a uniform basis across Australia. Accordingly, in view of the significant benefits to be gained from the wider use of Bdoubles, I announced in October last year that the interstate road transport legislation would be amended to include B-doubles. The Bill now before the House does this. The Federal registration of B-doubles will provide for the operation of these in all States and Territories of Australia, will allow for the operation of B-doubles under harmonised regulatory arrangements throughout Australia and will allow for the development of a national B-double network which complements our efforts to increase efficiency at transport interfaces. It is expected that the introduction of B-doubles under the Federal interstate registration scheme for interstate tasks will provide significant impetus for the wider introduction of these vehicles by all jurisdictions. Their introduction under FIRS will also enable their early operation on a national basis pending the establishment of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme. The proposed arrangements for the operation of B-doubles under FIRS have been determined through a consultative process involving State and Territory governments, local government and industry. The incorporation of B-doubles under FIRS would be accompanied by appropriate cost recovery arrangements to ensure that operators of these vehicles make a reasonable contribution to the wear they impose on the road system. Let me now tum to the individual amendments. The principal amendments in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill provide for a new registration category for B-double prime movers. The amendments also provide for the regulation of a B-double combination comprising a B-double prime mover registered under the Act with either State or federally registered trailers. Clause 5 provides a head of power enabling regulations to be made which regulate the operation of B-doubles. These operating conditions will cover mass limits, in-service requirements, designation of routes and any conditions which are imposed on operations on these routes. The States have generally agreed to inservice requirements for the operation of B-doubles. These will cover matters such as braking and coupling requirements, spray suppression equipment, dimension limits, axle spacing and road speed capabilities. These requirements are aimed at ensuring that B-double operations occur under conditions which are safe for the community as a whole. A national B-double network is being developed in consultation with State and local government and industry. The proposed network will incorporate major interstate routes as well as the connection of areas of industrial concentration with ports, depots and rail heads. Clause 5 also expressly exempts Bdouble combinations operating under the legislation from the need to obtain State permits for B-double operations. Further amendments set out the penalties for offences against mass limit provisions for B-doubles. The penalty applying to an individual is $4,000. Consistent with the provisions of the Crimes Act, the proposed penalty for an overloading offence involving a B-double in the case of a body corporate will therefore be $20,000. This level of penalty has been set. on the basis of equity and deterrent value. Setting the maximum fine for a body corporate at $20,000 will enable fines under FIRS to be consistent with the States and provide a sufficient deterrent to operators deliberately overloading B-doubles to secure increased profits. Consequential amendments are required to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act. They will enable the Government to set registration charges for B-doubles on a full cost recovery basis. The remaining amendments increase the level of infringement notice penalty for overloading for an individual to $400. Penalties for offences other than overloading under the Act and regulations will be increased to $1,000. The Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill provides for the amendments to come into force on a day to be set by proclamation. The net budgetary impact of these amendments will be nil. All registration charges will be paid into the Interstate Road Transport Trust Fund and will continue to be fully distributed to the States and Territories. All administrative costs incurred by State and Territory authorities administering the scheme are met through the levying of fees. The introduction of B-doubles on a national basis forms an integral part of the Federal Government's land transport reform strategy. Resultant productivity gains should encourage greater competition and lower prices for transport services, objectives consistent with the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for the transport industry. I commend the Bill and present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1991 to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Hawker) adjourned.

427,Mr ROBERT BROWN,INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill is to amend the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 to enable registration charges for Bdouble prime movers registered under the Federal interstate registration scheme (FIRS) to be determined on the basis of full cost recovery and to remove existing limits on registration charges. It is proposed to determine B-double registration charges on the basis of full cost recovery, consistent with the Federal Government's objective to achieve full cost recovery in the road transport industry. This will mean that B-double charges under FIRS will be consistent with those charges applying in the States. In particular, federally registered B-doubles will not be given concessional treatment in comparison to charges applying in New South Wales and Victoria. Under the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, registration charges are determined on the basis of maintenance costs only. A reinterpretation of section 92 of the Constitution by the High Court in 1988 means that construction costs can be included in the determination of Federal registration charges under the legislation. It is important to note that, it is not proposed to review registration charges for existing categories of vehicles on the basis of full cost recovery at this time. Revised charges for these categories of vehicles will be considercd in the context of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme. Given that industry has the opportunity to reap significant efficiency gains through the operation of B-doubles on a national basis, it is reasonable to expect that it will be prepared to accept the costs involved. I will now turn to the individual amendments. Clause 3 of the Bill removes the provision of the Act which limits the determination of registration charges to maintenance costs. The amendments also provide for the provisions of the Act which specify the maximum charges to be removed. This will enable the Government to set registration charges for Bdoubles on a full cost recovery basis. While it is not proposed to review cxisting charges on the basis of full cost recovery in these amendments, it is not appropriate to amend the Act so that there arc two separate sets of charging principles-one for B-doubles and one for all other categories. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill provides for the amendments to come into force on a day to be set by proclamation. The net budgetary impact of these amendments will be nil. The Bill should be read in conjunction with the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1991. I commend the Bill to honourable membcrs, who will note that I have already presented the explanatory memorandum for this Bill with that for the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill.

428,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUARANTINE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Quarantine Amendment Bill is to introduce amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. The amendments do not reflect major changes in policy by the Government. The Quarantine Act provides that the expenses of keeping goods in quarantine until such time as the risk of the introduction of diseases and pests can be assessed as minimal are a legal charge against the goods. However, it is unclear whether the Quarantine Act permits the enforcement of that legal charge against the goods by their retention and sale or whether the Commonwealth must surrender the goods to their owners when the goods have completed their quarantine. Accordingly, these amendments provide that the Commonwealth may retain possession of the goods, over which it holds a statutory legal charge, until such time as: - the expenses owing for quarantine have been paid; - suitable arrangements have been made by the owner for payment of the expenses; or - as a last resort, the Commonwealth may sell the goods and apply the proceeds of the sale to the debt owing to the Commonwealth. The amendments are necessary because the Commonwealth has been deprived of substantial revenue by owners or importers not paying their lawful debts for quarantine services. That situation is to be avoided in future. As an example of the revenue lost, there was a recent case where valuable animals that had undergone extensive quarantine had to be released and the Commonwealth is in the position of suing for the recovery of $1. 5m with little likelihood of recovering the full amount. In addition, another large program known as the scrapie freedom assurance program, which involves a large number of animals held in quarantine for many years to address risks presented by diseases which are slow to appear, is coming to an end. The animals involved in this program are quarantined in various places throughout Australia and have attracted substantial highly subsidised charges of up to $900,000 for services provided by the Commonwealth in ensuring that the animals are free from disease and may be released for breeding purposes. The animals are due for release early in 1992. Although highly subsidised valuable services have been provided by the Commonwealth over a period of approximately seven years, the importers have disputed the outstanding debt. These amendments allowing the Commonwealth to retain possession of the animals will ensure that the Commonwealth's bargaining position over payment of the debt is not weakened. Of course, the amendments apply to any goods undergoing quarantine now or in the future and not just to the animals in the scrapie freedom assurance program. The amendments add a new provision to the Act enabling the Commonwealth and the owner to enter into an agreement about the payment of quarantine expenses. In the event that agreement cannot be reached, the owner's rights over the goods are well protected by the provision requiring the Commonwealth to serve a notice advising that if, at the end of 30 days after the notice is given to the owner of the goods, any expenses relating to quarantine are still outstanding, the goods may be sold. This Bill has no financial impact but will allow the Commonwealth to more easily enforce payment of charges for quarantine services. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA RECONCILIATION BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Tickner, and read a first time. Second Reading",220
429,Mr TICKNER,COUNCIL FOR ABORIGINAL,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation) (3.00 a.m.)-l move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Today I bring before the House legislation establishing the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. It is the intention of the Government, backed I hope by a unanimous commjtment of the Parliament, that the formal process of reconciliation initiated by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Bill will signal the beginning of a decade of reform and social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and building bridges of understanding between Aboriginal and nonAboriginal Australians. I am delighted that in the public gallery in the early hours of this morning is the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, AM, CBE. The discussion paper on which this Bill is based has been widely circulated in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities. The object of the discussion paper was twofold: to keep faith with Aboriginal aspirations; and to strive for party support for the reconciliation initiative. The need for a process of reconciliation has been recognised by all major political parties. The support which has been forthcoming for the reconciliation process from Australia's indigenous peoples has been of vital importance. There have been too many expressions of support to record at this time, but I emphasise that support has been forthcoming from a wide range of organisations, including the Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, the Central Land Council, the Aboriginal Coordinating Council in Queensland, the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations, the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, and the Aboriginal and Islander Commission members of the Australian Council of Churches. Support for the initiative in the nonAboriginal community has also been extremely heartening. Organisations which have supported the proposals outlined in the discussion paper and now included in this Bill include Australian churches, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Medical Association, the National Farmers Federation, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia and many major Australian companies and community organisations. One of my objectives as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has been to remove unnecessary political point scoring from Aboriginal affairs to enable the nation to move forward over the coming decade with a broadly agreed agenda for reform which will meet the aspirations of Aboriginal people. The process of reconciliation has as its objective the transformation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal relations in this country. Only three weeks ago I tabled in the Parliament the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. That historic report, containing 339 recommendations, provides a vital part of a practical agenda for the nation over the coming decade. The report touches on every level of government and its recomcrossmendations reach out to the wider Australian community. I refer to the report of the Royal Commission at this time because of the integral relationship of that historic document to the Bill now before the Parliament. It was of considerable significance that Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, in the Royal Commission's five-volume national report described the reconciliation process, now reflected in this Bill, as 'the fundamental backdrop to reform and change', and commented that 'reconciliation of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities must be an essential commitment of all sides if change is to be genuine and long term'. The interrelationship between the process of reconciliation and the report and recommendations of the Royal Commission is a theme to which I shall return. This Bill will create the vehicle through which the reconciliation process will be conducted-the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The Bill is a machinery measure to initiate the process: it is not the end but the beginning of the process. The object of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, as set out in clause 5 of the Bill, is to promote a process of reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community, based on an appreciation by the Australian community as a whole of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and achievements and of the unique position of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as the indigenous peoples of Australia, and by means that include the fostering of an ongoing national commitment to cooperate to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. Consistent with this object, the main functions of the Council will include: - to undertake initiatives for the purpose of promoting reconciliation between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community; - to promote by leadership, education and discussion a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and of the need to redress that disadvantage; - to provide a forum for discussion by all Australians of issues relating to reconciliation with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and of policies to be adopted by Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments to promote reconciliation; - to consult Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the wider Australian community on whether reconciliation would be advanced by a formal document or documents of reconciliation; and - after that consultation, to report to the Minister on the views of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, and of the wider community, as to whether such a document or documents would benefit the Australian community as a whole, and, if the Council considers there would be such a benefit, to make recommendations to the Minister on the nature and content of, and manner of giving effect to, such a document or documents. With regard to the functions relating to a document or instrument of reconciliation, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and Commissioner Johnston agree that the approach should concentrate on the process of reconciliation and not an instrument which might become an outcome of the process. Commissioner Johnston has also observed that, in the past, there has been a tendency for the process to be 'bogged down and diverted by concentration on issues about which there was, or might be, disagreement'. As Commissioner Johnston so correctly stated, 'words can enlighten but they can also impose their o:"",n tyranny'. I agree absolutely with this VIew. I turn now to the composition of the Council. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, established by this Bill, will comprise not more than 25 members. The Council will consist of: past - a Chairperson, who must be Aboriginal; - a Deputy Chairperson; - a member of the Parliament nominated by the Minister; - a member of the Parliament nominated by the Leader of the Opposition; - a member of the Parliament nominated by the Leader of any non-government party in the Parliament of at least five members that is not part of the Opposition; - the Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; - the Deputy Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander Commission; and - other members appointed by the Min,ister. At least two members will be Torres Strait Islanders and 12 will be Aboriginal. Other members will be drawn from church, business, trade union, ethnic and other community leaders. I draw to the attention of honourable members that this departs in one respect from the membership outlined in the discussion paper-that is, that a Government member other than the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be on the Council. This change is as a result of my appointment as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and consequently the Minister to whon;t the Council will report. The legislation provides that, before members are appointed to the Council, the Minister is to consult with the Leader of the Opposition; the Leader of any nongovernment party in the Parliament of at least five members which is not part of the Opposition; and with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. Although the legislation provided for appointments of up to four years, initial appointments to the Council will be for a period up to three years. As these and other provisions demonstrate, this legislation has been carefully framed to achieve continuing cross-party commitment to the process of reconciliation through to the centenary of Federation in 2001. As I have indicated, a central role of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be to bring about, through education, a greater level of awareness of Aboriginal history, cultures, dispossession, continuing disadvantage and the need to redress that disadvantage. In short, we must come to terms honestly with our own history as a nation. In so many ways this is a sad history which includes the dispossession, massacre and dispersa- of Aboriginal people, confinement in reserves, removal of children from their families, and the destruction of aspects of Aboriginal culture. As the Royal Commission recognised, this history-and much of it very recent history-needs to be recognised as the primary cause of the current disadvantaged position of Australia's indigenous peoples. The objective of the process is not to create guilt but to create an understanding of an important part of the history of Australia and the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in that history. The outcome will be practical and positive. All fair-minded non-Aboriginal Australians will have the opportunity to develop an appreciation of Aboriginal people and of their disadvantaged position in society as well as an appreciation of the richness of Aboriginal cultures and achievements and the special position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the indigenous peoples of this continent. This process of public awareness and community education will involve, among other things, a focus on our education systcms. Generations of non-Aboriginal Australians have grown up with a very poor education about Aboriginal Australia. As recently as 1967 my own official Ncw South Wales school history textbook for year 10 said Aborigines who lived in towns would 'recklessly share their posscssions with parasitic relatives and friends'. The textbook went on to say: .. probably the greatest problem was presented by Aborigines and part Aborigines who seemed to inhabit a 'lost world'. They had lost the high moral and ethical traits of their ancestors, and had also failed to accept the white man's moral and legal codes. They were lazy individuals, apparently devoid of morals, and always prepared to lie, cheat or steal. Think how my 16-year-old Aboriginal friends felt being taught this version of Australia's history at Forster High School in 1967. Earlier this year I announced a national reconciliation and schooling strategy which will see schools playa key role in creating an awareness of Aboriginal issues in the community, to be implemented in closc consultation with State, Territory and nongovernment schools. The public awareness and education process must also, howcver, reach out to Australians who h-'.ve already left school. It has always been the Government's objective that the process should have a strong community focus. Millions of nonAboriginal Australians have no contact with Aboriginal people. In local communities across Australia we need to establish the opportunity for dialogue. In this process Aboriginal people must be given the opportunity to work together with the non-Aboriginal community-local government, the churches, the business community, the trade union movement, service clubs and community organisations. It is my hope that the reconciliation process will touch the lives of all Australians in their local communities. I turn now to a most critical aspect of the whole reconciliation process. The preamble to the legislation seeks a national commitment to address Aboriginal social justice issues. Paragraph (d) of the preamble states: . . . as a part of the reconciliation process, the Commonwealth will seek an ongoing national commitment from governments at all levels to co-operate and to co-ordinate with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as appropriate to address progressively Aboriginal disadvantage and aspirations in relation to land, housing, law and justice, cultural heritage, education, employment, health, infrastructure, economic development and any other relevant matters in the decade leading to the centenary of Federation, 2001. As a nation we must not miss the opportunity presented by the centenary of Federation to address critical areas of Aboriginal disadvantage. There can be no reconciliation without justice. Unless all levels of government cooperate to redress Aboriginal disadvantage, Aboriginal people will remain, on all relevant social indicators, the most disadvantaged Australians. It was these underlying issues of critical Aboriginal disad vantage which the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody found were the principal reasons for the disproportionately high rates of Aboriginal imprisonment-up to 30 times the rate of non-Aboriginal Australians. I remind the House of the graphic picture of Aboriginal Australia provided by the lives and deaths of those 99 predominantly young Aboriginal Australians who died in custody. The average age at death was only 32 years. Of the 99 Aboriginal people who died, 43 had experienced childhood separation from their natural families through intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. 83 of the 99 were unemployed at the date of their last detention. 43 of the 99 had been charged with an offence at or before the age of 15. Only two of the 99 had completed secondary schooling. 43 of the 99 wcre taken into custody in the period immediately before their deaths on matters directly related to the overuse of alcohol and, in the remaining cases, the Royal Commission concluded that alcohol was a contributing factor in their being taken into custody for the last time. The Royal Commission concluded that the standard of health of the 99 whose average age was 32 varied from poor to very bad. The average age of those dying from natural causes was a little over 30 years. The development of a national commitment to redress Aboriginal disadvantage will not be achieved simply by the enactment of this legislation. The unanimous commitment of the Parliament to this objective will, however, be a solid foundation for the achievement of the necessary intergovernmental cooperation to address that disadvantage. But this commitment must be backed by specific intergovernmental programs and policies in areas such as the Aboriginal employment development policy, the Aboriginal education policy and the national Aboriginal health strategy, and this backing must be underpinned by the necessary funding from all levels of government. All governments will be judged now and by history on whether they honour their expressed commitments to these policies. For example, there can be no more pressing need at this moment than for State and Territory governments to join with the Commonwealth to meet our obligation to implement the national Aboriginal health strategy. As both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have observed, as a part of the reconciliation process there should also be a national commitment to the attainment of specific goals in redressing Aboriginal disadvantage. The setting of these goals needs to be a cooperative exercise by Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. Goals thus agreed will have credibility and offer realistic measures of achievement. State and local governments will need to be actively involved in the reconciliation process. The Commonwealth welcomes the support already given by State governments and by the Government of the Australi<l.n Capital Territory. Mr Speaker, reconciliation is not a vague concept. It is a practical process. As an indication of the practical nature of the Council's work, the Bill makes provision for the Council to develop strategic plans that include statements of the Council's goals and objectives in the promotion of the process of reconciliation, together with indicators and targets for measuring the Council's performance in relation to those goals and objectives. The requirement is for the Council to produce its first strategic plan, covering a three year period, within 12 months of the commencement of the legislation. A further requirement is that each strategic plan must be laid before each House of the Parliament. To highlight the cross-party approach we have taken to the reconciliation process, I remind honourable members of the provision in the Bill that stipulates that, before the Minister approves a strategic plan developed by the Council, the Leader of the Opposition must be consulted. Since becoming Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I have been privileged to attend many significant gatherings of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. These events have often been moving and uplifting experiences, and they have helped shape this process of reconciliation. Through these experiences I have come to understand the depth of the hurt felt by Aboriginal people over the prejudice and lack of respect shown to them in their daily lives by so many non-Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal people understandably feel frustration and anger over their treatment. But there is also an enormous reservoir of hope, purpose and goodwill within Aboriginal communities across Australia. I mention just two events which embody what this process of reconciliation is all about. Last year I attended a graduation ceremony for two young Aboriginal doctors at the University of Newcastle. One of them, Sandra Eades, spoke about what it was like to be an Aboriginal woman and a doctor-of how when people looked at her in the hospital with her white coat they would look again, not believing what they had seen. Her very presence shattered the false and all too common stereotypes of Aboriginal people. Sandra Eades said that her achievement in becoming a doctor was not so much a personal one, but one which showed that Aboriginal people could if given the chance do anything. The second event was the transfer to Aboriginal ownership of a pastoral property at Merapah on Cape York in June last year. The former Queensland Government's overtly racist policy of blocking the transfer of pastoral leases to Aboriginal interests, even when they had been purchased on the open market as in this case, meant that it was not until 1990 that the first such property was openly transferred to Aboriginal ownership. At the transfer ceremony, an elderly Aboriginal man, Wompoo Kepple, spoke from personal experience. Mr Kepple has had no formal education. He has no real knowledge of Federal Parliament, of the workings of government, even of capital city life. As a young boy on Cape York, he lived through the brutal treatment of his people, their exploitation by pastoralists and their removal from their lands. In more recent times, he has seen his people suffer from the problems which afflict many Aboriginal communities because of their disadvantaged position in this country. On that day in Cape York, Wompoo Kepple spoke with sadness, but without bitterness. He spoke remembering the history, but looking to the future. Wompoo Kepple said more eloquently than can I what is needed in this country: that Australia is a great country and that there is room for us all in it. But what all Australians must do, he said, is to think about how we are going to cooperate and to live together in harmony, of how we are going to relate together. This is what the process of reconciliation seeks to achieve. The Australian Parliament has shown before that it is capable of finding common ground in Aboriginal affairs. In 1967, the then Federal Coalition Government and the Labor Opposition joined to give a unanimous commitment to constitutional change to effectively give Aboriginal people full citizenship. The people of this nation responded to that clear and powerful message-and a record 92 per cent of the Australian population supported the referendum proposing the change. The Commonwealth Parliament now faces another opportunity to provide a lead for this country. In drafting this legislation, the Government has taken into account the views of a wide spectrum of organisations and individuals; it has consulted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the Australian Democrats and the Federal coalition; and has considered their views and addressed their concerns. This legislation does not a narrow political agenda; it establishes a practical and effective method of coming to grips with something that goes to the very heart of this country's identity and its place in the world. This is a process framed to endure for a decade, calculated to transform relations between Aboriginal and nonAboriginal Australians, and to build a national commitment to social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It is a process which is intrinsica11y Australian-one based on recognition of the essential dignity of humankind; elimination of racism; recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as Australia's indigenous people; and a commitment to a fair go for Australia's most disadvantaged people. It is a process which is intended to be substantially completed by the time of our most important national anniversary, the centenary of the establishment of the Australian nation. It is a process deliberately intended to shape the kind of country we will be in 2001, less than 10 years from now. It is a process which will capture national and international attention. It is a process which the whole nation must embrace and which must not be allowed to fail. I commend the Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum.

The following answer to a question was circulated: Vendor Qualification Scheme (Question No. 781) Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for Science and Technology, upon notice, on 7 May 1991: (1) In what specific ways is the Vendor Qualification Scheme (VQS) used to promote the development of higher standards in the information related industries, such as component and software industries. (2) What is the relationship between the VQS and the National Industry Extension Service. (3) Will there be a closer relationship between the VQS and the Industry Research and Development Board; if so, in what specific ways. (4) Has the effectiveness of the VQS been evaluated since its inception; if so, are the results publicly available. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Vendor Qualification Scheme (VQS) was established as an element of the Government's Information Industries Strategy. A pilot intake of 12 firms was accepted into the Scheme in 1989. The scheme now has 37 firms. By focusing on quality VQS assists Australian firms to market information technology products, including components, overseas and to transnational companies operating in Australia. The Scheme has three programs covering Standards Awareness, Vendor Development and Infrastructure. Standards Awareness is concerned with improving local industry knowledge of the importance of product, quality and safety standards in international trade. The Vendor Development Program subsidises eligible firms 50% of the costs incurred in achievsmall ing internationally recognised quality and safety standards, process controls, and support programs such as World Competitive Manufacturing and Total Quality Management. NA The Infrastructure Program is developing a testing capability for Australian information tcchnology firms in the areas of safety and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). This will reduce both industry costs and product development time. The Scheme has contracted a specialist Technical Adviser from Bull HN in the USA to assist in this activity. At present the VQS docs not cover software. Following the announcement in the March Economic Statement options for developing a software quality initiative are bcing considered. The precise outline of the software initiative is being developed in consultation with industry. (2) The Vendor Development Program is delivered at the flrm level by field officers from the respective State NIES offices. Their involvement extends to evaluation of a firm's capabilities and recommendation of activities to be funded under the VQS. (3) The VQS and IR&D Board currently liaise at the Secretariat level to identify areas of cooperation in the promotion and commercialisation of R&D through the application of quality standards. From this contact it may eventuate that the IR&D Board and VQS will combine in promoting quality and standards through IR&D projects. (4) No, there has been no evaluation of overall effectiveness of the VQS since its inception. However, the VQS has been subject to internal reviews involving the Technical Adviser and other bodies such as NIES, Standard's Australia and National Association of Testing Authorities. These have resulted in the streamlining of the Scheme and enhancement of its delivery. The progress of companies participating in the Vendor Development Program is closely monitored by State NIES. The process of implementing quality systems can take up to two years to complete. Only a number of companies in the program have so far completed the implementation phase. An appropriate assessment of overall effectiveness will be made when more companies have fully implemented their quality and standards programs.",221
