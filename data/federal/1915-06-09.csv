4,Mr ARCHIBALD,LIVERPOOL MANOEUVR E,"I have looked in to the case, and find that there is a great difference between the claimed by the owner of the land and the offer of the Crown, the owner asking about £900, and the Crown offering about £200 .",5
5,Mr FLEMIN G,LIVERPOOL MANOEUVR E,That is one little tricks of the 'Crown.,5

If so, when was Sir George so informed?",5
9,Mr MAHON,LIVERPOOL MANOEUVR E,"Sir George Reid was EMPLOYEES. informed some time ago that his term cf office would be extended for twelve months. Some communications subsequently took place between the Government and Sir George Reid, and on 22nd A p r i l I think-ther e was an earlier notification by cable-Si r George was in formed by letter that there would be no further extension of the term after the twelve months had expired.  good enough to give the House the reasons why he desires that the services of Sir George Reid shall not be continued ?",5
10,Mr MAHON,LIVERPOOL MANOEUVR E,"The original term of AREA. office stated in the Act creating the office of High Commissioner was five years. I presume Parliament had good reasons for fixing that period. In addition to the five years, however, Sir George Reid is to serve this Government for an Liverpool additional period of twelve months. Personally I think that an absence of six years from Australia is a long term for a gentleman occupying such an office.

I do not think it ""right that he should press for my in-, dividual opinion as to whether or not Sir George Reid's representation of the Commonwealth has come up to Australia's expectations. I have no complaint to make of Sir George Reid's representation of Australia in London, but he must recognise that after so many years' absence from the Commonwealth be must be, to some extent, out of touch with Australian public feeling and public opinion.

The proposed amended scheme of competition is based on that already issued, and is now receiving' consideration by the Federated Council of Architects, and the Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction preparatory to its final adoption. 2. It is considered that since the war, conditions have so altered that the most practicable and advisable course will be to restrict the competition to British countries.

I had expected that the Tariff would have come under consideration earlier in the session, and that we should have had an opportunity of dealing with this remission of duty in - the ordinary course of dealing with the Tariff - As, however, consideration of the Tariff has been delayed, the duty which the business people have paid on these imports is held up by the Government pending, parliamentary sanction to remit it;, and I am taking action now to convenience the importers, many of whom are small men.",13

108,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"There is a time when the order of business can be altered, but the Government have not taken the course which would allow of that being done in a regular way. The Standing Orders specifically state that when the Order of the Day for Supply is called upon, with the exception of every third ' Thursday, I shall leave the Chair immediately. If that practice were not followed, we should have a grievance day on every occasion when a motion to go into Supply was before the House, instead of only once in every' three weeks.

Surely the Minister can tell us on what information the Government acted. So far as I am aware, we have never been given that information.

If that be so, there must be other parts which enjoyed a bountiful season, and produced straw, hay and chaff, bran and pollard and oats in abundance.

124,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"If it were ascertained that there would be an actual shortage between crops, and that, no matter what price might be offered for fodder, it could not be got locally, the action of the Government was justified' because the import duty would then have operated only as arevenue duty, and I am not in favour of the imposition of revenue duties, and have never voted for them. I rose because this is the first occasion on which this matter bas been mentioned, in the House.",15
125,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I have answered at least a dozen questions on the subject.,15

127,Mr KELLY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Wentworth) [3.56] The honourable member for Cook has placed the Minister in a somewhat difficult position. He must realise as clearly as any one else that it is difficult for the Minister to explain how widespread the drought was when the Prime Minister consistently referred to it as a little drought. ThePrime Minister has always denounced any one who has at"" tempted to draw attention to the suffern g deings of our producers as the result of the bad season through which we have just passed. To dare to do that seems to be, in his opinion, unpatriotic and un-British. He appears to fear that the Germans might hear' of it . Consequently out of the purest patriotism he has consistently spoken of the drought as only a little one, although, as we all know, it has been very widespread, and it is not altogether fair to ask the M in ister of Trade and Customs to make a' fool, so to speak, of his leader. What is proposed is to validate the action the Government Has taken. What was done was, in my opinion, necessary, and I therefore offer no opposition to the proposal before us, but I ask the Minister what' he proposes to do in regard to the duty on sugar.",15

132,Mr KELLY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not propose to do so, but I urge Ministers in all cases where there is an absolute shortage of an article to place that article on the free list, so. long as that action will not pletely dislocate local employment.",16
133,Dr CARTY SALMON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Grampians) [4.1].;- I agree with what has been said about the extraordinary position adopted by the Prime Minister in regard to the drought. Nothing but dire necessity would excuse such a departure from the - Protectionist policy of the country as is now proposed, and those of us who are in close touch with the country districts know that the conditions which bave recently prevailed have been almost unprecedented. The drought was so severe and sudden that it found the community quite unprepared for it . I do not propose to say anything against the granting of relief to the consumers of fodder, but we are entitled to receive from the Minister more specific information concerning the reasons which prompted the action of the Government. I have always felt that the Prime Minister was wrong in describing the drought as a little one.  what a drought, is.",16

The drought of last season was the most severe, because the most sudden, ever experienced in this part of Australia. The Protectionist party is sometimes charged with giving no assistance to those on the land, and what is now proposed takes from the producers a benefit given to tnem by the Tariff. As I bave said, only dire neces-. sity could excuse the action now taken. Yet the Minister has given no reason for the action of the Government, first in declaring that the drought was only limited in character, and then in taking : the drastic step of depriving a large number of persons of the benefit of protective",16
135,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The duties that have been remitted are of no use to our farmers except in times of drought.,16
136,Dr CARTY SADMON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not altogether agree with the honourable member. There is one commodity in regard to which, if it were not for our Protectionist policy, our farmers would have to meet very serious competition. This commodity would come from New Zealand, as in years gone by, in such quantities as com- to rob the growers within the Commonwealth of much of the benefit of the Protectionist policy. Simply because I am aware of the conditions, I am not going to oppose the proposal of the Government; but I feel that the Minister might have been a little more candid, and could have been so, without any great danger of conveying information to the enemy. We should have had placed on record the reason why he, as an avowed ardent Protectionist, has seen fit to introduce a proposal of an undoubtedly Free Trade",16

It is quite obvious that if Parliament does rise, and tbese goods are left on the free list, it will be impossible for the Minister to do then what he can do when Parliament is in session.

I do not regard the duties as absolutely essential to our primary industries; we all know that they are not. There are only very odd years wh«n the farmers get any benefit from such duties. Of course,- they may operate at times in regard to oats, bay, and wheat, but generally they are practically inoperative. I am pleased that the Committee is showing a disposition to ratify what the Minister has. done; and the only trouble is that the honorany able gentleman did not act soon enough. In my opinion, the Federal Government and the State Governments have slept on the question, whereas they should Lave been in the field much earlier. The first consignment of lucerne for Victoria is about to be landed, to be followed by the first consignment of cereal fodder; but, in the meantime, thousands of head of stock have died. The assurance by the Minister that the fodder is coming in duty free constitutes, in my judgment, not Free Trade, but the highest form of Protection that could be offered to count r y producers at the present time, seeing that full y 90 per cent, or 95 per cent, of the farmers are buyers, and not growers and sellers.",17

The action of the Government in regard to grain and pulse is perfectly clear to the people generally, but they went further, and remitted the duty on hay and chaff; and a statement has been made that that action was taken only after a deputation of Melbourne people bad waited on the Minister-that it was a relief granted, not so much to pastoralists and farmers, as to city people.",18

I urge the Government to reconsider the matter, because the position is certainly not fair to the distant community in Western Australia. The argument that was used as against the importation, namely, that maize could be purchased in Australia, has been proved to be absolutely incorrect; and I see no reason why those who require that commodity should not be placed in the same position as those who require hay and chaff.",18

I believe, in spite of the interjections that have been made, that the drought from which Australia is suffering at the present time, particularly so far as concerns Western Australia, South Australia,'Victoria , and Tasmania, has been the most severe that any of these States have experienced since their foundation, and it is a matter for regret that Tariff revision was not dealt with before. In some portions of the southern States it is practically impossible to buy some of the items enumerated in the resolution, except at prices which place them beyond the reach of the ordinary consumer. My only regret is that the Government have not dealt with this matter in one broad comprehensive measure.",19
178,Mr ATKINSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Wilmot) [4.23] - I was not in the Committee when the resolution was moved, and I did not hear the Minister's explanation of the idea that the Government have regarding the period during which it is intended that this Bill shall operate. I presume the [139]- 2 Government do not expect the Committee",19
179,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I will reply to that now if the honourable gentleman sits down.,19
180,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Yarra - Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.23] - In reference to the question asked by the honourable member for Cook, I would like to say that the Government did take action. In October, when the Premiers met in Melbourne, I visited the Conference on more than one occasion, and afterwards, on behalf of the Federal Government, I approached the Premiers individually, with a view to some joint action being taken. It was known that there was likely to be a shortage of about 300,000 tons of fodder in Victoria.",19
181,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What amount was available ?,19
182,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Seven hundred thousand tons, instead of a m ill i o n - I think those are the figures, but I am speaking from memory. Our idea was that all the Governments should act together, and that the Federal Government should make arrangements to Buy in New Zealand on behalf of the States. We could have bought then at the price of £ 3 10s. per ton.",19
183,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,That was the matter time to buy.,19
184,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"We tried to get the State Premiers to move, but the response was not encouraging. South Australia asked for oaten straw, and Western Australia asked that the duty on maize should be remitted, though, as we were producing five or six million bushels, the Government did not consider it desirable ho accept the Western Australian suggestion.",19
185,Mr RODGERS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Was it not the desire that you should allow private enterprise to import?,19
186,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"That was suggested, but I may point out that if the suggestion had been accepted, a dozen or more purchasers would have been operating in the New Zealand market, with the result that prices would have at once gone up , and that the people would not have obtained any advantage from our action.",19
187,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Were you referring to hay and chaff?,19
188,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Yes .,19
189,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What is the pripe now?,19
190,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I think it is somewhere about £ 1 0 or £ 1 1 per ton for chaff.. ""South Australia, as I have stated, did take action by asking us, the end of January, to make oaten straw. I pointed out that I did not think this would be of much effect, but that is what the South Australian Government asked for. Subsequently the Government agreed;-and a public announcement was made to this effect through the press-that as Parliament was not sitting, and in view of the shortage-as far as we knew it then existed, judging from the prices that were being, obtained-instea d of importing ourselves, to do the next best thing, .While we could hot remit the duty, as Parliament was not sitting, it was agreed that whatever duty was paid should be ear-marked, and subsequently repaid to the importer. It is in order to validate that action that this proposal has now been brought forward.",19
191,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Did the States ask thg Federal Government to import?,20
192,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No . We were asked by the Government to remit the duty on Western Australian maize, and subsequently by the South Australian Government on oaten straw. Mr Hutchinson and Dr Cameron, representing Victoria, saw me on many occasions with regard to the matter from the Victorian stand-point. This Bill is drawn up in the interests of the agricultural community, notwithstanding what my honourable friends opposite have said about the interests of the cab-driver.",20
193,Mr RODGERS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I said they compelled action.,20
194,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Wbateve r amount of hay, or straw, or bran, or pollard, or oats is consumed by the horses of cabdrivers, a. hundred, or probably a thousand times as much is consumed by the animals of other people in the community.

195,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No . The record has been kept, but I have not got it here.",20
196,Mr RODGERS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It has not arrived yet.,20
197,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Oh , yes. Some of it has been brought in , and the importers are asking that, as we promised the duty should be remitted, it shall be remitted at once, so that they can get back the money which they have paid in dut) . 7",20
198,Mr ATKINSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Can you say how long the Government intend that this resolution shall remain in operation ?,20
199,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Until the Tariff is contowards sidered by Parliament-and we are hoping to get on with the Tariff next week. The matter will then depend on Parliament.,20
200,Mr ATKINSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,But what is your idea about it ? You must have something in your mind.,20
201,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,We have. The idea of the Government is that these duties shall be reimpoSed as soon as possible for the benefit of the Protectionists in the honourable member's electorate.,20
202,Mr RODGERS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Assumin g the Tariff has not been reached before the harvest, will the duty be reimposed before then?",20
203,Mr TUDOR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The Tariff will be reached before the harvest. I can assure the honourable member on that point. Progress reported. ESTIMATES , 1914-15. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 2nd June. vide, page 3629): DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS. Division 34 (Administrative). £22,343.  week, when the honourable member for Grey was addressing himself to these Estimates, he censured the Government for their want of policy in regard to the Northern Territory. It is not the fact that there bas been an entire absence of policy in regard to this territory. In my opinion, there has been clear evidence of a well-defined policy, and I do not know that we can object altogether to it , because that policy has been in consonance with the Government's general belief. It has been a Socialistic policy- a policy which, however suitable it might be to some people under some conditions, is bound to fail when applied to the development of a territory such as the Northern Territory. Last year the total deficiency amounted in round figures to £500,000 . Out of that deficiency the sum of £26,880 has to be provided for in tbese Estimates for the payment of salaries. The Minister admitted in this Committee, some time ago, that the Northern Territory presents very great difficulties. I think his speech was the most pessimistic utterance that I have ever listened to from a Minister in charge of a large and important Department. It seemed ""to me,to be a cry of hopelessness; but we are piling up these deficiencies year ""after year, without making any progress. The Batchelor Farm, started with a good deal of eclat, has been practically abandoned. The cattle taken up there have been so treated that they appear to have been lamentable failures, and the whole thing is depressing in the extreme. In view of the fact that the Government's Socialistic policy, when applied to the Northern Territory, has proved itself a failure, [ think it is high time that we should seek to induce the Government to adopt some other policy. What I suggest is that we should* at the earliest possible moment, get rid of a large number of the highly-paid ofncials Who have been sent up to the Territory, and save the expenses incidental to their existence there, which Would be by no means limited to the large amount paid in salaries. Having done this, the Government should embark upon some well-defined policy whereby the natural resources of the Territory can be developed. There is tjnly one way in Which that can be done, it is by the establishment of railways. The Northern Territory should be coupled tip, according to our agreement with South Australia, to Oodnadatta, and in the direction of the Macdonnell Ranges, at the earliest possible moment; but I think, also, that there should be railway communication with Queensland. The only policy that can be of any service must be a vigorous policy. As things are now, we are simply frittering away £100,000 this year, and £100,000 next year, without accomplishing anything. There must be a vigorous policy if the Territory is to be developed, and. I suggest that that policy should be a borrowing policy, to raise money so that the necessary railways can be quickly constructed. So far as the Oodnadatta railway is concerned, I do not think that - there is any question at all about its desirability, or that the country in the Macdonnell Ranges is not eminently suited to the production of meat, and more particularly beef. I venture to think that if there had been a railway across that area at the present we should have been saved the exorbitant prices which have recently been charged for meat in Australia. The construction of such a railway in accordance with a policy which would not impose any immediate additional taxation on the people, would open up the country, would gradually lead to its being inhabited and exploited, and would so benefit, not only the Territory ""itself, but the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. Since We are contributing year after year so much towards the maintenance of the Territory, we are entitled to expect that, sohiething shall be done at the earliest possible moment to give us a return for our money, and, so far as I can see, the only means by which we can secure a return is the production of vast quantities of meat at a lower price than that at which we can obtain it elsewhere. I listened carefully to the speech made last week by the honourable member for Wimmera, who advocated a policy with which I am in no way in agreement. The honourable member urged that we should obtain from India the services of an engineering expert, possessing high qualifications, to advise us with regard to an irrigation policy for the Northern Territory. I am soundly convinced that an irrigation policy is suited only to a welldeveloped country, and not to a virgin land like the Northern Territory. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not give any serious consideration to such a policy. We can readily guess what would be the report made by an irrigation expert from India. He would, in all probability, say that we have in the Northern Territory the necessary water supply to irrigate certain parts' of it, and that, under certain conditions, it would be a profitable venture. But we must not lose sight of the fact that his experience of irrigation would have been gained in a country where the cost of labour is purely nominal, whereas no successful irrigation policy could be carried out where labour is at such a price as that likely to prevail in the Northern Territory. The Department of External Affairs is becoming more interesting since it now not only administer^ the Northern Territory, but also controls Papua. 1I have a few observations to offer with regard to that Commonwealth. Territory. The last report which We have received from the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua shows that in time, 1912-13 the territorial revenue amounted to £54,000, or £6,000 in excess of the revenue for the previous year, and more than double that received five years ago. These figures, so far as they go, are eminently satisfactory. They indicate progress and development, and show that the administration of the Territory is moving, to' some extent, along satisfactory lines. But there is another important statement embodied in this report which acts as an antidote to any feeling of congratulation which the reading of these figures might arouse. I refer to the paragraph in which it is stated that "" the volume of trade last year shows a decline of £11,000."" That is an unpleasant fact in respect of a country that has been developed to a considerable extent at our expense. The total receipts last year were £112,000, and of that amount the Commonwealth contributed in various ways £63,000. Mr RICHAH D FOSTER - O r more than one half the total revenue.  most serious aspects of this decline in the volume of trade is that it relates to exports, which were £5,000 less than for the previous year. The Lieutenant-Governor's report, goes on to sayThis decline in the exports is dne to the duced output of gold, which was £15,000 less than the previous year. I regret that this is so, and I think it worthy of note that the gold-mining ventures in Papua are uot proving as successful as we might have hoped. In the absence of a larger output of gold, the progress of the Territory is not likely to be rapid. There is yet another very unsatisfactory fact relating to the occupation of land in Papua. I am surprised to learn from this report that the area under lease has decreased regularly since 1911. In 1913-14 the area under lease was 60,000 acres less than in 1912-13. That is not an evidence of development. There must be a screw loose somewhere, and we have to ask ourselvas whether we are securing a fair return for our money. Judge Murray refers to a report made by Dr A r t h u r Wade, which deals with petroleum in Papua, and is good enough to say that it is eminently satisfactory. I regard it as being eminently unsatisfactory. I have been studying recently the question of petroleum and oils, and find that it is said by one excellent authority that if a map of the world were marked with a red spot at every place where there are indications and showings of petroleum, it would present the appearance of a person suffering from smallpox. The idea sought to hs> conveyed by that statement is that indications of petroleum are very widely distributed over the face of the earth. But there are certain places where petroleum is in great abundance, where it has proved of' inestimable value and of great profit. I , for one, would thank God if we could find a good flow of crude oil in Australia or Papua. It would be worth making a considerable sacrifice to secure. Dr Wade's report gives some indication that there is likely to be a favourable issue to the operations being carried on in various parts of Papua. He tells us, at page 15 of his report, thatThree miles to the east of the mission station at Orokolo we found a series of mud volcanoes in the coastal fringe of hills just over one mile north of the fishing village of Hohoro. . . . From Ekoa a series of vents extend eastward for about 4 miles towards Vaiviri on the Vailala River. The mud volcanoes consist chiefly of large flat cones varying from a few inches in diameter to about 20 feet. Much gas is escaping, along with brine, and good showings of petroleum. The sum total of the encouragement appears to be that the indications are good. re- In various places, we are told, there is a possibility of striking a good flow, b ut we have no definite assurance on the subject. The writer of this report goes on to urge the need of caution. He is a prominent authority, and we find him statingAfter mature consideration of all the conditions, I , therefore, recommend that the plant necessary for the safe, rapid, and economical development of the Papuan areas is the P-rker Mogul rotary of the latest type, and that the Parker firm be asked to supply to each plant two drillers with a guaranteed practical experience of their system. This, however, will entail considerable expenditure, and it may bewell to delay until the present plants on the field have been more thoroughly tested. In other words, we must be cautious. Before entering upon an enterprise which would involve much expenditure, we must make the best use of the small and inefficient plant we already have. Again, at page 34 of his report, Dr Wade statesGate valves should be available on the fieldfor controlling and checking the flow of oil, should it be struck. ""Should it be struck!"" Notwithstand ing all his knowledge and experience as a geologist, Dr Wade is not prepared to> make any more definite statement. At pags 37 of his report he advises rigid economyRigid economy, as far ns efficiency will allow, should be exercised until commercial quantities of petroleum are struck. Operations? should be hastened with this in view in order to put the working on a sound financial basis. I come now to what is the more important part of this report, which deals with the policy of the Government for the development of the field which has been examined. Dr Wade says The declared policy of the Commonwealth Government is to reserve the oil-field for Government exploitation. It is, therefore, obvious that the development must necessarily be comparatively slow for financial reasons. He says furtherThe effect of the Government policy will, therefore, in case of success, mean that no great output, sueh as is the case in privately owned fields, can be expected from New Guinea for a considerable period. This comes from a disinterested source. The author of this report is not committed to a policy either for or against State owned or State-controlled fields. But - he points out that if this work is undertaken by the Government, it must necessarily be a slow, and therefore an expensive, process.",20
204,Mr FENTON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Is the honourable member putting a proper interpretation upon the report?  Wade states furtherThe oil indications, however, extend over a wide area, and, should the Government think fit, a portion of the field oould be thrown open to private enterprise. Taking Eerema as the dividing line, if the Government retained the enormous area to the west, there still remains a large area to the east which iB likely to be idle for a long time. It may be worthwhile considering whether it is good policy to leave this area undeveloped. I would urge the Minister to give some consideration to this particular recommendation. Dr Wade reports thatIf private enterprise is to be admitted, it must be done in the early stages, otherwise if the results in the initial stages of the vernment exploitation of the western field fall short of expectation, it may make it difficult for companies to raise the money required. Suoh disappointments are always possible. A good deal of importance attaches to that proposal. If we are going to develop this or any other portion of the oil fields by private enterprise, then, as Dr Wade says, it is essentially necessary that private enterprise be given the first chance, because if an area proved disappointing it would be very difficult to induce any one to put capital into such a venture in other parts of Papua. Another serious matter-tb e last to which I shall draw attention-relate s to the question of labour. Dr Wade saysLabour is not cheap in Papnn when compared-with wages paid in other oil fields with which I am acquainted. Wages vary from 10s. to £2 per month for labourers and foremen, and, in addition, the men must be housed, fed on meat, rice, tea, sugar, and vegetables, or equivalents, and supplied with a quantity of tobacco weekly, according to Government schedules. A few skilled native workers get as much ns £8 a month with these additions. On the whole, the Papuan labourer is well paid, well fed, ivel] housed, and well treated in every respect. Whilst I am not advocating cheap labour, I do say that if we 'are to make a success of ventures of this nature in competition with other places where still cheaper labour is available, we can only do so at the expense of the general community, and the cost of the article must increase. That is a very serious consideration, and it is well that the Committee should be acquainted with these facts.",23
205,Mr WEST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The wages mentioned are not very princely.  for native""labour.",23
206,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"They are the wages which the Government are paying to natives.  tion to these matters in the hope that the Minister will think twice before entering upon a large expenditure in the development of these oil fields, because the report which is referred to by Judge Murray as satisfactory seems to me eminently unsatisfactory, having regard to the little assurance that could be given that the oil is really there, and that, even if it is tliere, it is doubtful whether we can work it at a profit. I turn now to another matter. Amongst other interesting places which the Minister of External Affairs has Go- under his control is Norfolk Island, to which somereference was made in the course of the debate last week. I was amongst those who were privileged to pay a visit to the island a little time ago. A gentleman who has resided in the island for many years, and has made his home there, describes it as "" B e a u t if u l ! Sublime! Incomparable!"" and he saysWithin its borders are neither public-houses, pawnbrokers, workhouses, madhouses, nor gaols. Add to this its prodigal profusion in nature (for its resources, owing to its wonderful fertility, are proverbial} by the Providence of its Bountiful Creator; its freedom from all conventionality and restraint, the allurements of its occupations on land and sea, the diversity of its refined pastimes and enjoyments, and you have at once a most bewitching island, an ideal home. The writer of that passage is Mr J . E . S. Caverswall, a Britisher who believes that he has reached a veritable Paradise. The island is not self-supporting, and has not been so during the whole time it has been under the control of the New South Wales Government. According to the reports of Mr Atlee H u n t , at least £1,500 per annum, probably a great deal more, will be required fo carry on and finance the island. The question at once arises as to what use this island is to Australia. It is situated a little more than 1,000 miles due east of Sydney, and has an area of only about 8,000 acres. At the outside, its capital value cannot be more than £40,000 or £50,000. The island is at a great disadvantage in having no natural ports or harbors, but one reason why we should retain it under our control is that if we relinquish our hold, it may be occupied by undesirable neighbours. Therefore, I think that whatever expenditure is necessary to maintain the island will be borne cheerf u l ly by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth.",23
207,Mr WEST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"All the trade of the island is done with Australia.  great value is to be attached to the trade of so small an island. The present population is largely composed of the Pit cairners, who were the descendants of the Bounty mutineers. Originally they lived on the small island of Pitcairn, but subsequently, when their numbers bad considerably increased, they petitioned the Imperial Government for a larger island on which to make their home. As the Imperial authorities were at that time about to remove the convicts from Norfolk Island to Tasmania^-and in that fact we have the origin of the name "" New Norfolk ""-the Pitcairners were permitted to enter into possession of the vacated island. According to the last census, there were on Norfolk Island 596 Pitcairners, 193 persons connected with the Melanesian Mission-mostl y black boys from other islands who are taken to Norfolk Island for theological training, and subsequently return to their homes - and about 150 other residents, chiefly pure Britishers. I think the problem of making this island pay its own way offers wide scope for the exercise of good government on the part of the responsible Minister. The imports of Norfolk Island in 1913 represented a value of £ 9 , 3 7 1 , and came almost exclusively from Sydney, and the exports were worth' only £ 1 , 5 3 1 . A small island which isimporting over £9,000 worth of goods and exporting only £1,500 worth must be rapidly going to the bad financially. The problem for the Minister to tackle is to make the imports and exports balance so that the island may be made self-supporting.",24
208,The CHAIRMAN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The honourable member's time has expired.,24
209,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Barrier) [5.0] - It is not my intention to discuss a general policy for the Northern Territory; I shall simply content myself with saying that I have confidence in the future of that great province. Its climate, soil and rainfall are of such a character that we are justified in believing in the ultimate successful development of the Territory, but I am prepared to admit that the problem before us is a serious one, and will not be easily solved. The difficulty of the problem is increased by the fact that every time a State Government very rightly endeavours to make its own State more attractive for its people, that very endeavour detracts from the attractiveness of the Northern Territory, because, naturally, people will not go so far afield if they think they can do just as well nearer home. The people who go to the Territory are those who gaze into the future, and are prepared to surrender i m mediate comforts and pleasures for the sake of greater rewards in the years to come. Therefore, it is necessary for us to exercise patience in tackling the great problem of settling and developing the Territory. Ultimately, I am convinced, we shall accomplish that end, but only after many failures. I do not think that any one Minister, either now or in the future , will be able to populate and develop that territory successfully without first making failures. I have been rather surprised to hear some of the opinions expressed by members from South Australia. The opinions they are expressing today are rather different from those that were expressed in the years before the Federal Government took over the responsibility for the Territory. I refer, particularly, to those of the honourable member for Wakefield.",24
210,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The honorablo member for Wakefield was opposed to South Australia parting with the Territory.,24
211,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable member was not in this Parliament in the - days to which I refer, when very glowing speeches we're made by Mr Solomon, ancl other honourable members. One would have thought that the South Australian people were surrendering the Territory only out of a great sense of national duty. The anguish of a mother parting with her Benjamin was as nothing compared with the grief of South Australia in parting with the ""Northern Territory. The transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth was made with that utter disregard of their own interests which has always - characterized South Australians, who were actuated in regard to it only hy consideration for the common weal. But now that we have the Northern Territory, we hear from the honourable member for Wakefield that it cannot produce this, that, and the other, and that to do anything at all with it we must employ the giant intellects of the world.",25
212,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What I said was that its development needed the application of practical common sense.,25
213,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable member said that it required the application of the great intellects of the world, and the expenditure of vast sums of money to attract the most skilled men. The inference from his speech was that the world must be ransacked for capable directors before the Northern Territory could be made to produce anything. Before the transfer of the Territory, its resources had only to be tapped-so said the South Australians-to make it produce everything that could be conceived; but today one might believe from their utterances that they had unloaded a duffer mine upon the Commonwealth. I do not look in any pessimistic mood at the problem which we have to face in the development of the Northern Territory. I believe in the future of the Territory, and in the capacity of the people of Australia to conquer the - difficulty of developing it. The honourable member for Wakefield complained about - some of the attempts which had been made to encourage agriculture there. The agricultural policy of the last Fisher Administration was laid down by an able and courteous member of the Labour (party, who, before he entered this Legislature, was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly. T refer to the late Mr Batchelor, whose early death was universally deplored. In South Australia he had been Minister for Education, and had had the administration of the Northern Territory under his control.",25
214,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,For only a little while.,25
215,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"For a. considerable time he Was a member of a Cabinet that had to deal with the affairs of the Northern Territory, and for part of that time he was personally responsible for its administration. He laid down a scheme of great promise for the agricultural development of the Territory under Commonwealth control. I followed him in the office of Minister of External Affairs, and loyally attempted to carry on his policy, which I still think is the right one. I am sorry that my successor differed from us, and interfered to some extent with the working of the agricultural farms for which Mr Batchelor had provided.",25
216,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,No ; I distinctly said that we should give the scheme a trial. When I was in office there had been the experience of only eighteen months.,25
217,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Are these farms still being carried on?,25
218,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Yes ; we tried to improve them.,25
219,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I nm glad to know that. I thought that work on the Batchelor Farm had been stopped.,25
220,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Twenty-eigh t thousand pounds had been spent on agricultural experiments, and it would have been ridiculous to stop these experiments before some results had been obtained from them.",25
221,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I am glad to know that the experiments are continuing. At the initial stage many difficulties had to be faced. It may be that we made mistakes in some of our appointments. It was difficult at the time to get first-class men for the ordinary work, because there was no drought, and things were booming in all the States. One or two of our appointments did not turn out as well as we had hoped, although the men appointed had been trained at agricultural colleges. I am a great believer in the agricultural college system; but the men turned out from agricultural colleges have sometimes a great deal of theoretical knowledge, and need time for the acquirement of the practical acquaintance with agriculture which is necessary to make good farmers. Por one or two of the appointments I am to hlame, if blame is to be attached for the unsuitability of - the men appointed. The labour difficulties were greater then than they are now. In the first, instance we bad to give to men sent to the Territory a twelve months' engagement, and, of course, men so appointed are somewhat in the position of being able to please themselves as to what they will do, and what they will not do. Tbeir position is very different from that of men who are appointed by the day, and may be dismissed at any time. The drink evil, with which I do not propose to deal now, but to which I may refer at some length when the proposals of the Minister of External Affairs for the nationalization of the drink traffic in the Northern Terriof tory come before us, has also played its unhappy part in the Territory. I am strongly in favour of pressing on with the agricultural experiments that have beeu begun. The honourable member for Parramatta, when a member of the New South ""Wales Government, was, as Minister of Mines, in charge of the Hawkesbury College; but it is more than probable that that institution did not then pay its way.",25
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It does not do so now.,26
223,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"That is very likely. But the teaching that it has given - to young Australians, and the experiments which bave been carried out there, have been worth the expenditure upon the college. The same may be said of the Wagga Experimental Farm, and similar places. I understand that in Tasmania land which was at one time considered useless is now found to be of great value for apple-growing. Discoveries of this kind are largely brought about by experiments; and in the making of experiments there are sure to be mistakes and loss of money. I was of the opinion that the honourable member for Angas, when Minister of External Affairs, did not find Treasurer as sympathetic as he might have been.",26
224,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,No Treasurer is ever that.,26
225,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The right honourable member for Swan has good and large ideas, and does not hesitate to spend money on any scheme in which he - liasconfidence. His career in Western Australia proves that. He had faith in Western Australia, and did not hesitate to spend money there. But when Treasurer of the Commonwealth he made one or two remarks about the Northern Territory which were not as complimentary as I should have liked to hear from him - though , no doubt, they expressed hishonest convictions. I , therefore, thought that be was not as sympathetic as he might have been in regard to the experiments that were being carried on in the Northern Territory. Mistakes may have been made in the development of the Territory; but, in spite of that, money must be spent there, and the country has a great future. Listening to recent speeches some of the honourable members of the Opposition, one might think that this and the last Fisher Government did not desire to assist the pastoralists in the Northern Territory, yet, when, as Minister of External Affairs, I laid certain regulations before the House for the government of the Territory, they were condemned by honourable members of the then Opposition as too liberal. We were prepared to give to the pastoralists areas larger than some of the German principalities; but I was compelled by the speeches and actions of lionorable members of the Opposition, and one or two members of the Labour party, to withdraw my proposals. It is the policy of this Government to help the pastoralists as well as to encourage closer settlement. In attempting closer settlement in otlier parts of Australia mistakes have been made and failures have occurred. Except for one week wben the Labour party was in power, and could not do much, Victoria has been governed continuously by Liberal Administrations. The State Government have, I believe, honestly tried to settle people on the land, according to their ideas, though these, of course, may differ from the idea* of some of us. There is a Closer Settlehis ment Board, which, I think, has dona some good; but, if all I hear is correct, a great deal of money has been wasted in this direction.

Here is what the Administrator said in his report-The progress of land settlement has been disappointingly slow, as will be seen by the report of the Director of Lands. Yet on the whole I am not surprised. While the southern continue an active policy of land settlement in districts already partlv settled, the Territory will not offer any real inducement for the small farmer with reasonable capital not put a to transfer his home from the south. And as, apparently, there is still much available land in Australia, where the climate and life generally offer more attractions than in the north, this is not altogether to be regretted. What the Administrator says is quite true. While there is land available, and labour to be obtained in the more temperate portions of Australia, it is only a few adventurers-and I use the word in its best sense-wh o will go to the Territory. Territory, Even those who are taken there for Government works almost invariably return south after a very short time; and this, periiaps, is not surprising when we remember that the conditions are so different from what they are elsewhere. What the honourable member for Barrier says is quite correct. While there are great advantages to he obtained in the southern region, we shall not get men, especially married men, to take their families into such an isolated place, where so many hardships and dangers bave to be faced. One strong feature was drawn attention to by the Leader of the Opposit i o n ; and it is one that this House and the Minister will have to consider. instance, on page 9 of the Administrator's report we readRecently the Chief Surveyor has handed me reports from three of his surveyors, who assert a deficiency in their men's work of 60 per cent, during the summer months. This means that a man is only doing 40 per cent, of the work that is done in the States. There is another statement of great"" interest in the report, that which deals with a subject that has been so often discussed in this House, namely, day labour versus contract labour. Honourable members opposite have declared, over and over again, that the Government are getting a very much better return under day labour than under contract; but on page 76 of the report we are told by the Superintendent of Public WorksDuring the last year, both systems, viz., day labour and contract, have been tried by this Department in carrying out work, and from the figures submitted herewith there oan be but one opinion which of the two systems is the better.. In my two preceding annual reports I have touched upon this question, and I should be wanting in my duty if 1 did not again call Your Excellency's attention - to the great difference in the cost of similar works carried out by the two different systems.",27
230,Mr MATHEWS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"This is party politics, pure and simple! There is no great national policy about this!",28
231,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It is all very in terestingI give two instances :Two workers' cottages in Beetson-street erected By day labour eost £640 each. A cottage of similar design at Fanny Bay gaol, carried out by contract, was finished for £530. besides paying cartage on the longer distance. It will thus be seen that £110 was the difference paid in wages on this day-labour job as compared with an exactly similar one carried out by a contractor. The whole of the materials for both jobs was supplied from the Public Works store, in one instance to the Department, and in the other to the contractor, the price for materials in both cases being the same. Further, the Superintendent says The teacher's residence, Darwin, by contract cost £f,0S3. A similar house built on block 598 by d,ay labour cost £I,'330 8s. 7d. Certainly in this ease the whole of the foundationblocks had to be blasted out and the material carted about a mile further than was the casein the first Jiouse, but even, after allowing for this expenditure, £130, the eost of the house by day labour was £1,200, or £119 more than the contract house.",28

235,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I did not interject in that spirit at all. I mean he should have been sacked for not doing the work better.,28
236,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I know nothing about this officer. My only knowledge of him has been from reading his report; but I do say that when the bead of a Department makes a report through a Minister to this House it is the duty of the House to give it careful consideration. He goes on to sayI do not hear the contractors complain about losing money. In fact, the contractor they have on the Fanny Bay job offered tp take on as many cottages as 11 , e could get at the same figure. There are other quotations here to which I might refer. One, for instance, in which he states that, although the contractor is not working his men as easily as the men are worked by the Government, yet, owing to the curious irony of tli,e situation, these men are giving the contractor in finitely better services than ever they gave to the Government. In dealing with the difficulty of getting men, the Administrator reportsThe great trouble of farming in the NorthernTerritory is the dearth of capable farm bands. The ex-Minister of External Affairs pointed out that it was quite easy to get good labour.",28

The exoeriment in land tenures in the Federal Capital Territory is, I feel sure,' being followed with a great deal of attention by the thinking, economic world. When our own people are supplied with farms, when, instead of hundreds of applicants for one block of land, there are hundreds of blocks of land awaiting settlement, we should take charge of the current of emigration from the Old World, which, I feel sure, will set in as soon as this terrible war is over, and direct it to the Northern Territory.

But wben we have supplied the wants of our own people, I should like to see us extend our arms in wide welcome to the white races of the Old World, and employ them in filling up the empty north.

I am anxious that the agreement made with South - Australia shall be kept, and that, as promised, the railvvay shall run from north to south. I have never failed to express my appreciation of what South Australia did for the rest of the Commonwealth in holding the Northern Territory for it. She helu to the Northern Territory when it was a great burden for her to carry, and I must compliment the men of South who rose to the height, not of politicians, but of statesmen, in the work they did in this connection.

Another reason why I think We should deal with them as quickly as Australia, possible is that we ought to apply ourselves with the least possible delay to the great duty which the electors cast upon us at the last general election, and that is, the revision of the Tariff on a sound, continent scientific, protective basis. That, in my opinion, is a duty which the electors of Australia intrusted to us, and which they What expect us to carry out. It is also very necessary that, instead of wasting time on what is likely to prove, shall I say, a profitless discussion, we should proceed to set our house in order. When the war comes to an end, we shall have to deal with greatly changed conditions. willingly We shall have huge financial and industraining trial problems to solve, and the sooner we prepare for them the better for the people of Australia. My chief object in rising to-night is to take exception to the argument which has been repeated again and again during this discussion, that we are committed, under the agreement made with South Austrawhere lia, to build a railway north and south from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. The the agreement with South Australia proves conclusively that the framers contemplated the necessity Of the line making a detour fro'rii a north and south course. In that agreement South Australia Territory bound itself to authorize,. by legislation, the Commonwealth to do all that is necessary to enable the Commonwealth to make surveys, acquire the necessary land, and for a to construct a railway in South Australia proper from a point oil the Port Augusta railway to a"" point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper, to corinect with that part of the transcontinental railway to be built in the North- era Territory from Port Darwin southward's to the northern boundary of South Australia proper.

All the evidence we have shows that such a line would pass thrbugh the best country. If , on the other hand, the railway is built due north and south between Oodnadatta Pine Creek, it will traverse an immense mileage of. poor country, and even then will not develop the Northern Territory. We should still have to face the probon fanciful theories. lem of developing the land between Vicother toria River on the one side and the clay Downs on the other.

I will admit that the lack of facilities for transport is a serious and obstacle. That is all the more reason why we should proceed with the policy of building railways to develop the Territoiy. We have wasted enough money Queensland and - States were developed in the first Barplace as cattle and sheep country, and those lines We must proceed to develop the Northern Territory. The other of development will follow. The exsooner we cease spending money on these beautiful theoretical propositions that sound so well, the better it will be for from the public Treasury. Mr JOHN' THOMSON - Would you the appointment of an Advisory Committee of tins House?",33
290,Mr STUMM,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Not a Committee of this House, but I believe there would be a great advantage in having an advisory committee. We must admit that the remoteness of the Territory and its nonrepresentation in this Parliament give agreeus less knowledge and less control sugover it than we have over other memportions of the Commonwealth, and there is no doubt that the burden of the is considerably increased in consequence. The thought occurred to me, The when this matter was being discussed a few weeks ago, that it was not fair to ask the Minister to immediately propound a policy for the development of the Terricantory. It will take time and patience to reproduce a sound policy of that kind, but surely during the forty or fifty years that has the Territory has been partially settled we have gained enough experience to put us on the right track. A few nights ago no the honourable member for Oxley expressed the hope that the freezing works Northwhich Vestey Brothers are erecting in the Territory will be resumed in the near by the Government, if they have the power to do so. I hope the Government will do nothing of the sort, but will would give Vestey Brothers a fair deal in the turn, arrangement which has been made with them. I cannot conceive of anything more mischievous and more likely to deter men with capital from coming to Australia, or those in Australia from investing their money, thau indulgence in such wild and irresponsible talk. I have no brief for Vestey Brothers, but I understand they are a British firm, and are investing British capital, and if the works are a success, as I have no doubt they, will be if Vestey Brothers are left alone, that success will represent a long step in the direction of solving the problem of the Territory. Therefore, I say again, let us, for goodness' sake, be done with theoretical propositions, and, guided by the experience of the past, develop the Territory along the same lines as those on which other portions of the Commonwealth have been so successfully settled and developed.",33
291,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Adelaide) [6.14] - The honourable member for Lilley has pleaded with Parliament to adopt a practical method of settling the Territory, and to be done with theoretical ideas. Apparently the practical method of the honourable member is to adopt the suggestion of the right honourable member for Swan, that a railway should be taken into the Northern Territory by a side window. The strategic railway mooted by the Government at the present time is practically based on evidence given before the Commission that investigated the Northern Territory railways and ports. Mr . J. Harper, Assistant Commissioner for Railways in New South Wales, proposed a scheme somewhat similar to that suggested by the honourable member for Swan. He was asked (Q. 620-21), "" A r e you aware that the contract with South Australia absolutely binds the Commonwealth"" to construct the direct line from north to south ?"" He replied, "" We are looking at it from a railway point of view only."" Mr Combes asked him, "" Would the system you suggest be used for trucking starving stock in times of drought?"" He replied, ""Undoubtedly."" My own opinion is that starving stock would not be carried on th_at roundabout route. Then he was asked, "" In suggesting these eastern connexions, you are not looking at the development of the Territory as the prime reason for building railways?"" and his answer was a direct "" No . "" There we have direct evidence that this suggested railway, which is to go to Broken Hill through Temora,through the far west of New South 1 Wales, and on to the Territory, is not. meant to develop the Territory at all.",34
292,Mr STUMM,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I was speaking of the Camooweal line.,34
293,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It is practically the same line. Even if it were not, its result would be the same, because it would not develop the Territory. When I said that the possibilities of the Territory are immeasurable-a phrase whichwas referred to satirically by the honourable member for Lilley-I was not expressing my own opinion, because I have not seen the Territory; but I was expressing the opinion of those who are qualified to speak, and who do know the truth of what they say. If honourable memberswill read the evidence taken before the Royal Commission, they will make their voices heard, so that in the next Esti-. mates provision will be made for the actual development of the Northern Territory, instead of for merely playing with it. Other witnesses before the Commission testified that the only way in which to develop the Territory was to build me north-south railway. We find that the first route suggested by the Commission is "" A, South-east-Camooweal."" Seven witnesses subscribed to that line, and amongst them were two Railway Commissioners^-one, Mr Harper; and the other,  Railways in Queensland. The seconc! recommendation was "" B, North-south Central."" Thirty witnesses advocated this route, and twenty also favoured a branch to Camooweal-not to Newcastle Waters and thence to the Territory, allowing time itself to bridge the interval. The Commonwealth spent a large amount of money in endeavouring to ascertain from experts what was the best thing to do, and yet today we are still discussing what should be done. Last year the Northern Territory cost the Commonwealth about £470,000, of which between £80,000 and £90,000 represented the loss on the Oodnadatta line. Therefore, it is about time that steps were taken to make effective use of that portion of the Territory's railway system. It is an established fact that once the belt of country between Oodnadatta and Charlotte Waters is crossed, what is said to be splendid country in regard to both climate and productivity is entered. Some honourable members have cast a doubt on the wheat-growing capability of the Territory. Were they persons who had lived in the Territory for any length of time, I should be prepared to accept their opinion on the subject, but they are persons who have not visited the Territory, or know scarcely anything of it . It is to be remembered, too, that thousands of acres in the southern parts of Australia, which it was once thought were useless for wheat-growing, are now wheat fields. Probably South Australia grows more wheat on country that at one time was held to be useless for wheat-growing than she grows on the land that was regarded from the first as good wheat country. Victoria, again, is growing wheat on mallee country which was long thought to be useless. As to the capability of ths Northern Territory for the growing of wheat, let me quote the opinion of Mr . Giles, the explorer, as stated in a letter written to Mr J . G. Knight, C.E., Chief Warden of Gold Fields in the Northern Territory, and published in the Northern Territory Times. The letter is dated l l t h May, 1880, and Mr Giles saysFrom the northern base of the Macdonnell Range to the west range (Hann), is a distance of 70 miles, the whole of which is magnificently grassed, although timbered thickly in places by mulga (acacia). At 25 miles from the Macdonnell Range are rolling downs, thickly grassed, and equal in richness of soil to any in South Australia, being inundated plains of rich black and red soils, fit for the .growth of wheat. The climatic advantages of this country are beyond dispute.  does not refer to the country round about Darwin.",34
294,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"We who urge the extension of the railway from the south do not say that the Darwin country will do all that has been claimed for it , but it is to be expected that as settlement follows a line eroing northwards, stock and human beings will gradually become acclimatized, and when Darwin is reached, will be able to successfully contend with any disadvantage that may exist there. While the representatives of South Australia demand that the right thing shall be done so far as their State is concerned, they bave none the less the interests of the Commonwealth at heart. But the proposal of the right honourable member for Swan was to give to Queensland benefits which should go to South Australia. That is evident from the terms of his letter, which I shall read. The right honourable gentleman saidThe Commonwealth would undertake to construct a railway from Camooweal through the Barclay Tableland, and thence up the Katherine River, which will, by that time be connected with Port Darwin. There is there no hint of the continuation of the line southwardsIn the construction of this work all the traffic of rails, machinery, and sleepers would be carried pver the Queensland lines; and I am informed wooden sleepers can be obtained in Queensland. That in itself during the time of construction would mean an immense advantage to Queensland. Then it would necessarily have the trade of the Northern Territory from Newcastle Waters and the Barclay Tableland, which would all gravitate into Queensland.",35
295,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It would never, under any circumstances, go to Adelaide.",35
296,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not anticipate that the production of the Barclay Tableland would go to South Australia, but the extension of the line northwards from Oodnadatta would give us the trade with the Macdonnell Range country. The right honourable member for Swan said further, regarding his proposalI t would be an outlet for the enterprising people of Queensland, and would encourage them to occupy and utilize the lands in the Northern Territory. Why should not the enterprising people of South Australia be encouraged by the extension of the line from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges? Have we not a special claim to that advantage? All the evidence of those who know the Northern Territory best points to the conclusion that it should be connected with the rest of Australia by a line going north from the existing line in South Australia. The proposal of the right honourable member for Swan would serve only part of the Territory. The honourable member for Lilley has argued that the right honourable member had in view an extension southwards from Newcastle Waters to Oodnadatta; but the concluding paragraph of the letter is against his contentionThe western portion, however, is impossible, unless we have communication with Queensland, and, if that is denied to us, we must turn our attention to connecting the Northern Territory from Oodnadatta, a policy to which we are already pledged. What the right honourable member says there is that if the construction of a line from Camooweal to Newcastle Waters were opposed, the Cook Government would be forced to carry out the compact with South Australia hy continuing the line northwards from Oodnadatta. honourable member said, further, that the agreement between South Australia and the Commonwealth does not stipulate the building of the railway from to Pine Creek. I believe that at the present time a survey is being made from Kingbouya to Oodnadatta. To that I do not object, nor should I object to any deviation from a direct route which would have the effect of serving better country than that on the direct route, so long as the line was extended northwards from Oodnadatta.",35
297,Unknown,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Sitting suspended from G.SO to 7.^6 p.m.,36
298,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"To continue my quotation from Mr Giles' letterNorth of Hann Range the country continues good and splendidly grassed, but badly watered. Brackish water has been obtained at 80 feet in abundance. The country offers every facility for dam sinking. At 20 miles north of Hann Range the road touches the Wood Creek, and follows it a distance of 40 miles, the whole of its course heing through richly-grassed plains, with occasional patches of mulga timber, up to the base of Central Mount Stuart, under the foot of which runs the Hanson Creek, where permanent water exists a few inches under the sand, and by using a plough and scoop in the bed of the creek large reservoirs can be scooped out, yielding unlimited supplies of water. land along the course of the creek maintains its rich character for grass and herbage, improving as it approaches the Stirling Creek, and rendering it exceptional for agricultural or pastoral purposes. Water may be got at an exceedingly shallow depth. - We thus know beyond doubt what the country is like in the Macdonnell Eanges. However, I desire to deal with that phase with which we are more immediately concerned. A Commission of our own creation, which reported last year, gives ample evidence of what the Northern Territory really is, and affords sufficient information on which the Department of External Affairs could do more than simply try to conduct the affairs of this immense area by sending an Administrator on long and circuitous journeys, and, from time to time, receiving reports from him, only to learn from all sorts of sources that there is turmoil and domestic unrest in that quarter. I maintain, and it is the opinion of most people, that, if we could get into the Territory with more ease and expedition, things would begin to right themselves more quickly from an administrative point of view; and I feel positive that the desired end could be best attained by The,, carrying the proposed railway from north to south. The leases in the Territory expire in 1944, but about one-half of them expire much earlier, and this gives us Oodnadatta ample opportunity to review our policyOne settler, in reply to a question put by the Commission in regard to railways,, saidIn the event of a railway passing through the northwards country, I think that every pastoralist would be quite prepared to surrender portion of his land. The leases are of such magnitude, simply because of the lack of moans of communication. The report of the Commission says The Northern Territory Land Act should be so framed as to allow for that. Wo can do nearly as much on 3,000 miles of country with a railway as on (i.OOp miles without a railway With compensation for improvements we would be quite prepared to surrender portion of our lease. Occupiers are forced to hold double the quantity of land under present conditions, but, with proper railway facilities, there would be two settlers where now there is one. Dealing with the matter as affecting the Barclay Tablelands, the report of the Commission says The Evidence goes to show that under more favourable conditions the stock-carrying capacity would be largely increased. One witness stated that on 0,000 square miles his firm at the present time carried 35,000 head, but that lie hoped to see the day when the run, with improvements, would carry 100,000 head. But there cannot be improvements u n t i l proper facilities are afforded, and those facilities, according to the evidence, must take the form of railway communicationIn other words, the carrying capacity is capable of bein<; almost trebjed. If that be so, it is evident that there is something in the country which ought to spur us on to attract population. Another witness, speaking of the Barclay Tablelands, saysOn one station on the Barclay Tablelands sheep have been raised for many years, the present number being 58,000. The industry is under great disabilities owing to insufficiency of water, cost of fencing material, high rate of freight, distance from markets, and scarcity of labour. These difficulties would be obviated by the provision of a railway; in fact, the witness saysThose disabilities would be certainly minimixed with railway communication.",36
299,Mr SPENCE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What about the Cloncurry railway?,37
300,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No doubt the Cloncurry railway would assist the Barclay Tablelands more than would the straight-cut railway; but it does not follow that, because the railway is taken from north to south, branches cannot be made, as recommended in the report. There is good country on the west side of the Territory-in the Victoria Eiver and Ord River districts-whic h is highly spoken of by Mr L. A. Wells, of the South Australian Lands Department. Wells has explored that part of the country, and his brother lost his life in similar work; and he tells us that the country west of the telegraph line is some of the most wonderful he has seen. He admits that there are belts of desert, so to speak; but with a railway from the main track into the Victoria River district, there are immense possibilities of development. In conversation with myself he said that he never saw bigger-framed flocks, and never tasted better mutton in his life than he did there; and he is certainly a man who knows what he is talking about. Although the line mentioned by the Postmaster-General might be the better one for the Barclay Tablelands, some of the richest country, from a metal-bearing point of view, is to be found in the centre of Australia; and this country, along with the pastoral country, would be best assisted and developed by means of a railway. Speaking of the Victoria River district, one witness before the Commission saidOn an area of about 11,000 square miles (7,040,000 acres) his company was carrying 107,000 bead of cattle and 900 head of horses. Ho believed that by providing water it would safely carry 30,000 head more. To provide water we must provide facilities for conveying the necessary machinery and labour, and there is no doubt that in this way the stocking capacity of the country could be nearly doubled - Another witness, an owner and manager, saidHe held 1,50.0 miles of country, carrying 5,000 head of cattle and 700 horses. In the event of a railway he would be willing, under certain conditions, to surrender part of his country. The block he would surrender would carry 10,000 head of cattle, and not be overstocked. This the settlers are prepared to do as soon as the Commonwealth is prepared to settle the country, instead of waiting for the Administrator to do it. Another paragraph in the report of the Commission isOne station owner and manager expressed the opinion that the whole of the Victoria River country, from the Kith parallel south, was, generally speaking, good sheep country. He estimated that with railway facilities that country would carry from 20,000,000 to30,000,000 sheep easily, and a great number of big stock as well. Then Mr Richard Murray, of the DeMr partment of Forestry, South Australia, told the CommissionTliere is country to the north of the Macdonnell Ranges wliere I have seen grass you could mow, and that country is unoccupied. Tliere is some fair country also in the vicinity of the Truer Ranges which is untouched at the present time. Another piece of evidence isAt the present time the two holdings carried about 10,500 head of cattle and 1,800 horses. On an average they sunt away about 1,500 head of fats per year; but in bad seasons they were obliged to hold them over, or sell as stores. Wit h a railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges this country would carry more stock, because necessary improvements in providing water would be possible. According to people who know, the development of the Territory depends on railway communication; and this is what ought to first occupy the attention of the Government. My object in speaking is, if possible, to obtain a promise more definite than that given last week by the Prime Minister in Adelaide, namely, "" Leave it with us, and we will see it is done."" I wish for some definite, specific promise, for which the report of the Commission affords ample justification. It is not only South Australia that asks for this railway. The motion on which the Prime Minister gave the assurance that I have just mentioned was submitted by delegates from Tasmania, who regarded it as imperative that the Territory be developed by carrying the railway from Oodnadatta north; and certainly Tasmanians cannot be charged with taking a local or prejudiced view of the situation. The Registrar of Mines, South Australia, in his evidence before the Commission, saidThe country round Hergott did not look well; but from about the Coward northward, right to Arltunga, feed is luxuriant, and water abundant-that was when I was up in March. According to that gentleman, had the railway been in existence during the recent drought, it would have been possible to send stock to Charlotte Springs, where feed was very abundant. The same witness further saidWhen 1 came down in December of the same year, the country was dry in parts, and had I - written my description then I might not have been so enthusiastic. It will be seen that this witness is unquestionably expressing his genuine opinion, for he does not depend on what he saw in March. He said furtherThe Macdonnell Ranges struck me as being a most wonderful place for horse breeding. It is to bridge that strip of what is called desert country that we ask for railway extension. Of course there is an extension from Pine Creek to Katherine River, but I doubt whether that railway will afford such facilities for the development of the Territory as would an extension from Oodnadatta.  covered ?",37
301,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I think between 300 and 400 miles. Mr Henry Lewis, pastoralist, of Adelaide, said to the CommissionI have travelled across (north and south) six times, and I consider that every mile of country between Oodnadatta and the Katherine is good country for cattle and hordes. Anywhere north of Newcastle Waters would be too wet for sheep, but there is room for plenty south of that.",38
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,How much stock is there between Oodnadatta and the Macdonnell Ranges now?,38
303,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not hold myself up as a compendium of statistics. I am quoting the evidence of others, who know the country well. The right honourable member admitted, after an interjection from the honourable member for Grey, that he did not go into the Northern Territory, but came in by the Alberga River from the north-west coast of Australia.",38
304,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It is 300 from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs.,38
305,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Exactly so.,38
306,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Tell us how much stock there is.,38
307,The CHAIRMAN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Order! The honourable gentleman has reached the time limit .,38
308,Mr GREGOR Y,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Dampier) [ 8 . 1 ] - I confess a feeling of some surprise that the South Australian Government ever allowed this wonderful Territory to be taken over by the Commonwealth. I have been listening here night after night to speeches describing what a wonderful land it is,38
309,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"They had confidence in the Commonwealth, but it has been misplaced.",38
310,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It must have been. The South Australian Government must have been giving away something very great, according to the wonderful resources that have been described to us. Yet, after the lapse of all this time, and after the expenditure of so much money, we only see barren results.",38
311,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,How has the money been spent? Not in the way this Commission recommends.,38
312,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I hope there will be some change in the expenditure of money on the Northern Territory. I was one of those who, a few years ago, severely denounced the expenditure that was then taking place, and I hope we shall not have any repetition of that sort of thing. What I want to point out is that the arguments we have heard apply, not only to the Northern Territory, but to the whole of northern Australia. We have to realise that that area must be populated. The honourable member for Franklin pointed out to-night that if we wished to retain our hold on northern Australia we should have to populate it , and in order to do this the Administration should be sympathetic, and should show, not only a keen desire to induce people to go there, but a desire to treat them fair l y when they are there. It is absurd for us to bring forward a scheme of closer settlement at present. If we realise the history of Victoria, of New South Wales, and of other portions of the continent, we see that the pastoralist came first, and opened up the country. He was followed by the farmer, and after that people began to talk about miles closer settlement. It must be the same in the Northern Territory. We must build up its pastoral and mineral resources first. Wben we get people going there like the Vestey Brothers, who will put forward capital for the purpose of developing the country, I hope the present Administration will do all they can to encourage such people, and not put obstacles in their way, as it has been suggested by some honourable members they should. Although the pastoral industry should be developed, one cannot help realizing that the mining industry, if encouraged, is the industry that is most likely to attract population. The history of Victoria shows the wonderful growth of population, ancl the great development that took place after the discovery of gold. My own experience in connection with ""Western Australia showed that the same thing happened there. ""We had an enormous area, with great resources, and yet, until gold was discovered, there was very little development. After gold was found a large population came to Western Australia. There was an immense settlement, ancl at the present time we bave a very large agricultural industry in the State. I hope the Minister will do all he can to encourage mining in the Northern Territory, by seeing that the raining laws are sufficiently sympathetic to encourage capital. It is all very well for us to try to assist small holders, and endeavour to induce people to start mining, but-the only way in which mining can be built up successfully in that particular country is by having the mining laws so drawn up that the people who invest their money can secure a good title, and be assured that they w i ll get from the Government a fair deal and every protection. I am not advocating anything in the nature of a fee-simple so far as mining propositions are concerned. That, in my opinion, would be a very great mistake, but those who are prepared to spend money should be told by the mining Ordinances that they will be fair l y dealt with, ""whatever the results of their enterprise. It is only by the establishment of large companies that we can hope for anything in the nature of a big mineral production in the Northern Territory. In this respect the history of Western Australia should be a guide to the Minister. He has had a big knowledge of Western Australian fields and conditions, and should be able to frame mining Ordinances that will induce capital to come forward and help in the work of development. He has framed certain Ordinances in connection with exclusive prospecting licences. There is danger if the Minister allows any person who has obtained a licence to have the exclusive right of mining over an area of 5 square miles. This might be all right if it applied only to something in the nature of a rare metal the existence of which was problematical. I had an experience of this sort myself once, and the Minister will recognise the difficulty that would arise if any one person with an exclusive liceucs to prospect for gold were to discover an alluvial lead in his holding; or lie will , without doubt, imagine the trouble that would follow the discovery of alluvial t in . I would, therefore, strongly urge the Minister to exclude any of the royal metals from these mining Ordinances, or anything in the nature of alluvial t in .",38
313,Mr SINCLAIR,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Will the licence entitle the holder to all minerals ?,39
314,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It will only give him the right to the mineral named upon the permit obtained from the Department, but I am sure gi'ave trouble would arise in the event of alluvial discoveries. I am quite in accord with a number of members in regard to railways. To develop the country railways must be built. A f t e r my experience in Western Australia, I do not think the railways should be built necessarily as the engineers desire, or be so heavily ballasted that trains can travel 30 or 40 miles an hour. Prospecting railways are required to carry goods, and admitting of travel at the rate of 14 or 15 miles an hour. If railways are to be built through Queensland, or from the south, they should be as light as possible, and constructed so that they can be made sufficiently strong to meet subsequent requirements. Water supply is also a subject of tremendous importance to that Territory, and, in my view, a large number of boring parties should be sent out with the object of locating subterranean water. In fact, I would advise the M i nister to get the map prepared by the Western Australian Government to see what was done in the back country there with the object of providing water for prospectors. I am quite satisfied that if the Minister spent £100,000 in the course of the next two or three years on a definite policy in this respect, even if it did not prove to be of material assistance in the discovery of minerals as well, the expenditure would be more than justified from the pastoralists' stand-point alone.",39
315,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Would you permit the use of the divining rod ?,40
316,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No . Men of experience are required. Send them out in three or four different directions to locate where water supplies may be found. I found one very good way was by putting down a 6-inch bore and a pipe with grating attachment at the bottom. In many instances we had nothing else, and .that means was always sufficient to provide water for a prospecting party. If , afterwards, settlement took place, we could make a more permanent supply. Another matter upon which I would like to touch has reference to the establishment of treatment plants, and I want to say openly that no blame attaches to the present Minister for the large expenditure recently incurred under this head. He is merely following the late Administration. Treatment plants are established for the purpose of enabling a prospector to realise to some extent the value of the ore that he may produce. It had been decided to erect a plant for the treatment of t in at Maranboy, but I was rather astonished to discover that it was intended to erect a ten-head mill. I saw the Minister, and pointed out to him that we bad done the same class of work at Greenbushes, in Western Australia, and suggested to him that a five-head mill would be more than ample for the requirements of the district. I also pointed out to him that, in a district such as that the great cost to the prospector was that of getting his ore to the m ill, and that it would be far better to have two small plants in different spots than one large central m ill .",40
317,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"If you had only mine, what would be the use of two plants ?",40
318,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"This is not the case of one mine; but here you have a tenhead plant involving an expenditure of something like £20,000. If other districts are discovered, how many plants of this sort is it proposed to erect? I am satisfied that the House would object to the heavy expenditure the frequent erection of large plants like this would involve, particularly as a much less expensive plant costing £9,000 or £10,000 would have done all that was necessary. I think there is only 1,600 tons of ore available now, and with that large plant it would be possible to crush the district out within a couple of months. Such a large mill is not necessary, and I hope that future action by the Minister in this respect will be more in the direction of erecting small treatment plants, which will be ample for all requirements. We have done a great deal of this kind of work in Western Australia. I advocated the erection of these plants as strongly as did any member of the State Parliament, and yet, when I left office, I had serious misgivings as to the value of the work we had done. We had produced something over £4,000,000 worth of gold, the wholo of which went, not into big outside companies, but into the pockets of our own people. There was, nevertheless, a doubt as to whether the working of these plants was beneficial to the mining industry. In many districts where we had small parties working, all the rich ore was crushed by men who, having done this, neglected their holdings, - with the result that a very great number of them are now deserted. On the other hand, if small plants had been taken there to assist prospectors in ascertaining the value of their propositions, and in inducing others to come in with ample capital for the development of their properties, I feel sure that, instead of so many of these holdings being abandoned and the districts deserted, as they are today, we should have had big mines in full operation. If the Minister will give in vestors an assurance of generous mining laws; if he will give them an assurance that if they put money into a mining proposition they will be full y protected under the mining Ordinances; if he will see that a large sum is expended on water supone plies, and also enter upon a good system of light railway construction, he will do much to induce settlement and development in the Territory. The matter of the development of the north does not apply only to the Northern Territory. We have an immense coast-line, stretching from Western Australia round to Queensland, and every effort should be made by the Government of the day, not only to promote settlement, but to develop the industries we already have there. I wish to refer more particularly to the pearling industry. At present, owing to the war, it is moribund; but I know that many honourable members of the Labour party would sooner see that industry closed down than allow it to be carried on with alien coloured labour. The pearling industry, however, has done much to develop north-western Australia, and to open up the resources of Western Australia itself. I do not wish to discuss the merits or demerits of coloured labour in connection with the industry. A Royal Commission, of which I am a member, has been appointed to inquire into the matter, and I should not care tc make any statement regarding a subject which, so far as I am concerned, at least, should be treated at the present time as sub judice. The Commission does not intend to hold any meeting until the war is over, and the industry is once more being actively carried on.",40
319,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Has not the sacrifice of human life been terrible in the pearling industry?,41
320,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"If that is so, surely we are not going to ask that our own people shall be employed in such an industry.",41
321,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I , for one, am not.",41
322,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The latest available statistics regarding the pearling industry are in respect of the year 1912. They show that in that year, in Western Australia alone, we had 401 pearling boats, of the value of £186,000, and that during the year they raised shell to the value of £421,000, in addition to pearls of the value of £100,000. These boats employ a large number of white people, as well as a large amount of alien coloured labour. I wish to point out, however, what the pearling industry did for the development of Western Australia. In the old days, before the pastoral industry of the State had been developed, many entered upon the pearling industry, made money out of it, and then opened up the pastoral industry in the north of Western Australia. A number of these, in turn, having made a good deal of money, settled in Perth, invested in several industries there, and invested largely in land in the agricultural areas adjacent to the capital. They were very largely responsible for a good deal of the development of Western Australia. The pearling industry is a big one. Broome, until the outbreak of the war, had a larger white population than any other town in the north-west of Western Australia, and we desire to do all that we can to retain population there. Life in the north-west is no mere frolic.",41
323,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What is the population of Broome?,41
324,Mr GEEGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Prio r to the war the white population was about 1,100, but I am afraid that it has dwindled away to something like 500. I am not asking that the Minister shall alter at present any of the existing regulations relating to the industry; but the honourable gentleman has recently given permits to a Targe firm, enabling it to employ some forty or fifty boats in the trade. I believe that at present twenty-five permits have been granted.",41
325,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"That is, surely, to the benefit of Broome.",41
326,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I am not questioning that; but my keen desire is that no monopoly shall be created in connection with the pearling industry. If wo are to have such an industry, I desire that the boats employed in it shall be owned by individuals, and not by companies. I should like to see the industry controlled by people owning at the outside not more than seven or eight boats each, so that we may secure the largest white population possible in the north, and in order that the profits of the industry shall be distributed over as large a section of the community as possible.",41
327,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It is, in the abstract, a good idea, but the honourable member knows very well that the industry can be most profitably worked by a company that has a schooner to follow its fleet of boats.",41
328,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Quite so. But the Minister should remember that the industry was never more profitable or better regulated than during the two or three years immediately preceding the outbreak of war.,41
329,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,That was because of the high price of shell.,41
330,Mr GREGORY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"On account of the arrangements that had been made, they were getting about £220 per ton for their also shell. The industry was then very prosperous; a, remarkably large number of pearlers owned only one boat, each, and quite a number owned only two or three each. I am sure that the Minister, like all of us, desires that if we have such an industry it shall employ as many white people as possible, so that we may not only maintain but increase the white population of the north. The Minister has satisfied me very well regarding his actions at the present time, but I hope future policy will be such as will enable the industry to be carried on by as many white persons as possible, and that he will distribute licences over the greatest ber of white people that can be secured for the industry. As to the Northern Territory itself, one cannot but feel doubtful of the result of our experiment. The Minister himself, when speaking to this question a few days ago, said that bad not yet been able to develop such a policy as he could lay before the House and say he was determined to carry I can understand that, having regard the varying views of honourable members, it is exceedingly difficult to thing in the nature of a common agreement. To my mind, the best policy that could be adopted would be to appoint three Commissioners tocontrol the Territory. The Minister should endeavour - secure for this purpose three sound, solid business men who have had experience the pastoral industry, who know what is to go out back, and to brave and fight I - all the difficulties incidental to the velopment of such a country. I have hope that we shall be able to push fordoubtedly ward closer settlement in the Northern 'Territory at the present time. We must first of all develop other resources. must induce people to develop the pasup toral industry, and encourage the mining depth. industry, by good, sound administration. The present Administrator may be a. very mines there. - clever man, but I would strongly advise the Minister to secure the services of three practical business men, who would produce much gold. be able to suggest to him what is best for the development of the Territory. If that were done, we would get far greater value for the expenditure of our public money in the Northern Territory than tion we are securing at the present time.",41
331,Sir JOHN PORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Swan) [8.27] It cannot be said that there is any of interest on the part of honourable bers in the question of the development of the Northern Territory. The attention given to this question no doubt is due to the small progress that has been made in developing the Territory since it was taken over by the Commonwealth, and the enormous expenditure that is being incurred in respect of the payment of interest on the public debt and i carrying on the administration. I do not propose at this stage to criticise either the Minister or the Government regardment, ing what has been done, because I full y his realise that there has not been very much time within which to carry out any great work, and that the war, which, unfortunately, is raging at the present time, has numengrossed our attention, and led us to hold over what we might otherwise have done in respect of this important matter. The difficulties associated with the Territory are that the climate is tropical, and that its products are such as are suphe plied by the cheap coloured labour of other countries. It is not likely that, except for home consumption, the tropical out. products of the Northern Territory, to grown by white labour, could compete with those of countries where cheap secure anycoloured labour is used.",42

336,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,They are on the way to do so.,42
337,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I repeat that I have great hopes of the mineral producof the Northern Territory, and ' I believe that if we expended a considerable sum in making a complete geological survey of it we should lack do well. We cannot do better than memlet daylight into the Territory, so to speak, by the construction of railways, so that people who are enterprising and desire to settle there, or embark their capital there, may have an opportunity of inspecting it . W it h that object in view, the late Government, of which I was a member, made the construction of n railways in the Territory the primary part of their policy. A statement, representing the views of the Liberal Governlaid on the table of the House on 12th August, 1913, contained these very definite wordsParliament would be asked to provide funds for trial surveys with the object of connecting by railway Port Darwin with Port Augusta, viti Macdonnell Ranges and with the eastern railway systemThat is, the railway systems in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australiavia CamoowealHonorable members will see that the Liberal Government made it part of their policy to connect the railway from Pine Creek southwards to Oodnadatta, vid the Macdonnell Ranges, with Camooweal, on the western boundary of Queensland. That statement continuedwhich will open up the country for agricultural and pastoral settlement. Without these main lines of transit it will be impossible to complete our defences or to adequately develop the resources of the Northern Territory. That was the policy of the late Government, and had we remained in ofiice we fully intended to carry it out. It has been said by honourable members representing South Australia, and I think it is understood by a good many people outside, that there is in existence an undertaking by the Commonwealth to build a railway to connect Port Darwin with South Australia vid the Macdonnell Ranges and Oodnadatta-the line which the late Government proposed to buildbut I submit that no undertaking of that kind was given by this Parliament or by anybody until the late Government placed that proposal in their platform. I will read the agreement into which the Commonwealth entered with South Australia when it took over the Northern Territory, and honourable members will be able to judge for themselves as to whether the Commonwealth had undertaken to' do that which the late Government proposed to do. The Commonwealth, by its agreement with South Australia, undertookto construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of .South Australia proper, which railway, with the railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect therewith, is hereinafter referred to ns the transcontinental railway. Alsoto construct, or cause to be constructed, as part of the transcontinental railway, a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper. I know that at the time those words were used the Government were not sufficientlyinformed on the subject to know exactly the route the railway would follow from Port Darwin to join the railway from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta, and therefore that language was employed; but the Commonwealth was bound to build a railway to cross the northern boundary of South Australia somewhere. I only mention this fact to show that those who argue that the Commonwealth is committed to the construction of a railway direct southward along the telegraph line from Port Darwin, vid Alice Springs and the Macdonnell Ranges, to Oodnadatta have no foundation in this agreement for the statements they make. The only foundation they can claim is that the late Government, of which I was a member, did mention, as part of their policy, the construction of a line to connect Port Darwin, vid the Macdonnell Ranges, with Oodnadatta. That is the only pledge that has been given-at any rate, in such definite words,-by any one. Reference was made in the House a few nights ago, and by the honourable member for Grey in the South Australian press, to a letter written by the then Prime M in ister, at my suggestion, to the Premier of Queensland, in which it was advocated that a railway should be built by the Queensland Government to Camooweal from Cloncurry, a distance of about 150 miles, on condition that the Commonwealth carried its line on westward through the Barclay Tablelands to Newcastle Waters and thence northerly u n t i l it joined the railway coming south from Pine Creek and the Katherine River.",42
338,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"You did not propose that the Commonwealth should build from Camooweal, which is in Queensland, to the border?",43
339,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No . Our idea was to carry our line to the Queensland border somewhere near Camooweal, which is very close to the border. When I made that suggestion I had in mind the Government programme, wherein we had undertaken to build a railway to join Port Darwin to Port Augusta vid the Macdonnell Ranges.  tunately expressed in your letter.",43
340,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable member is like the Mussulman of Fez or Delhi, who in his daily prayers turns l r * face towards the temple of Mecca, for his eyes are always fixed on the city of Adelaide.  the western railway always.",43
341,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I confess that I set before myself the construction of that great national work, and I glory in the fact that my efforts were successful. I may explain that after we hail pledged ourselves to build this railway, the question of route between the Katherine River and Oodnadatta, vid the Macdonnell Ranges, had to be considered. I had not sufficient personal knowledge to justify me in expressing an opinion, but 1 was guided by the opinion of Dr Gilruth, who had travelled over the country between Newcastle Waters and Alice Springs, and described it as being very poor. He did not advise that the railway should go in that direction, but thought that a detour should be made through the Barclay Tablelands, which is excellent country, to a place called Anthony's Lagoon; thence to Alroy Station; and thence southward for 339 miles to Alice Springs. The distance from Newcastle Waters to Alice Springs vid the telegraph line, is 470 miles, and a detour as proposed by Dr Gilruth would increase the distance by about 100 miles. . One great advantage in that route which appealed to me was that it Would pass through good country all the way from Newcastle Waters to Anthony's Lagoon and Alroy Station, a distance of 238 miles, and Alroy Station is only 150 miles from Camooweal, on the ""Queensland border. that means we should have had a common line from Port Darwin for a distance of 688 miles to Alroy Station. point the two lines would diverge; one would go west of south to Alice Springs, a distance of 339 miles; and from Alice Springs through the Macdonnell Ranges to Oodnadatta, a distance of 297 miles; the other would go eastward to Camooweal, near the Queensland border, a distance of 150 miles. That seemed to nie to be an excellent idea.",44
342,Mr ARCHIBALD,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It would have been on a narrow-gauge railway.,44
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"That does not make any difference to my argument; the distance is the same, whether the gauge be narrow or wide. The only difficulty if the railway was constructed on the 4-ft. 8 i - in. gauge would be the change of gauge at the Queensland border. In constructing the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, the sleepers could be made long enough to allow of the widening of the gauge, and then the gauge would be the same from Port Darwin to Port Augusta, and from Port Darwin through Queensland to Wallangarra, where the New South Wales gauge of 4 f t . 8J in . would be reached.  vide for starting construction from Oodnadatta ?",44
344,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"We had not reached the constructing stage. The bargain had been made, and it had to be kept. This is no small matter. The present war had not broken out at the time my letter was written, but the Government of which I was a member had the smallest of majorities, and many large obligations, and money was not too plentiful. To make a railwav from theKatherine to Oodnadatta, connecting with the Queensland border and the anchorage at the Pellew Islands, would probably cost £7,000,000, and would occupy several years, the distance being about 1,009 miles.",44
345,Mr ARCHIBALD,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It should not take longer than the construction of the eastwest railway.,44
346,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I hope that it will not take so long. But in the latter case you are going to a settled country, in which there is a considerable population, an immense trade, while in the By former youmust develop the country through which it passes in order to create traffic. At that Mr SHARPE - Will any of the traffic from the Northern Territory go across the east-west railway?",44
347,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I do not think so.,44
348,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The right lionorable member said last week that he had no axe to grind.,44
349,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,And I am not aware that I have any.,44
350,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The right honourable member's axe is already ground.,44
351,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I am not always thinking of myself. The railway to Oodnadatta stops within 300 miles of the Macdonnell Ranges, and, although it has been constructed for many years, the intervening country is still uninhabited. The honourable member for Wakefield told us the other day that it is a droughtstricken country.",44
352,Mr RICHARD FOSTEK,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It is all occupied.,45
353,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I understand - that there are but few sheep or cattle - there. I cannot understand the - attitude of the honourable members for Orey and Adelaide.

355,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Are we not M connect with the Queensland railway system until a line has been carried through Central Australia from Port Darwin to Oodnadatta ? That is not what we pledged ourselves to. Our policy was to connect Port Darwin and Port Augusta by a railway eoing vid the Macdonnell Ranges with a branch to Camooweal connecting it with the railway systems of the eastern States.,45
356,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What did the right honourable member say in his letter?,45

359,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The connection which I suggest would mean the construction of only 150 miles of railway. There never was a more dog-in-the-manger policy than that of the honourable members for Grey and Adelaide, who virtually say that until a railway is taken right through South Australia, at a cost of several millions of pounds, and requiring several years to construct, the Northern Territory shall not be connected with the Queensland railway system, although a connection could be given by laying down 150 miles of railway. They cannot hope for the sympathy of the members of their party or any one else in such a selfish and foolish policy.",45

' Sir JOHN FORREST - When I read the long letter in which the honourable member for Grey misrepresented my action and the proposals of the late Government, I wrote to the newspaper in which it was published, stating that it would be only fair to publish my speech; but I now hear for the first time that it has been published. westwards.

364,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not withdraw one iota of what I have written, because I believe that I defined a good policv-for the opening up of the Territory. I think that my second letter did not reach the Premier of Queensland, that it did not get beyond the then Prime Minister.  External Affairs would not endorse it .",45
365,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I shall deal with that interjection presently. I said to the Prime Minister ou the 30th June, and he endorsed the statement, that if the Northern Territory is to be opened up by railways, within a few years we must build from the Katherine southwards to Newcastle Waters, and from Camooweal westward to Newcastle Waters. That was to be a first instalment of the whole construction, and would mean the making of a railway for a distance of 838 miles from Camooweal to Port Darwin, 146 miles of the track being already laid, viz., from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. There would then remain 636 miles to connect Aho y Station with Oodnadatta. Although I am not now in office, I repeat that the route which I favour, from the information I have gained from those who know the country,.is from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, a distance of 146 miles, for which the railway is already constructed; from Pine Creek to the Katherine, a distance of 54 miles; and from the Katherine to Newcastle Waters, another 250 miles; thence to Anthony's Lagoon, which is 592 miles from Port win, and on to A l r oy which is 688 miles from Port Darwin From Anthony's Lagoon there would be a branch line to Peilew Islands anchorage near Booroloola, a distance of 236 miles. From Alroy Station there would be a connection with Camooweal, a distance of 150 miles, and the main line would go on from Alroy Station to Alice Springs, 339 miles, and from Alice Springs to Oodnadatta, a distance of 297 miles.",46
366,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The r i g h t honourable member apparently wishes that the construction shall be from the north southwards.,46
367,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I have never said so. The honourable and learned member for Angas and myself are in agreement as to route. The method of construction was never considered between us, except that I told him that I could not make provision on the Estimates of 1913-14 for the construction of these railways. We had not then sufficient information. All we could do was to determine a policy.",46
368,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"And we also sanctioned surveys. The honourable member's time having expired, leave to continue granted.",46
369,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable and learned member for Angas would have liked to commence the work df construction at once, but I considered that want of information and the financial position did not justify that. We had a great many other obligations to meet, and had not been long in office. It was too soon to propose the construction of railways which would cost many millions of money, but had we remained in office we should probably bave done something in the next session. My honourable and learned friend was desirous of constructing 300 miles of railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Range, but I held that such an extension of the present line by itself would not in any way develop the Northern Territory, because its terminus would be 1,000 miles from Port Darwin. I did not say that we should not make that extension, nor that I would not build from the south. There are many advantages in building from the south. Por one thing, labour can be obtained in the south, but is difficult to get in the north. ^The route that we advocate, except for Dar- 150 miles, is common to both-the Station, through line and the line to Camooweal - and it seems to me that no public man, not even the honourable members for Grey or Adelaide, if they were in office, would dare to declare that they would build a line for 688 miles from Port Darwin to Alroy Station, and then carry it 339 miles down to Macdonnell Ranges, and on to Oodnadatta, and would not connect with the railway system of Queensland by building 150 miles of railway from A l r oy Station to Camooweal.",46
370,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,No ; I should start from Oodnadatta.,46
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Would the honourable member not take the line to Camooweal at all ?,46
372,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,If it were profitable I should; but I would not leave Oodnadatta out altogether.,46
373,Sir JOHNFORREST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not see,, if funds are available, why the line should' not commence at Oodnadatta, Camooweal, and at Katherine River, too; I should have no objection. It must be remembered that beyond Macdonnell Ranges trade is not likely to come south, t u t must go north, except, perhaps, i u the - case of cattle and other stock. I think that the bombardment of those who are willing to assist this great railway project ought to earn for the honourable members who carry it on discredit, and not .praise, in their own State of South Australia. The honourable member for Grey .'has been attempting to make some capital by pointing out that I had not the concurrence of my colleague, the honourable member for Angas, at the time he mentioned, but was acting against his advice. Let me tell the honourable member that, ^unlike himself, I do not regard this as a -.parochial matter, the whole end and obj e ct of which is to have a large expenditure in South Australia, biit as a great national project.

I full y appreciate the difficulties which confront the Government and the Minister in regard to the Territory. If we are to let daylight into that part of Australia, it must be by means of railways; and this work is of the utmost importance to the people of Australia.

I am greatly indebted to honourable members on both sides for the manner in which they have dealt with this problem of the Northern Territory. The great issues involved have been dealt with in no sense from a party point of view; and it is only right that it should be so. For if ever there was a problem that will tax to the utmost the wisdom and patriotism of Australian public men it is that of the development of the Northern Territory. Therefore, it is an omen of good hope that honourable members on both sides look at the problem in a practical and business like way, and are offering suggestions not to embarrass the Minister or the Government, but to assist in arriving at a policy which will enable Australia to make the best of this great possession of ours. A good deal has been said about the route of the railway. I incurred the displeasure of my honourable friend, the member for Grey, some time ago, because I expressed the idea that, if We did desire t.o le.t i m mediate daylight, into this northern portion of Australia, the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Swan that there should be a railway from Newcastle Waters to Camooweal was a good one. I am still of that opinion. But this does not affect the view that I hold, namely, that the rest of the railway should be pushed on from the south as well as from the north. Here I may say to my honourable friends, who have insinuated the possibility of a breach of f a it h , that, so far as this Government are concerned, they are determined to honour the agreement already arrived at, not merely in the letter, but also in the spirit. This declaration should satisfy honourable members from South Australia. But surely honourable members will reflect on the position in which Australia finds herself today] We are confronted with the greatest convulsion in history, and with the necessity for unparalleled expenditure in men, money, and munitions. In such a world-wide cataclysm, may we not be excused from immediately taking in hand great national projects, including this railway?  have constructed the strategic railway if they could have found support for it . ' Mr Mahon - I would rather ti.ie honourable member did not introduce this question of the strategic railway. Wbil? the Northern Territory presents a very pressing problem, I take it that the safety of the whole of Australia is stui more important. If it were necessary, on the advice of the best experts, that the strategic railway should be built in order to safeguard this continent from attack, then it would become even more important than the Oodnadatta railway.  perts ?",48
391,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable member may depend on it that the Prime Minister of Australia has not proposed this strategic railway without having good advice. Some comment has also been made upon the circumstance that we have devised no new policy for the development of this Territory. Well, the Government have been only a few months in office, 'and a problem so vast as this Territory presents is not to be solved off-hand. Surely it is not expected that every new Minister shall come down at once with a new policy. Is it not wiser that he should examine the work of his predecessors-preservin g what seems good, and eliminating that which has proven to be defective? The lines on which the Territory are now administered were inaugurated by the honourable member for the Barrier, and others who preceded him in office. Their work was well done, and continued with equal energy and ability by the honourable member for Angas, my immediate predecessor. What course was left for 'me ? Obviously that of taking up the threads of administration as I found them, and giving time and opportunity for the ripening of one experimental measures of those who had studied the same question in advance of me. The honourable member for Angas, for instance, gave exhaustive consideration to the Territory, and has bequeathed a historical retrospect of its position of the greatest value to those who are to follow us. Again, the honourable member for the Barrier laid securely the foundation of measures which, in the ultimate issue, must contribute to the successful settlement of the Territory.",48
392,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Agricultural ?,49
393,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"-Yes ; agricultural. Experiments in agriculture are not to be decried, and I will be pleased to show the honourable member a sample of butter made at Darwin. Its condition disproves the idea that we cannot make butter in a tropical country.",49
394,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,In the winter you can; in the summer it runs away.,49
395,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,This butter was certainly not made in the winter. It has been in my possession for some time.,49
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What are going to do with it?,49
397,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Divid e it up if the honourable member is particularly anxious for it. That is practical Socialism. Coming now to the views expressed during this debate, I am in partial agreement with many of them. I have faith in the future of the Territory. Ultimately, it will, I am convinced, become a great asset for Australia. Meanwhile, I do not disguise the difficulties of any great advance coming from what is known as ""closer settlement"" there. My opinion is that development tliere must be pursued on the lines which have succeeded in other parts of Australia. And notably by what has occurred in Western [140] Australia, where the mining pioneer prospector has been the avant courier of civilization. I pin my faith, in the order named, to the miner, the pastoralist, and the agriculturist.",49
398,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I wish that were right.,49
399,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The Northern Territory admittedly contains mining fields of very great possibilities.,49
400,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It is-for the speculator to go down.,49
401,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable gentleman knows the early history of mining there and in other parts of Australia. He is aware that much of the money subscribed for mining development never reached the mining fields. I repeat that mining must be looked to to give this country its initial impetus; then development of its pastures, and, after these two, on agriculture.  a railway would be a prime factor in this development ?",49
402,Mr MASON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I believe the railway will be of very great assistance, but I remind the honourable member that there was a Coolgardie and a Kalgoorlie long before a railway went beyond Southern Cross.  country.",49
403,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Yes , rich mining country; and if we could strike a rich mine in the Northern Territory, we would have the people there, railway or no railway.",49
404,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Then the best thing is to wait until you strike a mine.,49
405,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No ; we cannot stand still. We must have settlement. Yet it is to be feared that from the man who you risks no capital of his own little is to be expected as a settler. Experience so far with such has been the reverse of encouraging. He is a very unstable type of pioneer who requires to be spoon-fed by the Government. On the other hand, the man who does possess capital of his own will not occupy the Territory. Why ? Not because the country lacks attractions, but because other parts of Australia,- where life is less strenuous and conditions, more comfortable, also offer him inducements. Until there is greater congestion in the temperate zone of Australia we can hardly look for any large accession of bold and adventurous spirits to occupy the agricultural areas. Tbis is why immediate reliance must be placed on the mineral wealth and the pastoralpossibilities of this great possession of ours. I have been twitted by the honourable member for G-rey with presenting a policy of despair in connection with this Territory. The honourable member surely does not expect me to portray its possibilities in the exuberant language of a company promoter. Is it not better to look difficulties in the face rather than resort to the devices of the ostrich ? Is it not wiser in the long run , and more honest, to present drab reality rather than a picturesque Utopia? Remember that we cannot absolve ourselves fro m responsibility for the consequences to men who might be lured into the region by glowing descriptions of the fortune which there awaits grit and industry. course, be easy to draw alluring pictures of the Territory ; to dwell on the rapt happiness of Edwin and 'Angelina gazing on roseate sunsets, across fields of bountif u l crops which the mere tickling of the f r u it f u l soil had made ready for the reaper. But those on whom responsibility rests must adhere with fidelity to the actual conditions which must be faced by the settler in the Territory. ,"" Mr YATES - If you would incorporate the railway in that picture, we should .take you more seriously.",49

It is liquor that we propose to prohibit; it is the abuse of it , and the introduction the vile concoctions that have worked so much mischief on the constitutions white men in the past.",51
425,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Will you give us your definition of the word "" abuse "" ?",51
426,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I think the honourable member, whose reputation for humour well established in this House, can find an illustration if he will "" stop, look, and listen,"" when next he goes out of doors. them The honourable member for Barrier referred to a suggestion of mine which found favour with the Argus, that reown turned soldiers should be invited to tive settle in the Northern Territory. appeared to think that approval from such a.source threw some doubt on the scheme. In that I am inclined to concur. I tainly is disconcerting to find one's posals favoured by the organ of Toryism. The position reminds me of O'Connell's attitude towards the Times. Whenever he was in doubt about any question he consulted the Times, and invariably found that by doing the exact opposite to what it recommended he was generally right. But the honourable member for the Barrier has scarcely gathered the real purport of the proposal in regard to the - ettlement of returned soldiers. I recogthat nise, as he does, that everything we do for the men now fighting for civilizawork tion should be done when they return. Many of these men who before the war had followed sedentary occupations, will have acquired a taste and liking for air life, and may be willing, in default of better opportunities to embrace those offered by this new country. Judging by the number of disappointed applicants at every land ballot, it will be very difficult to find in the moderately cool portions Australia areas of land offering sufficient attraction to these men. If we are assist settlers in the Territory - and think we should - then these men, who have developed a taste for an open-air life, and who will be physically strong and vigorous, might well be' assisted take up land in the Northern Territory. negotiations The precise method in which this is to be done remains to be decided, but it mightwell be done perhaps on the community traffic. system suggested by the honourable memsubmitted ber for Franklin. [140]- 2  much ment on the community system will be not the use of an absolute failure.",51
427,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I do not know why of the honourable member should say that.  of would not - put our returned soldiers on land which no one else would take up?,51
428,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I spoke not of every returned soldier, but of those who might be inclined to follow the life of a pioneer. I did not say that we should send them is indiscriminately into the Territory.  Mr. land nearer home ? MAHON - Can the honourable member find any land for them in his constituency? If not, what alternahas he to offer ? In conclusion, I may He say that these Estimates relate to several other important matters, such as the control of Norfolk Island, the Territory of t cerPapua, and the High Commissioner's prooffice; but, with the exception of the honourable member for Cook, no one has referred to them. The honourable member for Darling Downs has made some inquiries privately regarding Papuan developments in railways, oil, rubber, and general plantations, and I am glad to be able to supply the information. As the Committee is aware, the late Government projected a railway from Port Moresby to Astrolabe, an5 in respect to line I have ascertained that the can surveys had been completed, and the. was about to be begun when the war broke out. That event created considerable uncertainty as to the future of the mines, on which the railway will depend openfor practically all its business. The Mount Morgan Company, which it was understood was about to exercise the option which it held to purchase the principal mine, the Laloki, declined to exercise that option. The result was that no of steps Were taken in connection with the construction"", and that the rails which to had been ordered for Port Moresby were I carried on to Brisbane, where they now are. Since that time the position has not changed until today, when some responsible gentleman called on the Secretary to and intimated the desire to re-ooen on-the basis of their furnishing a guarantee of a certain amount of A.s this proposal is only now being to me, there has been no time to consider it , but it might, perhaps, be stated, for the information of the House,, that the intention to complete the railway has not been definitely abandoned. The fact is that the work was suspended only because the Government found themselves in a position that whereas they might build the railway, they had no assurance that any freight would be forthcoming, on its completion, for it to It might, perhaps, be added, that the wharf at Port Moresby, with which the oil fields work is intimately connected, is about to be begun. Instructions to put the work in hand have already been given. Honourable members will be interested to hear the latest reports from the oil field, which came to hand only today. Work in connection with the oil field, which had been suspended, pending consideration of Dr Wade's final report, has now been resumed. Dr Wade has been appointed director of the oil fields under an engagement for two years. Three drillers have been engaged, two of whom had to be obtained from Canada. These men have arrived, and leave Sydney today. A report from Dr Wade has just been received, indicating that work on the field is now well in hand. He has already obtained 30 or 40 gallons of a good, clear, light oil, which he states gives better sults in his oil engine than oil imported for the purpose. It has a sweet smell, and is free from sulphur. It is likely that a large sample will be sent down shortly. This light oil, in Dr Wade's opinion, indicates a heavier oil at a lower depth.  qualifications ?",51
429,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,He is a man of very high standing. We made exhaustive inquiries regarding him.,52
430,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,If the honourable mem. ber will refer to the report which Dr Wade has presented he will see for himself the various letters wfiich he is entitled to put at the end of his name.  mining fellows who put many letters at the end of their names.  Darwin has the whole alphabet after his name.,52

A small vessel for the transport of stores, &c, between Port Moresby and the field bas just been completed, and is to leave Brisbane within the next few carry. days. Arrangements for the engaging, housing, and feeding of a considerable number of native labourers are now in progress. The matter of the health of the men of the field is a subject of consideration. Malaria and a particularly troublesome kind of sore are prevalent, but it is expected that, with the application of the precautions suggested by modern preventive medicine, these evils can be minimized.",52

433,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Dr Wade's report came to hand only today, and I have not yet had time to read it . I shall be glad to show it to* the honourable member. In regard to the plantations, the position is as follows: Speaking generally with regard to the plantations in the Territory, it may be re- said that they are in a favourable condition. Many mistakes have occurred owing to ignorance of planting conditions and inexperience of the country. During the last two'iyears progress has been seriously retarded by the remarkable and unusual drought felt over a large part of the Territory. No particulars are available at present showing the respective areas of different private owners which are under cultivation, but as regards the Government plantations, the following table shows the areas under cultivation: Cocoanuts. Bubber. Miscellaneous Kemp Welch .. 50 352 Orangerie Bay .. 515 - Kapari .. 44 11 Hombrom Bluff - 20 114 Milne Bay . . . 45 - Nari Island .. 215 - 11 On the whole, these plantations are in a favourable condition, but it will be six or seven years before they are all making returns. This period has been extended owing to the setbacks that the Government have had, in common with private planters, particularly owing to the drought.",52

The honourable member for Angas then spoke for another quarter of an hour. I am bound under the Standing Orders to rule therefore he has spoken twice.",53
442,Mr GLYNN,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not wish to speak a second time, but there is.a misappreislanders, hension which, as I am the victim, should like to clear up. I thanked the Committed for its courtesy for granting me an extension of time, which otherwise I could have obtained by sitting down and rising again. It was a case of an to extension of one speech.  gratulate the Minister on the impartial attention he has promised to give to the suggestions which have emanated from both sides of the Committee in regard to the development of the Territory. The price of beef and mutton is high at the present time, and that fact, although it is a great disability to the community, will be of great assistance to the Minister in helping him to develop the Territory. The great difficulty in the past has been that the pastoralists have not been able to get sufficient value for their products. The However, I do not wish to say anything furthe r on this question, having already expressed my views. I doi wish to appeal to the Minister, however, to do something for the people of Norfolk Island, which is situated about 800 miles from Sydney, and has an area of about 8,000 acres and a population of 900. Its imports were valued last year at £9,000, and its exports at about £1,700. The residents are practically cut off from communication with the mainland. A steamer visits the Mr island only once a month, and is unsuitable for taking away the produce. Having regard to the high price of beef in Australia, I think it would be a good policy to encourage the development of the fisheries of Norfolk Island. The have three or four whale-boats, and those members who visited the island recently noticed that the boats returned after an absence of a few hours laden with the best varieties of fish. In order or to give the islanders encouragement and to develop that industry, the Government might very well consider the advisability of providing them with a steam-launch",53
443,Mr RILEY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Do you mean that the Government should make a free g if t of  be altogether a free g if t , inasmuch as it would help the electors of South Sydney that to obtain cheap fish. In conjunction with the trawler the Government should establish a refrigerating plant for the and transfer the fish frozen I there to the Sydney market.",53
444,Mr MAHON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Would that not be a socialistic undertaking?  of proposal it is. The Australian people require fresh fish, the islanders are in need of a means of livelihood, and it is only proper that the Government should do something to assist them. Another industry which has been neglected is whaling. The islanders have to go for many miles in ordinary whale-boats in pursuit of a whale, and in some instances they have had to tow a whale behind an ordinary row-boat for two days, whereas if they were provided with a launch they could prosecute their industry with more vigour. Something might be done to encourage the industry of drying and smoking fish. The islanders know nothing of our requirements, and I think that some person of experience should be sent there to teach those people the fishcuring business, and to produce other articles which are much needed on the mainland. The Commonwealth grants a bounty of Jd. per lb. on dried and smoked fish. In 1912-13 there were only five establishments engaged in this industry, and the bounty amounted to only £103 for the 49,440 lbs. produced in the Commonwealth. The importations of dried and smoked fish in .1912 totalled 26,000 cwts., worth £76,327. On this subject Knibbs says- t The abundance of fish offers excellent opportunity for the institution of preserving establishments, particularly in those coastal districts which enjoy a temperate climate. Up to the present but development has taken place, and the lishments for fish preserving at the time are very few. I think this industry requires only little encouragement from the Governdue ment and it would be quickly established, The Norfolk Islanders are under a great difficulty, because of the absence of anchorage for vessels calling there. steamer has to anchor in the open stead, and the residents never know which side of the island the steamer ' stop; its anchorage depends on the of the wind. The steamer is able to main at the island only a few hours, the consequence is that as soon as ' vessel comes to anchor every vehicle island is requisitioned in order to carry, the produce to the point of embarkation. If the residents were provided steam launch, it would obviate rowing of their produce for 1 or 2 miles to the ship's side, and the spoiling of perishable commodities by the salt water. We were treated excellently on the small steamer Makambo, which carried us from the island to the mainland; but if some arrangement could be made for the steamer Levuka to make a detour of about 50 miles to the island, the people would be much better served. The small boat was overcrowded ; many passengers had to take accommodation in the smoking room, and I understand that on the last trip some men had tQ sign on as members of the crew in order to secure passages. What is required is a vessel with up-to-date refrigerating accommodation, so that the perishable products of the island may be landed in good condition on the mainland. The fruit industry of Norfolk Island also presents great possibilities. Never have I tasted more luscious oranges than those grown on the island. I find that lemons.*' oranges, and other fresh fruits imported into Australia were valued at £217,796, and I am sure that Norfolk Island would, be able to supply from £15,000 to £20,000 worth of fruit for the Sydneymarket, if facilities were provided for bringing their produce in good order to the mainland. I have mentioned tbese two or three items in the hope that the Minister will do something for these islanders, who are certainly deserving of in Australian waters consideration.",54
445,Mr KELLY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Wentworth) [9.55] little Honourable members on both sides of the estabHouse are very grateful to the honourable present member for Calare for anticipating in such a concise .and clear way the statea ment which, no doubt, we shall have in course from the Royal Commission which recently completed a visit to Norfolk Island. I do not wish, at this late any hour, to traverse the issues whioh have The been raised by my honourable friend, or roadthe Ministerial statement to which the on Committee listened 'this evening; but T will do wish to take this the earliest opporstate tunity, to express my profound disaprepointment with the attitude evidenced by and the honourable member for Brisbane durthe ing the remarks of the Minister. Thosein the of ns who are innocent in our natures have always looked to. the honourable member for Brisbane as a. sort of apostle of with a the temperance movement; we have-, the hoped for great things from him. We. *have heard him most desperately in - earnest on the public platform; we have - seen him moving in this Chamber from victory to victory-Pyrrhi c in nature, no doubt, but still victory-w e have seen him abolishing the parliamentary bar, and still the bar is open; we have heard bim denouncing the Minister for iniquities in the Northern Territory, and we have heard him making the rafters ring with appeals that the people there - should be allowed to settle the question of liquor control by local option. To-night, in the most barefaced manner, the honourable member for Brisbane has told the House that he believes that when the vote has been taken Bung will come out triumphant. Has he been urging and compelling us to agree to the taking of a vote so that Bung may be triumphant? This is an extraordinary thing for a temperance advocate to do.",54
446,Mr WEST,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Giv e the honourable member credit for an attempt to educate the people on the - subject.,55
447,Mr KELLY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable member would establish the liquor trade in the Northern Territory by buttressing it withGovernment . assistance, and without inconveniencing himself politically. This is a most disappointing attitude. If there are any from whom we might expect - coherence and consistency, they are the advocates of temperance. Surely we have - a right to expect that the honourable members for Brisbane and Barrier will not ask Parliament to arrange for the taking of a vote which will benefit the hotel trade of . Australia. I protest, with all the warmth of which I am capable, against the proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane to give the people of the Northern Territory local option on the drink question when, aa he himself has confessed, the result will be to establish the liquor trade there. Is he so recreant to his temperance principles' as to wish to entrap Parliament into consenting to a mock referendum which will benefit no one else but Bung? I hope that honourable members will no longer take as gospel everything they hear from these temperance gentlemen, but will do what they think best to bring about lasting reforms, discountenancing reforms which, though politi«ally expedient, must damage the temperance cause.",55
448,Mr BILEY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What would the honourable member suggest?,55
449,Mr KELLY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"My honourable friend does not wish me to outline a policy at this hour. No doubt the Temperance party throughout Australia deeply regrets the price which the honourable member for Barrier has had to pay for many of his most earnest convictions. The honourable member adorned the last Labour Ministry, in which he acted in many capacities-on e rapidly succeeding another, I might add. He is not now a member of the Cabinet, and there is no member of the Cabinet to whom we can look for guidance on this question. I ask him, therefore, to get into even closer touch with the honourable member for Brisbane, and to obtain from the honourable member an explanation of his interjection that if a referendum were taken in the Northern Territory the vote would go in favour of the drink traffic. We ought to be in earnest in regard to referendum proposals. If we think that we can achievesome good by means of a referendum, let us urge it ; but it would be to waste the public funds to hold a referendum merely for educational, purposes, if the result would show the people of the country how helpless we were in regard to the reform proposed.",55

If one could hear that honourable member without seeing him, one would think that he meant what be said, and it would not be evident that to-night he has tried to make a farce of so serious a matter as the sobriety of the people of the Northern Territory. It is most unsatisfactory that the honourable member, notwithstanding his high abilities, which have been developed by special training, should utilize his eloquence to cast ridicule on a good cause, and to make fun of what, at the present time, is for the nations of the world one of the most serious and perplexing questions that they have to face. The honourable member continually descends from the sublime to the ridiculous, and generally ends in making himself ridiculous. I owe him an apology for a statement that I made some two years ago, undeT the mistake that he had received his training at Oxford. Having discovered that I am wrong, I apologize to Oxford.",55
451,Mr KELLY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Why does the honourable member wish for a referendum in the Northern Territory if he thinks that it will benefit Bung?,55
452,Mr FINLAYSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I have always taken the stand that the liquor question should be settled by the people concerned. It is for them to say what they want. I may be defeated on this occasion, as I have been defeated before, but I am confident that ultimately good sense will prevail. I agree with the Minister that we cannot entirely reform this generation; in this generation that reform comes by stages, and that often victories are achieved by defeat. may be defeated, but the tide is sure to w in , and in a Democratic country nothing has a better educational effect than the free exercise of the f r a n chise on questions of national importance. There could be nothing better in Victoria and the Northern Territory, or in Papua, than to allow the people to determine, in regard to the liquor question, what is best for themselves, as they did in South Australia a few months ago. refer to the fact that the honourable member for Barrier, when he was Minister over the Department, also promised that a referendum vote should be taken. That has not been done yet, but I am quite satisfied with the announcement of the Minister to-night.",56
453,Mr GROOM,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Will the' vote be taken on the basis of adult suffrage of the white population ?,56

460,Mr FINLAYSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Yes . The Lieutenant-Governor of Papua is a total abstainer, and so is the Administrator of that Territory. It is just as wrong to say that strong drink is necessary in the tropics as it was wrong to think that alcohol was necessary in the Arctic regions.

462,Mr FINLAYSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No, because it may be the means of allowing men wh» take it to become frozen. The same argument against alcohol in the Arctic regions applies against alcohol in the tropics. Evidently the Minister needs to look up some authorities in order that his mind may be disabused of the ideas he holds now that because people get thirsty I want to they must drink strong liquor.  trator of the Northern Territory think about it ?",56
463,Mr FINLAYSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not know. Now coming back to the statement made by the honourable member for Wentworth, I want to say that while it is true that if a referendum vote were taken in the Nor. thern Territory, it would probably result in favour of nationalization, that is noguarantee that it will be the final decision. Local option polls on this question have been held in various countries of the world for many years, and yet we have not seen the end of the liquor traffic, but they have all done something to educate the people concerning the effects of alcohol. At any rate, I am prepared to stand by the result of a referendum vote rather than the statutory decision by a Parliament sitting in Melbourne with regard to the conditions in the Northern Territory. This Parliament has no right arbitrarily to determine such a question That state- for the Northern Territory. I know of no more satisfactory method of settling this question than by the referendum.",56
464,Dr MALONEY,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Would you give the people there a vote for other things besides liquor? William Mr FINLAYSON - I would give them a vote for everything. I am so thoroughly democratic that I am prepared to trust the people in all circumstances, because I believe in government of the people by the people and for the people. I believe that people in the Northern Territory are just as intelligent and - capable of deciding what is best for the Northern Territory-indeed , I think they are more likely to know what is best for them-tha n we here in Melbourne are, for they have to live there, and they know what suits them best. They might be wrong, and they might do things of which I do not approve; but that would not prove I was right and they were wrong. The mere fact of being in a minority on a question does not necessarily mean that the minority is wrong. For instance, we were in a minority on two occasions over the referendum questions in Australia, but we are so convinced that we are right, although the people said we were wrong, that we shall submit the questions again. There is no better educational method in any country than the exercise of the referendum, which requires people to give an intelligent vote on all great questions. In regard to the Northern Territory, on this and on any other question I am prepared to abide by the will of the people, and to allow them to determine under what conditions they shall live.",56
465,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Gwydir) [10.18] My experience with regard to the temperance question is that those who know least about the effects of drink set themselves up as judges. I believe the honourable member for Brisbane has not had anv experience of the effects of drink.,57
466,Mr FINLAYSON,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Would you mend me to try it , and speak from experience ?",57
467,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I believe that the honourable member would then be in a better position to say what are its effects, and would be able to speak on both sides. I have not much to say regarding the Northern Territory. I spoke upon the subject some years ago, and as time goes on I find that my utterances are being borne out more full y even than I anticipated. I do not think that it will be necessary for me to alter the views I expressed at that time. In common with - other honourable members. I regret that the prospects of the Northern Territory are not more promising than they are. sympathize with the representatives from South Australia in their desire to induce the Commonwealth to spend millions of money upon the development of aterritory which, at present, holds out .very little hope of success.  ber knows nothing about the Northern Territory.",57
468,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I have read almost all the reports upon the Northern Territory that have been received, and the more of them. I read the worse I am confounded in trying to arrive at a decision. The Minister of External A f fairs has said that he relies upon three things for the development of the Territory. The first is mining, the second pastoral occupation, and the third agriculture. What is the history of the Northern Territory from a mining point of view? There is no territory in Australia, or for that matter in the world, from which so little has been earned at so great a cost. There is no country in which so much capital has been sunk with so little result. The men who sank their money in the Northern Territory were as clever as many of those who profess to know all about mining today. They sank, not thousands, but tens of thousands of pounds there, and the monuments of their misplaced confidence are to be seen in the Northern Territory today. I am told that it is because the water beat them, but it was because no continuous lode has yet been discovered there. Since this Parliament took over the Northern Territory, we nave spent, or have undertaken to spend, £35,000 to encourage mining prospecting. What recomhas been the result?",57
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"We have had minerals from the Northern Territory to the value of nearly £3,000,000.",57
470,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,And it cost far more to get them.,57
471,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,The same thing might be said of the gold obtained in Yictoria at the present time.,57
472,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It is of no use for honourable members to talk in that way. I ask them, to point to one mining show in the Northern Territory that has paid dividends to those who have undertaken to explore the mineral wealth of that country. The result of the prospecting that has been undertaken does not give the slightest encouragement to continue I the work. We have spent £35,000 upon prospecting, which has merely tested mining shows that have been tested over and over again, and proved to be failures.",57
473,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I could refer the honourable member to Eundreds of places in the eastern States of which the same might be said.,58
474,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"The honourable member could not refer me to a place where the mines have all been failures, and where there have not been some that have been successful. I should like to be able to speak otherwise of the Northern Territory if I couldi No man has a greater desire than I have that it should prove a profitable undertaking to the Commonwealth. Of what use is it for. honourable members to tell this House and the country that we are warranted in expending millions of money, as the right honourable member.for Swan has recommended, ""upon a railway scheme in the Territory ?  ploration. I have known the proprietors of one station to lose £35,000 in putting down trial bores for water.",58
475,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"We have had no result from this expenditure in the Northern Territory.  The honourable member speaks of £35,000 as if it were an enormous sum.",58
476,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I expect some result from that expenditure. Thousands of pounds have been spent on bores put down in the Northern Territory to crosscut a lode which it was thought might run deep, but without any result.",58
477,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,It takes more than a bore to prove a reef.,58
478,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I am well aware that it does. Does the honourable member think that I do not understand how to prove a reef? When I refer to one feature of the subject, honourable members apparently desire a disquisition upon the subject of mining generally. come to consider the pastoral possibilities upon which the proposed railway is to depend for revenue, what is the position? If honourable members will look through the reports, they will find that nearly all the more valuable areas of land i m the Northern Territory are already under occupation. They are held under leases for forty-two years, granted by the State Government, t i e term having to a greater or lesser extent unexpired.",58
479,Mr THOMAS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,That is one of the problems of the Northern Territory.,58
480,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"We have to look it in the face. The desirable pastoral areas are already under occupation. Outsidethe Barclay Tablelands, with the exception, perhaps, of a little of the country in the Macdonnell Ranges, there is nocountry in the Northern Territory suitable for the closer settlement which would, be necessary to provide a traffic which, would pay interest on the millions of money which some honourable memberssuggest we should spend in railway construction there. It is better that I should speak according to the facts than that I should, with a desire to curry favour, support some of the proposals that have been made. So far as the returns from pastoral occupation in the Northern T e r r i tory are concerned, I predict that the> north and south railway will never pay.",58
481,Mr BURNS,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,We are pledged to thatrailway by the agreement.,58
482,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"No , we are not pledged to that railway. ",58
483,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Some other time we shall have a talk about that; but I predict now that the north and south r a i l way, if constructed, will always be a white elephant for Australia. What was the ground of the appeals to this Housefor the taking over of the Territory It . was urged that the taking over was necessary in order to preserve the Territory against the invasion of the Japanese. That was the great lever which was always used when it was found that f a it b had been lost in the Territory from a developmental point of view; and but forthat, I doubt whether the proposal would have been agreed to. If it is possible for the Japanese to come to Australia through the back door, the best thing for them would be for us to build a railway so that they may get to the more settled When we portions of the country. No attacking force could possibly travel over the Territory as it now is; and the best course,from the point of view of safety, would' be to leave the Territory as a buffer between the threatening elements and the settled parts. The Minister of External Affairs seemed to be very happy because some one has sent him 5 lbs. of butter as a specimen of what can be produced in the Northern Territory-as an illustration of the agricultural possibilities of that big part of the country. No one denies that cows caii give m i l k in the T e r r it o r y. if they get sufficient food, and that butter can consequently be produced; but it .'S sheer nonsense to point to. that as a proof of the agricultural possibilities of that part of Australia. I was one who predicted failure for the experimental farms of the honourable member for Barrier, and in consequence I was almost insulted by some honourable members. As a matter of fact, however, in the shortest time on record, these experimental farms have mot only proved a failure, but have practically passed out of existence, as, indeed, they well might, for the project was stillborn and never had any life in it . To talk of agriculture in connection with the Northern Territory is mere nonsense; to talk of its great pastoral possibilities is a stretching of the imagination; and to talk of its mining possibilities only suggests that the wish is father to the thought.",58

490,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"In the early days men took up areas on the borderland under conditional purchase and leasehold tenure, and these areas became divided and subdivided u n t i l they became too small for the increasing f a m i lies. Then the sons, being used to the land, went further afield, and that is what I mean when I speak of overflow population. The sons of men who are on the margin of settlement, and who are acclimatized, and anxious to follow in their fathers' footsteps, keep spreading further and - further out,- ever bringing land under cultivation.",59

496,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I differ from the honourable member.,59
497,Mr YATES,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Then you differ from the report of the Commission. Mr . WEBSTER - I do not care about the Commission at all. I do know that the State from which the honourable member comes had every opportunity to do something with the Territory.,59

499,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"It did nothing, and it handed over the Territory to the Commonwealth, overwhelmed with debt.",59

The Territory was handed over - to us overwhelmed with debt, and with railways which involve us in an annual loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Yet representatives of South Australia are now telling ns of what the T e r r i tory is capable. Thousands of pounds were spent at Port Darwin to illustrate what could be produced there in the way of cocoanuts, paupans, and so forth . When honourable members visited that part of the Territory everything was arranged to impress them with the idea of both agricultural and mining production. Even the miners never tried to wash out the t in from the mica deposits, but built them up in great tiers, and we were given glowing accounts, such as m in in g' syndicates ever put forward.",59

506,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not thank the honourable member for that incorrect statement. It was a red-letter day for the residents when the Governor General visited Port Darwin. Every man threw down his tools to go into the town and learn that the Commonwealth really intended to take over Territory. I had the opportunity of disthat cussing the problems of that country with many men, who had no object in telling me what was not correct; and I drew own conclusions from what I gleaned from them. The best proof of the view I hold lies in the fact that each Minister who has had control of the Northern Territory has felt that the task of advising the adoption of any practical policy for i almost hopeless.",60

In the meantime, I am pointing out that I have seen no reason to change the views I had formed. Unlike other Ministers, the present Minister is pioneer it . not very enthusiastic. He is right in saying that every new Minister cannot be expected to evolve a policy for the Territory. In fact, he goes further, and says pose? that he proposes to follow the policy moulded by his predecessors, by. which take it that he means to say he is going to adopt the best part and to set aside the impracticable. If he does this, will be doing well. No Minister have a more vexed proposition to deal , or a more unsatisfactory one, or in - one the attempt to settle which will do",60
509,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Richmond) [10.45] - I honorcannot let the statement made by the honourable member pass uncorrected. The honourable member has always been an uncompromising opponent of the Northern Territory. I admit that there is a great deal of doubt as to whether that portion of Australia will ultimately be a success; told but we have to make up our minds to it either a big success or a big failure. to We are now piling up a large debt by the accumulated interest which is falling into every year, and we do not see any hope of getting an adequate return for our investment unless we propose to go further. What encourages me in my desire that we should go further is the fact that we have heard said about many other parts of Australia just what the honourable member has said to-night about the Northern Territory. A number of years ago it was said that all the country in Western Australia between Beverley and Southern Cross and towards Kalgoorlie the was utterly useless, yet today we know in an ordinary season this country is one of the best wheat fields Australia possesses. From what I have heard from my men who bave had experience in the Northern Territory and in pastoral and agricultural pursuits in other parts of Australia, a great deal of the Territory, if it is provided with adequate means of communication, will be found to be ret is munerative. I do not say that the whole of it is good pastoral, or good agricultural, land-as in every other part of Ausany tralia, belts of poor country lie between belts of good country-bu t I venture to that, taking it righ t through, it is of the same average quality as is the rest of Australia. What is. keeping it back is partly its inaccessibility, and partly the fact that an adequate reward has not been held out to those who are willing to",60
510,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I suppose that you want some more millions for that pur,60
511,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"If honourable memI bers say that rather than hold out a reward to those who are willin g to develop the Territory they would prefer to see i the remain waste, to be ultimately taken could possession of by other nations who are land hungry, I have nothing to say; but we-can only populate the-Northern Terriproduce tory by opening it up by good means communication, and by holding out adeagain, quate rewards to the people who are ing to sink their capital in it.",60
512,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,What form of reward would you suggest?.,61
513,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not care whethei it is freehold tenure or any other form of reward; but I do say that we must hold out an adequate reward to the who is prepared to risk his capital The honourable member says that the - Territory is useless, and that any man prepared to put his capital in it is bound to suffer loss.",61
514,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,I did not say anything of the kind.,61
515,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"I do not know what other interpretation could be placed on the honourable member's attitude. He tells us the Territory is no good, and that would be infinitely better to leave i occupied for all time, because we can never hope to get an adequate return from it. I say that if any one is prepared to sink his capital, risk his own enterI prise, and. perhaps, a considerable of his life, in the Northern Territory, honourable member should be the very first to-offer him the fullest reward we can possibly give.",61
516,Mr WEBSTBH,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,Quite a number of men have already done it.,61
517,Mr MASSYGREENE,INTERNMENT OF GERMANS AND,"Everythin g that the honourable member says in that regard another reason for saying that we should give to any one who goes to the Northern Territory and takes all those risks the fullest reward that 'lies in our power. . In regard to the much-discussed scheme railways, whilst I admit the existence the agreement with the South Australian Government in regard to the north south railway, it seems to me that it a matter of no moment to the people South Australia, from a commercial stand-point at all events, provided Commonwealth builds a line from Oodnaplished. datta to the Macdonnell Eanges, whether, after that, the Commonwealth develops tha Territory from the railway standMinister point in any other way. It must be fectly obvious to anybody who looks at the map that, after a'certain point in Territory is reached on the journey south from Darwin or on the journey north from Adelaide, there must be one point where it would be better to send either north or south, and if of any honourable member looks at the map he will see that point about 50 willmiles north of the Macdonnell Ranges, which is about equidistant from Adelaide and Townsville. It seems to me, therefore, inasmuch as most of the good territory lies to the eastward, that it would naturally be very much better to take the produce from the portion of the man Northern Territory that does not go there. directly north to the ports in the Northern Territory, through Queensland,, and that it would not pay in any circumstances to use the port of Adelaide. I do not. believe produce from that district will ever go to Adelaide. "" Necessarily, from its geographical position, all the trade that will ultimately develop in the ranges will go south, but after that I believe most of the trade .will either go east or north, if the means of communication it were similar in every respect. While we t unare pledged tq go on with the development of the Northern Territory with railways as being the only means that make it possible to open up the Territory, yet think we should be fulfilling the letter part and the spirit of the agreement with the South Australia if we built the line from Oodnadatta well into the Macdonnell that Ranges, and then developed our railway policy from the north, so as to permit the settlement which I believe will ultimately take place to draw the north and south lines together. I think that will be the is wisest and most economical policy, and that it will develop the Northern Territory quicker than any other. 'My view is that the only course open for us to pursue in regard to the Northern Territory is a of forward one. We cannot retract the step of we have taken. Whether that step was wise or unwise is not a consideration that and we can enter upon now, and we should, is at all events, make a serious effort to try of to turn the Northern Territory into a commercial proposition. I have great the faith in that, being ultimately accomI t may take a good number of years, but I believe it will ultimately be done. I recognise the truth of what the said a little while ago, that, perwhilst this great war is in progress, and that whilst necessarily the whole energies the of the nation are being devoted to the fulfilment by Australia of her full share in it, it is practically impossible for us to go on with big developmental schemes; but I would suggest in the meantime that the .Minister should go into this matter as fully as he possibly can, so that, when the time comes, that money is available, We shall be, able to' start immediately upon a strong, forward, progressive policy in the development of the Territory. .
