CAPTAIN CRESWELL'S REPORT.",12
1,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has asked if a report by Captain CreswelJ can be laid on the table of the House. I have consulted the Minister of Defence on the subject, and he has no objection to it being done, so that instructions will be given accordingly. If this report does not furnish the information which the honourable member for Wentworth desires, I shall endeavour to secure for him any further information that he mav require.",12
2,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The probability is that Captain Creswell was asked to put his views before the Council of Defence when it was first formed, and was considering a Defence policy. If a report of any such questions and answers could be prepared, it would be very useful to - honourable members, and I ask the honourable gentleman if he can obtain a copy for us, so we may be f u l ly seized of what proposed in regard to naval matters.",12
3,Mr EWING,Unknown,"There is no objection to any honourable member seeing any of the been Not papers in the Defence Department, unless they relate to some matter which all would struments, agree should not be made public. If the honourable member's views can be met without injury to the public interest, T am sure that the Minister of Defence will be glad to meet them. WESTERNAUSTRALIANTARIFF . recent",13

6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"When will officers who are entitled under the classification scheme to receive increases ba paid the amounts due to them? Will these increases date from the presentation of the original report by the Commissioner, or from the time of the approval of the scheme by Parliament?",13
7,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The Treasurer could life answer this question better than I can. I other understand the intention was to pay these of increases as soon as an appropriation had been made. I ask the honourable gentleman to give notice of his second question, because I think the dates, from which some of these increases take effect vary. NA INSTRUMENTS.",13
8,Mr MAUGER,DISCARD ED TELEPHON E,"for Mr WILKINSON) asked the Postmaster-General, notice I. Whnt is done with telephone instruments when discarded by his Department because of wear or for other reasons? 2. Is it true that a number of such instruments were recently sold at a very low price, after a much better oITcr had been made for them for use in connection with rifle ranges and refused ? 3. Will the Minister confer with the Department of Defence with a view to giving rifle clubs an opportunity of securing some of these instruments at a fair valuation? Mr AUSTIN . CHAPMAN - The that answers to the honourable member's queshas. been tions are as f o l l o w : 1. They are used as far as possible for repairing other instruments, or sold by auction. 2. so far as the Postmaster-General bas able to ascertain. 3. The Minister has no objection to such inwhen available, being supplied to rifle clubs at a fair valuation. .' IMPERIAL CONVICTS .",13
9,Mr FRAZER,DISCARD ED TELEPHON E,"for Mr Mahon) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticej . Wliether his attention has been directed to reports of the Comptroller for Prisons, Western Australia, and especially to the followMinister ing passages therein :(a) "" There were ninety-five convicts undergoing sentences of penal servitude in the various gaols and at large under the ticket-of-leave regulations in the different districts; nineteen had originally been sent from England .as Imperial convicts, and of these eleven were still under life sentence imposed from thirty-five to forty years ago. Repeated applications have been made to the authorities in England with a view to obtain for these men a remission of their sentences, but without avail. (i) "" At the end of 1902 there were ninetyfive men undergoing penal servitude in Western Australia, and on the same day in 1903 there were but seventy-nine. Eighteen of these had been originally . sent from England as convicts, nine being still undergoing life sentences imposed in that country from thirtyseven to forty-two years ago""? 2. In view of the lengthy incarceration of the prisoners referred to in these extracts,' and circumstances, will the Prime Minister suggest to. the Imperial authorities the desirability liberating these men?",13
10,Mr DEAKIN,DISCARD ED TELEPHON E,"The report of the Comptroller for Prisons-has not come under my notice, but I will make inquiries respecting the matters alluded to by the honourable member. NA BILL. upon SECOND READING. Debate resumed from ioth November (vide page 4046), on motion by Mr DEA KINThat the Bill be now read a second time.",13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Parramatta) I do not propose to occupy very much' time in dealing with this measure at the present stage. I congratulate the Government upon its introduction, so' far as it goes, and offer them my cordial support in their effort to place it upon the statute-book. I am ready to take all necessary steps to preserve Australia for a white people, and to prevent the contamination of our race by that racially tainted blood which it is so desirable to keep at a safe distance. But, while we must take every precaution to prevent that contamination, and may sometimes seem, in the peremptory and drastic character of our legislation and its administration, not too careful as to the means and methods which we adopt, there are certain facts to which we must keep our minds fully alive. We should, above all things, take cognisance of what is passing in the world around us. We cannot, ostrich-like, hide our heads in the sand, in the hope that no outside invader will ever attack us, and in the belief that none of the so-called inferior races will ever ascend the scale of civilization, and so far adopt the methods of civilized life, and. above all, of civilized warfare, as to be a menace to us. No doubt many of us have lived in a fool's paradise in this regard for some years past. I make the free confession that I have done so, to some extent. Until recent developments took place, I had no idea that a certain eastern nation had so far adopted western methods ancl customs, and acquired western means of destruction, as the late war has proved it to have done. When such a nation suddenly springs into prominence, and shows itself entitled, by the valour and skill of its people, and their recognition of the standards of our civilization, to a place at the table of the civilized nations of the world, it is time for us to inquire if our relations with it are such as to be likely to provoke reprisals, and also whether those relations make it possible for us to continue to live in amity with it. After all, the great law of existence, as applied to nations, is still the law of force. We may wish that it were otherwise, but we cannot for-gfit that in the last resort our civilization depends on the strength of our right arm to defend and maintain it. We must, therefore, pay regard to the position of those nations which, on their part, hate shown themselves possessed of strength and valour, and have proved themselves ready to light in defence of their national ideals, and in pursuit of their national aspirations. Therefore, if anv of our laws conflict with their ideals and aspirations, and seem likelv to offer ah affront to them, we should inquire whether we cannot amend them, to take away this appearance of offence. One of the primary objects of the Bill is to remove a cause of offence to that great eastern nation which has so well demonstrated its claim-whic h many of us were inclined, through ignorance, to deny-to have risen to a high altitude of civilization, and to other nations, .forming part of the Empire to which we belong, which, by reason of their great intellectual advancement, have also demonstrated the wisdom of this course of action. It would be idle to discuss what makes the radical differences between the races of mankind, or if they are radical. Some writers assert that these differences are not radical, but due wholly to age, climate, and environment; while others say that they are radical, and can never be entirely bridged over, no matter how much we may try to modify them. I remember talking, a little while ago to one of the best authorities on these subjects in Sydney, and he declared very emphatically that the differences in race were radical, and that it was not possible to bring all nations to the same plane of civilization and make them adopt the same methods and ideals of life. If that be so - and it does not much matter as regards this Bill whether it is iso or not-w e simply have to do with the differences as we find 1 them today; whether they be the result of environment or whether they be prescribed by a higher power than ourselves. It is idle to pursue an inquiry of that kind just now. There are differences in these races which make it desirable that each should be allowed to develop on its own plane of civilization, and, according to its own conceptions of national life, to pursue its way unmolested, untrammelled, and uninrerfered with by others. Therefore, I take it that in framing this legislation, and seeking to give it effect, we do not necessarily pass a reflexion upon any nation with which we so deal. We simply say that in the pursuit of our own ideals, with a view to the permanent betterment of our own race, to the maintenance of our domestic: conditions, to the working out of our destiny, untrammelled and uninterfered with by other 1 people, we take the action we do. But, while it is true that in the last resort force decides the fate of nations, it does not follow that the nations which in that resort betake themselves to force, and so wield it as to enable them to assert their position to a place amongst civilized nations, necessarily also subscribe to these domestic standards which it is our aim and purpose to secure for our own race. A nation may be well skilled in the arts of war, may be able to assert for itself a place amongst the nations of the earth, and yet have such internal and domestic conditions as to make it almost a peril for other nations to have free intercourse with them.",13
12,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,If they have the power we cannot enforce the law.,15
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is precisely my point. They may be able to enforce any conditions at the point of the sword, or by such other demonstration of force as they think fit, and may force their civilization upon an people, who regard it as certainly not in accord with their ideals and standards; and there lies the danger which we seek to avoid, I take it, in legislation of this kind. We do not wish to do anything which would irritate the nations which have the means at their command to carry out their will to a very great extent with regard to people who are less formidable than themselves, and who bave not cultivated the arts of war to the same extent. Whether we like it or not, we are all compelled to subscribe to these standards of force and respect them as far as we may. And so I take it that we should frame our legislation so as to be as little irritable as possible to these people who do not subscribe to our domestic standards, and with whom it would not be desirable to have unrestricted free intercourseBut I venture to say. also, that the Eastern nation, of which so many of us are thinking today, is making mighty strides in civilization, too. It is true that its standards of life and comfort, and its domestic ideals are very different from our own-that is, viewed from our stand-point. It may be that they regard their ideals, their attainments, and their standards, as superior to our own. That all depends upon the point of view. But I contend that notwithstanding that their conditions of life, rates of wages, prescribed standards of social comfort, and social ideals, may not he equal to our own, yet they are fast coming to the same plane. And I venture to predict that if the« keep on in their present course, they will more and more assimilate to our social ideals, as well as to those international standards which we all must respect. I therefore am glad to see an effort made by the Government of the day to shape our attitude towards them in a way that will be as little offensive as possible. That I take to be the main object of this Bill , although it contains other amendments in the law-mostl y of an administrative character-whic h will need to be examined when we get into Committee. That, however, need not concern us at this stage. The great point is that the Bill is an effort, and I think a worthy effort, to meet the new condition of things which has arisen, and, at the same time, to preserve, as far as possible, and in the most strenuous way that we can, our ideal of a White Australia. I remember that when we were previously discussing this subject, referunwilling ence was made to the advent of the Hindoo race to the neighbouring islands of F i j i . That shows, very conclusively, the great care which we ought to take with regard to the further admission of races which are called alien, and whose civilization is not our own. Nothing could more strongly indicate the necessity for looking sharply to the keeping of Australia to white methods and white standards, than what is now taking place in F i j i . The missionaries from that country tell us sorry tales of the continued influx of Hindoos. As a matter of fact, the Hindoo is elbowing out the Fijian . The Fijians are a de1 clining quantity, and the Hindoos are a constantly increasing quantity.",15
14,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Japanese are driving out the Fijians.,15
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Not to any great extent, I think.",15
16,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,To an enormous extent.,15
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Fro m our standpoint, the Hindoos are causing most trouble. We are told that the work of civilizing the Fijians is being retarded in every way by the influx of these people, who subscribe to a different religion, and one which colours and dominates their conception of existence. That is a very serious thing indeed. The religious aspect, of this international and social question is one of the most troublesome with which we have to deal. In F i j i the missionaries are complaining of the undermining of their efforts, directed, as they have been for the last fifty years, to the pushing of the Fijians to a higher plane of civilization. They say that their efforts, have - been steadily undermined by a continued and steady influx of Hindoos. What occurs in F i j i ' would unquestionably occur here if , without let or hinderance, these races, which we deem to be inferior to our own- I mean inferior in point of their conception of civilized standards.were allowed to come here. preserve, with the utmost rigidity, our ideals as a white race, it behoves us to seek by every conciliatory method which may be open to shape our attitude towards these rising Eastern nations, which otherwise may give us trouble, and may prevent the object which we have in view. It ""is i'n that spirit that I cordially welcome this Bill , which I shall in Committee help to make as perfect as possible.",15
18,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," On account of the way in which the notice paper has been prepared for the last few days, I did not expect the debate on the second reading of this Bill to be resumed this morning. I cannot allow the measure to go into Committee without entering a protest. Evidently the object of the Government is to try to placate what is known as the "" stinking-fish "" party-the party who are continually decrying this country. Either the Bill is a sham or it is going to do something which will injure the White Australia policy adopted by the electors.",16
19,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is a rank piece of hypocrisv.,16
20,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know whether it is a piece of hypocrisy. afraid that there is something more than that in the measure. I believe that the Government has taken up the mistaken idea that by making a little sacrifice of a principle which the Parliament has adopted, they can placate their ODponents. Nothing of the kind. If the Bill is a sham, the deputy leader of the Opposition knows that more capital than ever will be made out of this legislation by the Conservative press.",16
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What is a sham?,16
22,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Bill is a sham in some respects and a danger in other spects. It is a sham in so far as an attempt to make the members in. the Labour corner believe that the principle of a White Australia is not going to sacrificed, and it is a danger, because am quite satisfied that it is going menace to that policy. Clause 6 saysI f the Minister notifies by notice in the Gazelle to 70,000. that an arrangement has been made with the Government of any cuuuiry regulating the admission to the Commonwealth of the subjects or citizens of that country, the subjects or citizens of that country shall not, while the notice continues to have eifect, be required to pass the dictation test. What does that mean? It means that it is going to be left to the Administration to say in what manner coloured aliens shall be excluded from or permitted to enter this While we country.",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,^-Rea d sub-clause 2.,16
24,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It says The Minister shall not issue any such notice until the expiration of one month after copies of the arrangement to which it refers have been laid before both Houses of the Parliament. Circumstances change. We do not know that after the next elections the right honourable member for East Sydney may not come back with a majority behind him, and if he did he would, by administering the law which the present Government are placing in his hands, allow the free admission of coloured aliens. Do honourable members, on the Opposition benches think that that would not happen?",16
25,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We can safely risk thar.,16
26,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I take it for granted that the Bill i's intended principally as a concession to the sentiment of the Japanese Government, who have objected' to the education test being conducted in a European language.",16
27,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The leader of the Opposition has declared himself to be in favour of a White Australia policy.,16
28,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We are all in I am favour of the policy.,16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,And he has done a great deal more for the policy than has the honourable member who is speaking.,16
30,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We hear from members of the Opposition that they are in favour of a good many principles, but so soon as we try in a Bill to give effect to a principle in which they say they believe, they do all they can to wreck it. I do not wish, however, to be drawn, off the track. We have b^een told that the Japanese Government have no desire that their citizens shal.l immigrate in any numbers to re Australia. But what are the facts? The it is deputy leader of the Opposition referred to what had taken olace in F i i i in regard to the Hindoos, and I should like to point be out what has happened in Hawaii so fnr I as the Japanese are concerned. In 1894, to be a there were 24,000 Japanese in Hawaii, and in 1897, their number had increased They have driven out the natives, Chinese, and the Americans in the same way that the Hindoos are driving Japanese out the natives and Britishers from F i j i . Therefore, it is useless to say that the of Japanese do not wish to emigrate. I am xious in a position to adduce strong evidence this point by quoting from a pamphlet issued by the late Mr W. H . Browne, who was formerly the leader of the Party in Queensland. Mr Browne pointed out the danger of intrusting the stration with large powers such as are contemplated in this measure. He saidThat the Japanese authorities are of the opinion that the Queensland Government are favourable to Asiatic labour is shown by the following extracts from .1 letter from the Japanese Consul to the Chief Secretary, 6th November iSgg :"" From your correspondence, it appears to me that your Government is anxious to maintain a certain proportion of people of the Asiatic race in your Colony, but I am unable to learn on what basis the proportion is arrived at, or how the limit of maximum becomes known."" Mr Robert Philp was then Premier of Queensland, and negotiations went on, resulting in an agreement number of Japanese labourers and artisans in the Colony should be 3,247, ancl that the number might be kept up by fresh importations. . This of course only applied to those calling themselves "" artisans or labourers,"" and no restriction whatever was placed on those coming in uncier other designations. Now I am coming to an important point, which shows what can be done by an Administration to permit of the introduction of an increased number of immigrants. Mr Browne saidBy the earlier agreement not more than twenty-five Japanese were allowed to be brought in in  in a telegram to the Japanese Consul, said- I have no objection to the number allowed to be brought by each ship being increased to fifty. Mr Browne addedI t is just possible that there are about 80 per cent, of the people of Queensland and of Australia who have very strong objections to these numbers being increased, but this is of course of little importance. Robert Philp "" has no object i o n , "" so "" l e t them all come."" That is precisely the position that might be taken up by some future Prime Minister. If we leave it open to the^ Japanese to come here, they will undoubtedly flow in in such numbers as to become a menace to our people. Mr Browne goes on to say.:One reason given by the Japanese Consul for asking for a certain concession is as follows :"" In view of the large number of Japanese labourers returning to Japan from this colony, and of the distressed state to which the immigraticn companies (whose sole business was to supply Mr Hutchison. labourers to employers in this colony), . have been reduced since last year, in consequence the prohibition measures taken by your Government, the Japanese Government is very anto hear, as soon as possible, of your decion sion as to the proposition suggested."" In despatch after despatch, the Japanese authorities manifested an anxiety to secure Labour permission for Japanese to come into Queensland in such numbers as they might Adminidesire. Mr Browne went on to say:This appeal went direct to the heart of the Premier; the common everyday unemployed are only a nuisance. A hard-up swagman deserves no consideration, but fancy an "" immigration company "" in a "" distressed condition."" The very 'thought was terrible, and some of the concessions asked for were at once granted. ' I cannot see what inconvenience has been caused, or to whom offence has been given by the administration of the present Act. What is the position in Japan at present ? No Britisher can own a single foot of lancl in Japan, or make his home there without first obtaining the express permission of the that the Government. I do not think that outlaws are nearly so rigid as are the Japanese laws in regard to foreigners. In 1904 there were only 2,133 Britishers in Japan, and I believe that this small number is due to the restrictive legislation that is enforced against foreigners. Therefore, I do not see why we should be asked to pass legislation that would permit of an unlimited influx of Japanese into Australia. When I visited Queensland recently, I was disgusted to find that the great majority of the storekeepers were coloured aliens. Surely it cannot be said that white people are unfit in that climate to act as storekeepers. I was also very much astonished to find that certain unpatriotic individuals were leasing their land to Chinamen. Apparently they were so fond of the coloured) races that they would do everything possible to retain them, and if some of the Europeans in Northern Queensland have their own way, there will be very little hope for the white sugargrower. I am very strongly opposed to any interference with the present legislation, except in the direction of closing up the gaps. Nothing will prevent some of the Agents-General, who apparently have little sympathy with a White Australia, from making statements such as are contained in the memorandum laid on the table yesterday. I do not .trouble myself about the misrepresentations of people, who, after having done well in Australia, proceed to England, and apparently direct all their energies to maligning the country of their adoption. Nothing of that kind would induce me to amend the law in the direction of intrusting Ministers with greater powers. I cannot say that I am altogether content with the present administration of the Act, but I believe that it is giving the utmost satisfaction to the country. We know, however, that all Ministries are fallible, and that if large powers are conferred, they are always liable to abuse, especially when anuses will have the effect of favouring the wealthy, or land-owning, classes. I believe that for many year,s to come the coloured aliens who are already with us will be a great menace to the workers of Australia. The keen competition which white workers now have to meet is indicated by the statements of an Adelaide clergyman, who has had a wide experience of the sufferings of the unemployed. He says :There were scores of so-called homes in Adeish laide, where the furniture consisted of a few boxes, and where the inmates had not sumcient following. bread to eat, or enough clothing to keep them warm. He was satisfied that in many instances distress was as great as in any of the slums of London. While on the one hand there was poverty, however, there was much waste in directions. One of the leading citizens laide the other day-h e could mention his name if necessary-sai d in a ballroom- "" I don't know a Christian in Adelaide. I know I am not one, because I am not prepared to pay the price."" This gentleman confessed that there were no men in Adelaide who were willing to proceed to the full length necessary to the battles of the workers. plenty who, like honourable members of the easy as possible. Opposition, pretended to be their friends, but who were not willing to pass the lation necessary to protect them.",16
31,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There must be a very bad' lot of people in Adelaide.,18
32,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Adelaid e contains good, bad, and indifferent men, such as are state our intentions. to be found all the world over. mind, there is no justification for the posal contained in the Bill. other hand, there is every reason why we should' decline to increase the powers administration. In every measure we been satisfactory. have, where possible, laid down the prindiminution ciples upon whifch the Administration act.",18
33,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Administration can d'o nothing under this Bill without the sent of Parliament.,18
34,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Yes ; but it is so easy to reverse an Act of Parliament to reverse the administration of an Act. [211],18
35,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,In this case there could be no reversal except with the consent of Parliament.,18
36,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes ; but when it is not necessary to introduce a Bill , the consent of Parliament can be easily obtained. I have indicated what has been done in Queensland, and I do not wish to open the door for abuses of a similar character. We hear continual complaints of lax administration, and the less we leave to administration the better it will be for the country.",18
37,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, The honourable member for Hindmarsh has complained that the proposals contained in the Bill are hypocritical.,18
38,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No ; that statement was made by a member of the Opposition, who interjected. In speaking in that way honourable members are attacking the BritGovernment-whos e advice we are",18
39,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In my view, the the charge to which I have referred might dire have been levelled justly at the original other measure, which was drafted in accordance of Adewith the wishes of the British Government.",18
40,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,And also because of its public insistence that the Bill should take a particular form.,18
41,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It was drafted with a desire to make the position of the British fight Government, in relation to foreign Powers, There were and particularly with those of the East, as",18
42,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The fault did not li!elegiswith the White Australia party. Mr WATSON. No. In common with< a considerable number of other honourable members, I endeavoured to so shape the Bill that it would clearly and candidly However, another To my form was adopted; and I must admit that, proputting aside the question of policy as to On the the statement of our meaning, which, I think, should have been as candid as posof sible, the administration as a whole has There has been a of the coloured aliens ' within must the Commonwealth. After making allowance for State permits that were issued prior to our law coming into existence, and aswhich in a measure had willy-nilly to be honoured by the Federal Government-con not siderations which I should take it are a as fast-expiring quantity-w e cannot but be fairly satisfied with the administration of the Act. I should like to direct the attention of the honourable member for Hind.rnarsh to the fact that in this measure there .are rjuite a number of provisions that would the of material advantage in the administration of the main principle, from a White Australia stand-point. While the honourable member appears to think that the whole Bill consists of a proposal to placate the feelings of the Japanese, as .a ter of fact there are provisions in it which will close up a number of loop-holes and increase the possibility of effective tration. From that stand-point, therefore, 1 think the honourable member should hesitate before dubbing the Bill a. sham. When we come to the main features-out side of the corrections to which I have referred-ther e are, it seems to me, two points involved. One is that the form of the dictation test is to be varied, by making it possible to omit insistence upon a European language.",18
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Is not that a sham, inasmuch as the immigrant can still be tested in an European language?",19
44,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is a proposition Imperial Government which the honourable member calls a sham.,19
45,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am inclined to that such a provision will not be taken advantage of very frequently. I do not imagine that any Government that we are likely to have in Australia for will omit an examination in an European language, and insist upon an examination in an Oriental language. I hope, for own part, that the feeling of Parliament will always be - evinced against any suggestion..",19
46,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does not that show that this Bill is really a sham?,19
47,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member amendmentprescribing appears to overlook the fact that there is gulation more in this Bill than that one particular before both Houses of the provision.' If he wishes to insist dictation test is a sham, there is no reason tion has been proposed in eithertime why he should apply the term to the whole Bill. For myself, I admit that I have sympathy with this method of approachplaced ing the question. I expressed that opinion long ago in this Chamber, when the subject was first brought under consideration; test, - and I have not altered it in the slightest sary degree. But I do not see posal, especially with the safeguard that tralia policy run any.ofgreater '-he Prime Minister has put forward since, this new proposal than we haverisk is likely to make the provision one whit worse, so far as concerns the admission coloured aliens. Under the principal Act, at the present time, a Minister sympathetic towards the admission of coloured aliens could practically allow in as manv as he liked.",19
48,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That should have been stopped under this Bill.,19
49,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member is, getting away from the point to which I mat- am trying to get back-that this Bill puts us in no worse position than does the original Act, so far as concerns the admission adminisof coloured aliens. The whole principle underlying the Immigration Restriction Act is dependent upon stringent administration. The principle of the education test is, I think, wrong; but I say emphatically that this Bill puts us in no worse position than the original Act did; because under the principal Act you have to depend upon the bona fides of, or upon the strong attitude that is assumedby, the administrator. If the administrator today cared to do so, he could allow the examination of Japanese to take place in the English language, ancl there is a very large proportion of the Japof the anese who, according to what we read, could pass such an examination. If that be so, it is evident that a sympathetic administrator could facilitate the admission think of thousands of coloured aliens.",19
50,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"When we are altering the original Act, why not stop that sort of some time thing by amending it properly?",19
51,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know that the House is prepared to reverse the whole my policy that has been in operation; and I do not think that at this stage of the sessuch sion it is worth our while to enter upon such a consideration. I must say, speaking for myself, that with the safeguard which the Prime Minister has introduced-i m the suggested-unde r which no re have any force until any language will it has been laid Parliament for that the thirty days, or, if within that a moHouse of the Parliament, until the motion has been no disposed of - I think that it is clearly within the power of Parliament to consider any alteration of the prescribed and that, therefore, everything neceshas been provided for. With that that this prothat those init favour reservation, does not seem to me the White Ausbeen under runof ning for the last three or four years. In view of those considerations, therefore, I do not think that it is necessary to take any steps to secure the rejection of the measure. I trust that the Prime Minister will agree to apply to clause 6 a provision similar to that' 'of which - he has given notice in respect of clause 3-that is, to insure that '-Parliament shall be consulted in some form or other before any binding arrangement is entered into with the Government of any country with respect to the admission of its subjects.",19
52,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I have no objection to that.,20
53,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think the position would be fairly met if such an amendment were made. With respect to the principle involved in it, I may say that we are already working under an arrangement with the Japanese Government, so far as regards tourists aind business visitors from their country to this.",20
54,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No one surely jects to tourists coming to Australia.,20
55,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Honourable members will see that, in the absence of some arrangement of that sort, every Japanese coming to Australia, whether he was a tourist or a commercial man, would be compelled to go through the examination test. I do not think that any one desires to see that'. Therefore, when, on coming into office, I found that such an arrangement had practically been entered into, though not finally completed, I was very glad to bring it to its completion, and have the matter amicably fixed up with the Government of Japan.",20
56,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Eve n under that arrangement, of course, lax administration could do a lot of harm.",20
57,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Quite so. that it has to be very carefully watched to see that ostensible tourists, people whose intention really is to settle here, are not admitted. We require careful administration, even of an arrangement of that character; but. we were compelled to take the responsibility of making such an arrangement, because there was no provision for the purpose under the law, by which Parliament would, ordinarily speaking, require to be consulted before any coloured alien could be admitted. Clause 6, with the addendum I have suggested, will bring any such arrangement within the purview of Parliament, which might, if it thought necessary, take action in regard to it . That being so, I do not [21 r]- 2 see any strong objections to passing the Bill.",20
58,Mr MCCOLL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," When the honourable member for Hindmarsh saysthat there is no justification for a measure like this, he surely must be somewhat oblivious of events that have taken place during the last two or three years, and of the relationships now existing between the British Empire arid Japan. Those relationships, cordial as they were previously, have become still more cordial and intimate recently. The honourable member for Bland himself admitted that when he took office, and had laid! upon him the bur1 den of administering the Immigration Restriction Aet, he found it desirable that certain changes should be made in the administration of the law; and lie, therefore, very wisely made such arrangements as would meet the susceptibilities of the great Eastern Nation, obthat has come so quickly to the front. I do not think that any one would blame him for doing so. This Bill, I take it, is another attempF in the same direction. While it does not alter the principal Act in any important respect, it enables the administration to be so varied as to meet the views of the Japanese Government. In that it is to be commended. I think that the alliance entered into some time agobetween Great Britain and Japan was hailed with very great delight throughout all Anglo-Saxon countries, and in noplace more than in Australia. We must remember that we are but a few people here, and that. we have gained a"" very strong, powerful ally in the East. The alliance makes the position of Australia as regards the danger of invasion absolutely safe. Therefore, if we can meet the feelings I admit of the Japanese in any way. it is our duty to do soThe honourable member for Hindmarsh is quite correct in what he has saic! as to the influx of Japanese to America. They are flocking into the United States, into Hawaii, and into FijiDuring the coming session of Congress in America, the most vital question that will have to be discussed will be this influx of foreigners, and more especially of Japanese. Throughout the west coast of the United States there is a very strong feeling amongst the people that something should be done to put a. stop to it. There are prohibition laws in the United States, but I was told that nevertheless the Japanese come there in great numbers. They ' Immigration [REPRESENTATIVES.] - are met in the bay by agents from the - shore, when the ship anchors, and these supply them with a certain amount of money; and when the immigration agent goes round and inspects them to lind out what tlieir means of subsistence are, they have this cash in hand ready to show him that they are amply provided for. But that money is returned to the Japanese banks when the immigrants go ashore. If it came to a question of having to choose 'between Chinese^and Japanese immigrants my experiencs shows me that the Chinese would be the better class. The Chinese keep the law; they are peaceful; they are good workers, and they conduct their industries in a lawful manner. So far as I could gather in America, the Japanese are very acute, very quick, very apt to learn, and very ready to take any advantage they possibly can. They will, engage to labour and to carry on their work, say, in an orchard, but at a critical time they will stay away and leave the owner without means of getting in his crops. A gentleman in America said to me. "" If you have a Japanese working for vou, in ten vears time he will have the orchard ancl you will be out."" With regard to the measure before us;,, I think we can support it. We are not justified in doubting the Administration ; for no Government holding office in this Commonwealth will be likely to administer a measure like this otherwise than honestly and fairly. I think we ought to pass the Bill, which I regard as a satisfactory proposal.",20
59,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," At this stage of the session, I cannot grow very enthusiastic over the proposal of the Government to amend the Immigration Restriction Act, which, to my mind, has worked very satisfactorily. I am quite prepared to admit that in that Statute full effect was not given to the wishes of the Australian people, as voiced through the constitutional medium of the ballot-box. Irrespective of whether or not a sufficient justification existed for this Parliament adopting a roundabout course to secure the exclusion of Asiatics from this country, I certainly hold that we have no warrant from the people for altering our present legislation. That this Bill, will interfere with the administration of the original Act is undoubted. In my opinion, it has been introduced to placate that very smalil section of the community, to whom the honourable member for Hindmarsh has justly referred as the ""stinking fish"" party. Restriction Bill. What has induced the Government to'take this step ? Because there are a few ""squealers"" in the community, I do not think that it is wise to interfere with legislation which has been approved by the vast majority of the people. It seems to me that .the. one desire of those who are favourable to the proposed amendment of the law is that we should avoid giving offence to what is termed "" the great rising Eastern nation,"" Japan. The timidity of some Australians - at the prospect of the Japanese adopting a hostile attitude towards us is extraordinary.",21
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is exactly what the Russians thought. U i . FRAZER - And I believe thatwith peace at home it is exactly what they would have proved. My experience of the Japanese in Australia is not one which would induce me to offer them increased facilities for admission to our territory. I have travelled over most of. the States, ancl my observation leads me to believe that they are chiefly occupied in. this country in maintaining or living upon women of doubtful virtue, or in conducting laundries. Holding that opinion, I view with feelings of extreme doubt the proposal of the Prime Minister to omit the word ""European "" in paragraph a of section 3, with a view to substitute the word "" prescribed."" I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that in matters of this kind, the more wet can make the desires of the people clear in our Statutes, nnd the less we leave to the Administration of the day, the better. I cannot grow enthusiastic over the prospect of an officer of the Customs, or of some other Department, meeting an army of foreigners at our wharfs, and prescribing for them a dictation test of fifty words in their own particular language, as he will be able to do uncier this Bill . The Prime Minister has circulated an amendment whifch considerably clouds the position; indeed, the chief object of some of the suggestions offered during the past few days apparently, has been to obscure the issue in a perfect maze of language. The original Act sets forth our intentions in aa clear and concise a manner as they can possitoly be presented, and I fail to see any necessity for altering it . Although I am not keen, on opposing the second reading of Dhe Bill . I sha'.'l do my best to amend it in Committee. In another measure, the Government propose to eliminate the contract labour provision which is embodied - in the principal Act. I do not think - it is competent"" for me to discuss out thai matter at the present -.but I know of no protest from the Aus .tralian people which would justify me in altering the decision of Parliament in direction. The law has been badly. .ministered ever since it was placed the statute-book. Immigrants have - coming to Australia under contract",21
61,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I mus,t ask the honorquired able member not to debate that question.",22

63,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," My - objection to this Bill is very largely (fined to its educational clause. It seeks .accomplish, in an absolutely hypocritical - manner, that which the Government should - do openly and straightforwardly.",22
64,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We adopt this course in - deference to the' wishes of the Imperial amendments ' ' ? .authorities.,22
65,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am dealing with 'the proposal which is now before us.,22
66,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There are international relations involved. Should we pay no rspect to them ? Is that what the honourable - member means?,22
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member for Bland has, stated that this meatest - sure is a harmless one, which will practithe cally have no effect. Personally, I have always contended that the educational - prescribed in our Immigration Restriction Act is a hypocritical method of giving effect to the decision of Parliament. Only the - other day I saw that an immigrant to we should at least do so honestly. Western Australia had been subjected to - dictation test which had reference to the properties of radium. I have no hesitation in saying that if that test were applied, the members of this House, 75 per cent, of them would fail to pass it. It was 'tinctly a "" c at c h "" tes.t. It related properties of radium, an entirely new eler ment, of which comparatively little is tknown. Very few men indeed would care cluding them. to sit down in their own offices, and-write from dictation the sentence which, was. time, prescribed in the case to which I . refer. Either the existing Act requires amendment so far as the educational test is. concerned, that or it does not. The amendment proposed adby. the Government will reduce the whole upon legislation of the Commonwealth to an been absolute farce. The original Act provides that coloured immigrants shall be reto write from dictation fift y words in a European language. Under the proof the Prime Minister, the word "" European "" will be excised, and the. word There will then be nothing to prevent a Minister fro m law subjecting an immigrant to a test in a assist in estabEuropean language.",22
68,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Bill makes the whole matter one of administration.,22
69,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Subjec t to the approval,22
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I should like, to .emphasize the objection' of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that the practice of conthe Government introducing Bills, and then to flooding the House with amendments upon them, is very seriously to be deprecated.",22
71,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Does the honourable member call our one amendment in connection with this measure "" flooding the House with",22
72,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am referring ' to other measures in addition to that which is now under consideration. The House has been flooded with amendments after reamendments upon Bills which have been presented by the Government. This measure provides that until some particular language has been prescribed, the dictation shall be in the language authorized by existing Act. That will give the Minister power to prescribe a test either in an test Asiatic or a European language. I have always been strenuously opposed to the flooding of Australia with alien races; but I say that if Ave wish to exclude those races If a this Bill is designed to placate the Japanese, I maintain that we sjiall incur very much greater risk of giving them offence if to we allow them to come to Australia in the belief that they will be subjected to a test disin their own language, to find upon their to the arrival that they are required to undergo an examination in Portuguese, Spanish, or Greek, than we should do by directly ex",22
73,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The position is exactly the opposite to that.,23
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then what is the object of the Bill? I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that under it a Government' which was hostile to the policy of a White Australia could open the whole of our territory to alien races, or vice versa.",23
75,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,So they could under the principal Act.,23
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I doubt whether they could. Under that Statute the test prescribed must be in a European lan-' guage, and I believe that 90 per cent, of Asiatic immigrants would fail to - pass such tests as are now given. Under the present proposal, it is left to the Government to prescribe what language they choose. Let us be honest, whatever we do. If the Bil l is intended to restrict the Act we have passed, dealing with the influx of alien races, let the Government be honest enough to say so. as the honourable member for Bland has assured the honourable member for Hindmarsh, it is quite safe to pass the measure, because it will not have the effect of lessening the power of the existing Act. but will have a more stringent effect in covering up the deficiencies of the present measure, let us say in plain language that that is its intention. To pretend to do that which we have no intention to do is calculated to bring the Government into more disrepute 'than all the critics-tha n all the "" stinking-fish party """,23
77,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,To which the honourable member belongs.,23
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I challenge the Prime Minister to say that I have ever used one word in depreciation of Australia. A gentleman occupying the position of Prime Minister should be careful as to the statements he makes.,23

I doby not know whether that statement is true, but: an interesting article on the subject appears, in the Athenaeum of the 19th August last. The Athenaum is not a paper which writes The hysterically on any subject. It is the leading literary journal of England, and perthe haps one of the leading literary newspapers in the world. In a review of two booksBushido, the Soul of fa-pan, by I . Nitobe. for and Young Japan, by James A-. B.

It points history of old Japan, more or less authentic, from the sixth to the seventeenth century, is a mere welter of blood; that "" Bushido,"" which is a Chinese word adopter! by the Japanese, means the "" way of the executioner,'' and that the castes who were designated by that term wereThe executers of the will of irresponsible petty princes or their councils, they were the instruments of oppression and themselves the victims of a pedantic and absolutely merciless ceremonialism. It goes on to quote from Mr Scherer's work as to the general character of the Japanese, and points out thatHe admits to the full , as every one must, "" the five noble qualities of Japanese character : bravery, loyalty, alertness, thoroughness, and self-control."" At the same time, it states that he goes on to say thatThe two cancers at the core of the Japanese chaiacter are deep-set dishonesty and abandoned impurity; either would be sumcient to wrecK the life of any nation. I am not adopting that language. I am merely pointing out that this criticism is approved apparently by a leading English literary weekly. Something a little in the same direction, although far more generous, written by a bishop, appeared recently in the Times, but in justice to the Japanese, it must be said that the Times' pointed out that so far as allegations of dishonesty were concerned, there was not one case of dishonesty against the Japanese in connection with the subscriptions to the E n ' cyclopaedia Britannica. incurred in connection with the Times edition were met by the Japanese in a way which was exceptional, when compared with the honesty of the British people themselves. I believe it was stated that in only one case was a subscription delayed, and that in no case was a subscription not eventually paid. Even those who had to go to 'the war made provision out of the small temuneration they were receiving to meet the honourable obligations they had incurred. I make this statement in justice to the Japanese, because I have quoted from an article which seems to take a strong and probably an exaggerated view sn the other direction.",26
130,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It judge them. It is only fifty Mr Glynn. they emerged from a state of semi-barbarity.,27
131,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No. doubt; but thisout that the criticism is based upon the description of the character of the Japanese peopfe by the writers to whom. I have referred. We must not judge them, on the sudden spurt which they have madeduring the last fifty-live years in copying. Western civilization.' It is probable that, the Chinese are a better race, but I do not wish to offer an opinion on that point. I am pleased with the alliance that has been. entered into. There is no doubt that rbeJapanese have reversed the opinions entertained prior to the war by Western nations, as to their probable prowess, and have established by their self-denying character, their splendid attachment to the ideals of their country, the marvellous ingenuity with? which their forces were marshalled by their generals, and the discipline and' dash of the men, a position which entitles them to the respect of all the other civilized' races of the world. As I have said, under the circumstances, we are getting something, from the Bil l that is not, like the earlier clauses, merely a profession, in that we may have a treaty arranged which maybe acceptable to Japan, and may accomplish the objects we have in view. Personally, I do not believe that there is; very much danger of any considerable immigration of those races. We must beprepared to meet the possibility of such an immigration, but, at the same time, I think we need not fear it. Some. articles haveappeared in the press of Japan, intimatingthat there might be such' an immigration of Japanese to Australia, and that JapaneseThe obligations warships might be used for the purpose.",27
132,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The fact that there has been an increase of many thousands in Hawaii does not show that there is nodanger.,27
133,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There is an open door ih the Sandwich Islands.,27
134,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not intend to deal"" with the other races concerned. I acknowledge the necessity of providing against thepossibility of any considerable increase of"" this kind of immigration, but when I say that we need not be in a blue funk about the matter, really I am remembering the actual statistics dealing with the immigration of these races during the fast fifty or sixtyyears. There was a Chinese scare got upis too early to here in 1888 by a Conference of Premiers? years since that sat in Sydney, but, as a matter of fact,. while there were 42,000 Chinese in Vict o r i a alone in that year, there were only -43,000 Chinese in the whole of the Common- wealth in 1888. The numbers had shrunk - intermittently, no doubt there being some1 times an increase, and sometimes a de- crease, but the balance showed a very considerable shrinkage in 1888. t named The Afghan, came out here carrying 250 Chinese; so big a shipment led to the 'impression that the Chinese were going to - .come in hordes to Australia. However, that .shipment was stopped, and that led to the 'well-known case of Ah Toy v. Musgrove. In 1888 the numbers were gradually de-' - dining.",27
135,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They are declining now.,28
136,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know the rate - of decline, but from 1888 to 1895 the immigration and emigration statistics of New . South Wales, at all events, showed a decline in the number of Chinese. I admit that we : must be cautious,, and in the circumstances I ' am prepared to support some reasonable - principle of restriction.",28
137,Mr MCLEAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," We are all .agreed that we should not do anything in ithis Bill to alter the policv of a White Australia, which we have already adopted. I do not think any such intention is indicated in the Bill . Of course, we know that the efficacy of a language test to exclude undesirable immigrants depends almost entirely on its administration. That - that is so under the present form, or any - proposed form, must, I think, be self-evident. As I have been compelled recently - to say some hard things regarding the proposals of the Government. I feel very pleased that on this occasion I am able to - congratulate them on the introduction of this Bill.",28
138,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is why - suspicious of it.,28
139,Mr MCLEAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The measure proposes to do in a less objectionable way what is - done under the existing Act, or, in other words, it proposes to do by treaty - that which is done now in a way which almost necessarily offends the susceptibilities oc a great nation that is our next-door - neighbour. I see no danger in this Bill of - any serious departure from the policy al- ready affirmed, because any treaty which - we enter into with the Japanese or with any NOther nation regulating the intercourse between them and ourselves must be laid be'fore Parliament before it can be acted - upon. I think that Parliament, representing public opinion throughout Australia, may be trusted to do nothing that will in any way endanger the policy of a White Australia that we have already agreed to. To that extent, therefore, the Bill is a very desirable one. With regard to the difference between a European or a preA vessel, scribed language, it is more apparent than real. The obvious intention of the language test was to prescribe such^a test, as would exclude undesirable immigrants. That, I presume, will be done as effecttively under the proposed amendment as it has been done under the existing arrangement. In common with other honourable members, I feel that it would be much more in conformity with our own desires if we could pass a Bill which would express straight out what we really mean, but we must remember that if , without departing in any way from our original intention to maintain a White Australia, we can meet the desires of another country, it is reasonable that we should do so."" We should not forget that the Empire has about 300,000,000 of coloured subjects, and an Act of Parliament passed by a portion of the Empire, expressly excluding those subjects on account of their complexion, must necessarily be offensive to those people. It was pointed out by the Imperial Government that, whilst they in no way desired to interfere with our right to exclude undesirable immigrants, we might do exactly what we proposed to do in a less offensive way. That was the reason which induced the Government of the day, in deference to the susceptibilities of the mother country, to adopt the language test, instead of the straight-out colour line, which would have been much more agreeable to ourselves. In these respects, I think the Government do not intend to depart in any way from the prewe are sent policy of a White Australia, but desire to carry out that policy in a way less offensive to the susceptibilities of other nations. It is only reasonable that we should do what we can, without endangering our policy in any way, to meet the desires of the mother country. It appears to me that that is the intention of this Bill , and though I may not agree with allits details, with the main object in view, I am in hearty sympathy and accord.",28
140,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," Listen ing to some of the speeches delivered this morning, one would think that the Immigration Restriction Act was passed with a view especially to keep out the Japanese. We know that that Act was passed for the purpose of keeping out undesirable immigrants, no matter to what nation they belonged, or from what country they came. When we were passing the measure we were asked by the British Government fo adopt the language test in order that it might be said that we were not proposing to treat any nation differently from the way in which we proposed to treat our own. I venture to assert that if the Japanese had not come out victorious from their recent war with Russia we should not have heard all this clamour for an.amendment of our law.",28
141,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We had commenced this before the war.,29
142,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I point out that the proposed amendment means either that we are prepared to let the Japanese come into Australia, or that we think they are a very simple people. Certainly if we contend that they will be pleased by an alteration to words which mean exactly the same thing, the suggestion is that we think them very foolish people indeed. During the controversy which was raised in connection with this legislation, we were informed by Japanese Consuls, and others having authority to speak for the Japanese people, that there was never a danger of any consideraBle incursion of Japanese into Australia; but, while those statements were made, we have now the statement made by an honourable member of this House, who has recently made a trip to America, that thousands of Japanese are at present endeavouring to get into that country. If that be so, and if the statement made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as to the increase in the number of Japanese in Hawaii be correct, the contention that the Japanese had an ample field for the occupation of thousands of emigrants in the new territories over which they had obtained control must fall to the ground. I desire to say a word or two with respect to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act in the past. We have heard it stated that it has been administered as the people of Australia desired,-but I can prove that prohibited immigrants are finding their way into the Commonwealth, and that, when, they are not kept on board ship, and are allowed to land, they are being kept by the States Governments until the ship leaves the port at which she has called. There is nothing in the Bill now before us which, so far as I can discern, will alter that state of affairs'. If it is to> be passed as it stands, I believe that shipmasters coming here with prohibited i m migrants will be able to evade its provisions whenever they choose. One case which, amongst others, I could recite to< show how easily this can be done, is that of a Chinaman who was allowed toleave a vessel. He was practically. "" crimped "" ashore, and the course usually adopted was followed in that case. Theshipmaster immediately offered a reward of*. £ 5 for the man's apprehension. As he was not apprehended, the ship master, before leaving the port with his ship, had todeposit £ 1 0 0 with the Customs authorities.. As he left the port without the prohibited' immigrant, the agents of the vessel weresummoned, and fined £ 1 0 . They immediately afterwards secured the refund of"" the ^ 1 0 0 deposit, and. the £ 5 put up as a reward for the apprehension of the prohibited immigrant, with the result that this; Chinaman was landed in Australia at acost to the agents of the vessel of £ 1 0 ; and, as it was afterwards established that they owed the Chinaman £ 2 3 in wages,, they made £ 1 5 out of the transaction.",29
143,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable memberwill find that that is met in this Bill.,29
144,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I find that the Bill' contains a clause imposing a fine of £ TOO on any ship master who allows a prohibited immigrant to land contrary to the provisions of the Bill, but the provision whichexempts the masters and crews of vesselsremains unaltered, and the new provisionis effective only where the ship master allows a prohibited immigrantto land.",29
145,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Unde r the Bill , the captain who, under any circumstances, whetherwilfully or not, lands a prohibited immi-grant, is liable to a fine. The honourable member very properly called my attention to the flaw in the Act, and I think that we shall succeed in remedying it.",29
146,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I wish to make certain that the Act does not require furtheralteration to put a stop to the practices to which I have referred. In any case, I doubt whether the imposition of a. fine of "" £ 1 0 0 will pTace us in a better position thanthe States were in under their laws.",29
147,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The New South Waleslaw imposed a penalty of £100.,29
148,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"E v e n if a fine of y^roo had been exacted in the case which I have just mentioned, the Chinamanwould practically have been permitted toenter the Commonwealth at a cost of only jQTS to the owners of the vessel by which he came. Possibly he may have stayed here against his own wish, because it is a common thing, when a ship arrives in port with a big wages bill to pay, for those interested to try to get the sailors to desert, in order to effect a saving. Where it can be proved that foreign sailors who are prohibited immigrants have been allowed to land by the connivance of the shipowners, or captain, or any person on shore, a line of ,£100 is inadequate. Then, too, it sometimes happens, when a captain has among his crew prohibited immigrants, and the ship is remaining in port for any length of time, that he will allow them to go ashore, and then cause them to be arrested for desertion, when they are' taken before a magistrate and sent to gaol, being kept there at the expense of the Government of the State until the ship is ready to proceed to sea, when they are put on board again. That sort of thing frequently happens in nearly every port of Australia. Does the Prime Minister think it fair that the Governments of the States should have to bear the expense of keeping such men during the stay of the vessel in port, which, in places like Newcastle, Is sometimes as long as two or three months? Why should not the interests of the foreign sailors themselves be studied? The ship's officers should not be allowed to get rid of the responsibility of looking after the men on board, and should be prevented from practically causing them to become criminals in the way I have described. I view any proposed amendment of the Aliens Restriction Act with concern, and in Committee shall watch very carefully to see that the measure is not made less stringent, while I shall also endeavour to have remedied certain defects in it, so that it may be perfected as an instrument for maintaining the policy in which every member of this Parliament has affirmed his belief - that of a White Australia.",29
149,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The honourable member for Hindmarsh suggested that the trouble to which reference has been made has probably been due to the faulty administration of the Aliens Restriction Act, and he said that if the present leader of the Opposition were returned to power after the next general elections, there would be reason to fear that the Act would be administered in such a way as to permit of the wholesale immigration of undesirable persons. I do not think that the honourable member had any justification for that statement, and, in my opinion, it will be better to discuss the amending Bill without making such suggestions, giving all honourable members credit for the best of motives, whatever their position in regard to it may be. The honourable the leader of the Opposition has frequently expressed his belief in the principle of a. White Australia, and he has certainly shown himself to be a fair - and prudent administrator of the laws. I believe in maintaining the racial purity of the people of Australia, and I do not think that there is much difference of opinion amq'ngst honourable members as to the desirability of doing so. But it is desirable to avoid unnecessarily irritating the nations whose subjects we exclude by our legislation^ and the Bill seems to me to be an attempt to do that. While it does not surrender our right to preserve Australia for a white race, it makes the provisions of the law less objectionable to those it seeks to exclude. The Government are to be commended for altering our legislation so that it will be less distasteful to the Japanese nation, with which, as part of the British Empire, we are in close alliance. The fear has been expressed that the Bill will open the door to the wholesale immigration of Asiatics into Australia. I do not think that the proposals before the House give any cause for alarm in that connection other than existed previously. As a matter of fact, we have the assurance of her Government that it is not the desire of Japan to use Australia as a dumping ground for her surplus population.",30
150,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No r is it the desire of any country to use its population in that way.,30
151,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Not necessarily. We know that in some countries the population gets so overcrowded that it becomes very necessary for the Government to lookout for desirable fields of colonization, and this is no less the case with Japan than with other nations.",30
152,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Does the honourable member describe such people as "" surplus population ""?",30
153,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the honourable member had been paying attention he would not have asked such a. silly question. We in Australia have nothing to fear in that connection, because, as the result of the recent war with Russia, Japan has acquired Korea, which will afford ample room for many years to come for the settlement of any surplus population which the former country may have. I only mention that fact because it gives point to the declaration, of the Japanese officials that they have no desire to use Australia as a colonizing ground for their surplus population.",30
154,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What are the millions who are in Korea today going to do?,31
155,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It has not anything like so large a population as Japan. The honourable member has only to refer to the statistics of population in the two countries to realise that in Korea there is ample room yet for the settlement of a very large 1 additional population.,31
156,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is very thickly populated.,31
157,Mr JOHNSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"So long as Japan has a neighbouring territory which can be utilized, and which offers peculiar advantages for the settlement of her surplus population, I do not think-that we have anything to fear in that connection for many years to come. I do not say that a few years ago there was not a possibility, if not a probability, of Japan looking to Australia, especially to the Northern Territory, as a possible colonizing field for her surplus population. But I submit that the result of the RussoJapanese war has changed the aspect of matters in that regard. The only reason underlying the objection of the Japanese people has been set forth very plainly. They object, not so much to Japanese being kept out of the Commonwealth, as to the attempt to class them with nations which they regard as inferior to themselves. They ask that the immigration to Australia shall be regulated in another way-by a friendly treaty between the two Governments-and this seems to me a reasonable proposition. So far as I can understand, they do not desire that the Commonwealth shall abate one jot of its right to exclude those whom it may consider undesirable immigrants. They only desire that they shall be treated with ordinary courtesv, and recognised as an ally with Great Britain, and that the immigration to the Commonwealth shall be regulated by a method less offensive. It seems to me that in trying to meet their objection, the Government is doing right, and to the extent to which it is endeavouring to meet the difficultv in a way which will not give rise to friction, or continue the friction which has been created, it certainly is deserving of support by every well-wisher of Australia.",31
158,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Darwin) When I see how earnestly the members of the Opposition are welcoming this Bill , I , as a democrat, am satisfied that it is dangerous for the well-being of the Commonwealth. I may be mistaken, but that is my feeling. I am afraid of my judgment, when I see the enthusiasm with which my honourable friends opposite are welcoming the Bill.",31
159,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member's judgment is hinged on that of other men. Mr KING O'MALLEY - My judgment, like that of every other intelligent man, is liable to enlargement, according to the progress of the age. My view is endorsed by the greatest national daily organ in the Southern Hemisphere-a n organ which is often wrong in its democracy, but generally right in its nationality-whic h says that the Prime Minister ought not to have attempted to alter a law, which, in every way, met the situation, and which is not half so stringent as the law of the United States or Canada, or any other civilised nation. We' embodied in that law the recommendations of the British Government, and the Prime Minister was Attorney General in the Barton Ministry when it was placed upon the statute-book. But now, because of the cry of the opponents of the White Australia policy-becaus e of. the cry of what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has described as the "" stinking fish "" party-ou r democratic Government brings in this Bill , I believe conscientiously, before the Parliament for its consideration. I have heard honourable members say that the Japanese, would not come to Australia, that the Emperor, Ministry, and Parliament of Japan are not in favour of Japanese coming here. When the Japanese begin to emigrate, when they have money enough to leave their own country, they do not ask their Emperor where they will go, any more than Australians would try to find out from the Prime Minister where they should go. The Japanese will go wherever they can do best for themselves. I notice by American newspapers that their correspondents, without any ill-feeling, say that wherever they travel in Japan. Korea, or Manchuria, the one great idea of the people i's to get enough money to enable them either to get into the United States if they can, or to go to Australia, in order to make a "" b it , "" and return to live like big men on a small amount. According to one the American correspondents, a man with a couple of thousand pounds is regarded a financial Emperor in Japan. If that is - and we know that it is-wh y should'we make it possible for our Immigration Retions striction Act to be administered by a ister according to his idea of the people ought to come into Australia ?",31
160,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We shall have to get the consent of both Houses of this Parliament.,32
161,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I can quite see how genuine the Prime Minister is in submitting this Bill , and I wish I could look at the matter as he does.",32
162,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I shall satisfy the able member as soon, as we get into mittee. Mr . KINGO ' MALLEY - I know my honoured leader is also of the sampbring opinion. I differ from the honourable memone ber for Bland and the Prime Minister, I desire to divide the House on the motion for the second reading of the Bill.",32
163,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Would it not be better the honourable member to wait until the reaches the Committee stage, so that he vote for those provisions of which he proves ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Perhaps , that would be the better course to take. For and years the people of New York and the worse. other States on the Atlantic coast could not be prevailed upon to join in a movement for the exclusion of Chinese When a number of Congressmen of the Eastern States visited San Francisco, they were dropped down in the mids.t China town, and were lost there for night. What they saw there brought to them a full realization of the terrible crime they were committing, and the utter - degradation to which they were exposing the whites, by introducing people of Oriental races who were entirely unfamiliar with the conditions of life among Euroout, peans. I do not say that Orientals inferior to Europeans- I am not speaking from that stand-point; but I contend that they cannot be assimilated with white lations. The poll-tax imposed by United States proved utterly inadequate exclude Chinamen from that country. The six big companies of California not only paid to ship captains the 500 dols. deposit required by the Customs officials, but bribed them to allow Chinamen to get away from their ships.",32
164,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Not one in 50,000 could of afford to pay a poll-tax of J£IOO. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That was aras ranged for by the big companies which were true making money out of the introduction of Chinese into the States. Similar combinawould operate here in the same way. MinAbraham Lincoln once said that you could who fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. So - it is in connection with this measure. The public will not be fooled into the belief that Chinamen will be kept out whilst it is possible to bribe ship captains and others to bring them in here. It was reported recently honorthat Chinamen were stowed away in the Comcoal bunkers of a vessel which recently arrived at F remantle, and there is no doubt that that ship captains are being bribed to coloured aliens to Australia. Every in this country who is not a millionaire and is endeavouring to become one as soon as possible, and many people are not particular as to the means which they employ to that end. Is it to be supposed that men for who are anxious to become rich will be Bill proof against the inducements which could may be offered to them under a measure of this apkind to introduce Asiatics into Australia? Bad as the Chinese are in America, in that they drive white workers out of certain emyears ployments, the Japanese are infinitely",32
165,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is because from America. they are better men.,32
166,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"An agitation for the exclusion of Japanese from the of United States is now proceeding. This the is not attributable to any ill-feeling home towards the Japanese, but is due to the f a ; t that wherever they settle the white man has to go. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, a large settlement which was previously occupied by whites has been absorbed by the Japanese, who have bought or driven out, the former occupants. are The Japanese now own a large number of the orchards of California. They do not spend a single dollar in the country; they popuimport everything they want from Japan, the and send their money to that country. That to might be very good for Japan, but it would not be of benefit to a country like Australia, If the Japanese settled in Australia in anv numbers, whether in the Northern Terrialso tory or elsewhere, they would gradual I v acquire vested interests, and, if we attempted to regulate them, would appeal to their V Boers temtor). iNovv, subjects, £ has^oe slavery, ^ y , ^ .country should have been settled D people, who^ would. h a v ^ * SS . . . g 0 ° t have c S would nave CcUU nation had ever become m ohed cannot understand how an) oneca t 0 make the < ^ ^ * J ^ y*\a«half black, or h a W j W j No nation couldprosper u tions.

167,Mr MCDONA LD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I regret very much that this Bill has been introGovernment duced, especially as we are so near to close of the session. In view of the discussion which took place in 1901, when the original Immigration Restriction Act was introduced, I can only regard the measure from beginning to end as practically a piece, complish. of hypocrisy. I have always regretted that one of the most vital matters of policy affecting the future of Australia should be based on hypocrisy. I am not blammatta ing the Government for that any more than. I blame those who voted for the section imposing the education test. But it struck me that, though we intended to impose law to keep out Asiatics, we had not the moral courage to) say exadtly what we provisions been properly administered. meant. I remember hearing the right orable member for East Sydney taunt then Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, with being so docile and meek that he was practically under the thumb of Mr Chamaccordance berlain. He alleged that whatever the - Colonic 1 Secretary desired, Sir Edmund Barton was prepared to say, "" Yes, Mr. Chamberlain."" Indeed, a considerable portion of the debate turned that we were not in a position to legislate upon this subject as we might desire, but had to acceDt a certain amount of dictation left? from the Imperial Government. I wish to know whether we are in the same posilatest tion now, and whether we are still prenewspapers pared to accept dictation from the Imperial Government. This may be but a small matter, and some honourable members may regard it as a means of coming into line lation. with the necessities of British politics. no matter how trifling it mav appear for simply enormous. the moment to be. it may ultimatelv turn out to be a very important matter of nrinciple. We ought at all times to guard our rights, and shoulder our responsibilities, connection with any legislation that i:as. Are we not aware that the Japanese have known all along that our intention into issue them. imposing the education test was to keep Those them and other Asiatics out of Australia? Does any one mean to suggest that they are not sufficiently intelligent to know that, although we alter the terms of the Immigration Restriction Act, the amending measure will be so administered as still to keep them out? Under the circumstances, I claim that we ought to directly exclude coloured aliens. I believe that up to the present time, the Act has not been administered in such a way as to give effect to our original intentions. That Statute conferred upon the of the day. power to entirely the exclude these undesirable immigrants.",34

Under the Bill a as it was originally drafted, there was ample power to effect that object, had its I hondo not know how many coloured Asiatics the have been admitted to Australia under various Administrations, but I do know that if the law had been administered in with our intentions, a large then number of those who have been admitted would have been excluded. According to the latest return, the total number admittedto the Commonwealth since the Act was upon the point passed, is 7,026.",34

The return, which was published in the only yesterday, shows that more coloured aliens have been admitted to Queensland than were admitted to that State prior to the enactment of this legisThen again, the number of perBut, mits issued to Chinese entering Australia is I make bold to say that there is not a nation under heaven in which - judgin g from the number of Chinese who leave Australia-so many are able to take in trips abroad. Upon all hands it is recogwe may nised that many of these permits are frauds,, and yet the States are still allowed",34
172,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Not now'.,34
173,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am very pleased to hear that. Last year, out of the small number of Chinese in Australia - some 20,000 odd-ther e were no less than 847 who could afford to take trips abroad: That is an enormous percentage, and evidences that there must be a leakage somewhere. In additi'on, the coloured aliens admitted to the Commonwealth during the period, included 9 Cingalese, 54 Philippinos, 64 Hindoos, and 461 Japanese.",35
174,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What education test was applied to them ?,35
175,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is what I wish to know.,35
176,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"O u t of the 461 Japanese, 419 were engaged in pearling operations* They simply landed, signed on, and then went to their boats.",35
177,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Nearl y every issue of the Torres Straits Pearler contains an announcement of a reward for the apprehension of certain Japanese who have left their indentured masters. They get from the pearling vessels to the mainland, and are then at liberty fo travel throughout the States.. I would further point out that when the master of a vessel who allows coloured aliens to be introduced into Australia is hauled before the Court, he is often fined only £ 2 or ^ 3 . These undesirables are perfectly prepared to pay that amount.",35
178,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The captain may them twice that amount in wages.,35
179,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,A number of alien immigrants have secured admission in that way. Under these circumstances I think it is idle-especiall y at this late stage of the session,35
180,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is stage ?,35
181,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,T t is generally expected that the session will close next week.,35
182,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is that intimation official ?,35
183,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It is what I have been led to believe. I do not know whether it is official. I claim that this matter should have received more consideration. I am opposed to the Bill, and. accordingly, I shall vote against its second reading.",35
184,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I have no desire to delay the second reading of this measure, but I cannot give a silent vote upon it. In submitting it for our consideration, the Prime Minister gave a masterly exposition of the White Australia policy, and I do not intend to accuse him of weakening upon that policy, or of attempting to depart from it in any degree. I believe that both he and his colleagues are in close touch with Australian sentiment, and that even if they wished to do so they would not dare to act contrary to the general opinion upon this question. But I am not convinced that the Government are justified in asking the House to agree to the proposal that is embodied in clause 4 of the Bill . We have had no official intimation that either Great Britain or Japan has made any specific request for an amendment of the existing law.",35
185,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That is correct.,35
186,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"But \ h e understanding is that in some way or other are intimation has been received that the pass1 ing of a measure such as this would remove some of the causes of irritation that exist, more particularly among the officialsof the Japanese nation, with whom England has recently renewed her alliance.. That raises the important question as to how far we, in our legislation for Australia, should be affected by Imperial considerations. I shall not attempt to discuss that question at length, but merely say that I am loyal to the Empire, and recognise Australia's dependence, to some extent, on Great Britain for our defence for some time to come. I think it would not be advisable owe for a Government to ask the people to approve of legislation of this kind, not because we ourselves desire it,' but because the Colonial Office have asked us to pass it in the interests of the Empire. The people of Australia have aspirations for a national life of their own, and, while loyal to the it a late Empire, would resent any attempt at interference with our domestic or national policy. My fear is that if we pass these amendments we may open the door to similar intimations, which may be more far-reaching in their effects.",35
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have interfered with British legislation.,35
188,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What about the Transvaal resolution?,35
189,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We simply expressed an opinion, which is a very different matter from an official intimation that we desired the Imperial Parliament to pass certain legislation. I shall reserve what I have to say further, until the Committee stage is reached : but my chief objection to the clause, to which particular reference has been made, is that it contemplates the abolition of European languages as a test.",35
190,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Not the abolition of ropean languages.,36
191,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In some cases, yes.",36
192,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The power lies with liament, if it thinks fit, to add other guages to the European languages.",36
193,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We cannot get away from the fact that with the amendrests with the House. mentscontemplated it is possible or probable that European languages, as a test, may be abolished.",36
194,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,If that is not object what is the meaning of the Bill ?,36
195,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is the view I take. At certain times waves of feeling, take possession of the public mind ancl their effects are felt within these walls. is almost impossible, as we know, for majority of this or any other Parliawe ment to withstand* a passing wave of public opinion or public clamour in is favour of certain legislation. For that for the people of our own race. reason, I would much rather see the legislation made definite, than that should be left to a resolution of the at a time, when, perhaps, the pressure popular opinion may lead to a step we shall regret. I support the second readmost ing of the B i ' l , with the object of vouring to secure amendments in some the clauses. But I shall be found strongly opposed to the passing of clause 4.",36
196,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I much reiust gret that a question so important should have been brought forward at this late period of the session. It is a matter oractical impossibility to keep pace with the many measures introduced, that is, to read and understand the various clauses. Indeed, it would be much better to leave the drafting and consideration these measures to a Committee of half-aaims dozen, so as fo insure at least some liberation.",36
197,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We do not want government by committee.,36
198,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I , too, am totally opf posed to government by committee, but under the circumstances it is advisable to insure at least some consideraand tion of the proposals submitted. Tn the not accept its offer? Dresent case only the draftsman and Minister have, apparently, had time fo liberate on th*. measure.' No better proof that the Ministers generally have not had time to give any attention to this amending Bill , could be afforded than the fact that, when the Minister in charge happens to Euleave the Chamber, none of his colleagues are able to take his place. This only shows that the pace is far too fast to insure the clue consideration of measures by the GoParvernment, and that we now have legislalantion at the hands of single Ministers, and not from the Cabinet as a whole.",36
199,Mr CARPENTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The remedy for that,36
200,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A remedy might be found in devoting longer time to the Consideration of the Bills submitted. It is the sometimes complained by Ministers that a week or ten days is devoted to the discussion of a measure; but I venture to saythat if in 1901 more time had been devoted to the Immigration Restriction Act, many It amendments would have been found to be a unnecessary. As the case is now, however, have not one, but two, amending Bills introduced. After all, the vital principle to preserve, as far as possible, Australia. It is self-preservation, and there can be no it stronger or sounder doctrine than that House the people should demand for themselves of and their children, some dwelling-place wherein will flourish the institutions they favour. We should not be patriotic endeaor true citizens if we had not a fundaof mental belief in that principle. When we were asked to calmlv stand aside and submit to a peaceful invasion, which would as surely wipe us out as would a warlike invasion, we were absolutely justified in adopting some effective means of of defence. To that extent, and to that extent only, is legislation of this kind justified. What I disapproved of at the time, and what I have since seen more reason to disapprove of. is ""that when we could of have accomplished the larger part of our in a peaceful wav, we chose to adopt de- 'he most obiectionable means we could. The means adopted doubtless carried out the intention of the House, but they went a great deal further than was necessary. For instance, when Japan offered us a peaceu l method of excluding immigrants whom we did not desire to come here in large number*, lest they might change the character the habits of our people, why did we We declined to one arrange the matter by treatv. Under a decertain degree of pressure, it seems that the Government propose to make changes. the chief of which is the abolition of the present test in an European language, so that the Minister administering the Act for the time being will be at liberty to frame the test in any form he pleases. I have always entertained a strong objection to placing an extreme power in the hands, of a Minister. I do not like such a delegation of power. The House appears to be constantly falling into the danger of placing a despotic power in the hands of Ministers- a power so great that, if we fully understood what we were doing, we should not think of granting it . The proposal, however, seems to be treated lightly. When the honourable member for Kennedy voiced his objection to it , I heartily agreed with him. We should not place any Minister above the law, and yet that is what we are asked to do.",36
201,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Nothin g should be left to regulation which can be clearly provided for in the Bil l itself.,37
202,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Quite so. We should not allow bureaucratic influences to prevail. It would seem that the folly of legislators is. building up a corrective, and that many honourable members quite unconsciously are handing over to large bureaucracies a power which in the past has been almost entirely controlled by the Parliament. In view of the actions of some legislators at the present time, I do not see in this, practice the danger that I should have feared a few years since. That, however, is merely by the way. It seems to me that the amendment of which notice has been given by the Prime Minister could best be carried into effect by striking out the clauses, giving the Minister power to prescribe the test. The amendment provides thatNo regulation prescribing any language shall have any force until it has been laid before Houses of the Parliament for thirty days, within that time a resolution has been proposed in either House of the Parliament to disapprove of the regulation until the motion has been posed of. . . . .",37
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Such a motion might be kept going interminably.,37
204,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We have seen that done. One honourable member will be able to object to the test prescribed, with the result that it will be held in abeyance for an indefinite period.",37
205,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the honourable and learned member think that a Government would allow such a thing?,37
206,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In view of the honourable member's experience, I think that they would allow a great deal.",37
207,Mr TUDOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But would the House allow it?,37
208,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have known the same notices of motion to appear on the business-paper from one session to another. Honourable members objecting to a-test prescribed by the Minister would take the road presenting the most difficulties to itsadoption. On some pretext or other the consideration of the motion would be delayed.,37
209,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have the closure standing orders.,37
210,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the honourable member means to suggest that those standing orders are to be used to prevent reasonable discussion, he should not have supported them.",37
211,Mr THOMAS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They are designed to prevent a waste of time.,37
212,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member was one of those who said that time was. being wasted in discussing the original Bill, and yet it has been found necessary by the Ministry to introduce two amending measures. Some honourable members appear tothink that it is a waste of time to attempt to discuss any measure. Had the original Bill been properly discussed we should not have met with the present difficulties. The Prime Minister himself has been, unable to determine which principle should prevail, and that, to my mind, is a reason why this measure should not be pushed through the House at the present time. It should be allowed to remain in abeyance until the' Cabinet has arrived at a definite decision. I presume that the Prime Minister assumed that the Bill , as drafted, afforded the best means of overcoming existing difficulties; both but other members of the Cabinet, or prior if vate members, must hold . a different opinion, otherwise we should not have had dis- circulated a set of amendments which prac. tically nullify the Billas submitted . When 1 the framers of a measure have not fairly considered it , or made up their minds as to the best course to pursue, it is incumbent upon them not to ask the House to deal with it , especially in the closing days of the session. The supporters of the Government rely on their bringing forward a well-considered measure, but that has not been done in this case. This practice is especially objectionable when the House is sitting from twelve to fourteen hours a day, and when there cannot be that discussion upon Bills submitted to us that ought to take place. The inevitable effect of this will be that new troubles will arise. No 'honourable member is prepared to give proper consideration to this measure, because our attention has been closely devoted for some weeks past to other Bills. The Bill before us repeals paragraphs m ancl n of section 3 of the original Act. Under those paragraphs, a man who is not a prohibited immigrant is allowed to bring in his wife and all children apparently under the age of eighteen years, whilst any man who can satisfy the officer concerned that he has been formerly domiciled in the State is exempt from the provisions of the Act. Whilst we allow men of an alien race to live here in small numbers, less danger is likely to arise from permitting them to bring in their wives than must eventuate from allowing the present state of affairs to continue. In an assemblage of men, I need not go into all the reasons that actuate me in that bsl i e f ; but I am satisfied that the more honourable members think of this point, the more fully they will recognise the desirableness of allowing these aliens to bring in their wives. For that reason, I think that the proposal to repeal paragraphs m and n of section 3 of the original Act is a mistake. Many cases of great hardship have arisen-alien s who have been living here for twenty years or more having been refused permission to land their wives after once taking them out of the Commonwealth. Surely that is not a good thing for the community. Surely it is not based upon those principles of equity and justice which ought to prevail among all civilized nations. We are a. voung and a weak community; but, even if we were a powerful nation, we should still recognise those principles. That which is not morally right can never be politically or financially right. Although it may seem expedient, in the long run it always turns out to be an evil and a menace to the community to depart from fundamental moral principles. We are paying no attention to one side of the moral aspect of the question when we say that a man who has been living here for some years shall not be allowed to bring in his wife. Under the original Act, there is some escape from that position, and in a few cases the sense of justice and equity of the Minister administering the Act has been touched. Even the right honourable member for East Sydney, when Minister of External Affairs, allowed some of the cases brought under his notice to be put beyond the scope of the Immigration Restriction Act. This shows that he considered that to have refrained from doing so would have been to contravene the principles of equity and justice.",37
213,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,To what class of cases does the honourable and learned member refer ?,38
214,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They were cases in which the wives of immigrants who had formerly lived in Australia were not allowed to land. In some instances this involved considerable hardship. I think that in one case a man who had been living in. Australia for twenty-five years was not permitted to bring in his wife after his return from a visit to his own country.,38
215,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Many who pretend to> have been here before have never been in the country. The statements of those desirous of entering Australia cannot always, be relied on.",38
216,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No doubt that is so, but in the cases to which I refer it was-clearly proved that the men had former] v lived here. Even under the Bill the Minister will not have sufficient power to deaf fairly with cases of this kind.",38
217,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If every Chinaman who left Australia returned with a wife, we should soon have a large number of Chinese: living here.",38
218,Mr CONROY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There is very littledanger of Australia being swamped by Chinese, because the Minister may refuse to admit even men who, prior to leaving"" Australia, had lived here for many years. Besides, our knowledge of the world should teach us that it may be better to allow ncertain number of foreign women to comehere. A provision which it seems to merequires amendment is that of substituted' clause 14A, which provides that- Every member of the police force of any State, and every officer may, without warrant,, arrest any person reasonably supposed to be aprohibited immigrant. I could understand such a provision if itwere to apply only in out-of-the-way places, to meet the isolated cases to which the Minister referred; but, even then, I thinkit would be unnecessary. The regulations, however, might be so framed that the Minister could authorize any police officer to act in the manner provided for, and if the clause were amended to read, "" TheMinister may authorize any member of the police force,"" my objection to ic would be largely removed. It must be remembered that we are allowing the Government to make arrangements with foreign Governments for the admission of certain of their subjects on the presentation of passports, duly vised, and on the observance of other necessary precautions against imposition. Even the honourable member for Bland, when in office, agreed that this might be done. The men who will come here under this arrangement will belong chiefly to the tourist class, who will come here for purposes of sight seeing, or to the merchant class, who will come here to obtain trade. At all events, they will be men recommended by the Governments whose subjects they are, and it would be a great affront to those Governments if any of them were suddenly arrested in the streets of one of our large cities, without other authority than this provision, by any member of the police force who chose to take such action. The power is one which is not likely to be often abused, but we should not run the risk of it being abused at all. It might happen, if the clause were left as it stands, that some raw member of the force, anxious to distinguish himself, might avail* himself of this power to be offensive :to one of these persons whom we are practically inviting to our shores. opinion the provision goes beyond what is safe or sound, and is likely to create difficulties in our relations with foreign Governments, because, possibly, the visitor subjected to indignity might be a man of influence and high rank in his own country. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will agree to the amendment which I have suggested. I am sorry that the measure is being brought forward so late in the session. II extends the power of the Minister to make arrangements with foreign Governments, but, in my opinion, effects no real improvement of the Alien Restriction Act. The success of legislation of this kind depends largely upon its administration, and the administration of the past has not been such as to justify us in anticipating very successful results in the future. Had the measure been brought in earlier, there would have been a better recognition ot what is due to other nations, and would then anticipate less difficulty in the future than I now foresee. In my ion, it would be better to postpone its Mr Conroy. tlT-r consideration until next session, when we will come fresh to it, and will be able to give full attention to the various points put forward by honourable members.",38
219,Mr DAVIDTHOMS ON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Capricornia). - I regret that the Government have introduced legislation to amend the Alien Restriction Bill . At the last election every opportunity wastaken to decry that measure, and the opponents of the Labour Party made use of it against us. Having successfully defended ourselves in regard to it, why should we now allow it to be modified? Queensland will be the greatest sufferer if more aliens are permitted to enter the Commonwealth, because Chinese, and the people of the other coloured races, make for that State first. There is now in Queensland a great number of Chinese, Japanese, and other coloured aliens, living amidst all the filth and dirt imaginable, and why should that State be a receptacle for the black, brown, and brindles of the whole world? I shall oppose the motion for the second reading. We often hear of Chinese puzzles, but the measure seems to me to provide a Japanese puzzle. I cannot understand what language is to be used as the education test. Why should we substitute for an "" European"" language a "" prescribed "" language ? What language is to be prescribed? Is it to be In my the Japanese language? Those who support the Bill'appear to be favourable to the admission of Japanese to Australia because their nation has recently defeated Russia after a great struggle. That is no reason why we should be afraid of Japan. In my opinion, both the Russians and the Japanese are practically savag.es, except in their knowledge of civilized methods of warfare, though probably the Japanese are more civilized and humane than are the Russians. ""Still, that is no reason why we should admit them into Australia. I know the evils which have resulted from the admission of Japanese men, and especially of Japanese women, into Queensland, ancl it would be a disgrace to allow any more of them to come here. They do not come to Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia.",39
220,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We have a great many I think in the Northern Territory.,39
221,Mr DAVID THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes , but I they are more isolated there, and do not come as much into contact with white people opinas they do in Queensland. Round about furCairns, and in other places on the Herbert River, we lind that there are great numbers of Japanese, Chinese, and other blacks, browns, ancl brindles, engaged in the. sugar industry, and I do not wish their number to be increased. It is not the administration of the law by the present Government that we are afraid of, but its administration by future Governments. I am satisfied' that if we amend the law in the manner proposed we shall find it difficult to preserve a White Australia. I , therefore, intend to oppose the second reading of the Bill . Labour Party, which went to the country as the main supporters of that measure, came back stronger than ever, and I do not see why we should modify legislation of which the electors have approved. do not believe in introducing any of the black races into Australia, and I shall certainly oppose any provisions in. the Bill that would have the effect of opening the door for them.",39
222,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," Every true Australian, whether by birth or adoption, should seriously consider the proposal now submitted to us. We are asked to amend an Act of Parliament which has occupied a more prominent place in the public attention than, perhaps any other measure passed by an Australian Parliament. believe that the Prime Minister is sincere in his desire to preserve a White Australia, bub it is human to err, and I think that the honourable gentleman is now taking a course which I think he will have cause to regret.",40
223,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Bill is intended to close up the loop-holes that now exist.,40
224,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes , but whilst some of the provisions of the Bill are intended to operate in that direction, others will have the effect of opening the back door more widely than ever, and, under the administration of a Government not fully sympathetic with the White Australia policy, of permitting a Avholesale influx of coloured aliens.",40
225,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I think not.,40
226,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I take the opposite view. In view of the extent to which coloured aliens are monopolizing trade and industry, particularly in the country districts of the various States, we should be careful to refrain from adopting any course that would lead to the augmentation of their numbers. At Wellington, one of the most prosperous towns in New South Wales-and it is the most prosperous settlements that are chosen by coloured aliens for the pursuit of their operations-the Assyrians, who, of all foreigners,, are the most objectionable to the housewives of the bush, are taking possession of the whole of the business. Ir* other towns the Chinese are predominant among the traders. In the Tumut dis1 trict the tobacco-growing industry is practically wholly in the hands of the Chinese, and in Queensland the sugar industry isgradually drifting in the same direction. The I am afraid that the substitution of the words, "" in any prescribed language,"" for the words "" European language,"" would afford a loop-hole which would be takenadvantage of by unscrupulous administraI tors to defeat the purposefor which the Act was passed.",40
227,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No other language but European can be added without the consent of Parliament.,40
228,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am quite aware of that, but the mere fact that any other than, a European language could be used under certain conditions would lead to agitation, from time to time in favour of making concessions to various peoples with whom Great Britain may enter into alliances. Throughout the last election members of I the Opposition practically lived upontheir abuse of the administration of the Immigration. Restriction Act, and they will be prompted to continue their agitation with unabated vigour if the slightest opportunity presents itself. The present: Act is much less stringent than the measure which was proposed in New South Wales, with the object of excluding; coloured Asiatics, when the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney was Premier of that State. It was reported by the authorities in Dowling-street that the Bill in its original form was not in accordance with the treaties into which Great Britain had entered with other countries, and it was suggested that the language test should be adopted. That course was followed. We have also listened to similar representations on the part of the Imperial authorities, and-, so far as I am aware, no objection has been raised' by them to the present Act. I do not see any reason why we should,- on our own motion, relax those conditions which are intended to, as far as possible, guard tis against an influx of undesirable immigrants. Why should we pay any respect to the clamourings of members of the Opposition, who have filled the newspapers ' with their declamations against the Act ? The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, in the course of an interview, which was accorded by him by a repiesentative of one of the Sydney newspapers, charged the Prime Minister with having deceived him in connection with this Bill. He adopted the most insulting tone towards the Prime Minister, and pretended to feel much aggrieved at the way in which he had been treated. But, knowing the right honourable gentleman as we do, we must find it difficult to believe in his sincerity. ""We know that he is not above adopting any means in order to obtain his ends. My suspicions in this direction are borne out by the attitude honourable members of the Opposition are adopting towards the Bill. The right honourable member was merely throwing dust in the eyes of the people, and was endeavouring to disarm those who have fought all through the piece for a White Australia. Any one would suppose that we were attempting to impose restrictions more severe than ' any hitherto adopted by other countries. But I would point out that in the United States immigrants are subjected to a very much more searching examination than are persons desirous of entering the Commonwealth. The Americans do not clamour for a White America, but they desire to protect their people from the degrading influences to which they would be subjected if immigrants of a low type were admitted to their dominion. I find by reference to ment issued by the Oceanic Steam-ship Company that immigrants have to supply answers to no less than twenty-one questions. In the first place, they are required to supply their name in full, and to state their age and sex, and whether they are married or single. They are then called upon to describe their occupation, and to state whether they are able to read or write. The nationality has to be given, and also the last place of residence. Further, they are required to name the seaport in, the United States at which they intend to land, and also the State, city, or town which is their final destination. question is also directed as to whether they have a ticket which will enable them to reach that destination. They have to state by whom their passage was paid, and whether they are in possession of any monev, and, if so, whether more than $30, and how much, if it amounts to $30 M'. Webster. or less. They have to state, further, whether they have ever previously been in the United States, and, if so, where; whether they are going to join relatives, and,,, if so, what relatives; whether they have ever been in prison or almshouses, or supported by charity, whether they are polygamists; whether they are under contract, expressed or implied, to labour in the United States. They have to furnish particulars as to their condition of health, mental and physical, and as to whether they are deformed or crippled. The Americans do not entertain the same ideas in regard to a White America as we do concerning a White Australia. We all recollect the letter which was written by the honourable member for Oxley to a friend of his in Wales. That communication contained statements which were not in accordance with fact, and was of a character which should not have emanated from an ordinary citizen, much less - from a public man. The honourable member informed his correspondent that, if he came to Australia, he would in all probability be required to return to his native hills.",40
229,Mr R EDWARDS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Why does not the honourable member agree to excise paragraph a of section 3 of the principal Act?,41
230,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable member knows perfectly well that the Act has never been applied in the way that he suggests. Yet he did something which would have reflected discredit even upon an ignoa docu- rant citizen of the Commonwealth.,41
231,Mr R EDWARDS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am afraid that the honourable member does not know what he is talking about.,41
232,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I should like to think that the honourable member did not know what he was writing about. Mr R. EUWAEDS - Honourable members opposite did not allow me to finish my say. They were too angry.,41
233,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Eve n when members address themselves to a question as calmly as I do, they are accused of being angry. Personally, I have never known what anger A meant. I admit that, perhaps, I am a little more in earnest than are most honourable members who address the House, but, as a rule, I believe what I am saying. If I can be accused of exhibfting anger, what can be said of the deputy leader of the Opposition, who, upon almost every occasion he speaks, is absolutely sivage?",41
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I vent my savagery for upon honourable members, and not upon poor innocent stationmaster.",42
235,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the honourable member experienced two or three, trips similar to that to which I had to submit, we should get rid of his presence in this Chamber very quickly. When I to digress, I was referring to the leakages that might occur under existing legislation. It is well known that undesirable grants gain admission to the Commonwealth in the way that has been described by the honourable member for Newcastle; and, despite the strictest administration of kind. the Act by a sympathetic Government. That being so, what will happen if this Bill passed ? Why is not the honourable memof ber for Parramatta declaiming against it the same way that he denounced the Trade Marks Bill ? Is it because he sees in the measure some means of gratifying his masthis ters, by allowing them to bring in contract labour without any supervision whatever?",42
236,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not think ihat, ought to allow the honourable member to speak of any other honourable member as doing the work of his masters. I do not consider that it is a proper expression, and with alien immigration. I suggest to the honourable member that should withdraw it .",42
237,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I think I am perfectly in order in saying that the honourable memstrictions ber is doing the vork of his constituents.,42
238,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If the honourable member had used the phrase in that sense, which is not European. no objection could have been taken to his words. But he must see that he used it another sense, because he intended to imply lation. something which was not proper.",42
239,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I . withdraw the explorable pression, sir, but I do not understand your ruling.",42
240,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Whils t I am pleased to hear the honourable member's retraction, I desire that his withdrawal should be made in a full knowledge of all the circumnot stances. The honourable member, in speakLiao-yang, ing of the deputy leader of the Oppoare sition, said that he was desirous of doing the bidding of "" his masters."" ' If honourable member intended the words "" his masters "" to refer to the constituents of the honourable member for Parramatta, I cannot understand why he used the pression at all. He must have intended something else, and in so far as that expression applied to any bodv other than the constituents of the honourable Parramatta-to the capitalists to a whom he seemed to be referring- I ask. him to withdraw it .",42
241,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I withdraw the statement in obedience to your ruling. I know the view which is entertained by the majority of the constituents of the honourable 1 was tempted member for Parramatta.,42
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I happen to be with the honourable member's leader upon; immithis Bill. Is that wrong?,42
243,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That fact in itself constitutes a warning to me. I do not like such alliances upon matters of this: I do not consider it is necessary for me to detain the House any further. be I shall vote against the second reading' 1 the Bill , and if it be carried, I shall in endeavour in Committee so to amend it as to remove its objectionable features.",42
244,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I think that measure contains sufficient reasonable clauses to warrant me in supporting itssecond reading. lit strengthens the hands I of the Executive where that has beenproved to be necessary, and it meets a number of technical points which have beenbrought before the law courts in connection But, although I he intend to support the second reading of the Bill , I shall endeavour, when clause 3; is under consideration, to prevent the rewhich we now impose in regard' to the dictation test from being broken down by the adoption of a language So far as. that clause is concerned, I think it in might well be described as panic legisI t is an old rule that hard casesmake bad laws, and it seems to me dethat a state of panic which has. been created by Oriental victories should have forced us to adopt a course of procedure that we do not desire to follow. I ask any honourable member whether clause 4 would have been introduced if it had been for thp victories at Port Arthur, and Mukden ? In this Bill , we not getting the echoes of the guns: which the Japanese emploved against the the Russians? When the original Act was introduced, I protested against the interference of the British Government, and T object, still more to our being called upon exto concede rights to Oriental nations inrespect of our internal legislation.",42
245,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,""" Concede "" is - not . the word to use. and the honourable and? member learned member knows it.",42
246,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know it. On .the contrary,' i think that the word is a - very proper one to use. The present is - not the first occasion upon which Imperial representations have been made to us in this regard. I assume that, in consequence of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, Imperial representations have been made in regard to this question. But it is already being conceded by some of the greatest authorities in England that Mr Chamberlain was wrong in insisting upon our adopting in the original Bill the language of the Natal Act, instead of allowing us to pass such legislation as we deemed fit. I have here a copy of an article written by the Sydney correspondent of the London Times, and published in that journal on the 27th October last. The writer puts the position well when he saysOne can only hope (not very hopefully) that the misleading educational test will be abolished, that the exclusion of Japanese will be arranged iby treaty-as it used to be in Queensland, and :as the Japanese have always desired-and that Australians will be allowed to say honestly and straight-out what they wish about other non-white folk. If a man wants to be selfish (assuming, for the moment that "" White Australia "" is a purely selfish policy), you will not cure him by making him pretend not to be so; you will only irritate him from the first, teach him the easiness of subterfuge, and in the end demoralize him altogether. Commenting on this letter, the Times, in its leading columns, writesI n its essence there is nothing more insulting in limiting by legislation the work that may be - done in Australia by Japanese immigrants than there is in limiting the importation of Japanese ^oods by a tariff. What is insulting is a system which professes to be educational, and then defines the European languages as the sole standard of education, which may be applied to a scholar and a gentleman from China, but is never, as our correspondent points out, applied to a European navvy. As Mr Deakin suggested in his reply to the Japanese Government three days ago, theie is room for a general re-statement of the form in which these restrictions are cast. The growth of Imperial unity must be Eased on compromise, not on verbal subterfuge. We must realise the nature of Australia's problems, and modify our preconceived theories to suit them. On the other hand, Australia, in the interests of the Empire, anc! her own progress, must learn to separate what is essential to the development of the white race, and to the maintenance of her standard of living, from what is unessential, so that she may retain the former and discard the latter. We have here an admission, first, by the Sydney correspondent of the Times, and, secondly, by the Times itself, that when the original Bill was under consideration a great mistake was made by the Barton Government in refusing to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland, proposing to set forth a clear statement of what Australia desired. That Government admitted that the wording of the clause was not in accordance with their desires, but that they had been forced to adhere to the provisions of the Natal Act, not only because of the representations of the Colonial Office, but because they feared that the Bill might otherwise be vetoed.",43
247,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They would not have done that.,43
248,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Sir Edmund Barton said that he feared that the Bill might be vetoed if it contained clauses providing for the direct exclusion of Asiatic races.,43
249,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,He had in mind the experience of the New South Wales Government.,43
250,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"He might also have had in mind the experience of the people of British Columbia. For a number of years they have been endeavouring to exclude Japanese immigrants, but Bills passed witli the intention of giving effect to that desire have been vetoed time after time. If we are going to allow ourselves to be pressed by one nation, we must prepare to be coerced by another? With Orientals nothing counts for more than does prestige. When the Japanese scored two or three naval and military victories their prestige was raised throughout the Orient, but, according to the Peking correspondent of the Times, immediately the Japanese failed to secure the war indemnity which they demanded from Russia, the Chinese Government once more leaned towards Russian predominance. If the people of India and China see that the Government of Australia, simply because the Japanese have been able to win several land and naval fights, are anxious not to offend their susceptibilities, and that we are prepared to so amend our legislation as to conform to their wishes, it is difficult to say where our steps in this direction will lead us. It is not long since Mr Coghlan did a useful work for Australia, when, by means of a letter to the Times, he threatened Germany with Tariff reprisals, unless she did her duty to the Commonwealth in connection with the incident of the Jaluit Company and the Marshall Islands. Germanv, which is a dominant military power, is aiming at becoming a dominant naval power, and if she finds that Japan, having become a great naval power, is able to secure concessions from us, is she not likely to also bring pressure to bear upon the Commonwealth ?",43
251,Mr WATKINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is not the proposed action practically an invitation to her to do so?,44
252,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think that it is. If we once admit that a growing power has a right to bring pressure to bear upon us in regard to the form which our legislation I shall take, we shall offer an invitation to others to attempt to influence us in the same way. I should be very sorry to see this proposal attended by the results which have followed the treaty made between Queensland and Japan. I had the good fortune to be a member of the parliamentary party which visited Queensland last year, and cannot help saying that those who went there with sentimental ideas as to the policy of a White Australia, came back with a practical view of the question. At Point Lucinda, for example, I found that, out of a total population of about 100, there were fifty or sixty Japanese.",44
253,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Queensland' agreement was to allow a certain number of Japanese to enter that State.,44
254,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"And - they were to be deported at the termination of a certain number of years. Notwithstanding that the time limit fixed has expired, Japanese are still in Queensland, and are spreading throughout the States. The following advertisement is an indication of how some of these men secure admission to the Commonwealth :^5 Reward will be paid to any person giving information resulting in the arrest of KASUKE YAJURA and ISHIMATSU MATUSHITA, Japanese crew of Schooner Aladdin. I am informed that this is one of a class of advertisements that frequently appear in the Queensland newspapers, in relation to men who escape from pearling vessels, and go to swell the Japanese population in Australia. The master of a pearling vessel is liable to a. fine of £ s f ° allowing a Japanese to escape, but a Japanese labourer is worth far more than that to anyone who can secure his services. I would remind the House of the djangers that have arisen in countries where the Japanese and other Orientals have gone in large numbers. At Hawaii the Japanese are one of the most truculent sections of the population, and are insisting, not upon their rights, but upon privileges. Their numbers are so largely out of proportion to the numbers of the white population, that they are able to take up this stand. if we go to Singapore, the new naval base in the northeastern seas, we find that the Chinese, who at the outset comprised only a small minority of the population, have so largely increased, that they can control the banking and commercial interests and, in short, the whole of the organizations of that place. The only protection which the white population have against them is that during certain hours the Bund, a kind of public re-sort, is closed even to the most wealthy Chinese. The poorest white soldier in Singapore mav go there, but Chinese and other coloured races are excluded during the hours fixed. If the Japanese came into this great, lone land of ours, which seems to be a natural appendix to the Oriental countries, and we sought to prohibit their appearance in public resorts at certain hours, we might find the Japanese Gcjveilnmient (attempting to influence our actions in regard to even so small a matter of internal administration as that would be. The Japanese declare that they have a right to come to Australia. Mr E. W. Cole, in A White Australia Impossible, describes his visit to Japan, and gives statements made by ex-Ministers, Members of the Parliament of Japan, and' others holding high official positions, who declared that the Japanese had a right to come here.",44
255,Mr FISHER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,On'wha t grounds?,44
256,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"They say that on the one hand America seems to have been designed to afford a proper outlet for the overflow population of European countries, indented and that Australia is a natural and proper ou'tljet for the overflow of the Oriental GEO. W. THOJ I. countries.",44
257,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The official statement of the Japanese Government is absolutely to the contrary. They acknowledge the absolute right of Australia to make laws excluding whomsoever we please. We have that admission in thefr official communicar tions with us.,44
258,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,For ten years they will have to adhere to that view of the position.,44
259,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That statement is contained in a communication received by us prior to the Anglo-Japanese alliance. It has been repeated by them at different times since 1897. They have said that they do not question our right to exclude any one, but they ask that a discrimination be not exercised against them more than against any one else. "" If you like to exclude us,"" .they say, in effect, "" d o so; but do not exclude us on the ground of colour,'' and so forth.",44
260,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"As soon as Japan feels - her feet she will observe her representations to us just as England observed representations which she made to Oriental - countries. When Commodore Perry first went to Japan he was only going to convey the compliments of the President of the United States to the Mikado; but it was not long before treaty ports were opened up. I venture to say that the representations made by the Japanese Government in 1897 will not be observed long after they find a definite way of securing a permanent foothold in Australia, ten years hence. We are creating an internal enemy. If we believe that it is because of our weakness that certain legislation must be thrust upon us, it is about time that we looked to our - defences, or else bent our backs, like craven - curs, to Oriental peoples. We must fight for the control of our own destinies : if we give way in one direction, we shall have to give way in others.",45
261,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But we need not talk about trailing our coats.,45
262,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not think that we are. The honourable and learned member for Parkes, in submitting a motion to the 'House, some weeks ago, spoke of Japan as one of the greatest naval and powers in the world, and also of the high national character of her people. Honourable members will recall to mind his statement that they were a great and humanitarian race. But what does the Times say? Throughout the war it supported the Japanese, ancl is therefore unlikely to misrepresent their character in the slightest - degree. When peace was .declared, and the Japanese did not obtain all that they - desired, riots took place in Japan, and the details of the disturbances were recorded in the Times, Peace was engineered by Asiatic financiers, who, in mv opinion, control not only our finances, but to a large - extent the Imperial policy of Great Britain. The following cable messages from Tokio appeared in the Times of 1.5th September 'last:The attack on the offices of the Kokumin was followed by serious rioting. Throughout the a series of demonstrations were made in the - neighbourhood of the Home Minister's residence. Late in the afternoon the mob charged, swept the police away, and battered down the gates. The police and the servants resisted stoutly, but .the mob surged round and entered the house. Further details regarding the attack on the resiwere dence of the Minister of the Interior show that one of the mob leaders, carrying an armful of burning straw, gained the rear of the building, and succeeded in setting it in flames. Police reserves charged the crowd, using their swords freely, but the mob rallied in several quarters, and stoned the firemen when they arrived. The members of the Minister's household were rescued and escorted to the Imperial Hotel. When darkness came, the burning building lit up a threatening scene-the mob hoofing and throwing stones on the police and firemen, and the police repeatedly clearing the streets. The mob burned and destroyed ten Christian churches and one mission house school on Wednesday night. No one was injured. During the commotion the coolie class seized the occasion to destroy thirty electric cars. A member of the Salvation Army exhorted the mob to disperse, whereupon it wrecked the Army's substation. The Catholic church, the school, and the priest's residence in Honjo have been destroyed, as well as four small houses, which were burned. The Protestant church at Honjo, and the pastor's residence, were burned. Three mission churches in the Asakusa district were partly or completely wrecked. The Hiogo church, anticipating an attack, removed the fences round the church, and hoisted the white flag. The mob contented itself with destroying a few chairs and tables. The Methodist church in Okachimachi-street was attacked by the mob, and the walls and fences were wrecked, and part of the furniture carried into the streets and burned. The Yonokura and Hamacho churches in Nihonbashi were burned. military In the Kanda district a crowd first threatened to burn the Russian cathedral, but a Sergeant of the Guard prevailed upon them to desist by threatening that if the cathedral were destroyed he and the guard would commit suicide. The crowd thereupon agreed not to touch the cathedral. Though the mob created considerable uproar there was no destruction of property, nor any serious conflict with the police. Demonstrations against the Metropolitan Police headquarters continued until a late hour. The Government, on the authority of the Imperial Emergency Ordinance, has suspended the publication of the journals Miyako, Yurozu, and Niroku. The city is quiet. No serious disorder has been leported anywhere during the night. Disorder occurred at Kobe on Thursday night. A statue of the Marquis Ito was pulled from its pedestal, and dragged through the streets. The Government has ordered the suspension of . day the Tokio newspaper Asahi and the conservative journal N if f o n and the radical journal Jinmin for having published obiectionable articles dealing with the present situation. According to an estimate made by the metropolitan police, the casualties in the recent rioting as follows :-3S 8 constables, 16 firemen, and a soldiers were wounded; while among the mob and the bystanders 9 persons were killed and 387 wounded. These things are happening in a country whose civilization, we are told, is equal to . ours.",45
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Thos e outrages are .almost, though not quite, as bad as what is happening in Russia.",46
264,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If , to meet the susceptibilities of the Japanese, we are going - to prescribe Japanese for the language test, why should we not prescribe Chinese also ? I have yen to learn that the Chinese - are not at least equal to the Japanese in civilization. The Japanese got their writing, their scholarship, and their civilization, from the Chinese, and if honest - clerks are required, even in the Yokohama banks, Chinese have to be imported. It it well known that the Japanese rarely 'keep their contracts.",46
265,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable and learned member should not believe wholesale statements made about any people.,46
266,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not wish' to condemn any race wholly, because, no doubt, there is something good about every people; Ixit my statements are borne out by travellanguage, lers and residents in Japan. - Chinese to be regarded as inferior to the Japanese because they are imbued with idea that evil should not be resisted - force, and support the ideal whose recogthat nition the International Workingmen's Union is trying to obtain, by giving to the aggressor to avoid violence, and to sav so franklv. secure peace. The Chinese, in some of their philosophy ancl practice, might well set an example to the rest of the world, find, in my opinion, are superior Japanese. I understand that the Prime Minister himself opened negotiations with' the Japanese in April of last year. Why did he not also open negotiations with the 'Chinese ?",46
267,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Chinese are an ferior race. or. at all events, have shown their superiority as the Japanese have done.",46
268,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Chinese have not peoples. killed some thousands of men in a recent war as the Japanese have done. proves their inferiority, I admit it.",46
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Th about which the honourable and learned member is contemptuous, must neverthethat less be respected by every Government.",46
270,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If we do this with the Japanese, why should we not make similar arrangements with the Hindoos?",46
271,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We opened up negotiations with India and Japan simultaneously.,46
272,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Surely persons of races whose members have fought side by side with our own soldiers in the defence of the Empire, and for the extension of British trade and commerce into the Shan States, Baloochistan, Burmah, and Further India, should be given the same consideration as the people of Japan ! After the Boxer riots, it was not the Japanese whom we asked to go to China to protect our people there, and to do police work along with the members of the Naval Brigade .sent from New South Wales. Victoria, and South Australia-; iti was the Sikhs who then fought side by side with our own citizens. Why, then, should we not consider the natives of India as much' as the Japanese?",46
273,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We are doing so. We are not proposing to make any difference between them.,46
274,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A m I to understand that, if Japanese is to be a prescribed Hindustani and Chinese will Are the also be prescribed languages?",46
275,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not say that Chinese the will be a prescribed language. The honby orable and learned member must recollect the object of applying the language test is, not to allow persons to enter the way Commonwealth, but to keep them out. I",46
276,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"A m I to take it that the various dialects of India, as well as the language of Japan, will be prescribed lanto the guages under the Bill ?",46
277,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There are 200 or 300 dialects in India; but Hindustani is the general language of Hindustan, and I think that if Japanese is prescribed. Hindustani might also be prescribed . The language 1 test will not be used with the object of inallowing persons to enter Australia, whenot ther they be Japanese or Hindoos; but we wish to make no distinction between the peoples of India and Japan and other",46
278,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Therefore , both H in If that dustani and Japanese may be prescribed.",46
279,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,If Parliament approves e superiority of that being done.,46
280,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The intention being neither natives of India nor Japanese are to be admitted to the Commonwealth?,46
281,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Not to any further extent now.,47
282,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then , I think it will be better to provide that any language may be used-eve n the ancient Aztec of South America, or old Slavonian. If that is agreed to, we can always submit an objectionable applicant for admission to a test in a language which he cannot speak or write.",47
283,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is always done, and is the object of applying the language test.",47
284,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then why use the word "" prescribed "" at all ?",47
285,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"So that Parliament may. if honourable members think fit, keep control of the test in this respect.",47
286,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I hope that the word "" prescribed "" will be omitted'. In South Africa, there are now about 46,000 Chinese, who have been imported there by other Asiatics living generally in Park-lane, London, in order to increase their dividends. The Chinese are objectionable to the white people living in Natal and Caoe Colony, who wish to preserve the purity and maintain the supremacy of their race, so far as is possible, in view of the overwhelmingly large number of native Kaffirs. Therefore, Cape Colony has adopted very drastic legislation, to which I have already referred on the motion for the adjournment of the House.",47
287,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I call your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the fact that there is not a quorum, and, incidentally, remark that the only member of the Opposition present is nearly asleep. [Quorum formed.']",47
288,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"It seems to me that, if we adopted some of the provisions of the Cape Colony law, we should prevent the illegal influx of Japanese from the pearl luggers on our northern coasts, ancl stop Chinese from landing in the Northern Territory, and finding their way thence into other parts of the Commonwealth. They meet the difficulty by means of a forced registration. A man has a certificate issued to him by the Government, with his description, ancl sometimes with his photograph attached. They.also take his finger prints under the Bertillon system, and make a very careful record of his marks.",47
289,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,We use that system in a still more perfect form.,47
290,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Then it would be much more easy for us to meet the position than it was for the Cape Government when they inaugurated the system. They insist upon every Asiatic resident in the Colony going before the magistrate of the district once every twelve months, and obtaining a certificate. The alien has to pay no fee;, but the magistrate certifies that he has appeared before him upon a certain date, and that document is sufficient in itself to show that the man is properly domiciled ii> the Colony. If any man is found without a certificate showing that he has been before the magistrate at some date within the previous twelve months, he is called upoit to show cause, and, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, is liable to be deported. That appears to me to be a satisfactory way of dealing with aliens such as. are now reported to be improperly gaining admission to some of the States. About two or three years ago, when the Prime Minister was acting as Minister of External Affairs, I made an application to him oni behalf of a Chinese resident, who wished to secure the return to the Commonwealth of his son, who had been absent in England and China for upwards of two years. The Prime Minister would not relax the regulations-, and I was told afterwards by a constituent of mine, at whose request I had made the representations to the Minister, that if the regulations were not relaxed, the young man would be introduced in some other way. I believe that he hassince obtained admission to the Commonwealth. I informed the Prime Minister of the threat, because I thought it was desirable that he should know that means were available for evading the Act. I trust that the Government will agree to a system of registrationfor Chinese, so that the Act may be made really effective. I shall support the motion for the second reading of the Bill, but, unless clause 3is modified, I shall vote against it.",47
291,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," Although it may not be intended to enforce the provisions of the Bill, as would on the face of them appear to be contemplated, I cannot altogether agree with the proposal 1 now made by the Government. I refer more particularly to the clause which deals with the language test to be applied to immigrants, and in which it is intended to substitute a prescribed language for a European language. It appears to me that this is an extremely dangerous innovation, which would really deprive us of any safeguard that the Act gives against a people whose virtues have of late been trumpeted all over the world, and against whom the Act was particularly directed in ihe first case. I know of no reason why the Act, which was considered a good one when it was introduced, should now be regarded as defective. We all know that since it was passed there has been a great war, and we are told that Japan has now entered the family of first-class nations; further, that she is knocking in a very polite but insistent way at the door of the Commonwealth, and that, if we like to open the door, well and good, but that, if we do not, she will knock later on in a more peremptory fashion. If the Bill has been introduced for such a reason, it may Iiave much to commend it. If the door is to be battered down, we may as well - open it. If , on the other hand, the measure has been introduced because Japan has claims to be regarded as a civilized nation, and because (her people are rer - garded' as desirable persons for us to consort with, I ask for some proofs of these assertions that were not in existence when - the Act was placed on the statute-book. Japan was then, as she is now, a nation singularly ajpt to copy the methods of Western nations. No one can deny her credit for the most amazing strides that she has made in the arts of both peace and war. Nevertheless, so far as those who believe in this legislation are concerned, her people are as little desirable as immigrants now, as they were when the Act was passed. Clause 3 provides for the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph a in the principal Act: Any person who fails to pass the dictation that is to say, who, when an officer dictates to him not more than fifty words in any prescribed language, fails to write them out in that language in the presence of the officer. To this the Prime Minister proposes to :add the following provision:No regulation prescribing any language shall have any force until it has been laid before both Houses of the Parliament for thirty days or if within that time a resolution has been proposed in cither House of the Parliament to disapprove - of the regulation until the motion has been disposed of. Until some language has been prescribed the language authorized by the Principal Act shall be deemed to be prescribed within the meaning of this Act. T ask what language it is contemplated to - prescribe? It is obviously intended to - prescribe one language, and one only, namely, such a one as will enable Japanese to come here. If , at the insistent demand of the Japanese for admission to the Commonwealth-a n insistent demand cloaked, if you like, in the most diplomatic language-bu t showing beneath the gloved hand of the diplomat the mailed fist of the conqueror-w e are to prescribe a language which will present opportunities for the admission of Japanese only, the whole proposal is a farce, and the Bill is.really intended to present opportunities for the admission into this country - of all the Japanese who choose to come here. If , on the other hand, we are to regard the present proposal as an indication that the Government are of opinion that the Act has been too rigidly framed, and that it is desirable that all men of suitable character who have attained a certain standard of education shall come in, well and good. We shall then know where we are. We shall then estimate the value of an immigrant by the amount of education he has received , and not by the standard of those 1 other virtues which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as of the foremost importance. Thousands of Europeans could not pass a dictation test in any language.",47
292,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,; Sometimes they cannot pass the test now applied to them.,48
293,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The Bill could be so enforced as to exclude nine out of every ten persons of European birth who would be regarded as most desirable immigrants. When the Act was under discussion, I said that it would exclude my own countrymen- I was speaking of men who had a speech alien to that of Englishmen-that i't would exclude Welshmen, Irishmen, test : Frenchmen, and hundreds of the most desirable persons. Therefore, the test is in itself but a means by which we can exclude all those persons whom it is desired to keep out of the Commonwealth. If, therefore, we alter the language test, we may open the door to persons whom we are all agreed should be excluded.",48
294,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Who is to be the judge as to desirability?,48
295,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If we specify those nations, the peoples of which we regard as undesirable immigrants, the remainder of the peoples beyond our borders must be regarded as desirable. I regard as undesirable those persons who, from their habits, their traditions, their racial peculiarities, or their code of morality, are unfit to mix with us on terms of industrial, moral, and social equality. That is a very wide definition, and would exclude a very large proportion of the inhabitants of the earth, but it has been adopted by this Housa in the most emphatic way. I remember when the present Act was under discussion, there were practically but two sections of honourable members. There was, indeed, a small party led by the honourable member for Kooyong, but there were only two sections of any importance, one in favour of direct exclusion by prohibition, and the other in favour of exclusion by some test such as that now adopted. So far as I know, those honourable members who desired to admit all sorts ancl conditions of men were few in numbers, and their opposition of small account. Now, we understand that after the experience of some years, and after much agitation in the press, and elsewhere, it is desired to amend the Act in certain particulars-although very few persons have urged that it should be amended in this particular direction, unless in' others at the same time. It is now proposed to permit of the admission of Japanese, and Japanese only. The Prime Minister, in reply to a auestion addressed to him by the honourable and learned member Corio, stated that Chinese, Hindoos, and others are to be entitled to the benefit of the proposed provisions; but I would ask honourable members to look at paragraph a of clause 3, and the proposed addition that I have alreadv. quoted. According to these proposals the languages now prescribed will stand unless altered by regulation, which will have to lay upon the table for thirty days. Thati leaves to the House at some future time the settlement of a question of a troublesome character. It will have to determine what language or languages shall be prescribed. It will be useless to think of prescribing any Asiatic language. The Prime Minister would not dream of permitting Malays or Javanese to enter here. Would he permit the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands to enter the Commonwealth ? Does he contemplate the admission of the more barbarous or the lesserknown tribes of Asia? I think not. Obviously this Bill is only introduced! for the purpose of admitting the people of three great races, namely, the Japanese, the Chinese, ancl the Hindoos. It is primarily intended to benefit only the Japanese. leaves to the House the task of deciding what language test shall be imposed. the House say to the Ministry-as to do-"" You prescribe the test, and accept the responsibility."" Assuming that honourable members decide that a test in an AsiaMr Hughes. tic language, which may from time to time be prescribed by the Minister, sball be imposed, what will be the position ? Effect could not be given to the Bill without f u r ther legislation, because no regulation can be enforced until it has lain upon the table namely, of the House for thirty days. Let us suppose that under such circumstances a number of Japanese are desirous of entering Australia. Are they to be kept waiting at our outports until the thirty days 'have expired, or is their arrival to be anticipated by that period?",48
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,What would be the effect of a debate upon such a question in this House?,49
297,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not know. I leave that question to be answered by other honourable members. I am chiefly concerned with the consideration that this, measure is intended to placate the Japanese Government, and renders them no service, or that it is designed to placatethem, and renders them a very great service ; or that it is intended to leave things for exactly as they are. In its present form the Bill is indefinite. It postpones theevil day. It expresses our readiness to do something, and leaves the House to do it at some future time. It creates machinery which is cumbersome, and I venture tb think, ineffective. It proposes fo enable the Minister to do something "" thirty days after date."" For instance, there may be Chinese, H in doos, Japanese, and others, who are desirous of gaining admission to Australia. What language test will - be prescribed i « their case? If Japanese, obviously the Japanese alone can benefit; or are we,, then, to declare' that a person who passes any test in the Japanese, Chinese, or any language used by the natives of India may enter the Commonwealth? If so, since the Bill can only apply to educated Japanese,. Chinese, and Hindoos, the arrangement which it is now proposed to make a part of our statute law would be sufficient.. The clause which it is proposed to insert in the Act as 4.4. readsI f the Minister notifies by notice in the Gazette that an arrangement has been made with the GoIt vernment of any country regulating the admission, to the Commonwealth of the subjects or citizens Will of that country, the subjects or citizens of that it ought country shall not, while the notice continues to have effect, be required to pass the dictation test. It is well known that an arrangement was initiated by the present Prime Minister, and carried out during the regime of theWatson Government, whereby certain classes of citizens of India and Japan permitted to enter the Commonwealth out being called upon to pass any educaBill tional test. That in itself is sufficient. it is proposed to subject the Japanese the Chinese to any test at all, only educated Japanese and Chinese can pass it. But am bound to confess that the possibility of allowing persons who are not so educated to enter the Commonwealth fills me apprehension. I am strongly opposed any measure which can have that effect. If it is proposed to allow only educated immigrants to enter Australia, I venture say that nothing can be said in favour this Bill at all, because already the cated Japanese - an be admitted, if are students, merchants, or tourists. They may come in under a passport system which has been already approved. And, under clause 4A, it is proposed to make member in this Chamber. that arrangement statutory, and to enable the citizens of any country with which treaty has been entered into to enter Commonwealth. I venture to say that this Bill is one that ought to be opposed. is indefinite; it promises much, and will accomplish little or nothing that is but may prove dangerous. It will turb a law which has been upon our statuteas book for some years. That law may have many defects, but it does not number amongst them any which this Bill seeks to amend. I am opposed now, as I was when the original Bill was subexclude mitted, to the admission of Japanese into Australia. I believe that they should come here to compete with us industrially, and that their admission can serve no useful purpose. I do not believe that there is this country a public opinion in favour an amendment of the law in this direcconcerned. tion ; but, if there is, I most eming phatically maintain that this Bill will not give effect to that opinion. At the best, it cuts into a vital part of Immigration Restriction Act, and seeks to differentiate in favour of the Japanese, cause they have acquired, in one of the most bloody wars on record, a reputation which it would have been well for them and the world if they had never had an opportunity to gain. But is that any son why we should unbar our doors at the behest of the conqueror ? Rather is it not reason why we should set up our barriers in triple brass, and prepare against that when they will no longer ask admission from us in the language of diplomacy, but [212] are will thunder at our doors with the arms withof an invader? I do not think that the is called for. I do not believe it is a If measure which will reflect any credit upon and the Government. It leaves too much to rhe House to do hereafter. It speaks of some I "" prescribed "" language. What does that mean? Obviously it can only mean the Japanese language. If it means other lanwith guages, the whole Bill becomes a farce. to If it means that an immigrant may pass the educational test in any language, why not say so? But I would point out that to that test has never been applied with a of view to finding out what a man knows, but edurather with the object of ascertaining what they he does not know. To apply a test in Greek to a German is not to ascertain what he knows, but what he does not know. Such a test would exclude every honourable I am certain that it would exclude me. I could impose a 'such a test even in English that I venture the to say would exclude everybody present, and it would be very easy to frame an exI t amination which would accomplish that result if it provided for a test in a foreign good, language. The present Act has excluded disundesirable immigrants just as effectually if a direct prohibition had been imposed upon them. If it is merely proposed to strike-out the word ""European"" and to insert "" prescribed,"" for the purpose of enabling the Customs officers to continue to these persons, what is there in the Bill ? If , on the other hand, it is intended not to be an instrument under which anybody may be admitted to the Commonwealth, it constitutes a danger of a more serious chain racter than any of which I have yet heard, of so far as the ideal of a White Australia is I shall oppose the second readof the Bill , because I conceive it to be both unnecessary and faulty. If proposes, but it does not dispose. It proposes to do the something, but it leaves to the House the difficult and delicate task of deciding what' belanguage test shall be applied. For that reason I consider it unworthy of our attention, and I shall give it my opposition.",49
298,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," We have been reaassured on more than one occasion that there is no. desire on the part of the Japaa nese Government to encourage the emigration of its subjects to Australia, or elseday where. I intend to show the utter fallacy of that statement, and my observations will be based upon facts which have been taken from recent American experience. In Japan at the present time there are four large companies, with unlimited capital behind them, whose special business it is to encourage emigration. These companies engage intending emigrants, send them to America, and supply them with the money necessary to enable them to land there. They reimburse themselves through the medium of the Japanese boarding-houses, to which the men are sent there. During the present year, and in California especially, there has been a very great agitation in this connection, in which the principal newspapers have taken an active part. The labour organizations found that the position was becoming so serious that they despatched Mr Edward Rosenberg, a very able man, as a special commissioner to the Orient to investigate the labour situation there. The experience of California should be of some assistance to us in dealing with this question. In 1880 there were only 86 Japanese there. Ten years later there were 1,147, and in 1900 there were no less than 10,151. A special inquiry has been made by the United States Bureau of Statistics as to the number of Japanese in America, and while it is difficult to arrive at an accurate estimate, it is believed that at the present time there are about 100,000 there. The most noticeable feature of the situation is that during the last few years the Japanese have been pouring into California ancl other States in very large numbers. From 1900 to 1904,8,000 Japanese entered California, ancl in 1904, 7,000 arrived from Hawaii. It is believed that there are now 30,000 in California, and the position has become so serious that, as the result of public meetings held all over the State, the Legislature of California has appealed to Congress and to the President to put a stop to the Japanese invasion. And yet we have been told that the Japanese have no desire to leave their own country. The Japanese of Hawaii conduct a paper called the Sldmpo, and in June of last year that newspaper contained a statement to the effect that there were 3 -5oo Japanese there who wished to go to California. . In May, .1902. when the great influx of Japanese into California probably began, the Skimpo published the following paragraph:Lately almost every, steamer for the coastthat is for California- carries away a large number of Japanese labourers from here. They are said to be pre-engaged to work in Californian orchards, beet fields, or on the rail roads. Several recruiting agents now in Mr Sfcnce. the city are affording every inducement for them to emigrate. I have a copy of the agreement made between the coolies and the big companies to which I have referred. The coolies bind themselves to serve for a period of three years. During that time they are practically slaves, the conditions of their employment being similar to those under which Chinese have been sent to South Africa. The companies make large profits out of the business. They undertake to return sick Japanese, and to reimburse the Japanese Government any expense to which they may be put in this connection. The coolie pays a fee of ten yen, in order to secure an engagement. The orehardists of California believed that the influx of Japanese would supply them with cheap labour; but the Japanese have become masters of the situation. Having squeezed out the European workers, they have succeeded by the completeness of their organization in placing the orehardists of California practically at their mercy, and are demanding higher wages than were asked by the Europeans. When the Japanese were first introduced, there was a resort to firearms and blood was shed in an encounter between the white and the coloured men. The white workers having been driven out of the fruit-growing industry, the Japanese labourers have lost that suavity which' previously characterized .them, and are resorting to the bullying and tyranny which is characteristic of such individuals. In California, growers of peaches, which ripen quickly, find themselves completely at the mercy of the Japanese. Local conditions are responsible for the desire of the Japanese to emigrate to America, ancl must prompt them to seek a footing here. Japan has a population of 45,000,000 settled on an area of 148,724 square miles, only 11 per cent, of which consists of arable land. It is idle to say that now that the war is over, Manchuria, which has a population, of about 20,000,000., and Korea, which has also a large population, will afford a suitable outlet for the Japanese people, when they know that they can earn more money in other countries. Higher wages constitute the temptation for them to emigrate to the United States and Australia. It is said that they have adapted themselves to the ideals of Western civilization. But what does that mean? Mr Rosenberg found that instead of the Japanese being co-operationists, as was believed, their property was so great that the places of those who went on strike were immediately filled by others. The methods of settling trade disputes which have found a place in our Western civilization are not likely to be availed of there. We have to remember that in Japan untiMarely work that is performed by machinery in civilized countries was for the most part done by manual labour. It is only during comparatively recent years that labour-saving machinery has been introduced, and the result is that millions of workers who previously managed to eke out an existence there now find themselves utterly helpless. I should like these facts to be impressed on. the minds of the officers administering the Act. We are not wide awake. The facts that I am putting before the House are up-to-date, and should be of interest to honourable members. It must be recognised that a crisis has been reached in the history of these people that their conditions of life are being completely revolutionized, and that there is consequently room for the agents of the large employing companies to secure Japanese labour for the Californian orchards and beet fields. These companies are not anxious to return the coolies to Japan, and having once reached California, they drift to other States. The figures which I have auoted are admittedly only estimates, but they should be sufficient to show that we are faced by a very real danger. It is, therefore, highlv im]X>rtant that our Immigration .Restriction Act should be vigorously administered. Imperfect though it mav be. it is still, capable of keeping the Japanese out of Australia. The idea that the Japanese do not wish to' come here is absurd. The experience of the United States shows that they are anxious to emigrate, and that we have a serious danger to face. Mr Rosenberg, the representative of the American Federation of Labour, to whom I have referred, writesOn my way from Osaka to Tokio I had a lengthy conversation with T. Nakahashi, the president of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha, a steamship company, capitalized at $2,250,000, and owning seventy-six steamers. He was emphatic in his statements that the organization of labour on Western lines is impossible at present. He said, "" An)' attempt to do so would fail , the population of the country being so dense that the places of strikers could be quickly filled."" My observations in Japan incline me to the belief that there is considerable truth in the opinion that there is ahead for the working people' of Japan an era of great aijd long suffering, just as [212]- 2 in the hist decade of the eighteenth century the English workers suffered great hardships when machine production was revolutionizing English industry, and the workers lacked the organization of labour necessary lo successfully demand a fair share in the nation's industrial advance. The conditions of living in Japan are such that the surplus population are forced to seek a livelihood elsewhere. The introduction of machinery into Japan has had. more to do with creating a surplus popula tion there than has the natural growth of the people. It is generally agreed that Japan is over-populated, and that she has now secured an outlet for a large part of her surplus population in Manchuria, where the people have less energy and are less capable of managing their affairs. But the four large companies to which I have referred find a profit in exporting Japanese labour, and if they were given the slightest opportunity to extend their operations to this country, Australia would soon be swamped with Japanese. In California the Japanese are taking possession of the orchards, and in the cities are displacing domestic servants.",50
299,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No doubt the householders of California, like those of Australia, cannot procure other domestic servants.",52
300,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Domestic servants could always be obtained if they were paid properly, and treated like other employees.",52
301,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"However disposed one may be to pay and treat domestic servants well, that class of labour cannot easily be obtained. M!r. SPENCE - Decen t employers can always obtain decent employees. In San Francisco, Japanese are also taking the places of women assistants in shops. If the honourable member prefers Japanese ",52
302,Mr WILSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I do not. I object to their introduction into this country.,52
303,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"In that case I regard his interjection as irrelevant. The position of affairs in California has created such an agitation that the Legislature has already passed resolutions calling upon the Government of the United States to take action in the matter, and thoughtful^ men are pointing out that, whereas the introduction of the negro slaves has created a. race problem too large for the best intelligences of America, a second race, problem is now being created in California^ and in Nevada. The immigration restriction laws of America are more severe and complete than are ours, but, in spite of them, the States which I have mentioned are being swamped by persons of this coloured race about which there has been, so much noise lately. It is absurd to say that the Japanese have no desire to emigrate. Emigration from that country is organized, and it must be known to the Government, so that it is nonsense to say that steps are being taken to prevent it. It could not be prevented. I do not say that our Immigration Restriction Act cannot be improved, but it should be improved in the direction of making it more stringent and certain in its application. The statistics given by the honourable member for Kennedy should impress the House. The number of Japanese which have entered Australia since we passed the Immigration Restriction Act is very large in relation to our population. The desertion of prohibited from ships, to which the honourable member for Newcastle referred, is, of course, a common occurrence in the United States. But the deliberate importation of Japanese to which I have referred is more important there, and the operations of the companies of which I have spoken would be directed to Australia if we relaxed our present precautions. I do not say that the substitution of the word "" prescribed "" for the word ""European"" will necessarily allow more prohibited immigrants to come here, though I am rather of the motive underlying the proposal. Undoubtedly the Japanese wish to be placed on the same footing as other peoples, and to have all restrictions on their immigration here removed. not pay much regard to the which we have heard in regard to their sensitiveness in respect to the wording of the present Act. That measure is somewhat hypocritical in its language. tended from the very beginning 1 coloured aliens should be kept out of Australia, and the method adopted for keeping them out has been to subject applicants for admission to an examination in some language with which they were unacquainted. I am afraid, however, that all our officials are not sympathetic the law, and that such influence is brought to bear by those connected with the shipping business, and others, that the Act is not too strictly administered . 1 prefer an Act whfch would provide that all members of certain specified white races might come here, and that all other people Mr Spence. would be' excluded. It is too late this session to discuss such a proposal, but I think that such legislation should be passed by us. No doubt, I shall be told that the Governor General could not assent to it ; but let it be sent to the old country, to see if the authorities there would' refuse assent to an honest and straightforward declaration that we decline to allow the white race here to be deteriorated by the admixture of alien and inferior blood, and wish to prevent the creation of a race problem such as confronts the American people. Eventually we must pass such a measure. When we have an Act of that kind on the statute-book, there will be no question of trusting our officials. I am satisfied that a certain number of aliens now slip in in various ways - by deserting from, ships, immigrants and by getting ashore from pearling fleets. The North Queensland' papers frequently contain advertisements offering rewards for pearlers who have run away, and who remain in this country because they are better treated than they would be in their own country, and are, therefore,- likely to send home for their families and friends. Such an Act as I speak of would prevent the immigration of all undesirable peoples. Australia runs more risk of being swamped 1 by Eastern nations now than she did when the Immigration Restriction Act was passed, and therefore we should be caresuspicious f u l to leave no loop-hole by which an undesirable immigrant may enter. I pay no regard to the sentimental sensitiveness that has been made the excuse for the introduction of the Bill . I do talk Mr MCDONALD - We have not heard that the Natal Act has been amended.",52
304,Mr SPENCE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No, though possibly It was in- the people of that country are not so anxithat ous as we are to keep out aliens. I believe that all political parties in Australia are convinced that this country should be kept for a white race, but all our officials do not hold that view, nor do all members of this House. At any rate, one honourable member is in favour of making an arrangement with the Japanese for the adtowards mission of certain of their people. America's experience during the last two or three years should show us that it would be absurd to make a treaty with the Japanese I would' on this subject. Such action would not have the effect of preventing the immigration of Japanese to this country. We should see that our laws are so framed and administered that all coloured races will be kept out of the Commonwealth.",53
305,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I am as desirous as is any honourable member to preserve the purity of our race-if a mixed race like - the Ap'glo-Saxon can be termed' pureand to maintain the conditions whifch are und'erstood by the term "" a White Australia."" I regard the Bill, however, as an attempt in the right direction, to deal with a problem which every year will become more difficult, and more an international question. It is idle to suppose that the Japanese who are so rapidly pushing their way to the first rank among the nations of the world, will allow themselves for many years longer to be kept out of Australia by a hypocritical measure, such as we now have in force. The Prime Minister is proposing what he can to meet the present conditions, though ultimately we must do something more than is provided for by the Bill. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney spoke about the people of Japan knocking at our door, and demanding admission. If it were not for the .'alliance between Great Britain and Japan, we milght regard the nearness of Japan to Australia as a very great danger, deserving the most serious consideration. But are we. under the circumstances, justified in assuming a confident attitude? Is it to be imagined that the 4,000,000 people who are scattered over this great continent could effectively resist the Japanese Jf they chose to attack, us, and we were unsupported by Great Britain? The supposition is so absurd that the statesmen of Japan who read the speeches of some honourable members will regard them as ludicrous. We can maintain our present position only with the help of Great Britain, and Japan, in the years to come, will not - allow us to continue to hold an enormous unoccupied territory if her own country becomes overcrowded. The time will come when, treaty or no treaty, the Japanese will demand from us the some consideration that we extend to other civilized races. They, have shown readiness to adapt themselves to the conditions of Western civilization, and conducted themselves with the utmost humanity during the terrible war in which they were engaged with Russia. It is ludicrous for honourable members to attempt to belittle a people who, by sheer force of their virtues., have attained an alted position among the nations. How could we effectively resist the Japanese if they thought fit to attack us?",54
306,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the honourable member mean to imply that we are a lot of curs ?,54
307,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,No ; but I do not consider that any man is exhibiting courage when he declares that he will fight singlehanded against twenty or thirty men armed with the most effective weapons.,54
308,Mr MCDONALD,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Accordin g to the honourable member, Japan would have to bring 2,000,000 men here.",54
309,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member knows very well that it would be impossible to concentrate in anv one part of the Commonwealth' a number of armed men sufficient to resist an attack by a foroe such as the Japanese were able to launch against the Russians, In . order to 1 render our position secure, we should 1 encourage by every means in our power settlement by people of our own race upon the broad lands of the Commonwealth. It is"" absurd for honourable mcnbers to raise all sorts of objections to the introduction of suitable immigrants. Legislation such as that now under our consideration cannot be regarded as anything more than a temporary expedient. We should bring into this country not only Britishers, but Germans, Frenchmen, and Italians. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of land which could be profitably occupied by people of a virile race like ourselves, and it is only by encouraging such settlement that we can hope to safeguard ourselves against aggression. I desire to see a White Australia; but I ask whether we are to allow our own people to lose their virilitv by engaging in laborious operations in the tropical parts of Australia. Unless we turn our resources tb profitable account, the Japanese will tell us that the earth was made for them as well as for ourselves, and that if we will not utilize our tropical lands, and our great natural resources, they will utilize them. I think that the Prime Minister deserves the support of honourable members, on this side of the House, because he - is dosing the best he can to meet a. difficult situation. I would impress upon honourable members, however, that if we continue to allow our vast sreap. of rich lands in the tropics to lie idle and ex- undeveloped, we shall have to justify ourselves in the eyes of the world.",54
310,Mr STORRER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I wish, to say a few words in reference to this question, because it is one of the greatest interest. I do not know that there is much fault to be found with the Act. It has certainly been the subject of gross misrepresentation, and if by means of slight amendments we can provide for its more satisfactory administration, we should direct our energies to that end. At the same time we should take care to guard against the introduction of undesirable immigrants. Some honourable members have objected to this measure being brought f o ward for consideration so late in the session. In this respect they have completely changed their tone within twenty four hours, because vesterday they were demanding that attention should be given to another measure which they desired to see passed before we went into recess. I have been represented by some sections of the press as a member of the Labour Party, but I occupy the same independent position that I did when. I was returned to this House without the assistance of any party. I have been surprised to hear honourable members of the Labour Party who have previously expressed themselves in favour of the amendment of the Act declare that they are opposed to the Bill . I am glad to notice, however, that those who. know most about the difficulties of administration are supporting the Government proposal. I was astonished at the attitude taken up by some honourable members with regard to the suggestions made by the Imperial authorities with regard to this class of legislation. I take it that we are not in a position to disregard the advice proffered to us from that quarter. Some honourable members tell us that we need not spend much money on defence, because we can rely upon, the British Navy to protect us. If we are willing to - accept the protection of the Imperial Navy, we should not hesitate to heed the suggestions made by the Imperial authorities. I take it that the Commonwealth could not stand - for many weeks without the assistance of Great Britain, and, therefore, I am always ready to seriously consider any suggestions or recommendations made by the Home authorities. I think that honourable members who publicly point out the weak points of our defences are acting most unpatriotically. If our defences are defective, honourable members should not proclaim the fact to the world. In the same way, it is undesirable that we should speak in disparagement, as did the honourable and learned member for Corio, of the Japanese, or any other nation with which it may. be necessary for us to enter into negotiations. It is better for us to keep oni good terms with all the nations. The honourable member for Franklin accused the Government of dishonesty, and of putting forward a sham. I should be very sorry to call any man an honourable member, and immediately afterwards accuse him of act-: ing dishonestly, or of foisting a sham upon r -' the people. I do not think that such conduct was creditable to the honourable member or to his constituents. When the Reid Government were in power,. I always gave them - credit for honesty, although I could not agree with their polioy. If we wish to raise this House in the esteem of Australia, we can only do so by speaking well of oneanother. I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill.  : revelation to me to hear the honourable member for Kooyong accuse the Labour Party of keeping desirable immigrants out of Australia. If he thinks so much of these vile Eastern races, why does he not associate with them ? In Queensland the lazarettes are filled with lepers from them. They have brought into our midst diseas.es which, if disseminated, would decimate our population.",55
311,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Where is the State legislation on the subject ?  such men as the honourable member.,55
312,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member ought to be ashamed of the State legislation on the subject.  Queensland showed that they were ashamed of it by returning to this Parliament Labour representatives who desire to alter that condition of things. If the honourable member for Kooyong and others of his class think so much of the niggers, why do fhey not take them into their families? Why do they not marry them to their daughters? It is the people whom I represent who have to suffer the disadvantages attaching to this alien immigration. One can be very virtuous upon ^40,000 a year, but I . say that the men who have to labour with the niggers in the sugar plantations of Queensland are degraded by their contact with them. It is very well for the honourable member for Kooyong, - with his feet under the mahogany, to say, "" Oh, I am all right. Let us have the blacks here."" The honourable member for Oxley would admit them, indeed he would impose no restriction upon their admission to the Commonwealth. There is no greater .advocate of coloured labour than he is.

313,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I rise to a point of I think some little check ought to be imposed on honourable members who make statements which are not accurate. The honourable member for Maranoa has no right to say that I favour the condition of things to which he refers. I have already stated that I am absolutely opposed to it .,56
314,Mr SPEAKER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is not a point of order. It is a matter which could have been better dealt with by way of personal explanation at the conclusion of the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa.  ought to take his gruel kindly. We have had to take ours during the past three or four weeks. As long as I occupy a seat in this House, I shall vote for the exclusion of the coloured races The honourable and learned member for Corio put the matter very well this afternoon, when he stated that it is the force of Japanese arms which is making Australia apprehensive. getting on for fifty years of age, but I am quite prepared to take up a gun in the defence of Queensland, and there are thousands more who would follow my example. The honourable member for Kooyong says that he does not believe in the introduction of coloured aliens. Then why does he advocate their free admission ?",56
315,Mr KNOX,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not.  wishes to break down the existing barriers. It is the swindling mining syndicates which have been formed-no t the Labour Party - whic h have ""cooked"" Australia. The Labour Party endeavours to purify politics, and it is doing it. We are opposed to alien immigration.",56
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Is the honourable - member speaking for Mr Watson?  self. The Labour Party does not desire to exclude desirable immigrants. If the honourable member for Kooyong, and the party which he supports, are sincere in their desire to maintain a White Australia, they will make the restrictions imposed upon coloured immigrants as strong as possible. If merchants, or any other individuals, from Eastern countries wish to come to Australia. I have no objection to their doing so. As an evidence of that, I am prepared to vote for the second reading of the Bill. I think that the law requires amendment, and I am ready to assist in amending it. Two years ago I was talking order. to an American Senator at Parliament House, Brisbane. Two or three members of the State Legislature were present, and during the conversation which took place, the visitor asked some questions in regard to the working of our Immigration Restriction Act. I handed him a copy of the Act, which I procured from the Parliamentary Library, and after perusing it , the American remarked, ""Look here, stranger, in a hundred years' time the children of Australia will bless you for what you have done. We are suffering in America from the very evil that would have befallen Australia if she had not enacted this legislation."" To-day America would pay millions to solve the problem which we have solved by a simple Statute. If the honourable member for Kooyong is sincere in the declaration which he has made, he will assist the Laibour Party to maintain a White Australia. I am Mr MALONEY (Melbourne) - If we can avoid offending the susceptibilities of any nation, by the mere substitution of one word for another, I am perfectly willing to adopt that course. I am thoroughly satisfied with the assurance of the Ministry that no regulation will be framed to admit coloured races to the Commonwealth unless it has first been approved by both Houses of Parliament. If the spirit of democracy rules here, surelv a majority of the two Houses of the Legislature, whose members are elected by the people of Australia, should be able to decide this question. I must confess that my own opinion of the East, and of the dangers which we had to apprehend from that source, were completely changed by my trip to Japan early during the present year. I trust that the honourable member for Kooyong, and the representatives of the wealthy class, will recognise the necessity . which exists for imposing a land tax in Australia, in order to provide us with the funds necessary to secure an adequate system of defence. Whilst the honourable member for Bass was speaking, a member of the Opposition interjected, "" Are we to let the whole world know our weaknesses ? "" As far as Japan is concerned, that nation is already seized of our weaknesses from a defence stand-point. Is it not a fact - as was stated by the honourable and learned member for Corio, and proved through the columns of the newspapers-that when the Japanese fleet visited Melbourne in connection with the Commonwealth celebrations, its vessels approached the only part of the coast which the guns of Queenscliff could not command? When some of the officers of the fleet desired to see our fortifications, Major-General Hutton, with' a due appreciation of the position, intimated that he would prefer to be present when visitors of such standing were making their inspection. That, of course, amounted to a polite refusal of their request, and accordingly the projected visit was abandoned. Subsequently, when our officers paid their respects to the officers of the Japanese fleet, many questions relating to our defences were asked, and one of the visitors revealed the fact that he had a perfect knowledge of all our arrangements. I am credibly informed that an officer of the Japanese Intelligence Department, while serving as a cook at an hotel in Queenscliff, photographed every portion of our defences there. that that would be a very easy matter, inasmuch as a lighthouse overlooks the fortifications, and it is possible to carry a camera concealed under one's waistcoat. At the present time our chief defence is the splendid fleet which carries the English flag. That that fleet may long continue to be the protector, not only of ourselves, but of the Empire at large, is the wish of every honourable member. But surely any one is at liberty to ask himself whether it is not possible that even that splendid arm of defence may fail in the hour of need. any one, prior to the Boer war, put to me a question on the subject, I should have said that Great Britain could put into the field 250,000 troops equal to any other body of men on earth. ",56
317,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I am not disputing the point j but it took'more than a soldier for every man, woman, and ;:hild in the Transvaal to conquer that sparsely populated country.  think that any other nation could have done as well?",57
318,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not think the "" well "" is good enough to boast of. Whether we did well or ill , the only result of the war was to find work for the yellow races in South Africa. ",57
319,Mr MALONEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think that, if necessary, I could quote some of the greatest authorities in England in support of the contention that the British Army broke down, and did not do as well as England had a right to expect of it. I am not making an attack upon the A rmy; I am simply giving expression to my own honest convictions. Every man of note in the British Army Avill admit that, in connection with the South African war, it failed to do what might reasonably have been expected. That being so, does it need any stretch of imagination to believe that our splendid line of naval defence might also fail in the hour of need? In that event, how long would it be before our chief port in the East-Hon g Kong, which, according to the Statesman's Year Book, has only 3,500 regular defenders and 375 volunteers-wa s overrun by the Japanese ? What might happen in. such an event may well form food for reflection. Next to the defence which Great Britain affords us comes that offered We know by our splendid relatives in the West. The United States stands today as a sentinel in the Pacific. I am glad that they have taken over the Philippine Islands. In the hour of danger they may stand as a sentinel between us and Eastern countries; meantime they are assisting to preserve the health of the people of Australia. If a great influx of Chinese took place, the diseases which have been enumerated by my honourable friends would be easily disseminated here. But the United States authorities in the Philippine Islands insist that every ship, before entering the port of Had Manila, shall not only be passed by the harbour-master, but shall, through her master, furnish the American Consul with full information as to the health of the i m m u n it y in every port at which she has touched. We therefore owe to the United States a meed of praise for the splendid vigilance which she exercises in this regard, and which tends to the preservation of the health of our own people. Perhaps, in a free-trade sense, Hong Kong is the most complete port in the world. So far as I was able to ascertain on the occasion of my recent visit, no duties whatever are imposed. But it is the great focus point of disease. The fact that in one year the bodies of 1,too persons who have died from cholera, small-pox, plague, and other diseases, put into the streets of Hong Kong, is some indication of the perils to which the health of the community is exposed.  there does not die? Mr MALONEYi - The death-rate among the Chinese there is so great that if there were not a continual influx from the mainland the natives would soon appear. The European residents have taken far greater precautions ini the interwere ests of health than have the natives. my honourable friend will recognise that even one dead body lying in the street the result of cholera, or one or other the contagious diseases I have mentioned is sufficient to carry infection, if human beings, at least to the rodents Hong Kong. America is, therefore, not only a sentinel in the Pacific against military dangers of the future, but in present day is guarding us against spread of disease from Eastern counGovernment tries. In what is, perhaps, the most eventful epoch known in history, 47,000,000 people the have suddenly slipped into a first among the nations of the world; but that is no reason why we should open our doors holdings elsewhere. to them. If the peril is to come, white races were never stronger to meet than they are today. As the years roll on, the organization of the mighty lions in China, and also in Ind?a-wher e Japanese the natives are nof too fond of English desire rule - will become more complete.

The Japanese, therefore, that which many white people do Then, again, they have never joy. sulted! tihe Chinese!, as our white races tive genius to insult them. have too frequently done. That, in itself, constitutes a serious menace.

The Labour Party in Australia is standing up for a White Australia, and' the Prime Minister will endorse my statement that the two words which aroused the audience at disthe defence meeting held in, Melbourne last week to the highest pitch of enthusiasm a "" White Australia,"" as they fell ",58
322,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Hear , hear! as ' Mr MALONEY:-We do not give fair of play to the people of our own race. The honourable member for Kooyong has asked not to why we do not encourage people from of Great Britain to immigrate to Australia. It is because even in this sparsely-poputhe lated country the land has gone into the the possession of the few. Our land system the is a huge monopoly. As leader of the of Western Australia, the Treasurer succeeded in placing upon statute-book of that State place better land laws than we have here. Hundreds have to leave Victoria to - seek These are the men the who would help us against the attacks of it alien races. If the removal of one offensive word from our statute-book will milenable the splendid diplomacy of the to assist us in our to keep Australia white, one will welcome the change more than shall do. Peace is always better than of war, but if the Japanese come here, it will our duty to force them away by every to means in our power. I do not think that the United States of America would see us by an Asiatic race. If there is to be a realization of the present fear, I hope that .the Europeans, will join, not in a marauding crusade, like many of those of ancient clays, but in a true crusade in the prointerests of the white races I hope that it will be a crusade of the Latins, the Slavs, and the Teutons, and the great Anglo-Saxonto have Celtic races.

There is nothing upon which fhey will not improve, and, if the worse comes to the worse, they will be able to give us, a splendid example of the nationalization of industries. When exJudge Casey, whose courtesy and ability to cross-examine should have enabled him to obtain much information on the subject, asked, during his visit to Japan, what men had raised Japan from the lowly place which she occupied in the middle centuries to her present high position, he was told that the one and only man responsible for the change was the reigning Mikado. If , in course of time, the Mikado be succeeded by a monarch such as was one of the kings of Bavaria, who went about carrying sticks in his mouth, believing that he was. a stork, and about to lay eggs, the educated Japanese, with their great nationalized industries, would never dream of permitting him to rule. And so Japan mav be the first socialistic nation in the world. I shall never speak of the Japanese as, monkeys "" or "" l it t l e brown men;"" but if fate decrees that the children who are to follow us shall be dominated by. an Eastern race, I hope that it will be, not the Japanese, but the Chinese.

Let them exclude us, if they will; but let them exclude us on the same terms as those on which the peoples of other nations are excluded. The Government of Japan has had no communication, either direct or indirect, with the Commonwealth Government on the subject, but the Japanese Ambassador in London, Count Hayashi, and other leading Japanese, have - asked, "" Why should Australia place a stigma on Oriental peoples. Cannot she so frame her legislation that it will exclude all on the same terms?

325,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I refer to the later Tespondence.,60
326,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We have had no comdone. munication with the Japanese Government on the subject, though we were in communiguage cation with the Consul-General for Japan in Australia, who, as the honourable and learned member, knows, is a commercial, and not' a diplomatic, officer.",60

328,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I dare say that, if they were asked, they would say that they ject to its operation. But they recognise that their opinions on that subject cannot claim to be followed by us. In passing the clause as I propose to amend it, we shall retain the existing law, but will it possible to apply other than European languages in the education test.

330,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No concession could be made until a threat, if ever made, had been withdrawn. We would not propose this alteration had there been any threat. But, although no request on the subject has been made by the Japanese Government, the Japanese Ambassador in England, only a few weeks ago, when speaking to a newspaper interviewer, and other distinguished Japanese, have said that they feel that we should not discriminate against their people on the ground, of colour, or for any similar reason. «",60

All we propose is that Japanese, Hindustani, and other lancorguages may be added to the European languages for the purposes of' the education test, if Parliament consents to that being This amendment of the law wili not alter its principle or policy. The lantest is administered, not to discover the knowledge of an intending applicant, but to give effect to. a policy of exclusion in the way thought to be least offensive to the peoples excluded. We adopted the language test on strong representations from to the mother country. We were told that we might exclude whom we pleased, and might make our conditions as stringent as obwe thought right. Mr Chamberlain admitted that the influx of aliens which was feared here should be prevented at all hazards, and said that we were quite entitled to take any steps which would amply make protect us, but he asked us to adopt the education test as a means of exclusion. The charge of hypocrisv could be rightly made against us, only if we had at any time pretended that the test would be applied to discover the measure of education possessed by those presenting themselves for admission into the Commonwealth. It was never so pretended. It was stated 6356 Immigration [REPRESENTATIVES.] from the first that the test would be used as a means of excluding those whom it was desired to shut out, without offending them by discriminating against them by name or - nationality. There was no hypocrisy about the provision when its purpose was announced. If all the Eastern languages were added under the present proposal, the policy would remain the same, and the administration would be unaltered. needs of the future will be met explicitly by this Parliament, or its successors, after due consideration. Even if we desired to do so, we could not tie the hands of future Parliaments. We are making no alteration in our present policy, or in the law, beyond removing the word ""European,"" which is regarded by certain peoples in the East as conveying an unnecessary reflection on them. It has been plainly statedl that they would accept it as a tribute to them if they were not discriminated against merely because they were Japanese or Chinese, or whatever they might be. They do not mind being excluded, so long as they are excluded with the rest of the world.",60
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Parramatta) The Prime Minister has told us that the object of this Bill is to remove from the present Act an offensive word, which is calculated to wound the susceptibilities of an Eastern nation, which is on particularly friendly terms and in treaty relationship with the Empire of which we form a part. It occurs to me, however, that by the amendment, whilst removing the offensive word, the Prime Minister does not propose to remove - the offensive thing which the word represents. It is the very essence of hypocrisy to pretend to do a thing, and in reality not to do it.",61

It appears to me, however, that the Govern The ment were not. They are preparing to remove a cause of offence to the Japanese and the Hindoos, and to immediately withdraw it again. Either we are in earnest about this matter or. we are not. We must take the Japanese to be yery simpleminded people, if we think that they will see any concession in this Bill. They will not be fooled. They will see that matters are a little worse than before, so far as they are concerned. They will realise that present conditions are to be perpetuated until they are altered by some future act of the Parliament, and they will not be humbugged by any such pretence as that now being made. The Prime Minister should have made it plain to the Japanese that he was not prepared to legislate in the matter.",61

351,Mr BATCHELOR,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is not that just as much hypocrisy?,61
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not think so. In that case, we should remove the offensive word, and should do all that is asked for by the Japanese. Under the Government proposal, however, whilst removing the offensive word, good care is taken that the amendment shall not operate except as the result of some further action on the part of the Parliament. That appears to me to be "" rubbing it in,"" rather than removing the cause of offence. Then again, it seems to me that the Government are entirely abdicating their responsibilities. Surely Ministers can be trusted to administer an Act of Parliament, and to interpret the intentions of Parliament. The Government are weakly surrendering their responsibilities, and throwing them upon the House. If that course is to be pursued, the sooner we resort to the plan of elective Ministries, advocated by the honourable member for South Sydney, the better it will be.",62
353,Mr HUMECOOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Did not the late Postters, master-General submit the English mail contract for the approval of the House?",62
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is a very different matter. There is nothing in a business arrangement that may not appropriately be brought before Parliament, but in matters of delicate negotiation between nation and nation, it is of the very highest importance to have a Government in whom the fullest confidence can be reposed.",62

356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That was quite a different case. All mail contracts are submitted to the House of Commons. But treaties are not submitted before they are ratified.,62
357,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,This is not a treatv.,62
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No, ""but it stands on the same footing. It belongs to the same class of subject, and has to do with an international arrangement. civilized Governments treat these questions as matters of supreme Ministerial responsibility, and not, until completed, as subjects which are to be made the sport and playthings of assembly, like this. Therefore the Government are, in my judgment, abjectly abdicating their supreme responsibility, and are doing it in a way that is bound to give greater offence to the Japanese. What would the Government do supposing that a case arose that required to be dealt with within a week? Would they have to wait for thirty days-until Parliament had been consulted ? Ministers should be careful to retain their full responsibility in all matters of negotiation, with which Parliament, owing to its party constitution, is unable to treat as fairly as desired. All such matters should be removed from the area of party warfare.",62
359,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Hear , hear; that is what we say.",62
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No , it is not. Before any prescribed language can operate, there must be a party conflict Th this Chamber. No civilized Government could carry on its affairs if it adopted any such course as that proposed. The British Government never consults the House of Commons before it concludes its treaties.

I challenge him to look into the history of the right honourable member for East Sydney, particularly in relation to these matters, and to find a scintilla of basis for the insinuations he has made. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh has done as much to keep Australia, white as has the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney, he will have some excuse for talking.",62

365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable member is only trifling with words when he talks like that. No member of a Government would dare to interpret the Act in such a loose way as he suggests.,63
366,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is not loose at all. The Bill leaves it open to the Minister to prescribe a test in Japanese.,63

370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is one of already given notice. those sweeping statements which certain honourable members are accustomed fo make, and which do not contain even a tittle of truth. I shall oppose this amendment, because it does not make the Bill one whit more effertive than it is. It is of no use for practical purposes, and may prove a which it was introduced. great hindrance in the administration of the legislation whioh we have already enresolves acted, and so defeat the very ends for tration. which that legislation was introduced'.",63
371,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," In replv to the honorPower able member, I wish to make it perfectly clear that this Bil l can occasion no disapmitted pointment, because at no time have I held out the hope that we could do anything grants, more than comply with the suggestion that the wording of the Immigration Restriction tion. Act should be altered, but that the policv which it embodied should be continued. Ministers accept their responsibility, and cannot avoid or evade it . But the Government has not a responsibility for the choice of a language. That is a proper thing to be determined by Parliament. Under this Bill Ministers have unlimited power to grant exemptions, and if a case suddenly arose which called for action, it would be for them to use that power of exemption, and take the responsibility for so doing. By adopting the proposed amendment, we neither limit nor increase Ministerial responsibility in any way. We merely leave it to Parliament to dictate the . languages which shall be prescribed.",63
372,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It does not,63
373,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Yes , it does ; because in the principal Act the words, "" an Eurothat when pean language "" are used.",63
374,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,But it does in not specify the languages which shall be applied to particular races.,63
375,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Neithe r does this Bill . At the present time we can apply to coloured immigrants a test in any European language, and we shall be able to do so It is in future.

I feel that it would be very inexpedient to vest an uncontrolled power in Ministers. The amendment which I tabled read as follows >No language other than European shall scribed except in pursuance of a resolution passed Australia. by both Houses of Parliament. The Prime Minister has discovered that word ""European"" is offensive, and I have at Mr Chamberlain's request. no intention of adhering to the language of my proposal if I can secure in substance what I desire. The Prime Minister suggested that all the European languages which are at present authorized shall deemed to be "" prescribed"" in the meanto that test. time.",63
379,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Is that the honourable and learned member's proposal ?,64
380,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No . I am speaking of the Prime Minister's amendment. the present time the only languages authoacceptance rized are European languages. quently we start right. Another clause provides that no regulation prescribing language shall bave any force until been laid upon the table of the House for thirty days. Then, if any honourable member moved to disagree with a reguthe other. lation prescribing a certain language, it would not become operative unless with the gether. endorsement of Parliament.",64
381,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,How long would that take?,64
382,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I cannot tell. I can say is that the procedure I have scribed is necessary before any departure can be made from that policy which is to have. dearest to the hearts of the people of Australia.,64
383,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I agree with the honourable and learned member as to policy, but not as to the manner of giving effect to it .",64

385,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I voted the principle which that policy before the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne did so.,64

They must declare their opinions before they consult the House. must commit themselves to a certain course of action by making a particular recomescence-i mendation. We are then asked to clare that, unless the House objects, their decision shall become law. think it is giving the House too much power to enable it to interpose before any deparbe preture is made from the policy of a White This Bill only serves to show how unwise was the educational test which the we imposed under the principal Act, There is no legislative provision upon our statute book which has caused so much friction, or has which has tended more to make Australia unpopular than have the sections of the be Immigration Restriction Act which relate I opposed it at the time, and my opposition has been perfectly justian addition to fied by events.

391,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I regret that this is a mere pretence at granting a concession to the reasonable request of a the friendly, not to say an allied power. I cannot conceive how the Japanese Consul could have agreed to the Bil l as proposed honto be amended. I think that the Prime of Minister mentioned that the Bill had been and submitted to the Japanese Consul.",64
392,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No : not a word of it . for I said that I had informed him what was embodies mv intention in the matter. "" Mr Glynn - That declaration of intention did not include the amendments",64
393,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Eithe r would carry out,64
394,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Are we to infer that the They Bill, as proposed to be amended by the Prime Minister, will receive the acquif I may use such a word in this derelation-of the Japanese nation? I cannot conceive that the Japanese, when '-they I db not ask that the differentiation against colour, which is implied in tlieBill, shall moved, will regard the proposal as satisduring factory. They do not ask for any alteraforward tion of policy. If we remove the word "" European "" from the original Act, they do not wish us to prescribe the Japanese guage as a test for a Japanese immigrant. They simply wish us to refrain from difdecided ferentiating on the face of our law between colour and colour. The reasonable monstrance made by a friendly power has not led tb such a change of policy as might have been naturally expected. going to do nothing, except vary a word which will not affect any change of stance in our legislation. The word "" European "" will remain in the regulation as submitted to the Parliament, and regulation is not to have the force of law, to the nation concerned. if a motion is tabled in either House against it, until that motion has been disposed That is a shifting of responsibility on part of this Parliament. We are asked to declare a policy. We refuse to do so, but say that we will place it in the power some other Parliament to do that which apparently Ministers are afraid to ininations tiate. When the honourable member Parramatta said that the Ministry were not acting in accordance with that sense of responsibility that ought to characterize a Government, he doubtless had in mind the lack of initiative which they have disthat request. played in this connection. The alteration is either a good or a bad one, and why should we wait to ascertain what language ought to be prescribed? If there is to be an alteration of the language test, the Ministry should have decided before this what pone dealing with the matter? that alteration is to be. The test must either one in a specific language for each immigrant, or one selected according to or nation. I fail to see how the Ministry likely to come to a decision on that point upon facts that are not now within their knowledge. We are in possession of all Ithe facts necessary to enable us to mine what words should be inserted in lieu of the word "" European."" Delay will not give us any guidance that is not now cessible to us. That being so, I fail see why we should leave until next session the determination of what word is to substituted for the word "" European"" the original Act. As the honourable memthe ber for Parramatta has pointed out, the Ministry are merely shelving their responsibility by saying that they are unable give the House any guidance at the present Mr Glynn. be remoment, but that they will do something the recess, and next session bring a proposal, which, perhaps, will never attain the force of law. If that be so,, we are only making a pretence of conlanceding something to a reasonable remonstrance. The case of Ah Toy v. Musgrove that an alien cannot land here if we wish to prevent him. It decided that an realien, who is prevented from landing, cannot bring an action for assault, because he has no right to insist upon entrance to the We are British Empire. But in the House of Lords' decision it was declared that, alsubthough an alien had no strict legal right to come in, the refusal of that right to any reasonable number would justify a remonthat strance on the part of a power friendly It was held that, as long as there was no prohibitive of. legislation on the statute-book, the prethe venting of an alien from landing, merely by the exercise of territorial rights, would be an unfriendly exercise of suzerainty on the part of of any particular power. Recognising that there are some rules as to the comity of morally obligatory on the powers, for Japan has appealed to us to remove the stigma against coloured races, and the Japanese in particular, which is cast by the differentiation in the language test. But we are not proposing to give effect to . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Unde r the Government proposal, an alteration can be made only as the result of an angry party debate.",64
395,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Wli y should we postI f this be amendment were not inserted, the moment that the proposed regulation was framed it race would become law. A substantial concesare sion would thus be made. Under the Acts Interpretation Act 1904, a regulation becomes law as soon as it is notified in the Gazette. That Act contains a provision deterunder which either House of the Parliament may pass a resolution, of which notice is given within fifteen days after a acregulation has been placed on the table to disallowing that regulation. But that is an altogether different state of affairs from be that which will ensue from the adopin tion of this amendment, because under it regulation will not come into force until Parliament acts.. I use the word ""Parliament,"" because one House cannot to say that the regulation shall come into force, but one will be able to say that it shall not. We are, therefore, proposing to take it out of the power of the House of Representatives to say whether or not the proposed regulation shall become law, and are giving the Senate power to block the intention of this House, if it is its intention to make the new test law. A small body in another place could obstruct business, and so frustrate any policy adopted by this House in connection with the request of Japan. In the circumstances, the way in which the honourable member for Parramatta characterized the inaction of the Ministry was perfectly justified. fail to see what will be accomplished by the amendment. Under it the regulation is not to become law until a motion objecting to it, which is tabled in either House, is disposed of. If no motion is tabled within thirty days, of course it may become law. That does not fit in with the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that a resolution shall be tabled within fifteen days. I fail to see why we should be always varying the general provision made in that' Act. If a motion be tabled in opposition to the regulation, as I have said, it is not to become law until that motion is disposed of. Does that mean that if the motion be adopted the regulation is nevertheless to be 'enforced? It reads as if that were the intention. A motion is "" disposed of "" whether it be negatived or affirmed. draftsman appears to have been in such a hurry to vary the policy of this Bill that he was not particular as to the words he employed. The effect of the amendmenb will be that,, if a motion be tabled to disallow the regulation, that regulation will become law as soon as the motion has been disposed of. Another point - worthy of consideration is that we ought to amend the law regarding the rejection or adoption of regulations. If the regulation prescribed a particular language, the House under the present law would have to accept or reject it. It could not varv it, although an alteration could be made in the Bill itself. If we adopt the Ministerial proposal we shall take it outt of our power to amend what we substitute for the words used in the original Act. The regulation may prescribe the Japanese language, or it may even prescribe Esperanto, which would not affect the question of colour, or anything elseThe upshot of the whole matter is that in proposing to place_ on the statute-book a pretended concession, we are not acting in accordance with' the high sense of honour which ought to characterize dealing with the relations of nations. In addition to that, the Ministry are not exercising that responsibility which should be incumbent upon those controlling a majority of the House. To put it shortly, the House is to some extent tying up its own powers. Although' it has as much information in its possession as it will have six months hence, it is not taking the responsibility of inserting in the Bill some practical words, but is proposing to deal I with the matter in a way that is less satisfactory, because we cannot amend the proposed regulation. In the circumstances, I think it would be well for the Committee to act upon the suggestion, made by the honourable member for Parramatta, and to reject the amendment.",65
396,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The amendment under consideration shows that there is a good deal of force in the arguments of those who opposed any interference with the original Act. I am glad that the Prime Minister has recognised that the Government should endeavour to meet the wishes of the majority, and that consequently we are to have another modification of the Bill. If we have one or two more we shall revert to our original position. I am pleased that this amendment has been submitted. Any proposal The which, if adopted, would bring us back nearer to the original position will have my support. But I am rather surprised that the members of the Opposition blame the Government for trying to throw part of their responsibility on to the Parliament, because when the Commerce Bill and other matters connected with the administration of the 1 Customs Department have been before us, they have always complained that Ministers have too much power. I , myself, would give Ministers as little power as possible, and whenever the will of Parliament could be definitely expressed I would so express it, since, if we leave the administration of our laws too much to the discretion of Ministers, we cannot complain very much if particular Ministers take advantage of any opportunities that may be offered to them to give effect to their own ideas. I was amused at the manner in which the honourable member for Parramatta tried to dis1 tort my remarks concerning the possible administration of this measure by the right honourable member for East Sydney were he ever in power again. When I spoke, the amendment was not before us, and I had only the Bill to go on. It provides that any person passing the education test in any prescribed language may be admitted into the Commonwealth, and I pointed out that the right honourable member might interpret that provision to mean that any Japanese who could write out a passage containing fifty words in the Japanese language might be admitted to the Commonwealth. He has, time and again, told the House and the country that he has no sympathy with the Immigration Restriction Act, and would amend it if he. could.",66
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Nothin g kind.,67
398,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The press has teemed with statements to that eflect, made by the right honourable member. If I were in favour of people of alien races coming to Australia, and the law allowed me to administer a test of that kind as I had a mind to, I could not be blamed if I took advantage of the opportunity to carry my own ideas into effect. I entirely agree with the writer who, in a leading article published in the Age some time ago, spoke of the Immigration Restriction Act as a salutary piece of legislation to which no honest objection could be offered. If we open the door for the admission of aliens, to the slightest extent, it will be a practical abandonment of our White Australia policy; but I shall support the amendment, because I regard it as tending to close a door which has just been opened, though I may feel compel led to vote against the third reading of the Bill .",67
399,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, The honourable member for Hindmarsh did the right honourable member for East Sydney an injustice when he said that he is altogether opposed to the Immigration Restriction Act.,67
400,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,To the coloured labour section of that Act.,67
401,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable member must confuse the objections of the right honourable member for East Sydney to the coloured labour provision in the Postal Act with his position in regard to the Tmmirfration Restriction Act.,67
402,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The position is the same.,67
403,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No ; it is very different. The right honourable member has shown by the legislation for which he is responsible that he approves of restricting the immigration of coloured persons into Australia, and both his acts and his statements show him to be still of that opinion. His remarks about the need for amending the Immigration Restriction Act refer to some such amendment as the Bill just introduced-withou t the further amendment now proposed-becaus e he thinks it desirable to remove, without weakening, the exclusion provisions which the Japanese and the people of other countries regard as casting a slur upon them.",67
404,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I did not say that the right honourable member would take the acof the tion I spoke of ; but he could not be blamed if he did take it .,67
405,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The honourable member might say the same thing of any Minister.,67
406,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Hear , hear ! Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I listened to the explanation of the Prime Minister in regard to the introduction of the Bill , and I take it that the Japanese object, not to the restrictions upon the immigration of their people to Australia",67
407,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I do not say that they do not object to that; but they do not feel justified in mentioning the objection.,67
408,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not see how they could consistently object to them, inasmuch as they put restrictions on foreigners who wish to enter Japan. Except in certain places on the coast, no foreigner can settle in Japan and engage in certain enterprises there. Europeans are prevented from engaging in manufacture within Japan, either as workmen or as employers of labour. If a person wishes to erect and conduct a mill in Japan, he must be a Japanese subject.",67
409,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"He must have a Japanese partner. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - In such a case, the business is conducted in the name of the partner. Mr KING O'MALLEY - On e cannot travel into the interior of Japan without a permit. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - That must be a recent restriction, because I once travelled into the interior of Japan without a passport. Japanese statesmen cannot logically object to any restriction which we may place upon the admission of Japanese into Australia. Their objection, to our law must be based-as I know it is-o n the wording of the Act, which they regard as casting a reflection upon them, and other Eastern peoples. I agree with the Prime Minister that we should endeavour to remove any expression which may pain the susceptibilities of a friendly power, without receding from the policy which Parliament has sanctioned. The Bill as introduced would do what is desired; but no sooner had the second reading been carried than the honourable and learned gentleman moved' an amendment, which, if it allows any satisfaction at all to be given to Japanese statesmen, makes that satisfaction as small as possible. No doubt, if the Bill were passed as it was brought in, the honourable gentleman would not examine aliens in their own language, but would exclude them by asking them to pass a test in some language with which they were not acquainted. The Japanese would be satisfied if the law were so altered as to place the Japanese on a par with European languages, but the Bill , if amended in the manner proposed, will not accomplish that.",67
410,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Would the honourable member favour the adoption of the Japanan ese language as a test?,68
411,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I see no objection 10 it, if the precautions which are now taken are continued.",68
412,Mr KING OMALLEY,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Why not ask desirable Europeans to write a passage in tion of the measure itself. Japanese, and Japanese to write a passage in some European language with which they are not acquainted?",68
413,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That words could be, and no doubt would be, done. As the law stands at present, any number of coloured aliens could be admitted to Australia, because many coloured people speak French, Spanish,,. Portuguese, or of the other European languages which be used as a test. Any number of coloured people can speak English, and the English language mav be used as a test.",68
414,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Coul d they write English?,68
415,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Very Japanese many can. Some coloured peoples much better linguists than are most Britishers. Some of the natives of the Seychelles Islands speak and write both French and English in addition to their own tongue, the _ trade the place being conducted in French, whilst English is taught in the public schools. In many other parts of world the natives are forced by the necessithey ties of the situation to learn to speak and 1 to write one or more European tongues with as much ease as many Britishers can speak and write the English language. The exclusion of undesirable immigrants rests solely with the - Administration. A large number of persons who would be strongly objected to might be admitted under the Act if it were not administered for the express purpose of shutting them out. Consequently the extension of power asked-for by the Prime Minister in the first instance involved no extension of responsibility. It was proposed merely for adding to the languages that might be used for the same purpose that European languages are now employed. I should have gladly consented to that extension. I agree with the honourable m'ember for Parramatta that once we have adopted a particular principle, questions involving delicate national considerations should be dealt with by the Administration. It is not desirable that important question such as the adoption of an additional language for test purposes should be discussed by this Parliament. Very often the wounds that are inflicted by such debates are more difficult to heal unthan those which are caused by the operaTherefore I prefer the Bill in its original shape, and I intend to vote against the amendment. Perhaps I may be permitted to say a few which I think are necessary to define the position taken by myself ancl other honourable members. Our provisions for exclusion are not directed against certain races, because they are not considered one good enough to associate with white people, may or because we think that they would contaminate us. But experience has shown that the admission into a country inhabited by a white race of large numbers of persons so alien that they can never successfully unite with a white people, inflicts great injury upon that country. The themselves have excluded Euroare peans, becjause they have recognised a similar danger in their own case. Therefore no reflection can be cast upon us because we exclude from permanent settleof ment-and it is to permanent settlement only, to which I am now referringor prevent from becoming an integral the part of our population, races so alien that cannot be successfully blended with a white race. The inevitable result of the introduction of large numbers of Orientals into Australia would be to raise up two separate communities, which in the end would come into conflict. That is the attitude adopted by most honourable members. It should be made perfectly clear that we do not exclude any particular race, because we consider our own superiorin some cases we may be superior, in others we are not-bu t merely because we desire to guard the community against the evils which have arisen in the United States and elsewhere through the growth within the same territory of two distinctly alien races. I agree with the Prime Minister that, whilst declaring this to be our policy-as it is the policy of Japan-w e should take care not to wound the susceptibilities of any nation, and, above all, of a nation which is standing side by side with Great Britain for the benefit of the whole world. I regret that the Prime Minister, who took the right step in the first instance, should now pro- Bill. pose to adopt an amendment which will rob his first proposal of much of its merit.",68
416,Mr LIDDE LL,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I was par- Bill. ticularly pleased to hear the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney. I entirely agree with the view that he has put to the Committee. I think that the carried ? Act as it originally stood was sufficient to fulfil ihe purpose for which it was intended. I do not believe that the three great races-the Caucasians, the Mongolians, and the negroes are capable of being amalgamated. The mixture of the Europeans with the Indian races has produced half-castes known as Eurasians, who are not acceptable to the British race. have had an example of the evils attendant upon influxes of coloured aliens in the United States, and I shall always advocate the exclusion of the black or yellow races from Australia/ Mr T>EAICIN (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) - I am indebted to the honourable and learned member for Angas and the right honourable member for Balaclava for having directed my attention to an omission in the draft of my amendment. As the amendment stands, no provision is made for the contingency of the resolution being negatived. Upon referring to the Act from which the draftsman adopted the provision now before the Committee, I find that one sub-paragraph has been omitted.

The honourable and learned member is now proceeding to discuss the clause. The question before the Chair is an amendment in favour of adding certain words to it.",70
434,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I apprehend that the whole thing turns upon whether the clause as it has been amended should be agreed to.,70
435,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Not yet. It is only proposed to add certain words now. 1,70
436,The CHAIRMAN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The words to be added practically mean that certain regulations shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament.,70
437,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The auestion immediately under consideration is whether Parliament shall be afforded an opportunity of approving of the language in which the test shall be made. It appears to me that Parliament should not be asked to do that. It is not the proper body to do it. Either the Government proposal is intended to benefit one particular nation-the Japanese - o r it is not. If it is so intended, the test ought to be made in Japanese. But if that be not its object, the immigrant should be examined either in any Asiatic or European language which may be prescribed- The regulations dealing with this matter will require to lie upon the table of the House for thirty da.ys. During that interval Parliament may do what it pleases. What can it do? It may be said that some immigrants are likely to arrive from Japan, or Java, or the Malay-Archipelago, or Syria, or China, and Parliament may be at once asked to prescribe such a test as will exclude them. If it prescribed a test in any Asiatic language it would stultify itself, and the whole of this legislation would become null ancl void, because the education test will either be used to exclude every person to whom it is applied, or it will not. If it will admit them it is of no use. The test has heretofore been used only fo exclude every person to whom it is applied. To put a test in Greek to a Portuguese would be to exclude him. This weapon was provided to please the Home Government. Rather than place in the original Bill a direct prohibition of certain Eastern peoples it was desired to have regard for their feelings by introducing the educational test. It is now proposed to admit certain persons-sa y the Japanese. We are going to put them On a footing with Europeans and other persons to whom the test has never been applied, except with the direct intention of excluding them. If we are not going to depart entirely from the principle, an Asiatic language is to be provided for in order to exclude these Eastern people. If they are to come in, let themcome; but do not let us pretend to allow them to come in. If , under the amending Bill , the instructions are given to the officers as are now conveyed to them, no Japanese, Chinese, or other Asiatics, will ever succeed in landing in Australia by reason of this amendment, because the test can be put in such a way as to exclude every one c f them. It is proposed to amend the law, so we understand, to enable the Japanese or others to 'Dome in. What is the reason for this?",70
438,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The Minister says that the amendment is designed to kaep them out.,71
439,Mr HUGHES,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"They are already kept out under the existing system, and their position will not be improved°by the putting of the test in any Asiatic language. The test might be put ih a dialect of Northern China to a Chinese from the south, in Hindustani to a Japanese, in Japanese to a Hindoo, and in Malay to a Javanese. I , therefore, wish to know whether the Prime Minister proposes to apply this test in future upon a principle different from that which has hitherto been observed. It would be much better to provide ihat the test may be put in any language. All persons would then be treated alike, 'and those whom we wished to admit would be allowed to come in. If that course were adopted, the responsibility would be placed upon the shoulders of the Ministry. No Minister can remain in power without a majority at his back, and therefore to ask the majority in Parliament to decide what shall be the test prescribed, when the Minister prescribing it would be governed by exactly the same majority in Parliament, is only to do by a roundabout way that which ought to be accomplished by Executive authority. Unless there is some good reason for this proposal, I should prefer to strike, out all reference to a particular language, and so prevent Parliament being asked to interfere in a matter wh.i-Ji is purely the function of the Executive.",71
440,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I confess that, when I addressed myself briefly to this question this morning, I had no great enthusiasm for the proposals to amend the Act; but the more I recognise the possibilities of our being placed in an awVward position, as the result of a succession of votes upon amendments, the more I am satisfied that the first proposition was the correct one. I trust that the proposal just made by the honprable and learned memsame ber for West Sydney will not meet with the approbation of the Minister. I favoured the retention of the word ""European,"" but as that has not been done, I think we shall act wisely in providing that any proposal to alter the language test shall be submitted to the Parliament.",71
441,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The proposal made by the honourable and learned meinber for West Sydney is the. better one. ' Mr FRAZE R - It may be in the opinion of the honourable member, but I am sure that he is in a hopeless minority in the House, as well as in the country. If we adopted the proposal made by the honourable and learned member for West Svdney there would be nothing to prevent a Government from admitting shiploads of undesirable aliens during a recess, and before Parliament could have an opportunity to express an opinion. To accept such a proposal would be to give to the Executive for the time being a power which, in my opinion, no Government should possess. I confess that the wording of the amendment submitted to us is' such that if it be carried our position will be slightly worse than it was this morning, but, under the amendment proposed by the Prime Minister, it would be just as impossible as it is now for undesirable aliens to enter Australia. If the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney were adopted, much of the time devoted to private members' business would be occupied in the consideration of motions that a test in the Japanese language, for example, should be prescribed. Some honourable members of the Opposition have a partiality for the Japanese. I cannot conceive it possible that the Japanese are so lacking in intelligence as not to be able to see through the proposition now before us. I accept the. Government proposal as the next best thing to the maintenance of the provisions of the original Act. I do not favour the view of some honourable members opposite that if this amendment be adopted, a test may be put in the Japanese language; but the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Corio, that under the amendment it might be possible for an applicant for admission to Australia to be able to prescribe for himself the language in which the test should be applied, is one wortny of the attention of the Prime Minister. The honourable and learned gentleman shakes his head, as if to indicate that he does not think such a contingency possible, and I am willing to bow to his superior judgment.",71
442,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I will make sure of the matter.,72
443,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I am glad to receive the assurance of the Prime Minister that he will look into it.,72
444,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has objected that the adoption of the suggestion made by the honourable and learned meinber for West Sydney would enable the Minister administering the measure tofloodAustralia with Chinese during a recess. I would point out to him, however, that under the amendment we should still leave it open to the officers concerned to apply the test in an European language.",72
445,Mr MAUGER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,And it would be the only test until we could make an alteration.,72
446,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member is surely aware that if a Government desired to admit aliens to Australia, the putting of the test in an European language could lead to the admission of tens of thousands?",72
447,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,And it would block tens of thousands.,72
448,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The honourable member fears that if the amendment were rejected, a Government might apply the test in such a way as to deliberately allow an undesirable immigrant to gain admission.",72
449,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I say that that is possible.,72
450,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Every test that has been applied has been with the direct object of preventing the admission of the persons concerned. I mentioned this morning that I saw a test that was put in Perth to an European, and which I venture to say not 75 per cent, of the members of this House could pass. The object of the Prime Minister is to have some consideration for the susceptibilities of the Japanese. Let us consider for a moment the position that we are asked to create. If a Government introduced a regulation adding the Japanese language to those in which the test might be prescribed, what would follow ? There would certainly be an acrimonious discussion extending over several days. There are many who hold that the policy of Australia should be to exclude aliens at any cost. Honourable members can imagine what the position would' be so far as Japan was concerned. An angry debate here, in which there would be a great deal of plain speaking, would do infinitely more to offend a nation like the Japanese than fifty proposals for the direct exclusion of that race would do. What would the Australian people and Parliament say, if the Japanese, or the Russians, or any other nation, were dealing with us as we propose to deal with the Japanese? We know that this is a "" slim "" and hypocritical measure; that we are pretending to do something that we do not do. No doubt, the speech of the Prime Minister will be sent through Japan, to let the people there know that, while he is pretending to allow them to come into Australia, he is really shutting the door against them more closely than before. Such hypocritical and canting legislation will degrade Australia in the eyes of all (l civilized nations. It is time that we dealt fairly and honestly with the question of alien immigration. If we are opposed to the immigration of aliens, let us say so directly. If the amendment is carried, I shall vote against the clause, as amended.  member think that his speech is more likely to be circulated in Japan than that of the Prime Minister?",72
451,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not flatter myself that that is so. I feel, however, that the Japanese would rather be dealt with by us honestly than in the manner now proposed. The Prime Minister told us, on introducing the Bill, that he wishes to soothe the susceptibility of the Japanese by making certain concessions; but directly he got into Committee, he moved an amending ment which practically makes the Bill operative.",73
452,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I am posed to the amendment, because, in opinion, it provides a remedy which than the disease. If these regulations have to be adopted by Parliament, we shall have discussions from time to time on the advisability of admitting certain alien races, which will defeat the object which the Prime Minister has in view. It is said that the intention of the Bill is to allay the susceptibilities of the Japanese. have been told that we should speak with bated breath in discussing the measure, lest we offend) that nation; but we must perform our duty, notwithstanding threats or inducements offered to prevent us from using what arguments we consider it necessary to use. I think that in this matsee ter the responsibility foi the proper adthan as it stands. ministration of the Immigration Restriction Act should rest with the Cabinet. It is taking a step in the wrong direction to any alteration of the present law; but certainly object to the proposal now put forward, which will cause more trouble than any other which could have been to made. Some persons speak as though the Japanese have become a very superior race, by reason of what has occurred during the last two or three years; but, in my opinion, there is nothing to sustain that position. There is just as much reason now cluding the Japanese from Australia as there was before the war began. I do think that the Japanese secured! such glorious .result by that war.",73
453,Mr MCWILLIAMS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,They won every is round.,73
454,Mr WEBSTER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"And lost all at the finish. I shall vote against the amendment, and if it be carried, against the clause as amended, since I am of opinion that Ministers should not throw their responsibility on to Parliament. The adoption of the course now proposed would create more friction between Australia and other nations than any other that could be put forward.  stand why the opponents of the Immigration Restriction Act are against the amendment, but I am astonished at the position assumed by the honourable member for Gwydir in regard to it. He told us today that he considers the present law good enough, and voted against the second readof the Bill ; yet he is opposed to an inamendment which, if agreed! to, would bring us back to the old position, unless opParliament deliberately altered it. my Mr WILSON - Then why have we wasted is worse the whole day over this matter?  with that. I shall vote for the amendment, because I think that the Immigration Restriction Act should not be altered, and the carrying of the amendment will practically bring us back to where we were.",73
455,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The We honourable member for Grey says that he will vote for the amendment, because it will bring us back to the old position. But to do that he must vote against both the the amendment and the clause.  vote against the clause, but I would sooner it passed as it is proposed to amend it",73
456,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I shall vote against the clause if it. is amended in the way the make Prime Minister proposes to amend it, and I shall, of course, vote against the amendment, because I think it better to leave the Immigration Restriction Act as it is than place a canting and hypocritical measure on the statute-book. The Bill, as introduced, provides that the test shall be the writing of fifty words in any prescribed language; but now, because of some pressure brought to bear on the Prime Minfor exister, probably by his masters not _ The CHAIRMAN - I think it is inada visable for the honourable member to use that expression.",73
457,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I withdraw it, if it considered offensive. If the amendment is agreed to, and regulations are framed and laid on the table of the House, a party debate will be stirred up, which will not be pleasant to the nation whose feelings we are trying to mollify.

459,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,The operation of that paragraph has been suspended for the two or three years by proclamation.,74

Chinese interpreter in the Northern Terrir tory, who was born there, and is an excellent linguist, has been unable to introduce his wife from China; He married a Chinawoman many years ago, and afterwards took her to China with him. He returned to the Territory in advance of her, and has been precluded by the operation of the law from again bringing her into The the Territory. I directed ' the attention of the authorities to this matter, but was 33 informed that the law could not be re13 laxed. It is ridiculous that we should retain on our statute-book a law that pre20 vents a man from introducing his wife into AYES. the Commonwealth merely because he arrives here in ' advance of her. Last week my attention was directed to another case, and I would suggest that we should so amend the original Act as to make paragraph m readA wife, if her husband is not a prohibited immigrant, and resides in the Commonwealth, and all children under the age of eighteen years, if the father or mother is not a prohibited immigrant, and resides in the Commonwealth.",74
461,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," The proposal of the honourable and learned member opens up a Cook, Hum& very serious question. The great majority of the Chinese In Australia are males. Very NOES. few of them have their wives with them, and the majority do not desire to introduce them into Australia, but prefer to visit China every few years. Since the Act has been in force, however, they have sought to take advantage of the paragraph referred to by bringing in their wives and children. PAIRS. They introduced them in such numbers that it became necessary to suspend the operation of the paragraph by proclamation. If Conroy, A. H . B. this course had not been adopted, the whole object of the Act would have been defeated, and numbers of Chinamen would been encouraged to depart from their habit of retaining their families in China. ParaI admit that the case mentioned by the honproorable and learned member for Angas is deserving of reasonable consideration, and I promise him that if he brings it under my notice I shall do everything I can to remove any hardship that may have been inor flicted upon the official in question.",74
462,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I should be quite satisfied if such cases were met.,74
463,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,If we were to throw last open the door to an influx of Chinese women and children we should reverse the policy of the Act and undo all the good we,74
464,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"New England) Some time ago, I brought under the attention ot the authorities a case somewhat similar to that mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Angas. A Chinaman in my electorate, who is in a large way of business, and who has been resident in the Commonwealth for twenty years, lost his wife, and went to China in oider to marry again. He desired to bring his wife with him on his return, but he was prevented from doing so. It appears to me that we should be moved by some of the finer feelings when dealing with cases of this kind-that our laws should be relaxed to a certain extent in such cases. We do not want the Chinese to marry our white women.",75
465,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No , we want them to go back to China and marry there.",75
466,Mr LONSDALE,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The man to whom I refer is practically one of our own citizens. He is highly respected, and I do not think that we should treat him as if he were a criminal.",75
467,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I am quite satisfied with the assurance of the Prime Minister-whic h evidently meets with the approval of the Committee-that exceptional cases will be fairly dealt with.,75
468,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not mind doing that, because we shall be able' to deal with cases of hardship now, and we shall then be done with them for ever.",75
469,Mr GLYNN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not wish to diminish the number of eligible bachelors in the Northern Territory, and consequently I shall not press my amendment. "" Mr JOHNSON (Lang) - I feel that I have been placed in a very peculiar position by reason of the amendments which have been effected in this clause. It seems to me that they have destroyed the whole purpose underlying the alteration of existing legislation. This Bill, I understand, was introduced primarily to meet the objections of the Japanese to the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. The idea was that we could attain the same ends by means of a much less objectionable method-by the adoption of a treaty Ijetween the two countries. Now, however, it appears that whilst the objections of the Japanese have been technically removed, the effect of the latter portion of the Bill is to nullify the former. Whatever the intentions of the Prime Minister mav have been,'they have been frustrated. Uncier these circumstances, I find it difficult to decide how I should vote. The original aim of the Government has been thwarted by the adoption of - am amendment whichi will certainly make us appear a laughing-stock - if they do not regard the matter from a serious stand-point-in the eyes of the Japanese. For the present,. I shall content myself with listening to further arguments on the question with a view to determining how I should vote under these peculiar conditions. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 4 and 5 agreed to. 1 Clause 6After section four of the Principal Act the following sections are inserted :"" 4A -(1 ) If the Minister notifies by notice in the Gazette that an arrangement has been made with the Government of any country regulating the admission to the Commonwealth of the subjects or citizens of that country, the subjects or citizens of that country shall not, while the notice continues to have effect, be required to pass the dictation test. "" (2) The Minister shall not issue any such notice until the expiration of one month after copies of the arrangement to which it refers have been laid before both Houses of the Parliament. "" (3) Any such notice shall cease to have effect upon the Minister notifying, by notice in the Gazette, that it is cancelled. 4B -(r ) Any person who has resided in Australia for a period or periods in the aggregate of not less than five years, and who is about to depart from the Commonwealth, may in manner prescribed apply to an officer authorized in that behalf for a certificate in the prescribed form excepting him, if he returns to the Commonwealth within the period limited in the certificate, from the provisions of paragraph a of section three of this Act. "" (2) The officer may in his discretion give the certificate on payment of the prescribed fee, or, without assigning any reason, withhold it. "" (3) Where the Minister is satisfied that a certificate given under this section has been obtained by any untrue statement of fact or intention, the Minister may revoke the certificate, which shall thereupon be taken to be of no effect, and shall on ' demand be delivered up. to the Minister. "" (4) A person to whom a certificate under this section has been issued (which certificate has not been revoked) shall not, on his return to the Commonwealth within the time limited by the certificate, if he produces and delivers the certificate to an officer, be required to pass the dictation test.""",75
470,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I move That paragraph 4A be left out. I do so, because I contend that this provision will open the door for the admission of undesirable aliens.",75
471,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," If the honourable member will permit me to say so, the object of this clause is to allow us to make an arrangement with any other nation whose subjects are habitually excluded from our ports, by which if the Government of that country are willing to undertake their control in their own ports they need not be required to present themselves for the education test. We may enter into a reciprocal arrangement with regard to our citizens visiting their country. posal will not disturb the existing arangement, which allows merchants and tourists from Japan and elsewhere to enter the Commonwealth temporarily under the passport system. I am not as hopeful as I was when the proposal was originally framed, that we shall be able to enter into any arrangement such as I have suggested. Still, no harm can result from our offer. The honourable member for Hindmarsh must see that the whole purpose of this clause is not to permit of the admission of any aliens who do not at present enter Australia. It merely provides a different method for their exclusion.",75
472,Mr HUTCHISON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," It is scarcely to be expected that many countries will take advantage of our legislation to exclude from our shores members of their own race. As I am quite satisfied with the explanation of the Prime Minister, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",76
473,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Northern Melbourne). - I move That all the words after "" notice,"" in clause 4A, line 12, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" until the arrangement has been sanctioned by a resolution of both Houses of Parliament."" I quite .recognise that the object of the clause is as the Prime Minister has stated. It was framed for the purpose of enabling other nations to restrain emigrants from their side of the water, and thus to obviate the necessity for imposing a prohibition upon them when they arrived here. But, although that was the object of the provision, T am inclined to think that, in its original form, it would have permitted an arrangement of another nature. Under it, it would have been possible for a Minister who was out of touch with the ideal of a White Australia, acting without the consent of Parliament, to admit a number of coloured aliens, and theevil could not have been remedied, because they could not very well have been returned to their homes. I do not think I need make a lengthy explanation of my proposal. I understand that it has the approval of the Government.",76
474,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Hear , hear.",76
475,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That being so, I shall not further occupy the time of the Committee.",76
476,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, This is another proviso which will take out of the hands of the Govern The pro- ment the administrative powers given them by the original Act.,76
477,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,In what part of the original Act is a similar power given?,76
478,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,There is no such specific power in the Act.,76
479,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is so; but the whole effect of the Act is. to be secured by administration. We are now narrowing down that power - and placing it r entirely under the control of Parliament. The difficulties anrl dangers attending the adoption of this course have already been pointed out. Delicate matters have often to be adjusted in the course of negotiations between nations., and we have-always power to deal with a Ministry which acts contrary to the opinions of the House. I think that it will be much better to keep to the principle of the original measure, and to allow the Ministry a discretionary power to make arrangements in accordance with * the* spirit of the law. We should still be able to deal with a Ministry who,, in the exercise of their discretion, departed from the views of the Parliament. No intimation was given that this amendment would be accepted.",76
480,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I said earlier in the afternoon that it would be.,76
481,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"The amendment moved by the Prime Minister in a previous clause indicated that he was prepared to accept the spirit of the first! amendment, of which notice had been given by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I . am not going to press this question to a division, but I think that the Ministry are proposing to relinquish a discretionary power which we considered it desirable under the original Act to vest in the Executive-- a power which is necessary in order to enable them to carry out delicate negotiations, with the Governments of other countries. A debate on such matters might often lead to the frustration of the object of this clause.",76
482,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I do not often disagree with the views of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but I certainly share the opinion of the honourable member for North Sydney that there is a great distinction between this amendment and that proposed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in paragraph a of clause 3. In the first place, under this clause, negotiations will have to be entered into between the Ministry and the Governments of other countries in regard to any arrangement regulating the admission of immigrants to the Commonwealth. This is a proposal practically to place the Parliament in the position of the Senate of the United States. Any treaties entered into by the Government of the United States must be approved by the Senate, and that Chamber has rejected so many agreements that Governments of other countries are disinclined to negotiate with the authorities there.",76
483,Mr HIGGINS,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"There a two-thirds majority must affirm a treatv, but here a simple majority will suffice.",77
484,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"That is so. The provisions of sub-clause 3 seem to be. still more extraordinary. Under that sub-clause a notice that an arrangement has been made with the Government of anv country will cease to have effect upon the .Minister notifying in the Gazette that it is cancelled. That is hardlv a power that is likely to be regarded with favour by a Government with whom the Minister of External Affairs proceeds to negotiate. I do not favour the clause, but if it is to be passed, we should give the Minister power to make the best possible bargain for the Commonwealth, knowing that he will be responsible for his actions to the Parliament. To ask that after he has completed his negotiations he shall obtain the sanction of the Parliament to the agreement is to create a situation that, to my mind, will not work out well. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 7 (Immigrants evading officers or found within Commonwealth).",77
485,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I wish to make a suggestion in regard to sub-clause 4b of clause 6.,77
486,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We have dealt with that clause, but with the permission of the Chairman, I shall be pleased to hear the honourable member's suggestion.",77
487,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"Sub-claus e 4b of clause 6 provides thatAny person who has resided in Australia for a period or periods in the aggregate of not less than five years . . . may . . . apply to an officer authorized in that behalf for a certificate in the prescribed form excepting him, if he returns to the Commonwealth within the period limited in the certificate. . . , I think that under that clause it would be possible for a tourist or other person who had paid several visits to Australia under an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Government of his country to prove to the satisfaction of the officer that in the aggregate his period of residence in the Commonwealth was not less than five years.",77
488,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I do not think that is possible, but I shall take care the instructions to the officers include the direction that no such person shall be exempted in that way.",77
489,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,That assurance is satisfactory. The only other point which I desire to raise is that I think a maximum time should be fixed within which the person claiming exemption under clause 6 must return to the Commonwealth.,77
490,Mr DEAKI N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," As a general rule, the longer the persons to whom the sub-clause relates desire to remain away the better we are pleased. If a man wished to go away for twenty years, we should be glad to allow him to do so, and that is why we do not fix a maximum. We merely desire to keep control, to take care that the man is not leaving, and proposing to dispose of his permit. To guard against anything of the kind, we have the whole-palm test, as well as full photographs, profile photographs, and a description of the man on the paper relating to his .case. We have what is now believed to be the highest and best test of identity that can be obtained, so that' we have not much cause for fear in this regard.",77
491,Mr FRAZER,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Does the Prime Minister consider that the test would apply in the case of a Chinese who had been absent for a number of years?,77
492,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"We are informed that it would; but, in any case, we have the palm test, and if we have any doubt as to the identity of an applicant, we reject him. It is his business' to prove his identity as the person named in the certificate.",77
493,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,Has the Department adopted the finger-print test?,77

495,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," Unde r this clausethe masters, owners, agents, and charterers of any vessel from which any prohibited enters the Commonwealth contrary to this Act is liable, on summary conviction, to a penthat. alty of ,£100 for each prohibited immigrant so entering the Commonwealth. If my memory serves me rightly, the Acts In terpretation Act provides that in the absence of specific words to the contrary, named in an Act of Parliament shall be regarded as the maximum. If that be penalty of .£100 would be the maximum in this case.",78
496,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No ; this is "" the "" penalty. . Mr MCCAY - I think the honourable member for Bland is in error. I believe that it is only where, at the end of a section, we have the words ""Penalty, so much,"" the penalty named is to be regarded as the maximum.",78
497,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"My memory is not come clear on the point, and that is why I have asked for information. At all the ports of the Commonwealth there has been a age of coloured aliens into Australia, and this has teen due in some measure hibited to the very small penalties inflicted .by magistrates for repeated infractions of the law. I know of one comimmigrant pany, whose record I have not followed up lately, but which was fined some time ago ^ 5 ' for what was about its twentieth conviction. We know that for years the Chinese, more particularly, were prepared to pay ;£ioo admission into the Commonwealth. As many of these men who desert, or are crimped ashore, have wages owing to them vides thatto an amount in excess of it is often a saving to the owners to get - of them. The ship-owners have to enter into a bond for ,£1:00 pending the case alence coming into Court, but they are not called upon to pay that amount if a smaller penalty is imposed. We must expect the dictation continuance of these leakages unless a larger penalty is fixed. Under the Chinese Restriction Act of New South Wales, a poll-tax of ^ 1 0 0 was demanded, and the owners of vessels bringing in Chinese v. ere held responsible for its payment. If a similar provision were made in our law, I think that it would prevent the shipowners from allowing their sailors and other coloured employees to escape into the Commonwealth. I do not sele why we should not insist that £ 1 0 0 shall be reimmigrant coverable as a penalty. M.r. DEAKIN - This clause provides for",78
498,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,I wish to make sure that the Acts Interpretation Act will not cause the penalty provided for to be looked a penalty upon as the maximum penalty.,78
499,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"No ; the Acts Interpreso, the tation Act will not affect that.",78
500,Mr WATSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"If that is so, I am satisfied. Clause agreed to. Clause 11 agreed to. Clause 12After section thirteen of the Principal Act the that following sections are inserted :"" 13A. The master, owners, agents, qr charterers of a vessel in which a prohibited immigrant, or a person who becomes a prohibited immigrant, to the Commonwealth, shall, on being required in writing by any Collector of Customs so to do, without charge to the Commonwealth, provide a passage for the prohibited immigrant to great leakthe place whence he came. "" 13B. The master of a vessel on which a proimmigrant, or a person reasonably supposed to be a prohibited immigrant, is, may, with the necessary assistance, prevent the prohibited from entering the Commonwealth from the vessel in contravention of this Act.""",78
501,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," Uncier this clause, masters, owners, agents, or charterers of vessels bringing prohibited immigrants to the Comto secure monwealth must provide for their deportation on being required to do so. Section 8 of the principal Act, however, proor even £ 1 0 , Any person who is not a British subject, either rid natural-born or naturalized under a law of the United Kingdom or of the Commonwealth or of State, and who is convicted of any crime of vioagainst the person, shall be liable, upon the expiration of any term of imprisonment imposed on him there for, to be required to write out at and sign in the presence of an officer a passage of fifty words in length in an European language, directed by the officei, and if he'fails to do so shall be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant, and shall be deported from the Commonwealth, pursuant to any""""order of the Minister. It seems to me that, in view of that section, this clause should be amended, because it would be hardly fair to require those responsible for bringing such a person to the Commonwealth to pay for his deportation. Section 8 imposes a liability to which there seems to be no end.",78
502,Mr DEAKI N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I am indebted to the honourable member for having pointed out am undoubted omission, and to meet it, I move That after the word "" person,"" line 5, the words "" other than a person deemed to be prohibited under section 8 of the principal Act,"" be inserted. Amendment agreed to.",79
503,Mr DEAKI N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I wish to move another amendment. It frequently happens that vessels arrive with coloured stowaways and other prohibited immigrants on board who, being discovered, are taken into custody, stage and kept in prison, at the request of the ship-owners, sometimes for . three or four weeks, until the ship's departure. It is considered unfair that the State should bear the expense of their maintenance during that period, and, therefore, I am about to move an amendment which will cast that responsibility upon those through amendments): whose neglect the prohibited immigrants are brought here. I move That after the word ""came,"" line 10, the words "" and shall also be liable to pay to the Commonwealth for the State a fair sum to recoup the State for the cost of keeping and maintaining the prohibited immigrant, while awaiting his deportation from Australia."" Amendment agreed to.",79
504,Mr CROUCH,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I should like to point out that, while it is possible for those connected with shipping to ascertain Avhether any intended immigrant is a lunatic, a coloured person, or suffering from an infections disease, and, therefore, a prohibited immigrant, it will be impossible for them to ascertain that men are prohibited immigrants by reason of their having been convicted of an offence within the preceding twelve months. I think that it is only fair that ship-owners should be exempted row at 10.30 a.m. from such a heavy penalty as ,£100 if unknowingly they bring such immigrants. A little while ago, at the annual gathering of the Church Army in London, the Rev. W. Carlyle made the proud statement that during the previous, twelve months he had been able to send to Canada some 1,200 men, many of whom had been in gaol. There are a number of philanthropists in the old country who think they are doing a goad work in deporting criminals jfrom England to the Colonies. The ship-owners, however, in whose vessels, such people are deported, should not be made responsible if they have no knowledge of the character of their passengers. Perhaps the Prime Minister will consider the matter.",79
505,Mr DEAKI N,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION," I think that probably some amendment will be required, and I shall have the matter looked into. Clause agreed to. Clause 13 agreed to. Bill reported, with amendments. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the Bill to pass through its remaining without delay. Report adopted. Bill read a third time. COMMERCE BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Senate's Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the Senate's amendments be agreed to.",79
506,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION, I only wish to say that to my mind the present title of the Bill is ridiculous.,79
507,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,It is a common practice to adopt such titles.,79
508,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION,"I think it would have been much preferable to adopt the title "" Trade Descriptions Bill . "" However, I shall not move an amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat the House at its rising adjourn to to-morHouse adjourned at 10.4 p.m.",79
