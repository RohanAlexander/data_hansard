3,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"I have received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that the Senate concurs with the resolution of the House relating to the amendments to the resolution of appointment of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. NA BILL (No.3) 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 August, on motion BUSINESS by MrGear: That the bill be now read a second time. Orders Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth) (9.32 a.m.) - I rise to support the Taxation Amendment Bill (No.3). This is a miscellaneous taxation amendment bill and has no central theme. I wish to concentrate on a few issues that are touched upon by the amendment bill. These relate to the question of regional headquarters of multinational companies in Australia, the new homechilq-care allowance linked to the dependent spouse rebate; and those provisions of the bill which affect child-care centres and the sales tax regime. At the' outset it is important to make some general points that relate to Australia as a taxing country. Firstly, Australia is a low tax country; and, secondly, the government is the low tax party. What we are trying to achieve in Australia-and we are making considerable progress-is a low tax, low inflation, high growth, high productivity, high employment, high wage country. Our low tax country and . low tax party status is reflected in the budget papers. It is always useful to refer to the budget papers in the course of debate. I refer to the 1994-95 Budget Paper No. 1. If one looks at the statements on revenue on page 4.3, one finds the following: Revenue in 1994-95 ... represents 23.7 per cent of GDP ... If one goes on to page 4.15 to see how that is raised, one sees an important comment which reflects路 the government's commitment to a low tax regime. It states: Factors restricting taxation revenue growth in 199495 are the full-year effect of: the personal income tax cuts introduced on 15 November 1993; and the company tax rate reduction and general investment allowance announced during the 1993 Federal election campaign. An important point in respect of taxation needs to be made. At the last election we on this side went to the Australian people with a commitment to reduce the company taxation rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, while those opposite went to the people with a commitment to increase the rate to 45 per cent plus a 15 per cent GST. While there is no central theme to this particular. taxation amendment bill, it reflects our commitment to low tax and shows the stark contrast between our commitment on this side and the commitment which those opposite took to the last election. I want to refer to the question of regional headquarters. In the course of his second reading speech, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said: In Working Nation the government announced a number of measures aimed at enhancing Australia's attractiveness as a regional headquarters location. The initiatives in this bill will improve Australia's attractiveness as a location for the Asia-Pacific regional headquarters of large transnational corporaAt tions, including Australian companies. The measures contained in this bill should provide a climate that attracts and retains multinationals without compromising the integrity of our taxation system. He went on to make the point that the cost to revenue of these measures is in the order of $40 million in 1994-95. This路 measure was one of those measures in the Working Nation statement which reflect the philosophy and the commitment behind Working Nation, the notion of 'growth plus'. That reflects two things: firstly, to ensure employment growth we need to maximise growth in the economy but, secondly, to ensure that the long-term unemployed are picked up as part of economic recovery, we need to take additional measures. That is reflected by the shorthand term 'growth plus'. There are measures which we will debate later today on the Notice Paper which reflect some of the 'plus' measures. These are contained in the Employment Services Bill. So far as maximising economic growth is concerned, the incentives to ensure that regional headquarters are located in Australia are simply a small part of the great range of measures which are incentives for investment in Australia. In the 1994-95 financial year there are in the order of $3 billion worth of incentives for investment within Australia either by Australian companies or by foreign companies. Those measures, which make up the $3 billion, go from accelerated depreciation. measures, the development allowance measures, the general investment allowance and the 150 per cent research and development concession. I have referred to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. They also include the amendments which we debated in the last session to pool development funds and also the incentives to improve investment in infrastructure by way of infrastructure bonds. It is worth referring to the Working Nation document to see that reflected in the statement. The Working Nation statement, chapter 3, which starts at page 51, refers to industry development policies. This chapter of Working Nation reflects in very many respects the notion of maximising growth in the economy. page 54 is a heading 'Key industry policy initiatives'. This reflects the range of measures that the Working Nation statement introduced which have the effect of maximising economic growth in our economy. Those measures included better access for smaller firms to research and development incentives, greater commercialisation of research and development, increased funding for science, improved investment incentives for pooled development funds, the expansion of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation facilities, better access to industry for government purchasing, improved export marketing and路 promotion, government enterprise programs brought together under the banner of Auslndustry and the one that we are expressly dealing with today, attraction of regional headquarters. On page 82 of Working Nation one finds in some detail the government's commitment to the promotion.of international investment and business linkages. The philosophy behind that is also found at the top of page 82: The Government will place a major priority on broadening and deepening the investment linkages between Australia and overseas markets. With increasingly mobile capital and a continuing demand for investment in newly industrialising countries, it is critical that government and business work together to promote the advantages of Australia as an investment destination. The statement goes on to say on pages 82 and 83: Regional headquarters (RHQs) provide a number of direct and indirect economic benefits to the Australian economy, generally stemming from the high skill and high wage jobs they generate. The direct benefits come from expenditure on locaUy produced goods and services and the taxation revenue paid by the RHQs and their employees. RHQs tend to have a strong demand for specialist professional skills, telecommunications, international travel and data processing. Indirect benefits come from management skills and know-how, the flow of business intelligence about markets in the region and the ability to influence the parent company. In referring to the measures which the Working Nation statement committed the government to and which are implemented by the bill before the House, I quote again from the Working Nation statement: Notwithstanding our many advantages, the competition to attract regional headquarters operations in the Asia-Pacific region is fierce, and the Government has recently put in place a number of measures aimed at enhancing Australia's attractiveness as a RHQ location. These include the provtsion of a wholesale sales tax exemption for imponed used computer and computer related equipment路for RHQ investment proposals . . . and the eligibility of RHQs for Feasibility Study Fund grants under the Government's Investment Promotion Program. The measures this bill effects are the wholesale sales tax exemption and credit for imported use computer related equipment, tax deductibility of certain costs of locating regional headquarters in Australia and the removal of withholding taxes on certain dividends distributed throughout Australia. Although this particular measure is a small part of the One Nation statement, accounting for $40 million in the 1994-95 financial year, it does reflect the government's commitment to maximising growth in our economy and reflects, hand in hand, the dual commitment the government has to ensuring that with economic recovery comes maximum ecooomic growth and with economic growth comes special additional measures to ensure that the long-term unemployed are picked up as part of the recovery. The second measure that I wish to refer to relates to the home child-care allowance. When considering the philosophy behind the home child-care allowance, it is important not to do as some people in the community and some opposite do, and that is to glibly make a contrast between the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate. The home child-care allowance is an important addition to a vast array of family support measures that this government has implemented. I think it is important to look at the starting point for the family support measures that the government has introduced. The philosophy of the government over the last 10 years in relation to the support of families has been to try to target assistance to families to ensure that those most in need are helped. That is reflected by the regime that is currently in place with the basic family payment and the additional family payment. As members will be aware, the basic family payment is available to families whose income is up to about $60,000, depending upon the number of children. The additional family payment is available to those families whose income is up to about $25,000. The precise cut off points vary depending upon the number of children. The amount expended on the basic family payment and the additional family payment is in the order of $5 to $6 billion per annum. That is $5 to $6 billion in recurrent expenditure to give assistance to low and middle income earning families in our country. The vast bulk of money for the additional family payment certainly goes to one income families. It is true to say that the majority of the basic family payment-given that we are looking at a cut-off point of $60,000-also goes to one income families. When one highlights the figure of $5 billion to $6 billion in recurrent expenditure for family payments, what amount goes to the home child-care allowance and what amount goes to the child-care cash rebate? The effect of cashing out the dependent spouse rebate will result in an annual recurrent expenditure of about $1 billion. The dependent spouse rebate and its conversion to a cash payment and the topping up of that cash payment which has taken place will result in another billion dollars being expended by the government to assist low and middle income families and, in particular, one-income families with children. So, in addition to the basic family payment and the additional family payment, another $1 billion is being expended on the home child-care allowance. So we are now outlaying between $6 billion to $7 billion by way of assistance to families. Approximately $230 mi11ion will be expended on a recurrent basis in order to top up the dependent spouse rebate. When the dependent spouse rebate is cashed out by these measures, it is also increased and rounded off as a $30 payment. The expenditure effect of the topping up of the dependent spouse rebate is about, $230 million. So that is the magnitude of the expenditure. As I have said, some people simply compare the home child-care allowance with the child-care cash rebate. That iSa glib and a faulty comparison which does not bear up to analysis. The total cost of the child-care cash rebate program per' annum' is about $155 million. Some $155 million per annum is being spent on the child-care cash rebate, $1 billion per annum is being spent on the home child-care allowance arid $230 million pet annum is the effect of the dependent spouse rebate being topped up to a $30 payment. That is in addition to the $5 billion to $6 billion that we outlay per annum in the form of .the. basic family payment and the additionaddition al family payment. Those opposite who argue that a negative comparison ought to be made between this government's support for people who care for their children' at home and government support for people who take advantage of childcare assistance measures need to ensure that glib and faulty comparisons are not made. They need to ensure that the total out lays on assistance to low and middle income families are part of the analysis. The home child-care allowance, which will provide a payment to parents at home with children, commences on 29 September 1994. It is effectively a$30 per week payment, the maximum payment being $60 a fortnight. Some important philosophical points need to be made about the home child-care allowance. The cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate sees the payment go directly to the carer of the child at home, which in the vast majority of cases is the mother, for the purposes of expenditure on the child. That is an important philosophical point. I also believe that, having made a commitment in the course of the election campaign ' and having i,mplemented that by way of I,egislation in the course of this parliamentary session, the government can look, at either increasing that payment or making that payment available per child rather than' per family. They are measures that we on this side should certainly look at. . During debate on this bill last night, I heard in passing those opposite making many criticisms of the home child-care allowance payment. As a result; I thought I might spend a bit of time quickly detailing some of its advantages. The first advantage is that it pro: vides direct recognition of the time, energy, effort and personal support devoted to children by a parent, generally a mother, who decides to stay at home and raise children. For the first time, that support is provided directly to the parent caring for the child. . Approximately 840,000 families throughout Australia are eXPected to receive the home child-care allowance at anyone time. That is the extent of this measure. This government provides assistance to 840,000 families, into the $5 billion to $6 billion recurrent that we provide in a targeted way to families by way of the basic family payment and the additional family payment. . As well, the cashing put of the dependent spouse rebate and the topping up to $30 per week increases by $4 or $5 per fortnight the amount that families could expect to receive by way of the maximum dependent spouse rebate. The point needs to be made that not all families are entitled to the maximum amount of the dependent spouse rebate. So greater assistance is provided to those families who can take advantage of only part of the dependent路 spouse rebate but who are not entitled to take advantage of it to the maximum extent. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 to 55,000 families are not able to take advantage of the dependent spouse rebate to the maximum extent. However, they will now be able to take advantage of the home childcare allowance to its maximum amount of $30 per week or $60 per fortnight. An additional point needs to be made with respect to the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate. It is true to say that the home child-care payment is more responsive to families' needs than the dependent spouse rebate. The current income test on spouse income will be used rather than the financial year test which is used by way of the dependent spouse rebate. A parent leaving the work force at any time during the year to care for dependent children will be able to claim the allowance immediately instead of waiting to re-establish his or her entitlement at the end of the financial year by way of the dependent spouse rebate. It is estimated that that will have the effect of assisting 100,000 to 120,000 families whose circumstances change in anyone year. So we have a more flexible regime; a regime that will ensure that nearly 850,000 families in Australia are assisted. About 55,000 families will be able to take the benefit of the payments to its maximum extent-a category of families which was not able to take advantage of the maximum路 dependent spouse rebate - and we will have over 100,000 families which will be able to take advantage of their c-anging circumstances to get the payment direct on a weekly basis rather than waiting for an end of financial year rebate. I have concentrated on those two issuesregional headquarters, which reflects the government's commitment to economic growth, and the home child-care allowance. I.now see that my Western Australian col!eague the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has Just entered the chamber. I am pleased about that because finally I want to draw attention to those changes that I know the Assistant !reasurer has a strong commitment to-that IS,. the sales tax measures as they relate to chJId-care centres. He said in his second reading speech on this bill: In late 1993, to make child care more affordable the g?vernment introduced amendments to provide certam exemptions from sales tax to child-care bodies. In general, to obtain funding for a child-are centre and thus access to the sales tax exemptions the centre must be outfitted and operating. This rais- the issue that goods needed to set up the centre WIll not be exempted from sales tax. The bill will introduce a new credit ground to allow such bodies a credit of sales tax for goods to be used in the provision of child care. I take this opportunity to remind the Assistant Treasurer that I have put a view to him directly that this same provision ought to apply to toy libraries. I propose to put this to him again publicly when I make the opening speech at the toy libraries conference in Perth in the very near future. I am looking forward to a positive response from him on toy libraries and sales tax in the course of a not too distant financial year. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 46-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Proposed new clause 46A.",11
4,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank all of those who took part in the second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3). There are a few points which I believe need commenting on-including the contribution of the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), the general thrust of which was that the government was trying to con the Australian people by presenting the home child-care allowance as a new initiative.",15
5,Mr SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Perhaps the honourable Assistant Treasurer will assist the House by formally moving the new clause 46A and then continuing his contribution.,15
6,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"On behalf of the government I move: That the following new clause be inserted in the Bill: Certain income not included in assessable income ""46A. Section 128D of the Principal Act is amended by inserting 'or (gaa)' after '128B(3) (ga)'."". These amendments will simply make three minor technical corrections to the bill as introduced in order to ensure that the proposed dividend withholding tax exemption measure has its proper effect. They will correct a drafting oversight; make sure that foreign dividend income, which is to be subject to the withholding tax exemption, is not artificially inflated by the so-called foreign tax credit grossing-up provisions and make it clear that foreign income which has already borne Australian income tax in accordance with the controlled foreign company or foreign investment fund provisions of our income tax law are precluded from this measure. The amendments will not have any financial impact. I commend the amendments and the new clause to the House, and also table the supplementary explanatory memorandum. As I was saying before I moved the amendments, there were a few matters I wanted to address in the debate on the bill. The first concerned the honourable member for Menzies. The general thrust of his argument was that the government was trying to present the home child-care allowance as a new initiative. Mr Rocher- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think the Assistant Treasurer missed his chance to sum up the second reading debate. The second reading debate has concluded. He should now be addressing a particular clause in the consideration in detail stage. He is clearly out of order.",15
7,Mr SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I think the Assistant Treasurer knows the standing orders well enough to know that in the debate on specific clauses he must refer to those clauses. I am sure that during his contribution in wrapping up this matter he will do so.,16
8,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have moved the amendment. I have no more to say on this proposed new clause. Proposed new clause agreed to. Clause 47. Amendments (by Mr Gear)-by leaveagreed to: Page 37, after proposed section 128S, insert following section: Amount of a dividend ,,, 128SA. For the purposes of this Subdivision, in determining the amount of a dividend paid to a resident company: (a) subsection 6AC(2) (which increases the amount of a dividend by an amount of foreign underlying tax) is to be disregarded; and (b) any foreign tax paid or payable by the company in respect of the dividend, where the company was or is personally liable for the tax, is to be deducted."". Page 38, proposed paragraph 128TA(2)(b), line 9, after ""dividend"" insert"", to the extent that it is not exempt from income tax under section 23AI or 23AK"". Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 48 to 55-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 56.",16
9,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"by leave-I move: (I) Page 46, Jines 33 and 34, omit paragraph (b), substitute the following paragraph: ""(b) a spouse who received home child care allowance within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991 in respect of the year of income or part of the year of income;"" (2) Page 47, lines 21-23, omit the definition of ""non-HCCA spouse"", substitute the following definition: "" , ""non-HCCA spouse"" means a spouse who does not receive home child care allowance within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991 in respect of a year of income or part of a year of income;'."". The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that those people who for a variety of reasons would now be ineligible for the new home child-care allowance will still be in a position to receive the with child spouse rebate under the tax act. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that this aim is met. As was explained by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) when he spoke yesterday, it is the government's intention to address the problem that the opposition has identified in relation to the home child-care allowance arrangethe ments by allowing those who are ineligible or who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance to be eligible for the without child dependent spouse rebate. The outcome of the government's amendments is that a person who might be excluded from receiving the home child-care allowance would be able to get the dependent spouse rebate. It would be allowed at $1,188, which in net terms is $372 less than the amount that would be received if the person were fully eligible for the home child-care allowance. I do not propose again to catalogue all the cases that the government's legislation has adversely affected, save to say that if members opposite are true to their rhetoric-that is, they are concerned about low and middle income earners and they are concerned to assist those most in need-they would obviously want to address the problems that have been identified. Very low income earners, who are clearly in need and who are presently able to benefit from the dependent spouse rebate and the way in which it is paid, will, under the arrangements, be ineligible for the home child-care allowance in many cases. The most pertinent case that most clearly needs to be remedied amongst all others relates to those who are eligible to receive the new partner allowance that the government is introducing. The partner of someone receiving a jobsearch payment would have received the wife's payment before and there would not have been any particular payments under the tax arrangements. In this situation, where the government is introducing the home child care allowance, if the partner of a person receiving the jobsearch allowance receives the partner's allowance, together they will be earning over the income limit and will not be able to receive the home child-care allowance payment. For people who earn rather modest additional sums through part-time work, where eligibility for a dependent spouse rebate might well have applied, the home child-care allowance will not now be payable. I find that an unconscionable position that needs to be addressed. The amendment that we propose will address the situation. If it is carried, it will ensure that those who fall through the cracks in the floor are able to continue to receive the dependent spouse rebate. It provides an option for people who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance under the special rules relating to testing income in the Social Security Act. These rules operate differently from the way in which income is dealt with under the tax act. It is a sensible amendment and one which the government ought to warm to and want to pick up willingly.",16
10,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I want to respond to a point that came up quite consistently in debate and which has arisen outside this place with regard to the home child-care allowance. It has been said that the new home child-care allowance is a con by the government on the people of Australia. Mr Ruddock-That's right-a sleight of hand.,17
11,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The shadow minister says that it is a sleight of hand. I quote the election speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): We propose to introduce a new cash payment of $60 each fortnight to be called the home child care allowance. This allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replacethis is the Prime Minister's election speech. . . and has the added advantage of being paid directly to the mother at home. We have never tried to hide the fact that one form of payment would replace what was a tax deduction for, usually, the non-custodial parent. Let us contrast that with what the coalition government did in 1976. It cashed out the child tax rebate, which was an indexed payment, and combined it with child endowment, a small payment in the social security system which was not indexed, to create a new family payment called the family allowance. It was paid to the carer through the social security system. However, in a full year, there was no net cost from the new measure. Most onecchild families and families in which all children were of school age were losers under the coalition system. Over time, because the family allowance was not indexed, it reduced in value considerably. The Liberal government actually saved money over time. It was estimated that, by 1980, it was saving about $250 million per year from not indexing it. By the end of the coalition government, the family allowance had fallen in real terms by at least 20 per cent. The contrast between this government and the Liberal government is that when the Liberal government made the change it cost the beneficiaries' 20 per cent in real terms. The value of their benefits went down by 20 per cent. In comparison, the government has put in an extra $230 million on top of the savings from the measures that have been announced in this bill. The home child-care allowance has some significant advantages over the current dependent spouse rebate. It provides more direct recognition of the considerable time, energy and personal support devoted to children by parents, generally by mothers who decide to stay at home to raise their children. For the first time, this support will be provided direct to the parent caring for the children rather than to the other partner as a tax concession. Approximately 840,000 families are expected to receive the home child-care allowance at anyone time. It will be paid at a maximum rate of $60 a fortnight, nearly $5 a fortnight higher than the maximum rate of the dependent spouse rebate. Nearly 800,000 families are expected to receive increased payments. About 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate available to couples with dependent children will receive up to $60 per fortnight extra. It will also be more responsive to families' needs than the dependent spouse rebate because there will be a current income test on a spouse's income rather than the financial year test, which is used for the dependent spouse rebate. Parents leaving the work force at any time during the year to, say, care for dependent children will be able to claim the allowance immediately instead of having to wait to re-establish their entitlement in a new financial year. This flexibility is expected to assist up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within anyone year. These enhancements, as I have said before, will cost the government-in addition to the savings it will make in these measures-an extra $230 million; and they are indexed. As to the amendments moved by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the government will not accept them. The main reason is that the amendments do not do the job properly. We will move our own amendments after we have drafted them carefully. We will move them in the Senate. They will pick up the benefits that I outlined in my second reading speech. A taxpayer whose spouse qualifies for the home child-care allowance will not be entitled to claim the without child dependent spouse rebate through the tax system under the bill as it presently stands. However, the government considers that families should be able to fall back on to the without child dependent spouse rebate if they qualify for that rebate. Accordingly, the government will be moving amendments to the bill in the Senate, which I have already foreshadowed, to allow taxpayers to claim the without child dependent spouse rebate instead of claiming for the home child-care allowance. (Time expired)",17
12,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) for his comments, and I am sure he would like to pick up some of these matters and perhaps respond more fully. Perhaps I will give him that opportunity so he can explain where the opposition's amendments fail to meet the task. The substantial difference between the approach the opposition wants to take and the one the government wants to take was brought out by the minister in his speech yesterday when he said that the government seeks to put those who would not qualify for the home child-care allowance in a situation where they would still be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate. He said they would be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate paid at the without child dependent spouse rebate rate, not the with child student dependent spouse rebate, which is the higher figure of $1,425 at this stage. That is set out clearly in the explanatory memorandum. The government is involved in a degree of obfuscation. It is making it very clear that this is an expenditure saving exercise. It is wanting to reduce the overall cost by ensuring that there are some people who will not benefit from these arrangements who would previously have been eligible for a dependent spouse rebate paid at the with child student dependent rate. The way in which the new benefit is payable involves an additional payment. It is a very modest payment because of the sleight of hand that has been involved. The government held out that it was a major new initiative: it was not; it was cashing out the dependent spouse rebate and topping it up a little, for some. But at the same time that the government tops it up for some, it cuts others out and, essentially, they are people on very low incomes-people who fall through the cracks in the floor. If government members were serious and really wanted to do the job properly, they would pick up the opposition's amendment or agree to look at the matter more closely in the Senate. But I very much regret that the Assistant Treasurer takes the view that the amendments he has foreshadowed and proposed will do the job when clearly, by his own words, they will not put people back in the same position that they were in. As I have identified before, a number of classes of people will be so affected. There are people whose eligibility for the home child-care allowance ceases when their youngest child turns 18 ,or leaves secondary school-whichever comes first; there are families in which the dependent child is a prescribed student and who is automatically excluded from the home child-care allowance; and there are people who are absent from Australia for periods exceeding 13 weeks. As I,indicated, this could include overseas aid w'9rkers, exchange students and academics t-king overseas appointments-those who qo-tinue to pay tax in Australia and would h-y- been eligible for a dependent spouse r--ate but will fail in relation to this particularmeasure. I think that the government ought to, tjik- this matter up in a serious way be.It. is a very serious amendment that the slhon is proposing. as interested in the Assistant Treasurer's ents about the way in which the old nce arrangements were implead a look at the debates on ould have thought that, if the government were seriously suggesting that the allowance arrangements fell short, there would..have been some substantial criticism by the opposition-as it then was-of the government's proposals at that time. In the debate which took place on 26 May 1976 Mr Hayden, who was dealing with the matter, said that the new measures constituted a very good principle; the opposition supported it. Gordon Scholes, who spoke in the same debate, said: I 00 not think anyone disputes the value of the changes in the child endowment and dependants' allowances area. I certainly do not. The changes that have been. made in the means of distributing funds in this area are to the advantage of the large families on low incomes. The only person who, in his usual, rather esoteric way, picked up some of these points and ran them in adjournment debates was the honourable member for Prospect, Dick Klugman. But he was not supported by the then opposition which, if it had been serious about mounting that sort of criticism and had been concerned about low income earners who were going to lose, would have' been proposing some amendments like we are today in relation to that legislation. It certainly did not do so. (Time expired)",18
13,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In reply to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the government is concerned about the technical drafting rather than the substance of the amendment. I am told that there are specific references to the word 'qualify'. I suggest that the honourable member look at clause 57(c)(pa)(iii) of the bill because the word 'qualify' does not appear there and also it does not appear in clause 50. The government is going to do the job properly. We are going to make sure that the draftsmen who drafted this piece of legislation draft the amendment so it fits in and we do not have to come back at some other time to fix this up. We are going to do it right the first time. We are looking at the technical wording of the honourable member's amendthis ment. We are certainly going to pick up the thrust of it in our amendments. Mr Ruddock-At which rate will it be paid-without child or with child?",19
14,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,It is going to be $5 more than it was under the old system. When the honourable member for Berowra talked about the fact that the then opposition supported the move that I alluded to in myMr Ruddock-The dependent spouse rebate c1early,20
15,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,How many speakers can we have here?,20
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Mr Rocber)Order!,20
17,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"When the honourable member for Berowra said that the then opposition agreed with the then government about the moves that were made, of course he was right. We supported the principle that the money was paid to the carer rather than it being a tax deduction, usually for the noncarer. We did not support the fact that, over time, that change by the previous Liberal government ended up costing the recipients of those benefits 20 per cent by 1980. This government has moved to have those benefits fully indexed. We support the principle that the carer should get the benefit and that it not be a tax rebate, usually for the non-carer. We are opposing this amendment not because of what is in it but because of the way in which it is worded. We will do the job properly and insert the amendment in the Senate, and that will obviate the necessity to come back at some other time and fix up what could be sloppy drafting.",20
18,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I welcome the comments of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) about the drafting. Drafting of technical tax bills is a very diffithat cult matter at any time; I am the first to acknowledge that. What we have sought to do, however, is to make it clear and to have it put beyond doubt that those people who will fall through the floor will not be disadvantaged. The Assistant Treasurer is suggesting that the government really does wish to address this problem, and I take him at his word. I give him this opportunity to tell me now that, when the matter is dealt with properly-as he says it will be-the dependent spouse rebate that will be available for those parents who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance will be paid at the with child student dependent spouse rebate rate. It is very clear. It is either paid at the with child student dependent spouse rebate rate or it is paid at the without child dependent spouse rebate rate. Mr O'Keefe-That has to be a tautology.",20
19,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"No. I am not being caught out on this because I am reading from the government's own explanatory memorandum. I want to put the matter beyond doubt. I do not wish to be caught up on these sorts of matters. If it is paid at the without child dependent spouse rebate rate, it is very clear: the amount is $372 lower. If it is paid at the with child student dependent spouse rebate rate, the amount is $1,425. I acknowledge that that is still $5 or so lower than the actual home child-care allowance. But it is not the $372-the substantial figure. If the government is serious about fixing that matter, all the Assistant Treasurer has to do is answer the question: will the rebate be paid at the with child student dependent spouse rebate rate? The words the Assistant Treasurer used in the second reading speech were that it would be paid at the without child dependent spouse rebate rate. At the moment, he is clearly obfuscating. He is hoping that people do not understand the words that are being used or the purport of them as they will affect individuals. The Assistant Treasurer did pick me up on the approach that was taken by the previous opposition in 1976. I reiterate what I said on this matter. We are proposing here in this debate a direct measure to fix the problem has been identified of those people who fall through the cracks in the floor-:-the people on very low incomes who will be disadvantaged by the way in which the government is implementing this measure. We have said to the government-more clearly than anybody could do, usually-'Here is an alternative formulation which you could adopt which we believe will do the job.' There can be a bit of argy-bargy about how adequately the government does it, but essentially we are suggesting a very effective way of amending the legislation to achieve this outcome. I looked at the debate in the House of Representatives on 26 May 1976 on the Income Tax Assessment Bill (No.2). Mr Hayden, the then Treasurer-this was before he became the Leader of the Opposition-led for the government in a cognate debate on the tax bill and a social security bill, and there was no amendment. If the government had identified this problem and had wanted to address it, what should it have done? It should have come forward with some very simple propositions to amend the legislation. It did not do that. The whole issue was raised in adjournment debates weeks and months after by Dick Klugman, who had an active mind in relation to these matters. It is disappointing to me that the government would try to make a point out of the way in which that matter was implemented. If the government had been serious about it, it could have brought forward some amendments itself. I ask the Assistant Treasurer to clarify whether the dependent spouse rebate that is being proposed is at the with or out children rate.",20
20,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"We are trying to do exactly what the opposition is trying to do. Its amendments will give people the without child rate, and that is our intention too.",21
21,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I hear that observation. It was certainly not my intention that that be the case. We will have another look at the matter in the Senate. I want to put beyond doubt that our purpose in moving these amendments is to ensure that the rebate is paid at the higher rate: that is, the with child rate.",21
22,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Have you checked that with your leader?,21
23,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have checked it with the clerks in relation to drafting. The amounts of money are relatively small but, if a lot of money had been involved, the government would have identified the savings that it was intending to make. It would have made it very clear that there were losers from the way in which those groups of people were identified. In other words, if the government had clearly intended to make savings involving a million dollars here or there by cutting out overseas aid workers who happened to be out of Australia for 13 weeks or people who have student children over the age of 18 years who are dependent upon them, surely it should have come forward and said, 'That's what we are doing.' Mr Connolly-Been honest.",21
24,Mr RUDDOCK,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It should have been honest. In these matters the government wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to say, 'This is going to involve extra spending.' Yet in implementing this measure in the way it has it has not identified any savings. We spent a bit of time in drafting these amendments. We believe that, as drafted, they would allow rebates to be paid at rates at which they were payable previously: that is, a with children dependent spouse rebate if there are children in the family relationship and the without children dependent spouse rebate if there are no children. That was clearly our intention. We will have another with- look at this matter and, if we have not achieved our intention, we will move our amendments in another form in the Senate. From the answer of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), I take it that the government clearly intends the rebate to be payable at the lower rate-that is, the without children rate - to make savings. It has clearly targeted overseas aid workers, parents with student children and those people I have mentioned who receive the partner allowance. In other words, the government has clearly identified numbers of low income people that it deliberately wanted to exclude from eligibility for these benefits. Let it be clearly understood that that is the government's intention and that it is quite appropriate for us, when we respond to people who are interested in the implementation of the home child-care allowance, to let people know that that was clearly its intention. I can assure the government that we will take every opportunity to ensure that those people who do lose out from the way in which this matter is dealt with know that the matter was debated in this chamber, that there was an awareness of the issues and that the Assistant Treasurer understood the issues, as I understand the issues. I will also ensure that those people will know that when the government divides on this matter, as it will have an opportunity to do in a few minutes, it will be denying those people who fall through the cracks in the floor access to those benefits and will be doing so knowingly.

25,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"Bradfield) (10.36 a. W. L - The purpose of our amendment to t clause is to try to restore some consistency the tax treatment of' remanufactured goo sold in Australia to tax exempt users. T amendment to clause 128 which we a NOES moving is to the effect that we want to pr vide for sales tax credits in respect of pa used in remanufacturing goods used by leased to exempt users. The current sales tax treatment of parts us in the local remanufacture and repair of goo is a clear disincentive to the remanufacturing and repairing industry. I made this point very clearly in my initial speech during the second reading debate. I do not want to go into any great detail on that except to make the point that once again there is a fundamental inconsistency in the government's present position. On the one hand it wants to give tax deductibility to sales of remanufactured goods made overseas-as I said, we strongly support that view-but on the other hand it is not prepared to offer tax deductibility, as it had previously done under the old act, to exempt bodies, including the three levels of government, involved in the purchase of remanufactured or repaired goods in Australia. In other words, no satisfactory explanation has been offered as to why under the old act this exemption was provided but under the new act it is not. The position is even further complicated by the diverse views one receives from none other than the tax office. The tax office position seems to have been from my discussions with it that it ought to be there, that mistake was made, that this clause was not included in the act and that it should be rectified. However, on further discussion it appears that there are two essential issues which the government is concerned about: firstly, the question of the passing on of the provision-in other words, who is the ultimate beneficiary-and, secondly, the question of so-called loss of revenue. The passing on of the provision is an important question. I would not resile from that for one moment. Clearly we must have a rebate system which ensures that the end user gets the benefit of the tax not being applied. I have had the advantage in this particular situation of visiting the industry and seeing how the remanufacturing process works. I am quite convinced on the basis of what I saw and what I was told that there is no technical problem in ensuring that you have in place a system by which it is possible to audit effectively those components in remanufactured goods on which a tax deduction would be applicable. Take, for example, Rank Xerox, which manufactures a range of very effective copying equipment. If a piece of copying equipment comes into be remanufactured, it is examined in detail, it is literally pulled apart, parts are replaced, a document is attached to the chassis, to the outer skin of the equipment, which identifies the number of item, the classification of the item and the number and the value of the items included in the remanufacturing process. That immediately gives the purchaser the basic information necessary upon which to lodge a subsequent claim. If it is believed, for example, that the company itself is the beneficiary and not the end user, that can be easily identified because the company has to put in a claim for the amount of equipment it uses for which it is claiming the deduction. There is absolutely no technical reason why this could not be in place. It was in place for many years. The onus is clearly on the government and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to explain to the House in clear, concise language which the industry will understand why it is that on the one hand the a government is now putting in place a fundamental inconsistency in the tax provision while on the other hand it is asking industry to develop an export orientated remanufacturing base. The government knows perfectly well that the economies of scale within the industry require that we have a capacity to sell domestically as well as in the foreign market. The wider and deeper we are able to achieve that economy of scale, the more effective industry we will create, the more jobs we will create, the greater revenue we will attract and all the other benefits that flow from that. That is not the position of the government. Therefore I move: (I) Page 75, at the end of the clause add ""and to provide for sales tax credits in respect of parts used in re-manufacturing goods sold to or leased by exempt users"".",22
26,Mr GEAR,PAIRS,"The government opposes the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). The main reason for our opposition is that the amendment would, in the government's view, add severe complexity to the law without providing a corresponding economic benefit. The reason for the existing sales tax credit scheme is to alleviate double taxation where goods are used as an input in the production of other goods. This does not include goods purchased for the purpose of providing, for example, government services. The provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) that provide relief for export goods are clearly distinguishable. There are no worries about that. The government is trying to encourage and promote Australian exporters and their competitiveness overseas. The bill achieves that aim. The government has concerns with the honourable member's amendment which effectively seeks to ensure that any credit is passed on to the end user. If we give this benefit to Xerox, which was one example mentioned, there is no way of knowing that the person who buys equipment will benefit from the proposed changes under the honourable member's amendment. It is for those reasons that the government opposes the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 129 to 13I-by leave-taken together, and agreed to.

Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill (on motion by Mr Gear)-by leaveread a third time. PLANT BREEDER'S RIGHTS BILL Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Walker; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith.",23
27,Mr WALKER,PAIRS,"Robertson-Minister for Administrative Services) (10.45 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 with new legislation to enable plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they develop. Essentially the Breeder's Rights Bill, the PBR bill, falls within the scope of public policy established over 15 years from 1971 to 1986 by extensive public inquiry that included an exhaustive inquiry in 1986 by the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources. That Senate standing committee in 1986 recommended, among other things, that a plant variety rights scheme be established, that legislation be drafted to L. conform with the 1978 convention of the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants, known as UPOV, and that Australia accede to the 1978 UPOV convention. The PBR bill 1994 was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and a public hearing and further submissions were considered. The standing committee is of the view that the bill is not a major departure from the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The aim of rewriting is given to the claimant./I. and renaming the legislation is principally to conform to the 1991 revision of the UPOV convention. The Senate standing committee, in its Third Reading report, also endorsed the policy framework underpinning the bill that will allow Australia to ratify the 1991 UPOV convention. PBR legislation conforming to the 1991 UPOV convention is expected to provide a greater 1994 stimulus than the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 to innovation by encouraging increased First Reading investment in plant breeding and technology transfer. Continued innovation is needed to maintain Australia's competitiveness in agricultural and horticultural industries and the stimulation of technology transfer is crucial to maintaining Australia's access to new plant varieties for all plant industries. Second Reading These aims will be more easily achieved if Australia harmonises its legislation and accedes to the 1991 UPOV convention because other member countries of UPOV are preparing to do so and amending their legislation. The legislation, when harmonised with that of other member countries under the 1991 UPOV convention, from which some reciprocal rights are possible, is also expected to provide a stimulus to the seed export trade. The opportunity was also taken whilst the new bill was in preparation to introduce other provisions that would further increase the efficiency of the plant variety rights scheme, the PVR scheme, and the effectiveness of varietal protection without going beyond the limits of the 1991 UPOV convention or compromising the public interest provisions of the Plant Variety Rights Act. The plain English used in the PBR bill should promote a better understanding of, and a wider interest in, the legislation on which the plant breeders rights scheme will be based. The change in the name of the legislation to plant breeder's rights brings it into with the new UPOV convention and common usage internationally for this form of inteIlectual property protection. The unit administering the legislation and the scheme will be renamed the Plant Breeder's Rights Office. The Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 will be repealed foIl owing the successful passage and proclamation of the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. Transitional arrangements to the new legislation will be convenient and simple to implement. AlI of the approximately 1000 applications that have been made for plant variety rights in the five years since the commencement of the scheme will be either deemed to have been granted PBR or, should they be in the process of being examined on the day of proclamation, they will continue to be examined under the old act and, if successful, they will be granted PBR. No grantee of PVR under the old act will be disadvantaged by the transition arrangements. The important changes to the legislation in the PBR bill have been developed in consultation with the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, and these changes have their support. I note in this regard the efforts made by the Grains Council of Australia on behalf of grain growers to find solutions, using PBR legislation, to stimulate investment in breeding our principal grain crops, which that industry knows is an important element in maintaining our international trading competitiveness. The PBR bill provides for increased scope and effectiveness of the breeder's right on protected varieties. It is envisaged that, in the national interest, all sectors of the agricultural and horticultural industries, including public and private plant breeders, will jointly use the strategic business assets that PBR provides to develop marketing and breeder royalty systems appropriate to their industry sectors. The plant breeders' rights scheme is complementary to the government's policies geared to promote innovation in Australia's plant industries by encouraging research and development using production levies and tax line concessions. In addition, the PBR bill is consistent with Australia's obligations under the UPOV convention and the TRIPS agreement of GATT and with the FAO 'undertaking on plant genetic resources'. According to advice from the Attorney General's Department, the bill is not in conflict with either the International Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity or native title legislation. In response to the Senate standing committee's report, government has also introduced additional public safeguards to tabling of regulations on farm-saved seed and the duration of PBR. In this regard, if the minister is considering making regulations there will be mandatory public notice, a 30-day public consultation period and a requirement for the PBR advisory committee to take into account public submissions. In conclusion, I would like to reassure the House that all the public interest features of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 have been retained, and even extended, in the PBR bill and thus the essential balance between the public interest and the extended breeder's right has been maintained. I commend the bill to the House.",25
28,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"We in the coalition are pleased to support this important approach. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) said, the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill amounts to little more than an updating of the plant variety rights legislation which has operated in Australia since 1987. The current bill was subject to a Senate inquiry which recommended some amendments to provide for more public involvement. These amendments were agreed to by the government and the coalition. They have been passed in the Senate, and we are happy to oblige in this place now. It does seem that the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is normally pretty objective and factual in its publications, has caused a certain amount of unnecessary concern by undertaking a campaign which has been a little off the mark in relation to its presentation of the facts in this whole matter. The campaign seems to have emanated from one individual in particular who is paid not from Australian Conservation Foundation funds but by Australian taxpayers through a federal government grant to encourage debate on genetic. engineering. If this campaign, which I believe has been misleading, 'is a sample of his' work, the government should have a close look at whether he is the most appropriate person to encourage genuine debate - in the genetic engineering area and whether funding should continue to flow in that direction. Plant breeders' rights were discussed extensively in this country between 1981 and 1986, concluding with an exhaustive inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources. That committee recommended that a plant variety rights scheme be established in line with the 1987 Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, or UPOV, and that Australia accede to that convention. . Before the 1987 legislation, Australia,had not been able to keep up with. the latest varieties in a host of areas, particularly in horticulture. This was because breeden) - rights were not adequately protected in Australia and people who had bred new varieties路 were reluctant'to allow their varieties to be accessed in this country for fear that they would essentially lose what am bunted to t-eir property. As the minister has outlined, the reason for rewriting and renaming the legislation is to ensure that it conforms with the 1991 revision ?f the UPOV convention.The new legislation IS expected to provide a greater stimulus to innovation than did the earlier 1987 act by encouraging increased investment in plant ?reeding and technology transfer. Therefore, In ,my view, concern about its leading to fewer new plant varieties is, to put it mildly, unfounded. The bill makes it easier for farmers to save seed. Clause 17 of the bill allows farmers to save seed as a matter of right. I am aware of two areas-they were opposed to the bill, because I do not think they understood itwhich were active and which published material claiming that farmers, would be disadvantaged by this measure: I have received many letters from these areas saying that farmers' right to save seed was somehow threatened by this legislation. I am sorry that that misunderstanding has arisen. I sincerely hope that, through our response, our letters to c:;ditorsand our djrect response to individual letters and media articles, those fears have been well and .truly allayed. . In response to the Senate standing committee's report, the government has introduced additional public safeguards to tabling of regulations on farm-saved seed and the duration of planf breeders' rights. While it will be possible for an industr)'-not an individual or a company-to seek exempti'ons from farm-saved seed under clause ,17(2) of the bill, no industry has sought such ari exemption. It needs to be recognised that no industry in the future will request an exemption from - he saved seed provisions unless it is quite sure that there is more profit for the . indiv,iduals in that industry in buying new seed rather than saving it. As far as I am. aware, the cotton industry, which is overwhelmingly concentrated in my electorate, is the only one that has indicated that, at some stage in the future, it might like to seek alterations to this provision as it relates to that industry. If the minister is considering making regulations at the request of an industry, I note that there will be mandatory public notice,a 3D-day public consultation period and a requirement for the PBR advisory committee to take into account any public submissions before action can be taken. That is an adequate safeguard. I have no problems with it atal!. In fact, I welcome it. I inform those farmers who have expressed concern that the farmer organisations have been involved. The Grains Council, in particular, made a strong submission to the Senate inquiry; expressing growers' support for the legislation. I again emphasise that no farmer organisation has advised me of any opposition on its part to the legislation. I again note that the important changes to the legislation in the PBR bill have been developed in consultation with the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia. The changes have the support of those organisations for very good reason. The best way to encourage further developments in plant technology-better yields, more disease resistance, more insect resistance, or whatever-is to ensure that those people who are prepared to risk capital and finance in developing those new genetic and other technologies are guaranteed of a financial return, or at least to minimise the possibility of financial loss. In my view, Australia will remain fully competitive only if those safeguards are properly put in place. In路 the long term, it is only with those sorts of guarantees that the globe will continue to be able to feed itself and provide for its hungry mouths. I have had many letters from fanner organisations, the nursery association and other horticultural organisations urging the coalition to pass this bill without delay. Therefore, the bill has our support, as do the amendments suggested by the Senate inquiry and carried by the Senate.",26
29,Mr CHYNOWETH,PAIRS," The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 proposes to repeal the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The Plant Variety Rights Act was enacted to grant a proprietary right to any breeder of a new variety of certain plants and granting them exclusive rights to sell or license others to sell plants or seeds that they have developed. The act requires that plants and reproductive material be readily available to meet public demand at reasonable prices. On 20 November 1986 when the act was presented to this House in bill form, I expressed my concerns about the proposed legislation by saying: The major arguments against PVR concern their effects on the lesser developed countries and the genetic stock, which is what interests me. It is argued that the system of PVR adversely affects lesser developed countries as they will become more reliant on seed stock that has to be imported from the more developed countries. If they refuse to pay, they wiJI be deprived of the more productive crops. The concern over genetic stock is that the range available for future use will be drastica1Jy reduced and will get into fewer and fewer hands, and that much of the genetic stock that has been developed by nature wilJ cease to be available. I also said: Perhaps there should even be a sunset clause in the whole BilJ so that in 20 or 30 years time we can look at it and, if it is not working correctly, take steps to correct it. I hope there is a large seed stock that can be distributed freely throughout the country and we will not have to rely on one particular company or its products to enable us to survive. Those were the views I had then and my views have not changed. I still believe there are long-term dangers in this sort of legislation. While I then acknowledged the benefits of - ant variety rights, such as encouragement of increased plant breeding and the resulting export opportunities, I expressed my concern about the impact on developing countries. In order for the lesser developed countries to become more self-subsistent and their economies to become stronger, they need to be developing their own local products for their own local cONsumption. They do not need to be at rhe mercy of the large multinational companies, which swallow many plant variety rights and then export the manufactured prodl:lct to struggling countries at exorbitant prices. I also expressed my concern that the growth of the manufactured plant and seed industry will have a detrimental effect on the availability of naturally grown stock. By way of illustrat40n of this concern, I referred to the fact that at the turn of the century there were approximately 30,000 varieties .of rice in India. Now, however, there are only 30 varieties in use. Much of the genetic stock has been stored for future use, which begs the question: if the seeds created by nature are being hidden away for future use, who controls access to these seeds and on what terms and conditions? The bill is designed to repeal the Plant the Variety Rights Act 1987 but to save the effect of many of the provisions in the repealed act and also to increase, extend and effect a number of those provisions. The bill proposes to increase the length of time for which a plant breeder's rights can be granted; extend the coverage of a plant breeder's rights to include the import and export of propagated material; and extend the coverage of a plant breeder's rights, including essentially derived and certain dependent varieties and in certain circumstances harvested material. It also increases the penalties for breaches of a plant breeder's rights. The effect of the provisions in this bill is to heighten the concerns which I previously expressed. Others share my concerns. In a submission on this bill Friends of the Earth suggested that patenting rights to plants favour economic growth over possible ends and takes genetic material out of its historical and cultural context. The submission also suggests that most material protected by patenting is owned by companies from the northern industrialised countries despite the fact that much of the plant material that created this resource originated in southern Third World countries. These northern companies are in fact stealing resources from these other countries. Honourable members will recall that I have previously expressed my concern that large multinationals export manufactured plants and seeds to developing countries at exorbitant prices. Friends of the Earth is suggesting that these manufactured plants and seeds derive from resources which originated in the developing countries in the first place. At the moment I am reading a book called Seizing the future by Michael Zey. It talks about American companies involved in genetic engineering-that is, altering existing plants and then patenting them. It states: The potential for agricultural biotechnology is impressive. Already on the line is a highly productive com that grows without fertiliser. Reports have also become public of a marsh grass that cheaply desalinates seawater, changing it to drinking water needed by growing populations. Imagine what the companies will do once they get hold of this particular plant: they will patent it and then sell it back, as I said before, at exorbitant prices. The passage continues: More than a dozen companies have developed at least 70 new crops by utilising innovations in genetic engineering. A wide variety of cantaloupes, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers that contain new proteins, enzymes and other substances that make them superior in several different ways. Grains that resist the effect of drought. Such crops may have further uses in space colonies or other areas that have little or no access to water. Cotton and other products that are immune to infestation by insects. For many companies the 1990s is the biotech decade. Among those planning to introduce genetically improved tomatoes which extend shelf life are Cal gene and Monsanto. The latter company, along with Frito Lay, is also involved with developing a modified starched potato which resists starch. Many companies including Monsanto, Upjohn, American Cyanamid and Eli Lilly are developing a cow growth hormone to boost milk production. These are some of the biggest, wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world. They employ many people involved in long-term strategy. I am certain that they are not just investing millions in this area unless they are going to get back billions in profit further down the track. They are the types of companies which can influence governments, legislators and legislation. They have similar powers, of course, to the oil companies; and this worries me. If anything goes wrong, they will threaten you with the contempt one reads about in today's newspapers, of how the American giant multinational Dow Coming is treating Australian women at this time. In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, to which this bill was referred for consideration, the United Scientists for Environmental Responsibility and Protection (South Australia) expressed its concern that there is no guarantee in the bill that farmers will be able to save seed of PBR protected variety to sow crops in subsequent seasons. Farmers have the right under this legislation to be able to save the seed. However, with the newer variety of hybrids, their particular seed will not be able to be saved and used again. This concern raised by the united scientists relates to my wider concern that the producer is coming under increasing pressure from the owners of plant breeders rights in regard to what they can and cannot produce. As the stock of plant seeds covered by breeders rights expands, the freedom of the farmer or the backyard gardener to grow natural products will decline. In my speech on this matter in 1986 I held up six packets of cabbage seeds and noted that only one of them was not a hybrid. I went back to a seed shop to buy similar seeds and I could not find any. One of the things I did notice was that the word 'hybrid' does not appear on packets of seeds now. This might have been just in the particular sh-p I went to. Maybe it is just my cynical mind thinking that these companies that produce seeds have actually taken the word 'hybrid' off the packets. If we buy the seeds and plant them, we grow a good crop the first year, but the second year we get nothing. I will research further why this word 'hybrid' has been taken off the packets of seeds. As I said, maybe it was just. in the particular shop I went to. I will do a lot more work on this matter. It worries me that, as a general principle, family farms which struggle to survive ""are losing their natural right to store seed for future seasons because large multinationals not think it is a national right; rather, they think it is an entitlement bestowed by the multinationals themselves. The noose on seed supply is tightening. Let me put to honourable members this hypothetical scenario. It is the year 2010. People buy their seed for an antidrought, antidisease top crop from that great farming firm Monsanto, which in the past brought us some helpful chemicals such as 2, 4, 5-T. They pay top dollar for it. They get a great crop the first year. They save enough seed from this crop to plant the second crop the next year. Of course, up it comes-another great crop. The third year, when they use this seed, or what is left of it, what do they get? No seed. An ecological time bomb is built into this seed. They are on their knees for a new batch of seed because nothing else is available. The company has them. This may seem a little far-fetched, but banks have been using this business practice for many years. I have read with interest the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. I have some sympathy with the concerns about the application of industrial property rights to living matter which were expressed by the Australian Conservation FoundatiQn and Greenpeace. I agree with Senator Woodley's position, set out in his minority report, that the privatisation of living organisms is morally objectionable. Plant and animal genes are being patented. What right do we have to patent nature? Who gives us the right to patent something that we had nothing to do with? It is not an invention. We did not take two chemicals, put them together and make a seed. That stock was there. All we are doing is adding a little here and chopping at the edges and then saying that it belongs to us. An invention which comes out of my head .from an idea I had is new. If I build it, I have something physical that I know has come from an original idea in my head. This type of legislation steals and modifies an idea of which nature is the originator. As an issue, plant variety rights have been with us since the early 1960s. Since that time, not only has there been much discussion; do there has been much activity. For example, any nurseryman will tell us that it is only in the years following the 1987 legislation that Australian nurserymen have been able to develop new and improved strains of plants and seeds, better methods of production and distribution, and an export industry. At this point I must mention my daughter, Jane, who has just started an apprenticeship in this industry. I trust that this subject will be well discussed during her schooling and her apprenticeship. This line of argument about the fact that everything has improved since 1987 was put to the Senate standing committee by the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Australian Nursery Industry Association. I appreciate and understand this line of argument, but it is not strong enough to overcome my general concerns about the ideology of patenting rights to nature's products. I also understand that one person's concerns are of little significance in the wider debate about the power and influence exerted on the global economy by the large multinational companies. However, one can never tell.",28
30,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"I would be very interested to know how the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) regards the testing of the drug RU486 and the interference with natural processes perpetrated on human beings in those testings compared with what the House is looking at today: that is, intellectual ty rights as applied to plants. The original biII was called the Plant Variety Rights Bill. Inherent in that title is the concept that plants have some right to a name and that they should have a registered name which should be kept. It is interesting to hear the contributions of some of those who were opposed to the concept of changing that name, as a philosophical step, to the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill, which is the proper title for this sort of legislation. The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill concerns the effort of plant breeders to improve a particular plant or crop by their application to the selection of better quality seeds-a process that has been around since man first tilled the earth. The best seed is always selected and saved. The best plants are selected for the next year's seed and for the next year's crop. The concept that we take an average of all the seeds in the field and say that we must maintain a genetic purity by not being selective in the way in which we take seeds. is sheer bunkum. Agriculture does not work that way. From the beginning of time, man has sought to improve both the quality and the quantity of the crops that he grows. That is done by a process of selection. I advise the honourable member and those who may read these speeches that the process of hybridisation is a crossbreed process of bringing together two varieties, crosspolIinating and then planting the progeny, or the seeds, of that crossbreeding program. I think most students in secondor thirdyear high school would have come across Mendel's law regarding what happens if the product of that hybrid plant is replanted. There is a reversion in one part to one original parent and in another part to the other parent, and then there are two continuing hybrid types. It is completely inaccurate for the honourable member to say that there is nothing in the third year. There is a crop. It is better than the two separate parent crops that were used originally. The purpose of hybridisation is to maintain the original parent stock. It is critical in any plant breeding program-or any properprogram-to retain the pool of genetic diversities. Every breeder of plants or animals wants a complete diversity of material. Fears have been expressed about the availability of specific crops to only one individual, with the rest of the world going without, and about some multinational company being able to comer the market to the detriment of the rest of the world. These situations are an impossibility. If people want the very best of a specific type for a commercial crop, the breeder of that crop will receive some payment and his or her rights will be protected for the work that he or she has put into it. But it is part of the process that, as the government's own legislation says, there must be effective testing to prove whether or not what is being advanced as a unique type of crop or seed actually is unique and different from the existing ones. So there is extensive testing. Then there must be ready availability. All those facts are covered in the government's legislation. It is time that Australia recognised the reality of what is happening to our unique plant species. Our genetic pool of plants has been raided. International raiders have come in and taken our plant species offshore. They have genetically manipulated those plants and produced crops worth millions of dollars in value for their nations. Australia has been excluded from this process because there is no protection for a plant breeder and no encouragement for a plant breeder to look at the prospect of developing something unique. One example is the Geraldton wax, a common Australian plant. It was taken by the Israelis and developed to a very fine degree by both selection and genetic manipulation to produce a crop that has wide attraction across the Northern Hemisphere. Only since we have had plant variety rights in Australia have Australian breeders been allowed to touch this material, know that it will be protected and know that their work will ultimately be worth something at the end of the day. I pay tribute to a dear friend, Mr Nick Derera, who is one of Australia's great plant breeders in both wheat and cotton. He has worked for the New South Wales and Australian governments over many years. He is now retired and living in my electorate. He was recognised in recent Australian awards for his contribution to Australia's economic success and the success of our farmers. Until this point, Geraldton wax has been bred only by foreigners. Although it is a native Australian plant, the Australian capacity to use this plant material was denied until we had plant variety rights or breeders rights. In the last few years, Mr Derera has taken the Geraldton wax, miniaturised it and crowded blossoms onto it. He has not destroyed-he did not want to-the original plant material; it can still be found in the bush. He is a scientist who wants to retain the diversity of the genetic pool that he needs to be able to go on with his work. Mr Derera has taken one part of the genetic pool in Geraldton wax and created a miniature flowering Christmas tree. When it sits on a table, it measures somewhere between six and 18 inches high. It is a beautiful table decoration. In just its first year of miniature producIf tion, that one plant earned $3 million for Australian exporters. This plant is being applauded across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the United States. Where do the rights to it belong? In Australia. There is a long sad story of Australian scientists and plant breeders being done over by the pirates of this world taking our material to their own shores and calling it their native product. So it is time that we had legislation like this. If I remember correctly, this was firstly an initiative of the Fraser government. It was then delayed by arguments similar to those just used by the honourable member for Dunkley. They are unnecessary. The fears expressed at that time and since have not been realised. We now have Australians who are the best in the world. They have an opportunity to show what we can do and to provide for the rest of the world and Australian producers and farmers the sorts of opportunities that we should have had long before they were given to us. I have given one simple instance. I can think of hundreds of similar occurrences in the late Professor Keith Campbell's work with waratahs. This issue is about breeding a plant and not destroying the original material, which is critical. It is like a basic investment in the bank. No responsible scientists would dare touch it or want to change it. Doing so would restrict their opportunities for the future. Keith Campbell took the waratah and produced multiheaded plants. Beautiful cut flower decorations are now able to be exported by Australians and used around the world for the first time. I am a bit nationalistic about this issue, because, until recently, we have acted like juveniles with our broadacre and horticultural crops. This issue has been handled very much like our trade policy: we keep to ourselves and hope that nobody else does us over. We have been done over in broadacre and horticultural cropping for years. Until the government was prepared to grapple with the idea of plant variety rightsMr Cleeland-That's not quite true.",31
31,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"The honourable member for MCEwen says that that is not quite right. he looks across the range of horticultural crops, he will see that Australian producers were denied access to plant materials because we had no plant variety legislation in Australia. We could not use what the rest of the world was using, yet it was taking our plant material, abusing it and leaving us stranded. The honourable member is now nodding. Of course it is fact. It is irrefutable fact. There was no protection until that action was taken. I congratulate the government. The main change that I see in the legislation is a change of name; it now has a proper name. As far as I can assess it, the legislation itself is reasonable and has about the right balance. The provisions for testing under supervision are adequate. The proprietary rights that will now go to breeders appear to be well protected. The need to increase penalties has been obvious. People can now pursue these matters. The penalties for the abuse of rights and the abuse of plant material and other material seeds are proper. As the previous speakers have said, the bill covers an increase in duration. There needs to be an extension of time. The effort and development processes in so many of these instances, particularly in broadacre crops, is a long one involving trialling and testing to see whether there are improvements. I know that, of 10,000 varieties of peach tree trialled in New South Wales five years ago, four came through with some prospect of success. Of that 10,000, only one variety may have some commercial value. That gives the House a bit of an idea of the scope and time factors involved in developing variations or different types of plant materials. An extension of the duration of the plant breeder's rights is adequate. The extension to include the importation and exportation of propagative material is proper. The extension of plant breeders rights to include, in certain circumstances, harvested material is reasonable and proper. The extension of plant breeders rights to include, essentially, derived and certain dependent varieties is adequate. The increased penalties are overdue. I congratulate the government. I am pleased that this legislation is going through the House. I wish well those great and talented scientists which Australia has in large numper-it is an area in which we excel-in making their mark on the export world and the world of intellectual property rights, which is being safeguarded in this House t9 da y.",32
32,Mr CLEELAND,PAIRS,"MCEwen) (11.28 a.m.)The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in his contribution in this debate followed the usual conservative line that if there is a philosophy involved, the coalition does not want to know about it. It wants the dollar and the profit. He completely threw aw-y any arguments, based on philosophical - otlons, that the ownership of genetic material I-wrong per se. It is not of interest to him tnAt private companies can own genetic mat-nal and use it for profit only without lOoking at the broader issues. We on this side of the House have a broader view. We do not necessarily say that, whilst this bill is necessary, one should not look at the broader philosophical issues which it involves. The way that we on this side of the House always approach these difficult issues discloses a fundamental difference between us and the profit greed of the conservatives of this country. I also draw attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Mitchell, who is not in the House at the moment, when he said that Australia was missing out because we did not have plant variety rights. He does not seem to understand that wheat varieties in Australia, for example, were adapted by CSIRO for many years, including rust resistant varieties, long before plant variety legislation became a reality. In fact, Australian cropping and Australian wheat variety has led the world in dry-style cropping. It is another sign of ignorance from those on the other side to suggest that, without this sort of legislation, Australia was not developing new varieties of genetic material which were benefiting Australian farmers and, indeed, making us a very profitable exporting country in those areas. It must be said at the outset that whilst I support this legislation I do have concerns about it. I supported the legislation in its previous form, as I will support this amending or changing legislation. But why are we doing it? Why does Australia need to give private ownership of genetic material? The answer is very simple: we are forced into it by events over which we have no control that have occurred overseas. As usual, it occurs in countries like the United States where new genetic breeding was followed by the demand by those who were successful in creating new plant varieties that ownership of those varieties be given to them, for profit motivation. Countries like Australia, which did not follow this regime of plant variety rights-if you like, copyright of genetic change-found themselves out of the marketplace where, for commercial purposes, they could not access new varieties. It is fair to say that most people do not necessarily, in philosophical terms, like the concept that genetic material can be owned, whether it be changed or not. But the reality is that, like it or not, unless Australia follows the path of other industrialised countries, our ability to compete in world markets with the new varieties available will be severely diminished and our horticulturalists and farmers generally in cropping areas will not compete on equal terms with overseas countries. It should be looked at in that context. I do not think many people anywhere who think seriously about the problems of the world at large-population growth and the provision of food that the world so desperately needs for Third World countries-are keen on the idea of individuals owning such important material. I do not think any of us really think this is necessarily what we would like to see in a perfect world. We do know that the world's population, exponentially, is exploding. We do know that in the next 20 years the world's population will double. Whilst the club of Rome got it wrong, and while Malthus in his original proposition was not quite accurate either, we now unarguably know that, unless something is done either to improve dramatically the capacity to feed the exploding populations of the world or to reduce the explosion of population, the future is indeed grim for countless billions of human beings on this planet. This is where my concern for this concept of ownership of genetic material comes. Who is going to guarantee that those who hold genes for profit are necessarily going to provide the new varieties, in terms of increasing food capacity, to those who cannot afford to pay for it? In this legislation, the owner of a new variety of rice which, for example, could double the crop, reduce the growing time and therefore enable an increased number of crops in a growing season per field is under no obligation to provide it to a Third World country desperate to feed its expanding populations. It is pay up or do not get. If members in this House have the view that it is okay and that we should not be concerned about it, we as a parliament should be alarmed. The matter has to be debated. It is a matter which I believe should cause great concern not just to members of this House bu to everyone, including the Australian Conser vation Foundation and Greenpeace. I mus confess that I do not particularly agree wit Greenpeace's politics most of the time-tha is because it is a privately owned, profi making organisation; I would much rathe back the Australian Conservation Founda tion-but those people who have argued ver strongly on philosophical terms that geneti material should not be owned have a legiti mate argument. However, the balance with government i to somehow recognise the very simple fac that overseas countries now have this legisla tion, that owners of new material are denyin those horticultural products in particular t Australian producers and that, unless we giv the owners the copyright protection the demand, we will not get access to that materi al. That is the dilemma. I noticed my colleague the member fo Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in his contributio to this House reluctantly came to that conclu sion also. Whilst he does not like the legisla tion, and whilst I do not have particula affinity for the philosophical concept, it i nevertheless the right thing for this parliamen to do and it is the right thing for this government to do. In the original arguments back in 198 when the first legislation went through thi House I was approached by a large number o farmers from my electorate. For those who d not know Mansfield, Yarck and Molesworth in Victoria, in the Goulburn Valley, the area produces large amounts of pasture seed. Paspalum and rye grasses and clovers are very important for the pastoral industry of Australia, and many farmers there produce an enormous quantity of certified seed both for Australian use and for export. I had a large number of meetings with those producers and was quite alarmed to find that there were new pasture variety seeds developed externally to Australia which New Zealand had access to because in that period it had passed complementary legislation giving copyright owner': ship to such material and we in Australia had not. That meant that our seed producers were losing export markets. I stress again that these are large producers; they are a multimillion dollar export business. In the early stages of discussions with the farmers, it became apparent to me that, like it or lump it, this legislation was necessary. Further down the track I became chairman of the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust, which is the major wholesale clearing house for horticultural products in Victoria and Queensland. Through CAD and other industry organisations, I had a fair degree of involvement with the Victorian horticultural industry. It became quite apparent that new varieties of apples-trained along trellises like grapes and which have much larger yields, require less water and produce larger volumes of apples than the old varieties-were not available in Australia unless we had legislation which protected the rights of the overseas owners of those varieties. It became very apparent-particularly in the apple, stone fruit and citrus industries-that unless we gave a degree of protection through this type of legislation our Australian horticultural producers would not be able to compete effectively on world markets. Indeed, Australia could well have faced a situation where cheaper horticultural products could have been imported into Australia. I worry about that. I am a bit of a protectionist, as many members of this House know, and I sometimes wonder why we allow some of the imports to flood into this country when :we can produce so well in this country. The level playing field is in the eyes of the econometrists and those who play with little computers; it does not really exist in the real }Vorld of commerce. Nevertheless, that was - he criteria I adopted. Indeed, I moved and SEPported the original Plant Variety Rights Bill in 1986 in the House. ,:T-ese changes have been through a major m9u1 ry involving the Senate Standing Comon Rural and Regional Affairs, and In? its r-port to anyone who is interestthIS partIcular matter. As members of ommiUee rightly point out, the concept ariet.y right- is. really an extension opyrtght prtnclple. But they are -!;ji;lfferent in a sense from patent rights in that the right conferred on the end product is not conferred on the process, so the process of genetic change cannot be owned; only the end product which has been produced as a result of that process can be owned. Whilst pragmatically I am in favour of the legislation, I still wonder where the Third World is going to get the benefit, and I indicated that to the House earlier. I believe that the United Nations is going to have to address this matter very seriously. I know that there is a UN convention in existence which covers this area but, again, the UN convention is not going to guarantee in any way, shape or form access to these new varieties. So, on balance and having debated this once before in previous legislation, this bill has my full support. I welcome the changes from the original legislation; I believe they will strengthen the act. I know that the farmers whom I represent and the horticultural industries-which I have a great deal to do with-are looking forward to it. To those who oppose it, I think their philosophy is right, but they do not have to govern. I thank the House.",33
33,Mr CUNNINGHAM,PAIRS,"I rise also to support the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. The bill proposes to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The major differences between the provisions of this bill and the 1987 act are in the scope and strength of the proprietary right it provides to holders of plant breeders' rightsPBR-in propagative material of protected plant varieties. Specifically, the major differences are: an increase in the duration of PBR; an extension of PBR to include the import and export of propagative material; an extension of PBR to include in certain circumstances harvested material; an extension of PBR to include essentially derived and certain dependent varieties; and increased penalties for breaches of the act. Intense public debate over the best part of 20 years preceded the proclamation on 1 May 1987 of the Plant Variety Rights Act, which is the forerunner to the bill now before the House. It is my intention to give some background on the history of plant variety rightsPVR-or plant breeders rights in Australia, together with an assessment of the impacts of PVR on the horticultural and agricultural industries. The International Covenant for the Protection of New Variety of Plants-UPOV - was signed in Europe over 32 years ago. Whereas some countries-such as the United Kingdom in 1964, the US in 1970 and New Zealand in 1973-moved to enact PVR enabling legislation relatively early after this signing, is was quite slow to act. In fact, it was not until 1977 that the Commonwealth was even able to come to the conclusion that it had adequate powers to operate PVR under the constitution. From the start, PVR was a controversial concept in Australia. For example, those few farmers who knew early on about the PVR proposal were very confused about it, even though seed producing and other horticultural industries were very supportive of the principle of PVR. As well, as most of Australia's plant breeders were in the public sector, there was a good deal of opposition stemming from the breeders' fear of private sector competition. It was said that the public sector plant breeding to a large extent concentrated on cereals and would be starved of funds as governments relied more and more on PVR incentives to encourage private breeding. It was felt that the private industry would be seeking only immediate profits and would not be able to do the long-term strategic research through which CSIRO and the state institutions had proved their usefulness. There was certainly no consensus among state and federal departments on the worth of PVR in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, the most vociferous opposition came in 1979 from the many supporters of the newly published Canadian book by P.R. Mooney, entitled Seeds of the Earth: a private or public resource? This book denigrated PVR as a scourge of genetic source material in underdeveloped countries. Some conservation and consumer groups then elaborated on PVR as a tool of large multinational petrochemical countries. These, it was alleged, were scheming to control the world's genetic resources for food production in order to make farmers dependent on petrochem ical derived pesticides and fertilisers. Some takeovers of seed companies by multinationals at the time only heightened many people's fear of the global conspiracy generated by Mooney's book. Meanwhile, the coalition government of the day was not making things easy with its inadequate legislation. A particular point of contention was the scope of plants to be Australcovered by PVR. Whereas a draft bill for PVR had been drawn up as early as May 1979, it was not until 7 May 1991 that the Plant Variety Rights Bill reached the House of Representatives. Following numerous amendments, a version of the bill passed the House on party lines on 21 April 1982. Opposition members of the day-I was one of them-argued that all the implications of PVR had not been considered by the government and that the bill should be referred to a select committee of the House of Representatives. This was not done. However, the Senate referred the bill to its Standing Committee on National Resources on 15 September 1982. The committee's report of May 1984 reaffirmed serious deficiencies in the 1982 bill but gave the go ahead for further consideration of PVR. In July 1985, the Labor government commissioned Professor Lazenby to conduct a Commonwealth inquiry into Australia's plant breeding needs in order to investigate t-e frequently supported detrimental effect of PVR on public sector plant breeding programs. The inquiry came out strongly in support of PVR and upheld the desirability of Australia joining UPOv. The then federal Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, introduced a much improved plant variety rights bill on 8 October 1986, which passed both Houses by 25 February 1987. It had taken all of eight years for satisfactory PVR legislation to be proclaimed. As the House considers a replacement bill for the 1987 act in view of the UPOV update of 1991, and in light of the operational experience of the PVR system since 1987, one is entitled to ask: which, if any, of the furious arguments of a decade ago have proved correct with time? To briefly review the pros and cons of PVR expressed over a number of years, PVR promised to encourage private plant breeding in Australia, which had been largely confined to hybrids. At the same time, the importation of improved foreign plant varieties would for the first time be enabled, since they would be afforded copyright protection following Australia's membership of UPOV. Opponents argued that PVR would suppress public sector plant breeding and would concentrate ownership of the world's food plant genes in the hands of a few large multinationals. Debate on the original Plant Variety Rights Bill was confused by the lack of good studies of the impact of PVR overseas-studies which could have confirmed or denied the above claims. Likewise, in Australia there had been few extensive inquiries on PVR's effects since 1987. One exception is an evaluation of the plant variety rights scheme carried out by A.S. Watson for the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy early in 1983. This review is now briefly summarised. In terms of general issues surrounding PVR, the review noted that the controversy over plant breeders rights pertaining to field crops was always more intense than the case for ornamentals, fruits and vegetables. The latter group of plants seems to have been quite well served by PVR, for example, in bringing new varieties from overseas. In Australia, product cycles are usually shorter-with the exception of fruit and ornamental trees-and customers make a direct comparison of varieties in nurseries with field crop variety selection use. Certain firms and certain horticultural species, such as roses, have found PVR particularly useful. The predominance of PVRs granted for horticultural species is demonstrated by the fact that, up to September 1992, 82 per cent of PVR applications have fallen into that category. Ornamentals have been the most popular subcategory, with 65 per cent of total applications. Pasture species and crop species have each made up nine per cent of total applications. Another established pattern is the strong leaning to vegetatively propagated varieties, which accounted for 80 per cent up to 1992 as compared with seed varieties, which accounted for 20 per cent of total applications. It appears that both the expectations for, and fears over, PVR in the agricultural or field crop sphere have largely been unrealised. Overall the review concluded that 'PVR has only a small role to play for broadacre industries'. The fact that PVR permits the use of farm saved seed means that there is only a limited economic incentive to pursue PVR in this area. Furthermore, the consultant felt that this exemption from PVR was reasonable and sensible under the circumstances. Repeated use of farm saved seed is a special feature of Australian agriculture which is not likely to change quickly. As for the argument that PVR would strengthen the hand of large profit-hungry multinationals, the review's conclusion was that such companies have plenty of competition from rival firms, the purchasing power of customers, producer cooperatives and farm organisations. In any case, the special Australian conditions-that is, using farm saved seed-were not attractive for the seed industry in general, and this applies to seed monopolies. Some hopes for PVR as well as fears have not been realised so far, especially in agriculture, according to the review. Both sides were said to have 'greatly exaggerated' the effects of PVR on self-pollinating crop industries. Thus, because there has been little flow of PVR benefits or incentives to new crop varieties in general, there has been little and stimulus-that is, funds from PVR-to public sector breeding. As a result, such breeding on the whole continues to rely largely on governments and industry for levies. While the above conclusions may not appear to fully endorse the benefits of PVR, five years is really not a long enough period in which to get clear results. For example, most people would still not be seeing huge changes in the types of fruit, vegetables and nursery plants offered for sale. A PVR scheme is not enough by itself to bring about innovation in very conservative grower circles or to stimulate consumer demand for top varieties. But PVR is a necessary step in the vitalisation of a range of Australian plant varieties. Improved varieties lead to better productivity, better disease resistance, better keeping qualities and, ultimately, better consumer acceptance and market share. This legislation took us eight years to get into the House and receive proclamation. From 1987 to 1994 it was not amended. It has proved to be successful and will continue playa major role in Australia's economic future. We are now witnessing a major to change in many industries in Australia, especially in the vegetable and horticultural industry. areas. We have just been debating levy bills in the Main Committee on the very issue horticulture. The enormous markets of the future are there for vertically integrated operations in Australia. We need a big jump forward from what we have been used to in Australia. Many of producers in this area have been producing a population of 15 million or 16 million; they need to start looking at markets consisting of ation. hundreds of millions of people. The enormous jump to those markets is a very difficult concept for many Australian producers, rerelation quiring the development of capital in order achieve the objectives that everybody seeks. I strongly believe that this type of legislation, plus the approach that is now being developed in the horticultural industry, vegetable industry and other industries in Australia to look at export markets and at Australian market as an integral overall production and not the production base, is the way for Australia to go. In way consumers in Australia can have the benefit of buying products at world competicompared tive prices rather than being asked to subsiget dise smaller inefficient industries. We are heading down that path. We are seeing sucping cess after success around Australia. In my district in Gippsland there is an organisation known as Vegro. Eighteen months to two years ago-it may be a little more-a large multinational company in one of the big buy-ups and carve-ups decided to dump a factory that it had in East Gippsland because that factory alone was not seen to be productive. That did not stop the local organiIt sations, with the support of the government, producers. getting their act together, doing their studies, formulating their proper business plans and developing their marketing approaches. Today they are starting to move into export markets. Rather than trying to truck their product to the Melbourne markets, they are using the latest technologies in production, packaging and shipping. They are being very successful to in reaching niche markets in Europesomething we would not have dreamed of five 10 years ago. It all comes about by a long, slow process of governments working with The eight years that we spent on this of legislation was very beneficial. To have legislation introduced after an路 eight-year period and then not come back into parliament from 1987 to 1994 shows that the job was done properly; that the industries worked our with the government to achieve what was for beneficial to Australia. There is a new mood in Australia today in relation to this cooperGovernment departments are now working with one project in mind, in particular into regional development. It is up to to the local regions to specifically come forward with the produce, the products which are best suited to their region-for export marketing as well as for the Australian market. Those of the us who have the opportunity, through this parliament's committee work, to get around the Australia will be seeing this happen. It is part of the occurring in many areas. The big problem at the moment is the big that jump-where we suddenly find a market which wants hundreds of tonnes of material with tens of tonnes of material. To that big jump in investment capital, in production quality, in transport and in shipand to guarantee to supply the market is the challenge facing Australia today. It is a new ethos of thinking from the producer right through to the marketer. I have a vested interest in the dairy industry; I am still half-share owner of a dairy property with my son. We have seen the dairy industry blossom in this area, and I am sure that other industries will do exactly the same. is good for Australia and it is good for our In the political sense, I say to some of our political opponents on the conservative side that I do hope some of the members of the Liberal Party can bring some members of the National Party into the modem world with them. The rump of the conservative party did use its rump capacity to achieve objectives for its constituency over a 3D-year period. Those days have passed. We are not talking about a $16 million market anymore; we are talking about a large market where the small producers as well as the big players in the wool, wheat and beef industries are entitled to be involved. It is in that area that I believe this parliament can play a major role. I strongly support this legislation.",35
34,Mr ANDREW,PAIRS,"I also welcome the opportunity to participate in the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994. I observe that the honourable member for Page (Mr Woods), the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) and I have all been involved in the debate in the other chamber. That caused the opposition whip's clerk to say that she had been busier than an air traffic controller. I suspect that sentiment was also shared by the government whip's clerk as the clerks endeavoured to manipulate the speakers between both chambers. It would seem that this is the morning for horticulture. Perhaps it is not unreasonable to observe that, given that spring is in the air, it is an appropriate time to look at horticulture as it is on the move as well. I support the legislation currently before路the House, as does the coalition, because we acknowledge the essential role that plant breeders rights have applied in the development of all crops in Australia since they were introduced in 1986. We recognise that this legislation replaces what was once known as the Plant Variety Rights Act. I acknowledge that in the initial stage of this legislation some apprehension has been expressed, particularly in the grain growing community, about what the changes that were proposed by the government might do. There were those in the grain growing community who felt that the changes proposed in this bill would mean that they were unable to hold on-farm grain. I would like to assure those who are a party to this legislation and those who are directly affected by it that not only the opposition but also its major industry spokespeople believe that the legislation currently being considered by the House of Representatives, having already passed through the Senate, is in the industry's best interests. In an article written in July this year in a newspaper in my electorate, The Murray Pioneer, Mr Mitchell Hooke, the Executive Director of the Grains Council of Australia, stated: People may be aware of recent claims that farmers will be disadvantaged by the new Plant Breeders' Rights (PBR) legislation currently before Federal Parliament. Those who appear opposed to the fundamental concept of 'plant variety rights' allege that farmers stand to lose the right to save their seed for sowing on their land in subsequent years. Quite simply, the conjecture is wrong and misleading. The new PBR legislation explicitly states that farmers have a right to save their own seed for subsequent years' sowing from varieties covered by plant breeders' rights. The rights of farmers to save their own seed was one of the principal undertakings given farmers by the Federal Parliament on the introduction of PYR into Australia in 1986. The Grains Council of Australia, as the grain growers' national representative body, has ensured that farmers' rights are enshrined in the new PBR legislation. The Grains Council has worked actively with industry, the government and the federal Coalition, both of which support the PBR legislation, to ensure that farmers' rights are genuinely maintained. We have ensured that the incentive to invest in plant breeding of grain crop and pasture seed species is maintained in the new legislation as the fundamental objective of granting property rights on new plant varieties. This will ultimately benefit farmers through new and improved varieties. In addition, farmers are represented on the PBR Advisory Committee by a producer representative from the National Farmers' Federation. The committee monitors the operations and administration of the plant breeders' rights scheme. It is regrettable that some are attempting to use the issue of farmers' rights as a means of subverting plant property rights in totality. That is a bipartisan view taken up by Mr Hooke. He found it necessary to address the concerns of farmers, which had largely been inflamed by statements that may have been well intentioned but were unfounded and originated from the Australian Democrats. I want briefly to report to the House the perhaps well intentioned but, in my view, unfounded comments made by Senator Woodley Of the Australian Democrats. In his submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, concerning the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994, Senator Woodley said: The Democrats hold philosophical and ethical objections to the Bill. The allocation of exclusive rights over plant varieties establishes a system of private property rights over living organisms. The privatisation of living organisms, whether they are natural or the product of human innovation, is morally objectionable. As Greenpeace has pointed out in its submission to the Committee, the ownership of species runs counter to the UN Charter for Nature which recognises the principle of the Common Heritage of Mankind. The UPOV Convention, the PVR Act and the PBR Bill compromise this principle by vesting ownership of varieties with private individuals or companies. It is the view of the Grains Council of Australia, the federal opposition and the govern"" - ent-effectively, in numerical terms, the View of this parliament-that this bill does not compromise those who seek to use PBR for their own economic advantage. The purpose of the bill is not to offer exclusive ownership over living material, as alleged by Senator Woodley, but rather to encourage the production of new varieties. I point out to the House that the bill sets out to put a time limit on the period for which anyone can claim any sense of ownership over a particular plant variety. I, by the way, am not offended by any sense of ownership. It is true that it will extend the current period of 20 years for horticultural crops to 25 years, but that is an entirely responsible thing to do. There is a range of horticultural crops that do not get into the production stage until the third or fourth year, and no shortage of crops, such as citrus or pears, that are not into economic production until the 10th year. Anyone producing those varieties may well wait 11 or 12 years before anyone else is convinced that the variety has any real potential to justify their purchasing it and putting it in the ground. To offer someone an additional 10 or 12 years exclusive right over that material does not cause me any offence at all. Clearly, it does not cause the parliament any offence and, most significantly, it does not cause my growers, represented by the Grains Council of Australia, any offence at all. This bill allows us to continue to do what the Plant Variety Rights Bill has done so well in the past. What I think ought to be significant for every Australian producer, whether horticulturalist or agriculturalist, is that New Zealand farmers, who were much more rapid than we were in the development of plant variety rights and in the development of markets of a number of horticultural products in innovative ways, found within 10 years of the introduction of plant variety rights a 500 per cent increase in the availability of plant breeding material to New Zealand producers. If there is one thing that Australian producers need right now it is the opportunity to plant have a range of new crops and new varieties at their fingertips in order to tap into existing and expanding Asian markets. I will come back to that point in a moment. My reference to the Asian markets prompts me to pick up the other point of criticism levelled at this bill. That is the suggestion that the implementation of plant breeders rights as a worldwide concept would in some way disadvantage those in Third World countries. It was presumed they would be unable to access what was seen as more expensive breeding material. I do not adhere or subscribe to that argument at all. In fact, I confess to having spent too little time in Third World countries. However, from the little time. I have spent in Third World countries, it strikes me that they already have a number of varieties of fruit and vegetables-maybe grain crops as well, but I can speak authoritatively only about the fruit and vegetable area-which would already be useful in an Australian situation. They need some of the genetic characteristics that are significant and unique to our cropsThe opportunity for us to develop those genetic characteristics, knowing there is a market for them, exists because of PBR. Furthermore, the initial cost of fruit and vegetable material, particularly of fruit material in tenns of budded trees, is a very small proportion of the total cost of establishing an orchard and of the ultimate cost of getting it into production, having held it in that state for happen. about 10 years. I think this bill allows those in Third World countries who are looking for a genetic range and a set of varieties that might suit their own unique situation a chance to tap into the market. The total cost of their development will be infinitely more than the small cost of the additional price that will apply to the budded material that they use as part of their horticultural expansion. If my arguments for horticulture are not persuasive enough, let us look at the matter of grain. Every Australian grain grower recognises the need for increasing protein levels in Australian grain, something that the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), is more aware of than most other people. It is one of those things that will be developed only as a result of the opportunity for people breeding grain varieties to capitalise on that new market and to be recognised for the work that they have done in that grain breeding exercise. In my own electorate of Wakefield we have a large irrigation area known as the Riverland, which is very significant in horticultural tenns across Australia. In that area only last week I spoke to one of the innovative growers known as Mr Michael Troutwein. He has developed an expanding market for plums using what is called the tatura trellis, where plum trees are encouraged to be developed in a way something akin to grape vines because they are trellised on a Y-frame. The plum varieties that Mr Troutwein grows are not the varieties that he would like for the Asian market. He would like new varieties developed. His plum varieties are okay and they are giving him a market niche, but he recognises that the Asian taste is for a much sweeter plum than that of the traditional Australian production. He would like the opportunity to develop a sweeter plum, to access Asian varieties of plums, to produce them in the clean and green environment of the Riverland and therefore expand an export market. This bill allows him more rapid access to that material and the opportunity to develop a new market for the Riverland and, by implication, Australian horticulture in Asia. We ought to be encouraging that to It is for that sort of reason that the government and the opposition believe this bill is in the nation's best interests and do not subscribe to the theory that the bill in some way allows exclusive perpetual proprietary rights. In fact, it allows those proprietary rights for the people who have developed the new variety only for a sufficient period to get some sort of recognition for the work that they have done and for the chances that they have taken in that development. A good illustration of plant variety rights is what happens in the apple and pear industry. Few horticultural industries have been as innovative in planting patterns as the apple and pear industry. The New Zealanders led the way and around Australia today we will find, thanks to the existing PVR legislation, hopefully enhanced by this bill, a large number of apple orchards going into dwarf varieties and a range of new varieties that are giving us the opportunity to not only get into the Asian market but also capture a foothold in what was once our traditional market, that is, the markets of Europe. The apple industry illustrates best of all the changes in varieties that can occur when people are allowed to tap into a range of plant varieties and when plant breeders are given some recognition, in monetary terms, for the work they have done and the chances they have taken. A month ago, at a small town called Kersbrook in the Adelaide Hills in the corner of my electorate, I was trudging round a cherry orchard which comprises eight hectares and is now totally covered by mesh. The grower covered it with mesh to allow him to grow the cherries in an environment into which birds could not go. As cherry growers know, in Australia 40 per cent of our cherry production is lost to birds. Here is a grower who is doing something that I would have thought was impossible: he is growing cherries to export them into Asia and, in some cases, into Europe in the off-season. His cherry orchard is only four years old. He picked the /lrst crop last year. The crop totalled something like five tonnes, four tonnes of which was exported to premium markets. What that grower most needs now, having managed to keep the birds out of his cherry orchard, is access to varieties sufficiently dwarfing to keep them under the mesh. As one can appreciate, once a limb goes through the mesh one no longer has a bird-protected cherry orchard. He is currently keeping those vigorous cherry trees below the mesh by tying them down with a range of star droppers and ropes. This is to keep the limbs down, to train the cherry trees and to contain them as far as he is able. To his credit, he is succeeding in a very labour intensive operation. Imagine what we would do for him and for the cherry industry across Australia if we had access to varieties sufficiently dwarfing and sufficiently precocious to allow heavy cropping without the growth that is currently lost in excessive limbs and that makes the sealing of the area under mesh that much more difficult. This legislation encourages those who are in cherry production to produce dwarf varieties of cherries knowing that they will be recognised in monetary terms for the risks that they have taken and that they will ultimately add to the horticultural potential of this country. It does not matter whether we are talking about the horticultural or agricultustill ral industries, it is not hard to imagine the advantages that could flow from successful and constructive genetic manipulation and from some technique that adequately allows plant breeders to be recognised for the chances they take. Effectively, the legislation before the House allows us to conform to the 1991 revision of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. It encourages the increased investment in plant breeding and in technology transfer that we need if we are to encourage export industries, particularly export agricultural industries, in Australia. It improves our access to export material that is overseas and that we could usefully use in Australia to expand our horticultural base. Because of the number of pluses that this legislation offers to the Australian horticulturor al and agricultural industries, it has the support of the coalition.",39
35,Mr NEWELL,PAIRS,"Richmond) (12.14 p.m.)The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 is, as has been said, a rewritten version of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. Like the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), I missed the entire first hour of this debate much to my regret. I was involved in chairing the Main Committee for some 60 minutes which kept me away from this chamber. The Plant Breeder's Rights Bil11994, while it is a rewritten version of and does contain some amendments and differences to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987, does have bipartisan support in this chamber. The legislation has been the cause of great angst throughout the community and industry over the years. It has been debated and discussed and consultations have taken place. The honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) indicated that, for quite a period before 1987, when the first bill was introduced and passed, there was a degree of consultation and work done with the industry to formulate the original Plant Variety Rights Act. To some extent, the angst to which I have referred has been dissipated within industry but not necessarily completely. I think we must recognise, for instance, that people are concerned about where some of the aspects of the Plant Breeder's Rights BilI might be taking us. Overall, I think the consultation process has been to the credit of the government. It has been quite worthwhile and productive and has meant that we have the support of the opposition-and, more importantly, quite a few of the peak industry bodies have supported this bill-to ensure its smooth passage in implementation. Some honourable members, like the honourable member for MCMillan, will no doubt remember the original debates prior to 1987 about where we were going with this legislation. In the period since then, time itself should have addressed some of those concerns and should have indicated that the original Plant Variety Rights Act was not an act which would enable the multinational corporations vested interests. to have cart blanche control over the genetic material which exists naturally and can also be put together scientifically and purposefully by plant breeders. The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994, and the amendments that have been raised by the government, address most of the concerns, if not 99 per cent of the concerns, of the electorate at large. Some aspects of the bill have already been alluded to by the honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for MCMillan, some of whose remarks I was able to hear. The legislation has allowed horticultural industries as well as the floricultural industries to introduce new varieties. In my electorate both of those industries are quite substantial. In the horticultural area we have not only a banana industry, which has been present for quite some time,but also a burgeoning stone fruit industry. That has come about because partieular varieties-for example, low chill varieties-have been introduced which have been able to exist in the wonderful climate on the north coast and which have produced a multimillion dollar industry and become a national leader in the stone fruit industry. I pay tribute to the breeders involved, particularly arourid the Bangalow area where most of that industry is established. Much of the material which has come into the country has come from the Florida region of the United States of America where a number of low chill varieties were developed. They were brought into Australia, checked and tested and have been quite productive in parts of my electorate. The banana industry, in some ways, will also come under the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. There are a number of different varieties and qualities of bananas. With recourse to the intention of the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill, the industry will be able to pour more money into breeding disease resistant varieties as well as different quality varieties. Some aspects of the Plant Variety Rights Act, which is being replaced here, and the present Plant Breeder's Rights Bill we are debating have left questions in the community. I would like to address those in my remarks here this afternoon. The access of the public, particularly farmers, to plant material has been addressed in debate on the bill today in that protected plants cannot be held from the public as such. There is recourse to the bill if that happens. Farmers can freely save seed for their own use, which was one of my immediate concerns. That has been addressed in the bill. We will not have a situation where farmers are not able to reserve the seed or plant material they have grown on their farms for future years' growth. They will not be subject to any tax, excise or whatever. They will legally be able to save that seed, as they have done in the past. No doubt that has led the Grains Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation to support this bill. Another concern within the electorate at large concerns naturally occurring plants and even yet to be discovered natural plants; It would be remiss of us as legislators if we did not recognise that across Australia more than likely there are plant species to be discovered and classified. The worth of particular plants that we have even now is yet to be recognised. The application of some of the chemicals and so forth which are in plants has only just now been appreciated. I am obviously referring to the knowledge that is held by our indigenous people as well as to plants which may not路 be known to us. Chemicals have been discovered in plants and patented. I refer to. some situations overseas. I understand that the naturally occurring plant varieties or ecotypes of native species will not be covered, to the extent that they will not be subject to plant variety rights. At the saine time, any particular chemical which might be within a plant, both known and unknown,would not be covered by the plant variety rights legislation. There would have to be some other recourse. A plant, whether it be a plant which is already deemed to be protected under the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill or some other plant that is yet to be discovered and possibly for which inclusion under plant breeders rights will be sought, will still be available for both farmers and for research. That is most important. The use of patents to cover the chemicals within a particular plant would not be covered by this legislation; there would have to be recourse to the patenting laws and so forth for that to apply. The fact that that is the case is important. Many plants, including algae and fungi, are included in this bill now under the new definition of a plant. It is most important that what we can discover from those plants now or in the future not be locked up by simple recourse to the plant breeders rights legislation, for instance. What has occurred naturally to a large extent should be available. If it is incorporated or changed around by me, by a scientist or by anyone else, then it is good luck to them. But under the definition held within the bill the words 'essentially derived' should cover all that. The bill has bipartisan support. It addresses 99 per cent of the electorate's concerns. The honourable member for MCMillan indicated strongly how the bill will ensure that investment, scientific research, time and money are put into new plant varieties. In the process of government it is up to us to put in place legislation and mechanisms which will assist the development of industries. I am very confident that the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill will achieve those aims, that is, lead to the development of industry and assist the farming community in general. Industries such as the horticulture and floriculture industries already have achieved much through the present bill which this bill is replacing. In that sense I commend the bill to the House. I look forward to seeing its implementation and the achievement of those aims. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time. NA NA (No.2) 1994 Consideration resumed from 29 June. Second Reading",42
36,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (12.26 p.m.)I move: . That the bill be now read a second time. This bill makes amendments to a number of acts within the human services and health portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. This bill makes several minor procedural amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986. The pathology amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and correct anomalies to clarify the supervision definition for the rendering of pathology services, restate the original intention of the pathology licensed collection centre scheme and remove the redundant references to temporary pathology collection centres since these licences ceased to exist on 1 February 1994. The amendments to the definitions of 'general medical services table' and 'pathology services table' under subsection 3(1), the amendments of sections 4 and 4A and the repealing of schedules 1 and lA of the Health Insurance Act 1973 are to avoid the need to reprint the lengthy schedules in reprints of the act. The schedules repeat the content of the general medical services table and the pathology services table which are made or amended, and published, regularly, in the form of regulations under the act. The current wording of the act requires that reprints of the legislation must contain some 150 to 200 pages of schedules which are unnecessary. The proposed amendments to sections 4 and 4A of the Health Insurance Act 1973 conform with the arrangements in the act for the Health Insurance (Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Regulations. The amendments to paragraph 16B(11)(d) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 provide for the extension of the 'sunset' provision by two years to 1 January 1997 with provision to extend that date by regulations. Under the current 'sunset' provision, from 1 January 1995, Medicare benefits will no longer be payable for diagnostic imaging services rendered by medical practitioners who were exempted by the 'grandparent' provisions in the 1991 amendments dealing with 'arms length' requesting of these services. An extension will allow for the continuation of the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type services in these circumstances. The 'sunset' provision had been previously extended from 1 January 1993 to 1 January 1995. The amendments proposed will provide more time for the development, with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, of accreditation guidelines for general practitioners who provide radiology services. Paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Hearing Services Act 1991 defines those who are eligible to receive Commonwealth hearing concessions from Australian Hearing Services. The amendment will substitute reference to the pensioner health benefits card with 'pensioner concession card'. The purpose of this change is to ensure that pensioners continue to be eligible for hearing concessions after renaming of the pensioner concession card by the Department of Social Security. All references, except for one,路 to the term 'in-patient' have been replaced with the term 'patient' in both the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953. However, the substitution has not been made to subsection 4(1AA) of the National Health Act 1953. The amendment I am proposing is a housekeeping type duty which will remove an anomaly that exists in the act. The proposed amendment does not alter the intent of subsection 4(1AA) which pertains to the rendering of a pathology service in a hospital or day hospital. This bill makes two comparatively minor changes to the legislation governing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The first of these gives effect to the decision announced in the 1994-95 budget to restrict the issue of safety net concession cards to persons.eligible for Medicare benefits. This amendment is estimated to result in savings of $0.4 million in 1994-95 and $1 million in subsequent years. A second change is to permit the substitution by a pharmacist of a brand of a pharmaceutical benefit other than that ordered by the prescriber, subject to conditions agreed to by the Australian health ministers conference. The adoption of this amendment will result in savings for consumers and reduced inconvenience for both pharmacists and consumers. I commend this bill to the House.",44
37,Mrs BISHOP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mackellar) (12.33 p.m.)The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) proposes amendments to a number of acts relating to health services. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986, the Hearing Services Act 1991, the National Health Act 1953 and the National Health Amendment Act (No.2) 1993. The main thrust of the bill is fourfold. Firstly, it tightens controls over pathology services. Secondly, it allows the level of Medicare benefits to be set by regulation without reprinting in the schedule of the act. Thirdly, it restricts the eligibility of persons for safety net concession cards for pharmaceutical benefits. Fourthly, it provides for brand substitution by pharmacists of drugs or medication prescribed by doctors in certain circumstances. I will tum firstly to the tightening controls over pathology services. The bill deals with this issue in two ways. Firstly, it deals with the supervision of pathology services. The Health Insurance Act 1973 provides the legislative basis for the payment and administration of Medicare benefits in relation to medical and hospital services. These proposed amendments seek to tighten control over pathology services by defining the meaning of supervision. Medicare benefits are payable only if the services are performed or given on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. The proposed amendments dictate that a pathology service will not attract the Medicare benefit unless the pathologist has arranged proper supervision of that service. Proposed section 3AA(3) states that proper supervision has been arranged if the approved pathology practitioner ensures that a properly qualified person supervises the rendering of the service and has personal responsibility for the proper rendering of that service. According to the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of proposed section 3AA is to enable the minister to provide for the definition of adequate supervision of pathology services, rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. The question of whether proper supervision is provided is to be decided in accordance with the written principles which will be determined by the minister. The explanatory memorandum goes on t6 say: The intention is 'that these principles will be modelled upon National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council standards and applied using currently accepted practice for the approving of premises as accredited pathology laboratories. New subsection 3AA(5) provides for the determination of the principles to be a disallowable instrument. The second area of tightened control is in relation to the location of collection centres for approved pathology authorities. The bill replaces the existing section 23DNB with a new section 23DNB which incorporates and adds to the old section. The explanatory memorandum' notes: . ... to allow the Minister to act to alleviate ship 'caused by the commercial decisions of pathology' practices in locating their collection The Bills Digest states:' Presumably the Minister will be able to have SOme influence over the distribution of the collection centres to ensure'that more remote or less economically advantageous locations will have reasonable access to pathology collection services. Proposed section 23DNB(3) provides that the minister must determine in writing principles with which she must comply in performing her duties' under that section. The bill provides that these principJes must include a formula or other method for allocating entitlements, the circumstances and method for varying an allocation and the number and location of collection centres that can be operated under an entitlement. We seek an undertaking from the governmynt concerning the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the intention of the amendments is to allow the minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to provide an undertaking that the principles required to be determined in writing by the minister and subject to tabling and disallowance will address the need for collection centres in rural and isolated Australia to allow fair access. I' am aware of a proposal that provision should be. made for use of the allocation in operating licences on a one for three basis in rural and remote statistical local areas, as defined by 'rural other' and 'remote other' in the January 1994 Department of Human Services and Health publication entitled Rural/remote areas classification. The second main thrust of the bill concerns the table- of fees. The level of Medicare benefit which is payable for a particular service is calculated on the basis of a lengthy table of fees. Prior to these proposed amendments, the relevant tables were in schedules to the act.. Schedule 1 related to general medical services and schedule 1A related to pathology services. The bill omits the provisions requiring the tables to appear in the schedules to the act and instead the bill hard- provides that the level of Medicare benefits centres. will be set by regulation alone. The third thrust of the bill is important and deals with the eligibility of safety net concession cards. These proposed amendments relate to the National Health Act 1953 which establishes the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and ensures that pharmaceuticals are provided to the general public at a maximum of $16 per item. Where an individual or family spends more on pharmaceuticals than the safety net figure of $400 a year, any further prescriptions are provided at a reduced rate. The scheme also provides safety net concession cards for some patients, including pensioners, the unemployed, low income families, veterans, and war widows and their dependants. Eligible recipients pay $2.60 per prescription until their annual expenditure reaches $135.20. After this safety net level has been reached, pharmaceuticals are provided at no cost to the cardholder. The bill proposes an amendment to ensure that the safety net concession cards will be available only to people who are eligible to receive Medicare benefits. Such eligibility to receive Medicare benefits is generally extended to Australian residents and certain members of diplomatic missions. The restriction of the safety net concession card to Australian residents was the result of a 1994-95 budget decision and is estimated to result in a saving of $1 million in 1995-96. Those people who require medication as outpatients, especially in the medium and long term, may wonder what has happened to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme safety net when they realise that the cost of pharmaceuticals rose by 14.3 per cent in the March quarter to 1994. The Australian economic indicators at June 1994 attribute this increase to the reduced effect of the PBS safety net scheme. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has expressed concern at the lack of reimbursement for the extra workload imposed on it by this bill. The Pharmacy Guild argues that under the new legislation, as an additional step, pharmacists will be required to sight the Medicare card, to transcribe the Medicare number and to forward details to the HIC for eligibility. It is argued that pharmacists will also to explain to patients why concession .cards have been denied and try to recover from patients the difference between the concession and the non-concession prescription cost. Alternatively, the pharmacists will have to charge non-concession prices and then refund the difference when cards are validated. The fourth main thrust of the legislation concerns brand substitution, which is considered to be a controversial area. These proposed amendments also relate to the National Health Act 1953. The main proposal is to amend the National Health Act so as to allow pharmacists to supply a substituted drug or medication that is marketed under a different name from the drug or medication which is specified in the prescription. The aim of the proposed amendment is to allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic product for a branded one. This can occur only when the patent for the branded product has run out and generics are being manufactured. When a branded product is prescribed, the patient is required to pay a premium for the product, which on average is between 50c and $1. There can be a definite preference by individuals for a product with which they are familiar. The substitution will be allowed only in the following circumstances: firstly, if the prescription does not indicate that only the specified branded drug or medication is to be supplied; secondly, if a schedule of pharmaceutical benefits issued by the department states that the two drugs or medications are equivalent; thirdly, if a ministerial determination allowing the substituted genetic drug or medication to be marketed under a particular brand name is in force; and, fourthly, if the supply of the substituted brand is not prohibited under state or territory law. This change has resulted from an agreement between state and Commonwealth health ministers concerning rules under which pharmacists dispense medication. The proposed changes have been supported by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia has stated that the bill's proposals do not appear likely to have any significant impact on the pharhave macy profession. However, the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has expressed concern about two issues of the legislation. The first concern is with the term 'equivalent'. It states: Subsection (2A) (b) provides that one of the conditions required to be met before substitution can occur is that ""the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits issued by the Department states that the specific benefit and the substitute benefit are equivalent"". The current practice is for the Department to identify products where brands have demonstrated bioequivalence to the satisfaction of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) through the addition of an appropriate identifier in the PBS Schedule, and APMA considers that it is this practice which subsection (2A) (b) seeks to address. The use of ""equivalence"" has a much broader meaning than ""bio-equivalence"" and APMA proposes that the latter term be used in (2A) (b) and that both the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech make it clear that this subsection refers only to demonstration of bioequivalence and nothing wider. That is the submission which the APMA put to the government. It received an indication from the Department of Human Services and Health that the government was sympathetic to that proposition, as it was to the next one. But no action has been taken by the government in this regard. The second concern of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association related to co-marketed products. It states: There are a number of instances where the same pharmaceutical product is marketed as two or more separate and distinct brands with separate marketing and PBS listing approvals, co-marketed by competing pharmaceutical companies. APMA is concerned that the legislation as currently drafted could allow pharmacists to substitute one brand of such products for another, even though consumer premiums under the Minimum Pricing Policy, which the amendments are intended to allow consumers to avoid if they so choose, are not charged in such cases. APMA supports the proposals advanced by AMRAD Corporation Limited that this problem be resolved by the insertion of the following paragraph into subsection (2A):(c) either: i) the specific benefit is a drug or medicinal preparation, the patent for which has expired; or ii) if the specific benefit is a drug or medicinal preparation which is under patent, the manufacturer has agreed that the specified benefit may be the subject of substitution under the subsection; and Paragraphs (c) and (d) in the existing draft Bill would then be renumbered (d) and (e). I understood that these amendments had been proposed to the government and that contact between the department of health and the APMA had indicated that there was sympathy from the government. However, the parliamentary secretary has advised me that the government will not be moving those amendments. The coalition does not oppose the bill, but it does draw attention to the points made by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. It notes the need to monitor the operation of the new provisions to ensure that the system works as it is intended and that unfairness to patients and manufacturers does not occur. In saying that we do not oppose the bill, I still request an undertaking from the parliamentary secretary concerning the pathology collection centres in rural and isolated Australia. There is a great deal of concern in Australia about the access of people in rural and isolated Australia to a fair and equitable health system. It is for that reason that we specifically request that undertaking.",45
38,Mr LATHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I wish to concentrate my remarks on the parts of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) which deal with pathology services-first, the provision that a pathology service will not attract the Medicare benefit unless the pathologist has arranged proper supervision of the service by a properly qualified person; and, second, the minister for health being allowed to influence the location of pathology collection centres and ensuring that more remote or less economically advantageous locations will have reasonable access to pathology collection services. I wish to address the issue of the location of pathology services and, more generally, the regionalisation of Australia's health system. For instance, the Australian Hospital Association has suggested that pathology services could be used to test the benefits of managed competition; that is, to a purchaser-provider split in health and regional plans. My interest in health policy stems from the issues of equity, access and location, and their impact on my electorate. The distribution of health services in Sydney reflects historical, rather than contemporary, patterns of urban settlement. This lag means that most beds and services, such as pathology, are where the people used to live-not where they live now. For instance, the East Sydney Area Health Service has 6.9 beds per 1,000 population, . while south-west Sydney, which covers the electorate of Werriwa, has just 2.4 beds per 1,000. The south-west region has 11.1 per cent of the state's population, yet it receives only 7.3 per cent of health funding. Just as the federal government cannot rely on the states to redistribute health resources on the basis of need, it cannot count on them to tackle the growing gap in Australia between the demand for health care and the availability of services. The availability of pathology services, both public and private, would be much greater in Sydney's northern and eastern suburbs than in the south-west. The health status and needs of Australians are linked not just to how they live but where they live, hence the importance of community health programs that bring together preventive health and healthier lifestyles. The social justice research program into locational disadvantage, for instance, in a study in Adelaide in 1993 concluded: Measures of socio-economic status are strong predictors of variations in health status ations in the use of health services between geographic areas. The study estimated the additional health costs of the consequences of socio-economic disadvantage at more than $200 million annually in metropolitan Adelaide. It recommended in the reconsideration of public policy the addition of 'an element of targeting policy of universal coverage with socio-economic and locational factors bulking large in the set of indicators that would underpin the targeted approach'. That is, it is never sufficient for government to share its endeavours and activities in health equally across all locations. This is one of the flaws in the resource allocation formula developed by some of the states solely on the basis of regional population shares. Just as much, effective health policy should have regard for broader lifestyle issues such as employment, transport and recreation. This bill takes up issues of location and access for pathology services. It seeks to fulfil the original intention of section 23DNC of the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow the minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. I am an advocate of structural reform to Australia's health system to achieve purposes such as these-that is, to simplify the role of the federal government in health and overcome the inefficiency of the current federal relations. Health policy has become one of the most difficult issues in Australian public life. Scarce resources are expected to meet the growing health demands of a community accustomed to the highest standards of medical care. In Australia this challenge is made more difficult by the uncoordinated and confusing responsibilities in health between the national government and the states. In 1991 the national health strategy reported: The numerous, separate Commonwealth and State programs delivering primary health and community care lack cohesion and clear policy and service objectives. Many are providing similar services to the same target groups. Without overal1 policy and program integration, one cannot be confident that services are being targeted to those most in need, and that resources are being targeted and varito the most effective services. This basic inefficiency is aggravated by the disparate treatment of public and private services by both the federal and state governments. This applies particularly in a service such as pathology. The distinction between the public and private health activities in Australia cannot be made by ownership and funding sources, but by methods of reimbursement. Private activities-such as medical services, pharmaceuticals, private hospitals and private pathology services-are funded on an uncapped, fee-for-service basis at above average cost prices. Public services-such as nursing homes and public hospitals-are funded by capped annual grants with little recognition of service demand and volumes. These arrangements inhibit the movement of resources from less efficient to more efficient health programs. Specific problems include: first, incentives for cost shifting-for example, the privatisation of outpatient clinics shifts costs from state governments to the direct billing of Medicare. In Victoria in 1993-94 this technique transferred more than one million outpatient services onto the federal budget. Across the board the costs of services have shifted from the financially capped public hospital sector into the uncapped Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits schemes-in accident and emergency departments, and pharmaceutical, radiology and pathology services. Second, there are splits in health service provision whereby service providers are responsible for their own activities but not necessarily accountable for the general health status of patients. Differential funding arrangements also jeopardise rational choices between models of health care. The proper administration and resourcing of community health strategies has become exceptionally difficult in Australia. Third, a limited role for the great bulk of health professionals while in the specialities an undersupply of staff has produced excessive costs and prices. Health gains can be realised by liberating and broadening the role of general practitioners into community health activities. Fourth, we have a peculiar mix of health resources-with underfunded public hospitals and a private hospital system with surplus capacity yet insecure financial arrangements due to its dependence on private health insurance and a role residual to the activities of the public sector. I now tum more specifically to the benefits of managed competition and pathology services. Pathology is another example in Australian health of how advances in technology have overtaken the structure of the health system. The services emerged in the 1950s as predominantly private, free-standing laboratories due to the dominance of fee-for-service reimbursement underwritten by medical benefits, then Medibank and Medicare. Public laboratories have been restricted to tests for hospital patients-that is, low volume, high cost procedures-while the private sector has taken up the more profitable high volume, low cost work. In the 1980s automated technology greatly expanded the capacity for testing and volume of test work. Only private pathology services were in a position to take advantage of this expanded market. By custom and practice, public laboratories have not pursued the substantial revenue opportunities of nonhospital private work. Unhappily, this disadvantage has been entrenched in the current legislation as public hospitals are not entitled to the patient episode initiation fee for the collection of specimens. In this era of national competition policy, with an ownership-neutral framework for all policy, it is indefensible for private providers to have monopoly rights in servicing the OF and non-hospital sectors. I urge the Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence) to establish a level playing field between public and private pathology services. Otherwise, with the preparation of the government's model legislation for competition policy, this could well become the first instance of federal anti-competitive practices placed before the Australian Competition Commission. Let us hope it never comes to that. Pathology also exposes a typical inconsistency in the funding arrangements for Australia's health services. While private pathology is financed out of Medicare benefits, public services are funded by the states from grants or own revenue sources. Some laboratories in public hospitals have even been corporatised yet with none of the competitive advantages or uncapped revenue sources provided by government policy to the private sector. In 1991 the national health strategy questioned the funding arrangements for private pathology services. It states: ... there are many people who believe that pathology is the medical service least suited to fee-forservice and that the present balance between feefor-service and other systems should be changed ... Pathology is an institutionalised service, not a personal one, whether the institutions are publicly or privately owned. There is no direct doctorpatient relationship which would make fee-forservice meaningful. I am attracted to the proposal of the Australian Hospital Association to establish budget holder arrangements and a purchaser-provider split for the pathology industry. This structure would establish fair competition between public and private providers and thereby contain costs and improve the quality and accessibility of services. Through payments to regional budget holders it would, with greater overall efficiency, meet the objectives of this legislation for the equitable provision of pathology collection services in remote and less economically attractive locations. I point out to the opposition and, in particular, its shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who has been in and out of the chamber displaying her lack of interest in this important issue, that managed competition is not without its supporters in the private sector. After all, competition is inherent in the ethos and activities of private enterprise. Earlier this year, on 23 June, I had published in the Australian an article about managed competition in health. I was pleased to receive a very supportive letter for this approach from the. managing director of Hampson Pathology Services in Newcastle, Mr John Cameron. I might just read for the benefit of the shadow minister the views that her much touted private sector actually holds about modem, effective health administration in Australia in the 1990s. Mr Cameron wrote: If we could apply out modem systems and management skills in the public the same efficiency to the public sector as we currently achieve, the savings could be as high as 30 per cent of the public pathology budget. All too often the debate in health is about more money with very little focus on how to make the system more effective. He went on to say, quite kindly, that he thought my article was excellent. I think his point of view is excellent. It is a point of view that the opposition could well learn from. In Australian health, and especially in pathology, it is not really a question of public versus private ownership. Hilmer and the national framework have taught everyone that these considerations should be ownership neutral. Anyone who has an obsession with the private sector, such as the shadow minister for health, will pick up only half of the equation of effective health policy in the 1990s. Mrs Bishop interjecting",48
39,Mr LATHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That has been the policy. You have even had on your staff writing your policies people paid for by the private health insurance industry. On this side of the chamber we are not at all surprised when we hear the shadow minister, on bills such as this, reading out the material given to her by the industry groups-the AMA, the Pharmacy Guild, the health insurance funds. They have their agents in her office upstairs writing out the stuff, and she walks into the chamber time after time and faithfully reads it out. It is unacceptable for someone to be a captive of the private sector and for that person to be mouthing nothing but the interests of the private sector. ,., Mrs Bishop- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I take singular exception to that comment. I am captive of none, unlike you, who are a captive of ideology and cannot see past your blinkers. I ask for that comment to be withdrawn.",51
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! There is no point of order.,51

42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for Werriwa should come back to the bill and not respond to interjections by those opposite.,51
43,Mr LATHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member was forced by her own party to comply with its code and ditch the staff assistance. I will continue, Mr Deputy Speaker, hopefully free from interjections from the private idealogue opposite. The way of the health reformer in Australia is exceptionally difficult. The Liberal Party is too ideologically obsessed with the private sector to produce any meaningful reform. My own party-and the honourable member for Mackellar might care to listen to this concession-while fully embracing the outstanding benefits of universal health insurance and a safety net approach, still too readily associates health with welfare. Only the medical profession, especially the specialists, have a proper sense of the workings of the health economy, but unfortunately more for private gain than for public interest. Health service products are difficult to describe meaningfully. The cost effectiveness of various treatment types can never be guaranteed. Providers are a mixture of affluent and influential private interests and an irrational structure of public provision, both with a strong ethical commitment to the rights of patients. The public and, dare I say it, its elected representatives-especially the shadow minister for health-are often vulnerable and dependent on the expertise, goodwill and good advice of the providers. As I mentioned, the shadow minister has had them in her own office. Australia's health system requires much more than incremental reform. It deserves much better than a federal bureaucracy clever enough to prevent structural change but not committed enough to overcome the selfserving concerns of a range of vested health interests. In legislation like this and other health bills-and I have tried to spin out a set of reforms with pathology-there are some important principles that I hope to raise time after time in pursuing and advocating structural reforms based on the following program. There should be clearly defined, armslength agreements between the federal government and the states for the financing and delivery of a comprehensive range of health services. There should be full integration in the provision of health care and the development of sophisticated community health programs through budget holder arrangements at a regional level-that is, the purchaserprovider split. There should be implementation of regional health management-on the New South Wales model, for exampleresponsible for a full range of health services. Other reforms should be equitable funding of geographic areas, using resource allocation models based on population and targeted needs; payment to service providers on an output basis, with a pricing mechanism such as casemix; and fair competition and equal opportunity for public and private providers to secure performance based service contracts from the budget holders. The government has work to do in that regard. The public providers of pathology services are held back compared to the advantages that rest within the system for private providers. On this side it is much more than ideological obsession; it is the concept of the level playing field, with an ownership neutral approach to health care management. We have not got outside interests and their staff working in our offices. Further reforms should be based on continuing the safety net approach of universal health insurance. Mrs Bishop-You have 6,000 public servants.",51
44,Mr LATHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We did not breach the funding arrangements set by the ALP. You would be the only member of parliament in this place in breach of your party's own funding code. You should be ashamed of that, instead of sitting there brazenly trying to get out of it. It is just not right. It is not right when you are condemned by your own party.",52
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member for Werriwa will address his remarks to the chair.,52
46,Mr LATHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If I were not so rudely interrupted time after time by someone who has been condemned by her own party, I think it would be a lot easier to get on with the substance of the debate, Mr Deputy Speaker.",52
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Whether you are interrupted or not, it is still your obligation to conform to the standing orders.",52
48,Mr LATHAM,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am trying my best. Pathology services would be a fine starting point for Australia's progression to managed health competition. There is another issue arising out of this legislation. The model that I have proposed of budget holders at the regional level farming out, on the basis of need and equity, work to both the public and private sectors could be accommodated within the health structures we have in Australia at the moment. This is not commonly understood on the other side of the chamber. In our last sitting week in June, when I was away for health reasons, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) described my set of reforms as an attempt to move towards the British system of health care, towards nationalisation of our health system. It just goes to show that the honourable member for Warringah, obsessed with one issue, knows nothing about other issues. In his own state of New South Wales the health regions are in place, and they are ideally suited to the implementation of the sorts of reforms that I have outlined. There is a broad and very important agenda for the government to pick up in regional health provision. Going by the comments of the member for Warringah-the young fogy from Warringah-they have not got a proper understanding of those opportunities on the other side of the chamber; and that, of course, carries over to the adjoining electorate to the north. But the opportunity is there. The debate on this bill is one in a series of debates in which the parliament can consider the recommendations in the national health strategy in 1991. It should be compulsory reading for anyone in the chamber who is interested in the health debate. It shows the way forward to the sort of meaningful health reform we can have in Australia, free from the ideological obsessions of those opposite.",52
49,Mr VAILE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This certainly is a wide ranging debate, and we are getting into a few diverse subjects. The bill that is being debated today, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994, mainly proposes amendments to a number of acts relating to health services. The main changes include tightening controls over pathology services, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), has covered fairly well; allowing fees for general medical services and pathology which form the basis for calculating medical benefits to be consolidated in the regulations, rather than forming a schedule to the legislation, and being updated by regulation; restricting the issue of safety net concession cards for pharmaceutical benefits to people who are eligible for Medicare benefits; and allowing substitution of some prescription medications by pharmacists, subject to certain conditions. It is fourth element of these amendments that I am mostly interested in. I have spoken in this chamber on a number of occasions about the prescribing and the dispensing of generic drugs, and I will come to that shortly. It behoves me to comment-and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will pull me up as soon as you want to-on some of the comments by the honourable member for Werriwa with regard to using staff from outside and from vested interests. The ALP should never complain about the outside control of political operatives or political parties when that party is so closely affiliated with, and under the control of, the ACTU. It is outrageous for it to talk about special interests and giving jobs out. Yesterday we saw the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) appoint Neville Wran and the head of the republican movement to the new board of ANL. These are people who know nothing about shipping, and he is paying an extraordinary amount of some $150,000 to those two people in the first six months. I do not think that the government should crow too much about who does what around this place. It would not hurt from time to time to consult the specialists on all sides of an argument or an issue. It is very important that in this particular case people from all sides be consulted in the formulation of changes to the way health services are provided in Australia. Again, I was interested to hear the member for Werriwa outline what he sees as the future of health services in Australia. It certainly is interesting and, as I understand it, a little bit contrary to the way that the ALP opposition in New South Wales sees regional health services and the way those services are provided. The most important issue today in Australia in health services is breaking down and getting rid of the waiting lists. It is all about the lack of funding. The public system, the public purse, cannot provide the funding to do it. I am sure this government, with its bent for privatisation and with its absolute commitment to competition policy, is going to head down that path. Maybe the honourable member for Werriwa could talk to the opposition that in New South Wales about some of the things it proposes for the provision of health services in New South Wales. It is looking backwards 20 years rather than looking forward, which is what we must do. Professor Hilmer has indicated that. He has also indicated that we have to knock down the monopolistic way the government runs things and look at alternative methods of providing services to the community because the public purse cannot afford the present services. That message needs to be sent to Mr Carr and his colleagues in New South Wales, who are running a very political agenda on privatisation at the moment, certainly not one in step with the federal government. I ran through an outline of the sorts of things that are being proposed in this bill. The tightening of controls over the pathology services is of concern. The bill proposes to omit the current provisions which allow the minister to determine the maximum number of centres, in compliance with any written principles the minister may determine. The new section is designed to allow the minister to have some influence over the location of pathology centres and to ensure that remote and less economically advantageous locations have reasonable access to pathology collection services. Three mandatory principles will be applied in the allocation of units of entitlement. We believe it should be set out more clearly exactly what services are going to be invited to more remote areas. I understand that the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), is seeking an undertaking concerning the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the intention of the amendments is to allow the minister to act to aIleviate hardship caused the commerCial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. Specifically; the shadow minister is asking the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to provide an undertaking that the principles required to be determined in writing by the minister and subject to tabling and disallowance will address the need tion centres in rural and isolated Australia to allow for fair access. For instance, there proposal that provision should be made for the use of the allocation in operating licences at one-third in rural and remote statistical local areas, as defined by the terms 'rural other' and 'remote other' in a January 1994 Department of Human Services and Health publication. It is alI about fairness, equity and access for those people a little bitmor'e remote than the majority of the population of Australia living in metropolitan areas. people who live in rural and regional Australia have an expectation of-and also deserve-similar services at a similar price to those enjoyed their cousins in the metropolitan areas of Australia. Earlier I alluded to where we are heading with the Hilmer report, to competition policy and to the path the government is heading down with the privatisation of a lot of governrelate ment services. As a National Party member of this national parliament representing a rural and regional seat, I stress that we need to be ever mindful of, and very vigilant about, what is going to happen to the equality of services in regional Australia. The provision of health service is only one concern. We have to be careful and vigilant that all the services that we have enjoyed, sometimes at a slightly dearer rate than our city cousins enjoy, are not eroded in the government's bent for privatisation, for trying to generate maximum competition and the philosophy of user pays. The government's policy affects not only medical and health services but also postal services, communications, transport-everything that we do in the country. We are particularly discriminated against by by this government through its fuel tax policy, which impacts far more on my constituents and your constituents, Mr Deputy Speaker, than it does on the constituents of a lot of the for government members. The government collects 40c or 44c a litre in Commonwealth taxes from our road users. We have to be very vigilant and highlight these matters in this parliament when a bill such as this is for coIlec- under consideration. I support the requeSt that is being made by is a the shadow minister to the parliamentary secretary and ultimately to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that the government provide a level of equitable and fair access to these services to regional Australia. It is terribly important. I am sure ""that tht: government has recently . recognised the importance of some of these accessregional seats. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is doing a lot of work; he is out in western New South Wales paying a bit of lipservice to the poor people suffering from the most devastating drought this country has ever had-today, out in the Dubbo area. The by government might even get genuine and genuinely consider in legislation the plight of a lot of rural and regional people in Australia. Moving on from that aspect, I point out that the bill proposes a change in the eligibility of safety net concession cards. The amendments to the National Health Act of 1953. The National Health Act also established the phannaceutical benefits scheme. Where an individual or family spends more on phannaceuticals than a safety net figure of $400 in a year, any further prescriptions are provided at a reduced rate. The scheme also provides safety net concession cards for some patients, including pensioners, the unemployed, low income families, veterans, war widows and their dependants. The bill proposes an amendment that will ensure that safety net concession cards will be available to people who are eligible to receive Medicare benefits. Eligibility to receive Medicare benefits is generally extended to Australian residents and certain members of diplomatic missions. The restriction of safety net concession cards to Australian residents implements a 1994-95 budget decision and is estimated to result in a saving of $1 million for 1995-96. Something that should be highlighted is that, while the government of today will quite often go out into the community and say that it is doing this or that and providing this or that, this is all based on saving money, on compliance and on trying to hang on to more of the taxpayers' dollars that they have got to spend and that they are spending in other areas.",53
50,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,You are joking!,55
51,Mr VAILE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We are not joking. The childcare rebate is a great example. The government says, 'We are going to give you all this,' but what it does not say is that it is doing away with the dependent spouse rebate on the other side. The government does not give both sides of the argument, and it has been doing that for so long that it believes what it says. It is just a joke, and the parliawish mentary secretary should realise that. The government is giving with one hand and taking away with the other while, at the same time, suddenly collecting more and more under the table, where people do not know about it, in indexed charges. I go back to petrol taxes again. It was in last year's budget that this all came out. But what rose at the beginning of August this year? Petrol prices did. There was no big splash about it, because the announcement had been made last year. The Commonwealth revenue has rapidly increased every year that the Labor Party has been in power. History will record that fact, and also that this government has been the biggest taxing government the country has ever seen. There is no point in the parliamentary secretary arguing to the contrary, because that is a fact. I want to go on to the next aspect of this bill, I believe its most important element: the amendment relating to the substitution of generic drugs with the express approval of the prescribing physician. It is something that I have been arguing for ever since I came into this parliament. This should have been done earlier this year. The former Minister for Health-Senator Richardson, as he was then-was talking about it for months and months without actually doing anything about it. During that time a constituent of mine who is a phannacist was charged by the Health Insurance Commission and is the subject of a court case today over substituting generic drugs of equivalent chemical constituency that can do the same job. Exactly what is being addressed in this bill is the subject of a court case taking place today. On the very day the government introduces this bill to change the provisions on generic drugs, the government - through its instrumentality, the HIC-is continuing with the prosecution of a pharmacist who led the way in opening up competition in prescription drugs in Australia. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) described this pharmacist as a bit of a white knight or a Robin Hood in this area, saying that he has brought to the surface the issue of the substitution of generic drugs. I to read an extract from a speech I made in a grievance debate on 10 February of this year on generic brand drugs. In that speech I referred to the pharmacist Mr Keen, who is a constituent of mine in Wingham, and I said: Mr Keen has adopted the philosophy that he has a duty of care to his patients which not only involves their obvious physical welfare but also their financial welfare. Mr Keen realised that it could be alleged he was breaking the lawand that is what is being alleged in this court case that is under way at the moment; it has been alleged that he is breaking the lawbut in this case he believes the law is an as. Mr Keen strongly believes that, in those circumstances where the patient may be under financial stress, is not only appropriate but necessary for the pharmacist to advise about financial options. I clearly sympathise with Mr Keen on moral grounds and I believe the law needs to be addressed urgently with regard to generic substitution",55
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! I draw the attention of the honourable member for Lyne to the fact that he is making reference to a court case taking place today. If the matter is sub judice, he should be very careful in the way he refers to it.",56
53,Mr VAILE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not believe it is. I used the word 'alleged', and I am reading from a speech that I made in February this year.",56
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Okay.,56
55,Mr VAILE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I shall go on to quote Mr Keen himself. He said: The minimum pricing policy deregulates the price of drugs to allow prices to be set at what the market will bear, yet doctors won't allow their patients to have a choice. What I'm doing is giving them that choice. It seems to me that the government has brought in a policy about drug pricing, but the National Health Act has not been modified to allow that policy to be implemented properly. What is being introduced today, six or seven months down the track, is amendments to the National Health Act 1953. The main amendment to the National Health Act will allow pharmacists to supply a substituted drug or medication that is marketed under a different brand name from the drug or medication which is specified in the prescription. The aim is to allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic product for a branded one. This can only occur where the patent for the branded product has run out and generics are being manufactured. Where a branded product is prescribed, the patient is required to pay a premium for the product which on average is between SOc and one dollar. There can be a definite preference by individuals for a product with which they are familiar. The substitution will only be allowed if the prescription does not indicate that only the specified branded drug or medication is supplied; a schedule of pharmaceutical benefits issued by the department states that the two drugs or medications are equivalent; a ministerial determination allowing the substituted generic drug or medication to be marketed under a it particular brand name is in force; and the can supply of a substituted brand is not prohibited under state or territory law. The important element of this is that pharmacists for a lot of years, particularly since the implementation of computerisation in the dispensing process, have had at their fingertips all the information that has been available in the British Pharmacopoeia on their computers, so that you go in with a prescription for a drug and the pharmacist has a record-if it is the pharmacy that you continually go to-of what other medication you are on. Quite often they pick up what a medico has missed, that the drug that has been prescribed is going to interact with a drug that they are already receiving. Especially since the implementation of computerisation, the pharmacists have been providing that medical and professional service. They are also professional enough to be able to say, 'This generic drug has exactly the same qualities as that branded drug that has been prescribed, yet it is $10 cheaper,' and that is the point that Mr Keen has continually made. I am not going to refer to him again, Mr Deputy Speaker, but that is the point that has been made. Professor Lloyd Sansom, of the College of Pharmacy at Adelaide University, has made it quite clear on a number of occasions that sometimes the benchmark or generic drugs are of better quality than the innovator drug. That is, the innovator drug might have been developed 20 years ago and the benchmark or generic drug has been developed today with modem technology and it is a drug better suited to treat the patient. So to make the generic drug equal to the innovator drug sometimes requires that the generic drug be of a lesser standard or a lower quality than it might be. These things need to be borne in mind when the government and its instrumentalities are putting together the legislation that we have seen today. I commend the fact that the government has used the term 'equivalency' or 'equivalent' in the bill rather than 'bioequivalent', because that does not mean the same thing. It is not important that that be a part of the legislation, as was suggested by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. It expressed concern about the use of the term 'equivalency'. The association said: Subsection (2A) (b) provides that one of the conditions required to be met before substitution can occur is that ""the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits issued by the Department states that the specific benefit and the substitute benefit are equivalent"". The current practice is for the Department to identify products where brands have demonstrated bioequivalence to the satisfaction of the tic Goods Administration (TGA) through the addition of an appropriate identifier in the PBS Schedule, and APMA considers that it is this practice which subsection (2A) (b) seeks to address. The use of ""equivalence"" has a much broader meaning than ""bioequivalence"" and APMA proposes that the latter term be used in (2A) (b) and both the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech make it clear that this subsection refers only to demonstration of bioequivalence and nothing wider. I do not think that needs to be the case. The research that I have done with representatives from the pharmacy profession has indicated that it is not necessary to have the term 'bioequivalence' in the EM, but only 'equivalence'. That goes back to what I set out earlier, which was from Professor Lloyd Sanson with regard to making them equivalent between the benchmark or generic drug and the innovator drug. In the majQrity of cases it has been found that the benchmark drug is of a much higher standard than the innovator drug. I commend the government for taking this action through this bill in providing the people of Australia with choice and in introducing competition into the pharmaceutical industry. (Time expired)",56
56,Mr MARTYN EVANS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As honourable members have indicated in this debate so far, it covers a number of wide ranging areas within the health services field, and in that sense we are dealing with generic legislation as well as generic drugs. In fact, there are two particular aspects of that that I would like to cover. One is the pathology services which have also been canvassed today, and also the drug supply and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I think it is very important that, while this legislation is not specifically about competition in the medical field and in the health field, it is very important that the",57

I call the Therapeu- honourable member for Bonython.",57
58,Mr MARTYN EVANS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. While it is very important that we acknowledge that competition is not fundamental to the legislation before us today, I think in the context of competition policythat and acknowledging that Professor Hilmer is speaking in the Parliamentary Library as we are conducting this debate here this afternoon-it is very important that we acknowledge the role which competition policy can and must play in the future development of health services. It is very pleasing to note the number of members in the debate today who have referred to that aspect of it. To date, government interest in competition and, indeed, the community wide interest in competition policy have certainly led to an acceptance of the benefits which free and open competition can bring to the economy, and the way in which they can improve economic efficiency and enhance consumer welfare. The efficiency contributes to economic growth and to the substance of the nation's level of material well-being in our broader society. It is important that we acknowledge the benefits which that can bring to specific areas such as health where, in the past, that has not always been the case. One certainly has to note the view in the broader medical profession about some of the inherent problems which full, free and unrestrained competition could bring in the health arena. I am certainly not suggesting that we need to go to the length that some have gone to in the United States, for example, where competition has led to advertising campaigns conducted by plastic surgeons, in which full-colour photographs of patients were published in the national press to highlight the differences in technique between individual plastic surgeons. I think that kind of thing certainly misses the point of competition. What we are looking at here is, in the case of pathology services and in the case of the dispensing of drugs-and generic drugs in particular-the benefits which that micro-level competition can bring in the professional arena. Although the professions represent a much harder arena to introduce competition policy into, I think it is very important that the overall debate",57
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! It being 1.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Young Homeless Allowance",58
60,Mr CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to take the opportunity to address an issue that is of great concern to me, and that is the greatly increased welfare mentality of our nation. I am going to be fairly frank in this speech and, for being honest, I will probably be abused and harangued, but it is high time attitudes changed and we realised that society does not owe people a living, that they must in time try to fend for themselves. My concern increased after I received answers to some questions I placed on notice to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) regarding the young homeless allowance. It revealed that in Western Australia since 1987 the number of youths receiving the allowance increased by a staggering 1,0621/2 per cent. It was introduced in June 1986, and in that year 10 Western Australians received the young homeless allowance. In the first full year of the allowance, 1987, there were 104 recipients in Western Australia and by 1993 that figure had ballooned to 1,209. I am not saying for one minute that all of these recipients were not worthy of the allowance. However, it is most evident that quite a number of the recipients were receiving the allowance when in fact they should not have been. I will quote a young person from the television program A Current Affair of 31 March this year to prove that the allowance is being used by some young people who do not need it. The young girl, Tanya, said: I was 15 years old when I got an allowance and I was living at home at the time. And we had a few in arguments like, you know, dads and daughters always arguing and everything like that, and I just took it to the extreme, and I had heard at school that there was these people that the court says that help you and everything, and that you can go to them if you have got a problem and they care. So they sent me to the Social Security to get the young homeless allowance, and I just filled out the young homeless allowance forms and that was it. I was on young homeless two weeks later. The funny thing was, I wasn't homeless. I did have a home I could go to; it's just I chose not to. That anecdote from Tanya is typical of how the system is exploited by many young people. For many families, the young homeless allowance is encouraging family breakups by financing children who want to pack up and leave home. I find it ironic, in the International Year of the Family, that a welfare payment is being exploited, and in the process is splitting up families. To prove my point, I go back to the A Current Affair show. When asked by Ray Martin whether she conned the system, Tanya's reply was, 'Yes, very easy.' There are the side effects of this payment also, such as the young pregnancies .. Tanya was four days overdue with a baby at that interview and admitted that she probably would not have been in that situation had she stayed at home. There are also the drug taking, the kids who decide to just live on the streets and the crime problem which stems from this. These are consequences of the young homeless allowance which are ruining the opportunities and the futures of many young Australians. Another young person on the program also admitted it was flawed in its administration. A young lady called Narelle said: It's easy to bluff the system. You can go in there and say anything and they will give it to you. Narelle's next comments show how the young homeless allowance is ruining the futures of so many young kids in the country like ours, which has so many opportunities to offer our young. She said: Now that I'm out of hollie, there is no way can go back, because I've got too much freedom now. If I moved back, I wouldn't have the freedom that I have. I couldn't go. My question is: what sort of future does Narelle have? She will not have the education she deserves, she will not have the job opportunities she deserves, and this adds up to a future which, quite frankly, will not be bright and prosperous at all. I realise there is a parliamentary committee looking into this allowance but, irrespective of the outcome of that committee, this allowance just backs up the view that there is an attitudinal view permeating through our Australian society and we are becoming a welfare state. Call' it the young homeless allowance, call it the jobsearch allowance, call it what you like, if there is an offer of money from the government, there are many people-and these comments are not aimed at the legitimate claimants-who will do their utmost to get what they can from the system. I think there needs to be a total review of the whole social security system to look at every payment that is made and look at whether it is a successful payment, whether it is easily exploitable, whether it is being abused and whether it is even unnecessary. If such an inquiry were held, I think it would reveal many loopholes, many abuses and a great deal of rorting and would suggest many changes that must be made. I think this is essential, because it is not the government that is the ultimate loser to these cheats, the humble Australian taxpayer. I fear that the Labor Party will tum a blind eye to the rorting, cheating and exploiting of the system that goes on, because it has delibrately manufactured a welfare class in this ation as its own, and then proceeded to hampion the cause of that class. We now ave a society where young people have a alue system based on self-indulgence, cyniism, lack of respect for authority and the elief that society owes them a living. The Labor Party has tried to manufacture a new generation of voters who stereotypically are aligned to the Labor Party, but worse, in the manufacturing process, the Labor Party has made this generation dependent on the govthat I ernment,so that these people fear work, or the fact that they must earn a living. The Labor Party has created a class. of people reliant on' the taxpayer, and of the view that society owes therri a living: Ic-I1 it-and as I said at the start, I am going to be fairly frank-the government tit syndrome. This class which the Labor Party has manufactured has been feeding off the government tit and now cannot be weaned off it. I do not blame young people fo\' this. They are the ones who, through the economic decay caused by state and federal Labor governments, have been deprived of a degree of hope. I blame the Labor Party which, through megalomaniacal tendencies, has put its electoral prospects first and, in orderto satisfy its need for power, has bred a constituency of its own which is reliant on the welfare system. The Labor Party has this group of people on the government tit, and if it pulls them off the tit, which it can and should very easily do, those people will start crying, as you would expect, and .abandon the Labor Party. The last election exposed the - Labor Party as being reliant on many of the welfare recipients when its members blatantly lied about the coalition's policies with' respect to certain elements of the welfare system. They came out saying that we would cut people off social security after nine months-a blatant lie. They. made allegations about our health policy which were untrue, and they lied their way back into power. When you look at their it is comments, they simply appealed to those people who were recipients of welfare. They were wrong in what they said, but they found the tactic of suggesting that the coalition would destroy the welfare system to be a very successful one indeed. I am totally supportive of the welfare system. I have nothing against a system that holds out a hand to those who are finding it a struggle to survive from week to week, but I likewise support the Australian taxpayers, the people who pay our wages and fund our welfare system. They are the ones who are cheated when we have the social security cheats, the young homeless allowance cheats, or some other welfare cheats who have been brainwashed by the Labor Party into thinking that society owes them a living. We need a total revamp of the whole social security system so that, while it provides for those who require and deserve assistance, it is not easy to rort or rip off. The Labor Party is guilty of having created a new welfare class in our society, a constituency all its own. So while the government needs to reform our social security system, it is also incumbent on it to change attitudes to reflect the opinion the silent majority in our country, and that is that society does not owe people a living. I offer the government a challenge, but I certainly will not hold my breath waiting for it to take it up. Ross, Ms Sally",58
61,Mr SNOWDON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.38 p.m.)-I wish to spend today grieving the loss of a very important and heroic person in the field of Aboriginal health. That subject has been high on the public agenda for some time, but little has been done to date in the debate to focus attention on the role that is being played by people within the wider community, and particularly by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who, as actors in the health field, have made a dramatic contribution to the improvement of the health status of their own people and have become, in various ways, politically active as a direct result of their involvement nal health. I want to pay a special tribute to the job that was done and the life that was led by Sally Ross. My words are derived from a eulogy which was delivered by John Ah Kit at the Catholic church in Alice Springs on 2 August. A memorial service was held on the same day, at the same time in the cathedral if! Darwin. Ms Ross. passed away in a road accident on 25 July 1994 whilst doing her job. She was born in Alice Springs and attended school there until she went to Cabra College in Adelaide for high school. But it was as a kid that the woman we came to know and love came into her own. Maybe it is something to do with the Ross family. With 16 brothers and sisters, she learned to stand up for herself from an early age. She learned early on two important things. The first was the importance of family ood the mutual support that each and every one of her brothers and sisters deserved and of expected, just as she was looked after by the rest of her family. The second thing she learned was .to see things clearly and to stand up and fight for what she believed in. This became a hallmark of her life. She came back home to Alice Springs after high school, and was soon involved in work that would touch the lives of many of her country men and women over the following 25 years right across the territory. In the 1970s Ms Ross worked in a number of very remote desert communities, starting with Papunya in 1971 where she worked as a clerk, eventually taking on many of the responsibilities of town clerk. It was also in this year that she married Gary Cartwright, and young Justin, her first child, was born. After Papunya the family went for a year to Areyonga where she again worked with the local council. Then in 1976, the same year Mischa, her daughter, was born, the family went on to Ali Curung-or Warrabri as it was known in those days. At Ali Curung she was a jack-of-all-trades, .doing anything from clerical work with the council to acting as the in Aborigicommunity recreation officer. It was around this time that she developed an interest in what was to become the ruling passion of her life, Aboriginal health. The first work she did in the area was during a stint at Kintore on the Western Australian border, and then later at Docker River, where she started her Associate Diploma in Aboriginal Studies through the University of New England. Her work at the Kalano Association in Katherine led, after much arguing and fighting with the government on her part, to the establishment of Wurliwurlinjang Health Centre in Katherine in 1983, the first Aboriginal controlled health service in the top end of the Northern Territory. Ms Ross was the first director of Wurliwurlinjang, and the success of the place had much to do with the dedication and passion she brought to the job. After another stint in the desert, Ms Ross returned to Katherine where she served as the director of the Aboriginal Institute of Health, which paved the way for training of health workers throughout the territory. In 1985 she was back in the thick of things, starting up yet another health service, this time working with the Anyinginyi Congress in Tennant Creek. She kicked off the health service in Tennant Creek, operating from the old building near the camp on the north side of town. Within two years Congress boasted some of the best facilities in the territory, thanks to the hard work put in by her and the Tennant Creek Aboriginal community. After a stint in Katherine, again this time working as a field officer with the Northern Land Council, she took on another battle in the health field, this time in Darwin. Unlike in her home town of Alice Springs, Darwin had never had any Aboriginal controlled health service until Ms Ross hit town and started the job of community consultations and fights with government and bureaucrats. The establishment of the Danila Dilba Health Service was a crowning achievement. It now services 8,000 Aboriginal people in the Darwin area. After this, she took the fight to the highest levels of politics in her role as the executive officer of the Tripartite Forum and member of the Aboriginal Health Council. During this period she was also an inaugural member of the Yilli Rreung Regional ATSIC Council. Last year Ms Ross returned to Tennant Creek at the request of the Aboriginal community to take over the reins at Anyinginyi Congress again and to sort out problems the organisation was facing. Ms Ross was at the forefront of working in all the major centres of the territory in the area of Aboriginal health and, in a quarter of a century of work, she achieved many things that were important and vital to the Aboriginal people, including the establishment of three major Aboriginal medical services. Ms Ross had the spirit of a fighter. If there is one thing that she never walked away from, it was a good blue. She would go in boots and all, whether she was straightening up a government bureaucrat or a fellow worker-or indeed a politician. She was someone who was never afraid to speak her mind and stand strongly for what she believed. Those who have caught the sharp side of her tongue, as I did from time to time over the years, know that more often than not she was right. She never took the easy way out, never took the simple, nine to five jobs where she could put her feet up at the end of the day and watch the pay cheques coming in. She took on the jobs that involved a 24-hour-aday commitment, the ones that needed a strength and fighting spirit that would win the battles that have to be won against ignorance and prejudice. In all this, she honoured her heritage as a strong woman of the Kaytej and Arrernte people. But there was another side to Ms Ross: she also carried with her over those years of struggle her sense of humour. All of us who knew her wi11 treasure the memories of her laugh, her jokes, and of her humour in the face of adversity or in the midst of a struggle. The work that Ms Ross started is not over. It is merely begun. We are all thankful for the foundations that she helped build, in the knowledge that they wi11 be the basis for a better life for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in the future. I would like to offer my condolences to her family, particularly to Justin and Mischa. It is difficult to explain the feeling one has for such a person, because not too often in public life does one come in contact with people of such dedication. We often hear in this place recriminations made against Aboriginal people-wrongly, more often than not-and about their lack of desire to change or to meet the demands and challenges that confront them in their own lives. Let me put it on the public record that, in my view, that is almost 100 per cent wrong. I have never met an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person working in the field of Aboriginal health who has not made a grave personal sacrifice themselves, and dedicated extreme levels of commitment not only to Aboriginal people but to the wider community. Whilst, in this place, we can often argue about the merits or otherwise of particular policy objectives, and indeed argue-as we do, from time to time-about the appropriateness of funding in this direction, what we should not Jose sight of is the absolute commitment of people like Ms Ross to the quest for self-determination and self-management and control over their own lives by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is total commitment which marked Ms Ross as a truly great Australian. I would like to think that, as the years on and we come to reflect upon this current period of our history, we will recognise that debates in this place matter in some respects but that, more often than not, they are not worth a tinker's cuss. What is worthwhile is the commitment and dedication that a person puts into achieving a better life for others by actually doing things; and Ms Ross was one such person. Moura Mine Disaster",60
62,Mr NEVILLE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Hinkler) (1.48 p.m.)Moura is a mining and agricultural centre on the western perimeter of my electorate. It is a pleasant and vibrant town, indicative of those new communities in Central Queensland combining traditional farming practice with one of Australia's most important export industries, coal. In fact, it is not uncommon for families of the farming community to work in the mines. Moura, with 3,000 people, is also the second largest community in the Banana Shire. BHP's mining operations immediately to the south of Moura produce four miIlion tonnes of coal-600,000 tonnes of which comes from underground operations. Moura, along with the other export mines of Central Queensland, produces 40 per cent of Australia's vital coal exports. Against this background of a successful, happy and productive community, the events of Sunday, 7 August stand in stark and horrifying contrast. At 11.35 on that night, there was an explosion in the Moura No. 2 mine which claimed the lives of 11 miners. That evening, two teams of nine were on the shift underground. Another miner and a contractor were working with the team which was trapped. The second team, led by a deputy, put their路 emergency procedures into practice and, with a combination of good training and leadership, escaped from the mine after the explosion-which, though some distance away, enveloped them in dust and gas. A 10th escapee was thrown to the ground just as he entered the mine. Apart from the that merciful escape of those 10 miners, the rest of the story is a tragedy to test the hardiest participant or observer. Though some said a rescue should have been attempted earlier, roll monitoring showed that high levels of gases, including carbon monoxide, and fires would have made a rescue attempt at that stage highly hazardous. By Monday morning a crisis plan was in place and later the experimental Numbat, which many members would have seen on TV, was on its way to the mine. At 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday, a second and massive explosion blew out the ventilation fans and, ironically, this occurred just before the Numbat was to enter the mine. It was followed by two or three smaller explosions. Extensive fires ensued and a significant danger to personnel became evident. A meeting was held of representatives of BHP, the union and government and reluctantly they took the decision to seal the mine. One can scarcely imagine the trauma this event would have caused for the families of the trapped miners. The doubt, the uncertainty and the ability to properly satiate their grief are all bound up in that one decision. The last lingering doubts and then the horror of knowing their loved ones were entombed for all time are hard enough to comment on, much less live through. Those who died were John Robert Dullahide, 44, of Moura; Darrell William Hogarth, 46, of Moura; David Brian King, 24, of Banana; Geoffrey Mazzer, 45, of Biloela; Mark Reginald Nelson, 36, of Moura; Robert Alan Newton, 39, of Banana; Robert Parker, 39, of Newcastle; Christopher Robert Ritchie, 27, of Moura; Michael Edward Ryan, 31, of Moura; Michael Edward Shaw, 27, of Moura; and Terry Gordon Vivian, 49, of Moura. To the families of these miners I extend my deepest sympathy and that, I am sure, of all members of this House. I commend Bob Flew of BHP and Andrew Vickers of the United Mine Workers Union for their professionalism, and the local union representative, Toby Dittman, for his excellent arrangements. Returning to the scene at Moura: by Tuesday night a sense of resignation had descended on the town and the first of a series of memorial masses was held. An Anglican Eucharist, which my wife and I attended, was held on Wednesday morning. On Friday the grief of the whole community poured out in an open-air service attended by upwards of 3,000 people. Ironically, the service was held in the shadow of the hall built as a memorial to the. victims of the 1975 Kianga mine disaster. Scarcely a person in the town or district was not touched in some way by the tragedy: family, extended family, client, patient, parishioner, club or sporting colleague. One professional man lost eight of his clients and will now have the sad and onerous task of representing their families. Local and visiting clergy, including the Bishop of Rockhampton, local citizens and mining union officials participated in the service. In a rare act of bipartisanship, the Premier and the state Leader of the Opposition attended together, while the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), whose condolences were offered in this House yesterday, and the shadow minister for resources, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), flew in together. Mining union officials, BHP representatives and other industry representatives stood side by side in prayer and tribute. They included Brian Loton, John Prescott, Bob Flew, John Maitland, Andrew Vickers and Michael Pinnock-to name just a few. The presence of the Mayor, Barry Rideout, councillors and former councillors of the Banana Shire, and state members, including Mrs Di MCCauley, whose husband and son have both been miners, emphasised the local sense of loss. In these circumstances, a cheap shot is always the easy shot. I will not be part of that regime, nor, however, do I feel constrained in making a number of personal observations. It is scarcely possible that one community could suffer three such eventualities in the short space of 19 years. Thirteen died in the Kianga mine near Moura in 1975, 12 in the Moura No. 4 mine in 1986, and 11 in the Moura No.2 mine in 1994. I accept that a number of regions such as Kembla and the southern Bowen Basin, in which Moura is located, are gassy, volatile mine areas and that considerable research has gone into safety. I appreciate that there will be a mining warden's inquiry held in October. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to say that a wider ranging inquiry involving operational and safety aspects of all underground mining should follow the mining warden's report. This is in no way to reflect on the competence of the warden, but we should look searchingly at underground mining across Australia. Governments should playa significant part in financing such an inquiry and the subsequent research that such an inquiry might reasonably recommend. The industry, initially through the national energy research development and demonstration program, and later through the Australian Coal Association research program, has contributed $1.7 million to Numbat research, with approximately 25 per cent of it from BHP. I cannot help but observe that development would be enhanced by an injection of federal government funding, first to advance this unit beyond the experimental to the operational stage and then, if this can be achieved successfully, to fund the strategic placement of a number of these units in key mining areas. I must also echo the words of the shadow minister for resources in saying that no effort should be spared across Australia in improving mine safety. These tragedies come back periodically to haunt us and to tell us that we have not done enough. I say that without apportioning blame or condemnation to anyone, but as an appeal to government to take this matter in hand. In the few minutes remaining to me I would like to make another appeal. Although all salary and superannuation entitlements are being paid to the family, the company sponsored death and disablement insurance policies have been paid, and the death benefits will be paid shortly under workers compensation entitlements, we have the problem of common law claims dragging on and on. It is a sad fact of life that the victims of the 1986 disaster have not yet been paid for their common law claims. I think it behoves us, when you think of the great finality of a mine disaster, to simplify the procedures so that these people can have justice. Certainly, the families will have very generous superannuation payments at times; certainly, the families will have company payments; certainly, the families will have workers compensation payments; but without that final common law payment how can the widow, the mother of those children, plan their future, plan their education and make the decision about whether they live on in Moura, or whatever the town might be, or move to a capital city? I make these appeals to the government. Again, I offer my sincere condolences to the families, to the community of Moura and to the mining union. Moura Mine Disaster Overseas Aid",62
63,Mr LES SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Oxley) (1.58 p.m.)Firstly, I join the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in expressing my condolences to the families, relatives and friends of the people who passed away in the disaster in Moura. My electorate base is in the city of Ipswich, and I am sure that in passing on those condolences I speak on behalf of all the people in my electorate who have faced similar tragedies in their lives. I also acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) in the chamber at the moment because, as the honourable member for Hinkler rightly said, he attended with the others referred to. That has certainly been a great tragedy for the mining industry, and particularly for the town of Moura, which I have visited on one occasion as well. I join the honourable member for Hinkler, and I think it is good that he has raised that issue in this place. I wish to move to another point which also revolves around the generosity of Australians when it comes to crises. I know there has been a great response to the tragedy at Moura, but Australians also respond to crises around the world. Australians have always been prepared and ready to respond to the needs of those who are much less fortunate than ourselves. I particularly make reference to the generous response by the Australian government and people to the need to assist the people of Rwanda. It just shows that Australians are people who really do care about their fellow human beings. I am sure all members of this place have been involved somewhere in their own communities and have noticed, through their own churches and community organisations, the generous response that has come forward. I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution by all those people who do respond in need. Unfortunately, when it comes to the question of foreign aid, we often have some criticism out there in the community where people tend to say that we should not be giving aid overseas when we have problems at home. We do not live in a perfect world but, when we see tragedies like Rwanda, I think people in Australia really do see the merit in governments responding and providing in the budget for an ongoing foreign aid process. Of course, it often does not receive the debate that it really deserves in this place. We talk about many other issues that grab headlines, but I do not think that this issue often receives the attention it deserves. I think it is a very important area that we often overlook. Those who have had the opportunity to travel overseas and see what Australia does in the foreign aid area would agree that we can be justly proud of the contributions that we actually have made over many years. The case of Rwanda shows the need for us to respond on an ongoing basis, not just to respond when the crises arise. I think we need to have an ongoing commitment to helping those who are less fortunate than ourselves. We in Australia have for many years had the safety net to provide assistance to families on an ongoing basis, and that is something that I think we often take for granted when we see those in other parts of the world who really do live in dreadful conditions. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I are involved in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We certainly do have to respond to the needs of people at home, particularly our indigenous people. We are responding to that, the resources are there, but we can always do things better in assisting our indigenous people, as you and I both know. To return to the foreign aid question, particularly in this International Year of the Family, I think we should give real consideration to the concept of family and neighbourhood. In this rapidly changing world, where countries can be in constant contact,where communications are better now than ever before, where does the concept of neighbourhood actually end? That is what we really need to look at when we are looking at communication with our neighbours. Where does our responsibility to our global family fit into the equation? Time and again Australians have shown themselves to be some of the most generous people in the world, and I congratulate them again for their efforts over recent weeks. From the recent drought relief charity drives in both your state and mine, Mr Deputy Speaker, to our involvement in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Cambodia, Australians will never turn their backs on those in need. But trying to do this is a particularly hard task for any government. We have to do it in pursuing the sense of responsible global family. If we do not involve ourselves in the trouble spots of the world, we can hardly call ourselves responsible world citizens, and I think we are. I was very pleased to see the increase in our level of commitment to Rwanda once it became apparent that the situation had deteriorated. The government committed $3.5 million in humanitarian aid originally and followed this up with a further $6.5 million on 25 July, a total of $10 million. This was criticised by some sections of the community for not being generous enough-and we can always be critical of there not being enoughbut I think we must go a bit further and look at what some commentators ignored. That was the fact that the defence assistance provided by Australia is costing approximately $25 million. In addition, I would like to remind the House of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) just last week in Townsville when he farewelled the troops going to Rwanda. He said that, with all the foreign commitments the ADF has around the world at the present time, Australia now has more nurses serving overseas than at any time since the Vietnam War. I think that is a great commitment by our nursing staff in the ADF. Just recently the Minister for Defence Science  ate and we were speaking to some defence people at the AmberJey Air Force base in relation to this, and some of those people have actually had their names put on that list to go over there, and they were keen to go and to do their bit for those people. In my own electorate there is a nurse, Karen Harmon, who has gone to Rwanda. She was working with the West Morton Regional Health Authority in my electorate. She is very experienced in the health area and she is actually over there in Rwanda at the present time. It is good to see people that you actually know making that sort of commitment. The majority of Australia's foreign aid is provided in the form of development cooperation projects, and that is important from our point of view. It is by far the best form of aid because it allows people in less developed countries to take some control of their own destiny. It helps them find solutions to the problems which have hindered them in the past. Development cooperation places a focus on the ability and the responsibility of aid recipients to look after themselves. I think that is the most practical sort of aid that we as a nation can give. Australia's future is shaped strongly by our geography, which is often referred to here. That prompts us to alter our focus on aid a little to make sure that the Asia-Pacific region has a priority in aid decisions. If we look at the last budget, Australia's total development cooperation budget was $1,486 million, with those projects specifically targeting development in the South-East Asia region. I think that, once again, was often forgotten in the budget context, but it does show Australia's strong commitment to aid in our own region and in other parts of the world. Humanitarian assistance is one of the areas that many people complain about, but rarely understand. In the interests of informed debate I will, in the time allowed to me today, make a few observations about this sort of assistance. Through immigration programs, we are going to resettle some 13,000 people under that program in the year 1994-95. Those are important areas that are often forgotten. Finally, I turn to the role of those nongovernment organisations that have responded so positively to the need in Rwanda, and all the people involved with them. We should pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of those people. Those non-government organisations supply much of the aid and direct assistance to people on the ground there, and I think that is a great tribute to them, and it is a great tribute to this nation that our people are prepared to stand up and be counted out there and really work to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves. I thank the House for the opportunity to put on the record my tribute to those people. (TIme expired) Medical Research: Financial Assistance",64
64,Ms WORTH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight the way the government has failed those working in medical research and, as a consequence, the longer term good health of all Australians. Researchers have to go begging to charities, and not only to charities. ly, an Australian researcher applied for a United States grant on the basis that Australia is a Third World country in terms of funding for medical research, and he was successful. The International Commission for Health Research and Development recommends that even developing countries should spend a minimum of two per cent of their health budget on research, and Australia spends about half that. Prior to the last election the government made a commitment to increase medical research funding to two per cent of the health budget by the year 2000. In the budget speech, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said: As a step towards the Prime Minister's election commitment of lifting health and medical research, an additional $93 million is being made available for research over the next four years. This claim is dishonest. Studies by Access Economics and the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare undermine the government's claims. Using the government's own budget figures and forward estimates, both studies indicate that, rather than increasing direct government spending on medical research, it will actively decrease from just under one per cent of our health outlays at the moment to 0.83 per cent by 1997-98. The government has committed $667.4 million over the next four years to health and medical research. However, if spending on health and medical research were sustained as a proportion of the total health spending on the 1993-94 rate, the total would have to be $716.5 million over four years. In effect, spending on health and medical research in the four years has declined by almost $50 million, or $12 million per year. While the National Health and Medical Research Council will receive a small increase in funding this year, the government has directly committed $3 million over three years to establish a breast cancer research founda-' tion which the public will be invited to make contributions to. In two ways this smacks of political opportunism: the wife of the Prime Minister is the chairperson, and the role of the National Health and Medical Research CounRecent- cil is diminished. I am one of the people who have argued and lobbied for an increase in funding for breast cancer research. However, I am also on the record in this place as saying: I am not arguing for sectional interest and do not suggest that less should be spent on other areas of medical research. We should not reallocate existing resources but rather increase Australia's overall investment in medical research. It is difficult not to see the foundation as an attempt to politically undennine the distribution of research moneys on the basis of peer review, scientific validity and the detennination of priorities based on Australia's research within an international context and the needs of the community. It could be argued that we do not need to do medical research but could just make use of what is done in other countries. This is a false argument. The fact is that for the good of all Australians we need to have a seat at the international table so that we know what is going on where the bulk of the world's research is done. The price of admission to this table is for us to do quality research to bring to the table. As a nation we spend $33 biIIion annually treating iII health; the direct funding through the National Health and Medical Research Council is only $125 miIlion. Although Professor Forbes was referring specifically to breast cancer research when giving public evidence to the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the management and treatment of breast cancer, his evidence could well have applied to medical research generally. He said: If we have not got the data correct, the information and education programs are worthless. If we have not got the data correct, we are punching smog with our treatment decisions. Research is asking questions and trying to obtain new knowledge. It is also producing ideas and concepts and testing them to see whether they are true and when you make mistakes you develop new ideas to replace the previous concept. It is not difficult to conclude that good clinical research is really measuring outcomes. Wise investment in medical research means savings on expenditure on iII health. If we continue with an open chequebook style, we could be doing all the wrong things. The true costs of ill health are much greater than the aggregate expenditure on health would indicate. Indirect costs due to loss of productivity and earnings can be equally high. Annual costs of individual disorders are typically IOO-fold greater than investment in research in the same direction. Therefore, even small gains resulting from research readily repay the investment. Following the budget, Dr Christine Clarke, who is the President of the Australian Society for Medical Research, commented on the hoax of the supposed additional funding of $93 million, or $23 million annually over the four years. She pointed out that a significant proportion of this funding had been found by resurrecting existing spending of $14 miIIion a year from a program due to end in June. She said that that only left $9 million in new funding, most of which was needed to keep existing programs running. She added: It doesn't get us any closer to the Government's election promise of lifting research funding to two per cent by the Year 2000. When questioned by Kerry O'Brien she said: Unfortunately it is not going to fund any new research at all. And we are meant to be the clever country placing so much emphasis on educating people! Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith, from the Department of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, also was interviewed by Kerry O'Brien. She said: I think one of the saddest things at the present time is Christine Clarke's remark that no new projects will be successfully funded because for a senior researcher that is one of the saddest things of all to see new, young, eager, very capable, very intelligent research workers fail to get funding because of the present system. Dr Brendan Nelson, President of the Australian Medical Association, claims that what the federal government will commit to medical research this year equates approximately to the cost to Medicare of an inOuenza outbreak. The government has failed to recognise that the reason for meciical research is primarily to lead to increases in the good health of all Australians. With resources stretched, there are projects which are uniquely Australian, such as Aboriginal health, or partly Australian, such as chilcihood asthma or melanoma, which have the highest prevalence in this country, that will be lost because that research will not be done elsewhere. The government is being short-sighted. When our scientists go overseas, it is difficult to get them back to an unpredictable environment. There will also be additIonal costs. As Dr Clarke puts it: ... it is important to emphasise too that if we don't do research in this country, the cost of our health care is going to increase, perhaps not today but definitely tomorrow, because every discovery we don't make here we will have to buy back from overseas. The government makes long-term planning for the good of all Australians a low priority. All too often it seems that there is a one-electionto-another mentality. We need some long-term vision. We are stiIl a most fortunate country. Australia must take its place in the world in areas such as medical research. We should be ashamed of being considered Third World in this area. Recently I have been able to meet with health ministers in Zimbabwe and Botswana and to visit the Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana, where I spoke with a specialist physician, a specialist surgeon and also a paediatrician. They talk of the problems of HIV/AIDS and the high incidence of infection. There are estimates that 25 per cent of the sexually active population is HIV positive and that in some communities the figure is as high as 35 per cent. These countries should be able to look to Australia for assistance, expertise and research. Quite apart from any humanitarian consideration, these days, with changing immigration patterns, we cannot afford to say that these problems should not concern us. We need weB-qualified and dedicated researchers with adequate funding and planning as we look forward to the year 2000, and not just the next election. In conclusion, I do not believe I can do better than finish by quoting Dr Christine Clarke: I think the Minister's belief that there is not a crisis is wrong. There is a crisis that will manifest, if not next year then the year after. The situation is desperate and must be resolved with a major in-rease in funding, and we need not only the pnvate sector but the Government to contribute because the private sector will not substitute for Government investment in research. Moura Mine Disaster",66
65,Ms HENZELL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Capricornia) (2.17 p.m.)I wish to record my concern for and condolences to the community of Moura in response to the tragedy of the mine disaster. I acknowledge the reference to it made by the Minister for Resources (Mr BeddalI) in question time yesterday and also that made by my colIeague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in his speech today. As the minister indicated in question time yesterday, the coal industry is worth $7.5 billion in exports. But, as the article in the Age on 9 August said, it is also the mining industry's No. 1 killer. We have to face the fact that this is a very dangerous occupation. Until the most recent disaster, which has once again afflicted the community of Moura, folIowing the two previous disasters there, this century there had been 262 fatalities, as reported in the article in the Age, with the biggest toll of 94 occurring in 1902 after an explosion in the mine at Mount Kembla in New South Wales. Although unreported, five coalminers were kilIed last year in separate incidents-three above ground in open-cut operations and two underground. While the fatality rate and the injury rate have improved since 1986-87, we stilI have a very serious problem to deal with. Both federal and state governments, together with the mining industry, coal owners and unions will have to do a great deal more work on this issue. The Australian Financial Review noted in its article on 9 August: Although the fatality rate of mining has faJlen 40 per cent since 1986/87, mining jobs are still four times more dangerous than those in Australian industry in general. In fact, we do not compare particularly favourably with the United States and Canada. The article continues: Since 1986/87, the mining industry has averaged 30 deaths per year, with the lowest total, 19, in the last year for which figures are available, 1992/93, of which three were in underground coal mines. I do not want to prejudge the inquiry, which will take place in Moura, but we have to be very mindful of the fact that, in the aftermath of a disaster, the next stage of trauma for the families will be the necessary inquiry. A number of experts and people from alI over the country making comments and calling for greater safety can further traumatise the victims. In this case, where there was a very large number of deaths, the whole community was involved. The victims have families and friends. Mining communities are very close. Other family members in the community are often involved. All the mining communities in the Bowen Basin will have been affected, because many of the workers in other coal mining communities have moved around the area and been at different mines. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, they have even worked in the coal mines in your electorate. Many of the mine workers and their families in other mining communities will feel very personally affected. They have shown that impact by their attendance at the memorial services. I place on the record my inability to be at the memorial services due to my parliamentary commitments. But I have communicated with the mining union officials at the state and national levels and will be arranging to visit at an appropriate time. Having worked in the industry and having counselled people who have been involved in serious mine accidents and the families of miners who have been killed, I am only too personally aware of the trauma, grief, anger and feeling of impotence that affects people in this situation. In my coal mining town of Middlemount, the unions and management worked very hard on developing disaster responses. We did a lot of work to prepare for such circumstances. That is not to say that we can avoid those circumstances happening. But the community needs to have a very effective response, because certainly with past disasters in Moura there has been a great deal of anger at the intrusion of outsiders. The press has always been responded to positively because of apparent insensitivities. However, it is to say that the press is attempting to convey to the rest of the country what is happening. But the need to know needs to be balanced with a sensitivity and respect for the circumstances that the community is dealing with. It is very important to understand that both management and the unions are particularly Concerned about safety issues when, coal miners go underground every day. In a sense, one has to suspend that cognitive reference to disaster when driving through the fire doors. I remember the first time. I went down an underground mine. When the fire doors closed behind me, I realised that I was in another world. I had to adapt to those circumstances. Certainly, if the ventilation system breaks down-as it did when I was underground at one stage-the air becomes much heavier, there is much more dust and it gets hotter. Walking through the returns with one of the safety officers and seeing the readings of the methane gas, one realises the very volatile and unfriendly environment there. But miners and their families have to deal with this every day. In a sense, at a psychological level, they have to put that aside. At the same time, they have to be very conscious of the need for safety in an environment that is often dark and noisy, where there is heavy machinery and where one will be walking through sludge and so on. It is a very difficult environment. I believe that one of the reasons for the industrial position of the coal mining unions at the moment in relation to coal marketing and the CIT is that they want the particular dangers and circumstances of their industry to be recognised. This is a challenge for the government, the unions and the coal owners. The state and federal governments must address the issue of mine safety and ensure that adequate funding goes into research. A number of concerns have been expressed in the media and by people who feel that a number of the recommendations that were made following the previous investigations into previous disasters at Moura have not been fully implemented. There is a responsibility on all of us to make sure that these not concerns are addressed. It is important that there be an independent inquiry, however due true process occurs. I would certainly support the member for Hinkler in his call for a widerranging inquiry across the country. Once again, I place on record my concern and distress for the families of those who have lost loved ones in the latest disaster at Moura. Hawke, Hon. R ..T.L: Federalism  hate to guess how many column centimetres have been written over the past few days in our good quality newspapers about the Hilmer report and last week's COAG meeting. We have heard much about the value of competition policy and much about the obstinacy and parochialism of various premiers but precious little about what is surely one of the key issues in this debate: the various roles and responsibilities that the different levels of government have in our federation. All this was happening at the end of the week when the Hawke Memoirs was launched. I do not intend to publicise Mr Hawke's book here-he seems to have the Nine Network at his disposal to do that-but it is ironic to note that it was only four years ago when, as Prime Minister, Hawke stood in this very chamber and spoke of the need to fashion a new federalism, an aim that was deliberately sabotaged by the backbench member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) as part of his campaign for the leadership. It is probably worth reminding ourselves of the path Hawke followed in his views on federalism. In his 1979 Boyer lectures, Hawke argued that Australia was overgoverned and that the federal system was terminally inefficient. As a solution, he suggested that the state governments be abolished and be replaced by regional governments based on amalgamations of local councils. Hawke's lectures caused a minor stir before political reality struck. The sort of change he was proposing would require a rewrite of the constitution-a possibility, given the nation's record of rejecting almost all proposed constitutional amendments, so remote it could be considered only a political fantasy. So in 1990, as Prime Minister, Hawke said, 'We cannot rewrite the constitution, we cannot replace the federal system, but we can make the constitution and the federal system under which we live and work better than it now is.' It is worth remembering that much of the drive for the stance Hawke advocated had come from a Liberal, the then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner. It is certainly worth remembering that much of the cooperative spirit that existed in those days was destroyed by the current Prime Minister in his campaign to secure the top job. Despite the Special Premiers Conferences of the early 1990s and the work COAG has achieved, similar attitudes to those expressed by Hawke in 1979 are still strong. There is a real recognition that, despite all of the complaints we hear of Australia being undergoverned, we cannot realistically expect to see the abolition of a level of government. Instead, we believe that we have to make the current system work. We have to clearly delineate the functions that should be performed at each of the three levels of government-by the federal government, the state governments and local government-and what taxation policies they should have. In 1990-91, when there was much discussion over the Greiner-Hawke new federalism, it was popular to compare Australia with the European Community. It was said that in 1992 there would be fewer regulatory restrictions and less duplication of services between the 12 member nations of the EC than between the six states making up the one country of Australia, despite a centenary of federation. It was pointed out that investors now also had unlimited choice as to where they would invest their capital and had the means to uplift their capital and move it to another jurisdiction almost at will, making it difficult for any Australian government-federal or state-to tax capital or to regulate it more heavily than in the rest of the world. This leads me back to the Hilmer report and to the current buzz words of national competition policy. This side of the House fully supports moves towards a national competition policy. Unlike the Prime Minister, however, we also recognise the work that the state and territory governments are doing to achieve micro reform at their level. It should come as no surprise that the person who torpedoed the new relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in 1991 should now be locked in a log jam with the states. It is said that the states will benefit in the 100ig term through the policy direction outlined in the Hilmer report. Limited the their revenue bases may be, stronger econ ic growth will add more money to coffers while asset sales will benefit the servicing component of state budgets. r j will lead to a bigger national economic take and I am sure few people would dispute this. We all recognise the advantages of competition policy reform and I am sure that most people, despite the noises made by some commentators, realise that efforts towards a national competition policy have not been derailed by the failure of last week's COAG meeting. Earlier this week, Professor Hilmer wrote of the inevitability of a national competition policy. He rightly pointed out that competition policy starts to bite as soon as it is widely believed to be coming. Professor Hilmer said: The clear signal drives reform because managers and other decision makers don't make decisions on the basis of today's market structures and laws but rather on their views as to what markets and laws will be like in the future. It is the expectation of competition policy as much as the resolve of governments to lift performance of their enterprises that has underpinned the already considerable progress in many areas ranging from utilities to transport, banking and communications. If the COAG process collapses, the alternative will be policy formulation conflict, not intergovernmental agreement. We all know of the financial, economic and political costs of this approach yet, by its stance over Hilmer, the government is embarking on a course that could damage the political position of state governments while threatening the national economy. The states have restricted revenue bases. To make up losses they may suffer as a result of competition reform, they may have to rely on costly and inefficient forms of taxation. If issues of compensation, funding and revenue are not resolved states will be put under great pressure to put up taxes and charges, releasing a - hole new range of inflationary pressures. ThIS whole process will be entirely undesirable-politically and economically. COAG is the best method we have available at the moment to adjust the current pressures on our f-deration and to make it work better. The dIspute over the Hilmer report shows just how far we. still have to go in finetuning that federation before it can deliver the economic change Australia needs. It has always been clear that, if the states want more money and freedom on how to spend it, they need the courage to be accountable, to be prepared to say publicly how their own enterprises, like railways and buses, are performing. In New South Wales, the state government has been asking its managers for better performance to maintain dividend streams and lower prices for more than half a decade, and other states have followed its lead. The states are already delivering significant competition reform. It is time for the government to adopt a less centralist attitude. The Hilmer committee was advised that the Commonwealth, under the constitutional powers it has to make laws with respect to corporations, may be able to make laws to cover people and organisations dealing with or competing against corporations. This power is yet to be tested in the High Court. We only hope that the matter can be resolved by the government taking a less confrontationist approach. The Hilmer committee did not stem from a joint Commonwealth-state initiative. Instead it was announced unilaterally by the Prime Minister after negotiations on a joint inquiry broke down in 1992. It was only later acceded to by the premiers. Gary Sturgess, a former Greiner adviser, commented yesterday that Hilmer's recommendations have been unnecessarily insensitive on the subject of intergovernmental relations. He pointed to the close linkages the states saw between competition, policy and the rest of the new federalism, saying: In recommending a National Competition Council which is unrelated to the Council of Australian Governments, Hilmer has chosen a process which separates the different elements of the Commonwealth-State agenda. He went on to say: The underlying problem is one which the states have been warning the Commonwealth about since the very outset of the Hawke-Greiner new federalism process: the states cannot afford financially or p<?litically, to - ave the reform agenda fragmented with all the pam upfront and the benefits delivered if at all, only in the long term. ' What the Commonwealth was offering last week was m?-e pain with nothing more than the promise of political trade offs and real compensation in return ... We currently have a government that is seized with a republican millennium fever, yet it was decided to ignore some of the real problems of our federation. If the Prime Minister really wants his place in history, here is a reform he could make. Gary Sturgess finished by saying: . . . no one should be surprised that the states are no longer persuaded by these assurances. (Time expired) North-eastern Tasmania",68
66,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Bass) (2.37 p.m.)I rise today to speak about north-eastern Tasmania, specifically the area around Derby, and also about the local community near Derby, who are dealing with the chemical Atrazine in their water supply. Atrazine is a chemical which is used to control weeds in plantation and cropping areas. The chemical路 kills the weeds by preventing the process of photosynthesis. Atrazine is used in forestry operations prior to planting and again after planting if any weeds appear. The product has a history of being used throughout the world for such purposes. However, a number of countries have now either banned its use or severely curtailed its application in water catchment areas. Only this year, it has been banned in Denmark and Austria. It is banned in Germany, its use has been discontinued in Scandinavia, and its sale has been suspended in Italy. Atrazine is a chemical which does not break down readily and has been classified as a type 2B carcinogen. It also has the potential to adversely affect the human reproductive system. The people of north-eastern Tasmania in my electorate of Bass are to be commended for the action that they have taken to protect their own health and the health of their children. At a public meeting at the RSL club rooms in Scottsdale on 4 August, the following motion was passed: We call on the Dorset council to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the municipality's drinking water supplies are free from pesticide contamination. We also call upon the council to demand of state parliament a total ban on the use of pesticides within drinking water supply catchment areas and to call for the state parliament to implement an immediate moratorium on pesticide applications until the issue is resolved. I am pleased to say that the Dorset council has acted very well in the interests of its ratepayers on this issue. The council has called for a moratorium on the use of Atrazine in water catchment areas and has generally called on the state government to ensure that drinking water is free of all contaminants as a matter of principle. The people of the Dorset council and the people of north-eastern Tasmania are exactly right: clean drinking water is a matter of principle. Access to safe, clean, uncontaminated water is something that we all take for granted. We are constantly witness to chemicals being liberally plied to our lands and our crops, with very little consideration of the consequences down the track. The testing being done on the water supply in Derby shows that the level of Atrazine is well below the level accepted by the World Health Organisation. This is very good. However, it must be realised that confidence in one's drinking water is a very important thing. Many people do not accept any risk as being an acceptable risk. There are people in Derby who, rather than drinking the mains water supply, travel significant distances to collect their water from pure streams. They simply will accept no risk, and why should they? I commend the people of Derby and the people of north-eastern Tasmania for the action that they have taken. All persons should consider exactly what it is that they are drinking. I also commend the Forestry Commission of Tasmania for the very professional way in which it has handled the problem. The Forestry Commission is the organisation which used the chemical in the area. The outcry and the attitude of the people of north-eastern Tasmania have stimulated the Forestry Commission to place a state-wide moratorium on the use of Atrazine for the rest of this year. The Forestry Commission is also testing the water supply in Derby every fortnight to monitor the measure of Atrazine in the water. As well the health inspector from the local council tests the water supply twice a week. Furthermore, the Forestry Commission has undertaken a three-year research program at a cost of $200,000 to investigate alternative weed control. This entire saga shows something that we all should never lose sight of: a local community does have the right and the obligation to stand up and detennine its own living conditions, what risks it will accept and what risks it will not accept. I commend the people of Derby and the Dorset council for its action in this area, but there is still much work to do. We must be ever vigilant. I brought this matter to the attention of the House because the people in north-east Tasmania are my voters; they live in my electorate. Many times over many years in Tasmania the question has been asked: why do we have a variety of additives added to our water when we, as the people who drink the water, have no say? At last a group of people have stood up and said, 'Listen, local council, local government and the people who are contaminating our water, we have a problem with this and we want to ask questions.' I brought this matter to the attention of level of government so that it becomes a problem not only for the north-east of Tasmania but the rest of Australia, which perhaps needs to be looking at its drinking water supplies. Is drinking water as we want it to be? Is it what we want our children in the future to be drinking? Sometimes it certainly is not. Bodies such as the Forestry Commission in Tasmania are very pro-active in this area. The commission listens to people's complaints, queries and questions. It actively participates and does something about the problem.",72
67,Mr SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! It being 2.45 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day, the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affinnative. NA Western Australian Labor Party",73
68,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise today to paraphrase a quotation from history: I did but see him passing by, but I shall love him until I die. Who said that? It could have been Ian Taylor, the Leader of the Western Australian Labor Party, talking about Brian Burke, who, as we all know, is currently serving a prison term in Western Australia. It is interesting that there are some views in the Labor Party, particularly in Western Australia, that WA Inc. is behind them. In the West Australian on 23 July, a Westpoll held that week found that 68 per cent of those surveyed in the Westpoll think Western Australia Inc. is still current, despite Burke's gaoling. The article said that 47 per cent of those surveyed think Burke's two-year gaol sentence is too lenient; they want more blood, and the younger they are the stronger the blood lust. Fifty-one per cent of those polled up to the age of 35 thought that the sentence was too lenient compared with 44 per cent of those aged more than 36. Steven Loxley, the author of this article, argues that he feels that perhaps the younger voters who responded in this survey felt more betrayed because they were the group which this voted in droves for Burke and Labor in 1983 and 1986, buoyed by a feeling of optimism that the times were a'changing. Contrast that to the reaction of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) when she was contacted about her reaction to the two-year sentence imposed on Burke. After expressing sympathy and good wishes to the family, the honourable member, having worked with Mr Burke, was asked her opinion of him as a man. As the reporter put it, she said, 'Well, in fact, I did not really work with him-(TIme expired) Motorcycle World Championships",73
69,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This week has seen some magnificent achievements by young Australians in sporting events. I would like to draw attention, first of all, to the achievement of Michael Doohan in winning the 500cc motorcycle world championship-a great achievement and I believe something that all Australians would be very proud of. It is a fantastic record because this week was his eighth win, setting another record for the most victories by an Australian in a single 500cc world championship. He is the fifth Australian to win the world motorcycle title since the championships started in 1949. I think we take great pride in our champions and they take great pride in Australia, too. I have a photo which was in many papers this week showing Michael Doohan taking a lap of honour and honourable members should note closely that he carries an Australian flag. It is something that he does every time he wins. He carries the Australian flag and he is proud of it. I also notice a picture in today's HeraldSun of four of our swimmers who have won gold at the Commonwealth Games. Each of them has an Australian flag tattoo on his chest. The caption reads: Heart-felt pride: Andrew Baildon, Chris Fydler, Dwade Sheehan and Darren Lange put the national colours on their chests before winning gold in the 4x 100 relay. ""To show our pride, just how great feat and honour it is to represent our country, proudly put the Australian flag on our chests for everyone to see,""(Time expired) Commonwealth Games",73
70,Mr TUCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Salli Wills, whose family resides in Geraldton in my electorate, on her winning a gold and bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games. Salli, who is 14 years old-the minimum age for athletes to represent Australia-won gold for her individual apparatus performance on the beam in the gymnastics competition and bronze in the team event. Salli is the first WA gymnast, male or female, to win gold at any Commonwealth Games. Salli, who resides in Perth to allow her access to training facilities at the WA Institute of Sport, still competes on behalf of the Batavia Coast Gymnastic Club of Geraldton in any intrastate competition. Salli has been competing since she was six and trains six hours per day six days per week. Such dedication has now been rewarded in her victory for her country, Australia. Salli's immediate ambition is to represent her country at Atlanta in the 1996 Olympic Games. She has told me and her parents have told my office that her ambition is more to represent Australia than to achieve medals for herself. I repeat my congratulations to Salli Wills and her family, who have accepted considerable dislocation to family life to assist Salli in her achievement. I wish them the best of luck for the future. Girrawheen High School",74
71,Mr RICHARD EVANS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"We are talking about achievements today. I want to talk about achievements in my own electorate at the Girrawheen High School. The Girrawheen High School for the last four days of last week put on a show which they produced called Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat. Every performance was sold out. I saw it on Saturday night and it received standing ovations. It was a spectacular show. I commend Richard MCPharlin and Leah a Miliona, who were the principals of the show. we Both are untrained and performed exceptionally well. It was a total school production. All the teachers got involved. The director was Kyle Olsen and the choreographer was Belinda Eaton. The musical director was Bradley Oversby. Mr Barrie Wells, the principal of Girrawheen High School, explained to me during the interval that it had brought the whole community together, not only the Girraween High School but the surrounding areas-so much so that they now want to get a cultural centre up for the area. It is a shame that the grants that the government was giving out prior to the last election are no longer available. Cowan, which was a marginal Labor seat, missed out on grants. Obviously they thought their member could not return. The grants system was very good. A grant might help Girrawheen High School get a performing arts centre in the area to help the community. (Time expired) Terrorism",74
72,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I take this first opportunity since the resumption of parliament after the winter recess to express my sympathy to the Perth Jewish community on the appalling recent attacks of terrorism in Buenos Aires and London. The Western Australian Jewish community has family and community connections throughout the world and I know the community was greatly consternated by these senseless attacks. As well, following these attacks, security measures were instituted locally to help ensure that such attacks do not occur in Western Australia. I was pleased to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in a statement to a Jewish newspaper condemn the terrorist attacks on these Israeli targets, saying: The Australian government deplores terrorism ... and the appalling bombings in Buenos Aires and London. FoUowing the Buenos Aires and London attacks we have reviewed security measures for potential targets in Australia and steps have been taken to ensure appropriate levels of protection. I know that the community would be pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to Mr lsi Liebler, the President of the Council of Australian Jewry, saying that these events would have appalled all Australians. I know my sentiments are shared by my state parliamentary colleague, Diana Warnock, the state member for Perth, and I join with her in extending our sympathy to the local Perth and Western Australian Jewish community. Hawke, Hon. R.J.L.",74
73,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I speak about a matter which I know is very dear to your heart, Mr Speaker, and the hearts of other Labor Party members who are in the chamber today, that is, the ruthless political opportunism of some members in the Labor Party. No sooner does the former member for Wills, a Labor Party icon and our longest serving Prime Minister produce his memoirs and explain just what he did for this great country of ours than his mates start ratting on him. I think it is disgraceful. Take the member for Pascoe Vale, Kelvin Thomson, as an example. Kelvin is a bloke who followed the former Prime Minister around, basking in his warm afterglow, bobbing up in a photograph in the local paper, wrapping the big paw around the former PM's shoulder. But, as soon as the old R.J. Hawke steps out of line and sticks the boot ever so gently into P.J. Keating's backside, Thomson jumps off the bandwagon and starts sending out press releases saying what an ordinary member Hawke was for 10 years in Wills. Never once during that period did Mr Thomson complain about the policies instituted by the PM and the former Treasurer. Those policies included massive tariff cuts, which sent thousands onto the dole queues. I am sure that Mr Thomson's actions are motivated by a deep commitment to the Labor Party and have nothing to do with the fact that he wants preselection for the seat of Wills. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is also suffering from this opportunism. (Time expired) Commonwealth Games",75
74,Mr TAYLOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Like my colleague the honourable member ""for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I want to congratulate Australia's mean machine for its performance yesterday in the pool at the Commonwealth Games. The team included Andrew Baildon, Chris Fydler, Dwade Sheehan and in particular Toowoomba boy, Darren Lange, who was the first off the blocks in that four in the 100 metres relay. I congratulate the mean machine not only for winning but also for its pride in the Australian national flag. It made that point very strongly on television afterwards. I would also like to congratulate another Toowoomba person who won a gold medal and that is Cathy Freeman. She won a gold medal today in the 400 metres event. However, I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed because, as she ran around the track and accepted the accolades of the crowd, she was rather reluctant to show the Australian national flag. Instead, she seemed to be preoccupied with the Aboriginal flag. It seems to me that people who go overseas represent this country and not necessarily one group within the country. Whilst I congratulate Cathy on a fine effort, I am somewhat disappointed that in her case the Australian national flag seemingly took a back seat to what should be pride in our country. Western Australian Labor Party",75
75,Mr FILING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was interrupted before when I was talking about the response of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) to the gaoling of Brian Burke, as reported in the West Australian of 23 July. It is interesting to see the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) in the chamber today. It is good of them to be here. The article of 23 July states: After expressing sympathy and good wishes to the family, Dr Lawrence was asked her opinion of Burke as a man ... Honourable members should listen to this! The article continues: ""WeJl, in fact, I didn't really work with him, okay, bye"" ... It goes on to say: 路 .. it is true that Dr Lawrence did not serve in a Burke cabinet but she had more to do with the then Premier than a lot of backbenchers. It is interesting that she is not even prepared to acknowledge the fact that she was an integral part of Western Australia Inc. and the then Western Australian Labor government. In that article she went on to complain that she was being attacked by her factional rivals in the Western Australian Labor Party. She said that some of her colleagues were attacking her out of revenge for calling for the Western Australian royal commission. An article in the West Australian of 26 July reports that: 路 .. she had not wanted to testify for Burke at his trial this month on fraud charges involving $17,000 in travel expenses but offered to do so under force of subpoena. The matter went no further, she said. The same article reports that Mr Quigley, Mr Burke's lawyer, said: 路 .. Dr Lawrence's reluctance was due to her view that to testify would have been politicaJly ""highly embarrassing"" . (Time expired) Member for Lalor",75
76,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I did not get a chance when I spoke before to praise the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who is not actually with us at the moment. He has looked after his seat for 17 years but now a couple of warlords in the Senate have got behind a back door somewhere and want to turf him out. They want to foist on the electorate a bloke who has been in the Senate. He will not even sit in that electorate and will not do anything to look after the people of that electorate. Yet the warlords in the Senate say, 'No. Time out, Barry.' They want him to be shunted off to greener pastures. If there is not something wrong with the preselection process in the Labor Party someone ought to put me straight. It looks like there is a serious problem. In any case, I thought there was a democratic process that operated in the Labor Party. I thought it was yeah, the party of democratic socialism. It used to be. I am sorry about that; I forgot about that. I am with you, Barry. Commonwealth Games",76
77,Mr HAVILAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I did not see the incident involving Cathy Freeman, but all I can do is remind the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) that Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games are a chance for individual sports men and women to achieve individual honours. I would ask the member to keep that in mind. I found it a bit bemusing when I was watching the games on television and saw that when Australia won gold and silver and New Zealand won bronze and finished fourth all the flags of the countries were in a row and they all looked the same. I wondered what was going on. It just goes to show what a farce it is that so many countries, including Australia, have got the flag of another country in the comer of their own. Good on Cathy Freeman. She put her individual position on the line and she deserves full credit for it.",76

79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Was the Managing Director of the National Australia Bank right when he said yesterday that 'a more aggressive fiscal stance would minimise the risk of excessive burden falling on monetary policy'? Was the Governor of the Reserve Bank right when, in a recent speech in Tokyo, he said of the government's deficit reduction strategy that he 'hoped it will be able to do better'? Are his hopes well placed or does the minister intend to ignore calls for a better budget deficit reduction strategy?",76
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I really wonder how serious the honourable member is. This budget is $600 million to the bad as a direct result of what those opposite did to this budget and its predecessor. They get up in here and start to give us lectures on fiscal responsibility. After they have finished doing that, having increased in practical terms the budget deficit by about $600 million, they rock in with their shadow ministers, and what do they start to produce? The shadow minister for health has started to produce a whole series of spending programs. The shadow minister for aboriginal affairs has started to produce a whole series of spending programs. In conjunction with their leader, in so far as those opposite could ever discern anything from what he has to say, they have started to produce a series of propositions on substantial tax cuts with no indication whatsoever of any offsetting savings in the spending areas. We are happy to listen to any advice that comes to us from the Reserve Bank or anywhere else on the subject of our fiscal policy. We are not happy to receive advice from those opposite, as they have materially placed themselves in the way of continuing to pursue the sort of strategy that we are pursuing. Suffice to say that the Governor of the Reserve Bank expressed the view that he was perfectly happy about the fiscal targets that were put forwardMr Costello-He said he hoped you'd do better.",77

82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,by this government when its budget was brought down. Human Rights: Sexual Activity,77
83,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney-General tell the House why the government will be taking action to protect the basic right of all adult Australians to part in consenting sexual activity in private? Does he agree that the protection of basic human rights is not the responsibility of the Commonwealth and that state governments should be free to infringe on basic rights whenever it suits them?,77
84,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. The standing orders explicitly prohibit calling upon ministers to announce policy or to deal with things that are on the Notice Paper. The minister has already announced that he will introduce legislation on this matter. Surely it is his second reading speech that should explain these matters to the House-not a dorothy dixer at question time.",77
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With regard to the matter which the honourable member has raised, I do not think that announcing intention in this regard is a matter of announcing government policy. I am sure that the minister in his answer will not canvass issues that may come before this place in legislation, which at this stage has not been introduced.",77
86,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Commonwealth government takes the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms and liberties extremely seriously. We take those issues seriollsly not only in terms of our international relations and the fact that this government and many previous governments quite openly make comment and often criticise the human rights records of fellow nations but also those sorts of considerations and fundamental issues are very much at the forefront of our minds in determining policy within this country. The laws in Tasmania criminalise homosexual conduct and some other sexual practices between consenting adults. In my view, one of the most fundamental examples of where it is totally inappropriate that a government, a state authority, should be involved in regulating the behaviour of its citizens. Governments do not exist to have rights; governments exist to protect and enhance the rights of citizens. Of course these are fundamental beliefs which are not shared simply by government members; I would think they are shared generally by the Australian community and take largely by members on both sides of this House. Against that framework, I would have thought tM right to enjoy basic levels of privacy within one's home was quite fundamental. The idea of legislating to guarantee this right of privacy is not a unique one. I am not the first person to propose it; there have indeed been other advocates of such a right. I draw the House's attention to an article which appeared in the Weekend Australian on 9 April this year entitled 'Costello's vision goes down-market'. In this particular piece the honourable member for Higgins does the vision thing. One of the vision things he deals with is rather interesting. The article states: But he is also determined to protect individuals' rights to privacy-proposing a parliamentary committee to vet legislation for breaches of human rights, including the right to privacy. Then he is reported as stating: I think maybe we need a right to privacy in Australia, enshrined in legislation, diligently watched and guarded by a hllman rights committee. That is an interesting view. When proposing such a federal law inscribing such a right, I do not know what he thought would happen to section 109 of the constitution if there happened to be a state. law operating which infringed such a right. Maybe section .109 would render the opposing state law invalid. But of course the opposition runs away from this commitment it has to basic rights, goes back to the next step and says, 'We believe in ba-ic rights, but more fundamentally we believe in the right of state governments. '",77
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting..,-",78
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! We all know that the honourable member for Lalor enjoys considerable support in this House and we also know that he has arrived, but we do not need it drawn to our attention.",78
89,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They then argue that this is a bad law in Tasmania, but they protect to the death the right of the Tasmanian parliament to enact their bad law. Mr Costello-Like Barry's right.",78
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader d the Opposition!,78
91,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the view which the opposition now has. That is not even a consistent view in the opposition because in the Adelaide Advertiser on 20 June this year we saw some interesting opinions expressed by the honourable member for Barker about the federal parliament overriding the states. The article states: The Coalition has opened the option of using federal external affairs powers in government to override the .States and resolve environmental disputes. It continues: ... the Opposition's new environment spokesman, Mr Ian MCLachlan, said he would resort to the Commonwealth's controversial external affairs powers if a dispute reached an impasse. So we are not quite consistent on that point; are we? They do not really believe in the fundamental right to take on a fight, because they then say we cannot take on a state government. But, of course, on some subject matters they say, 'Maybe we will take on a state government.' The honourable member for Warringah today, in an article in the Australian, was saying, 'Well the Commonwealth shouldn't be relying on the external affairs powers to base its legislation on,' yet we have the honourable member for Adelaide imploring the House to use the external affairs power to pass legislation on female genital mutilation. Throughout this whole debate we have had absolute silence from the Leader of the. Opposition, with him refusing to commit himself and. refusing to speak on social policy. The Australian people want an answer on this. They want to know whether you actul).lly believe the words that you spoke in your maiden speech, when you said, 'In the contest between the government and tl1e citizen, I am for the citizen,' or whether it has a qualification that 'In the contest between the state government and the citizen, I am for the state government.' .. . Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. That was my maiden speech, thank you.",78
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That was very generous. Shipping: Australian National Line,78
93,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to the appointment of Mr Neville Wran as the Chairman of the Australian National Line. Is it a fact that Mr Wran's $150,000 fee for two days a week work for just six months is the equivalent of an annualised full-time salary of $750,000 a year? Is there any other federal government body whose chairman receives $750,000 a year? Does the minister think that payments of this size are appropriate for the chairman of a bankrupt shipping line who has no experience of shipping? Did the minister approve this payment?",78
94,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No; the Remuneration Tribunal approved the payment, having looked at the task that Mr Wran had set himself and the sorts of funds and resources that can be commanded in the private sectorwhich you so nobly defend in this place-for a similar task, and arrived at that judgment. I assume that, having arrived at that judgment, based on the sort of information that it put in place in regard to that, it was a perfectthose ly reasonable conclusion for it to come to. Bankruptcy",79
95,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. As the minister would be aware, an evaluation of the operation of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 was undertaken late last year and a report was produced. Given the importance to the community and to business of a strong and effective bankruptcy act, can the minister outline the findings of the review and the relevance to business operations in Australia?",79
96,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After the introduction of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991, which came into effect on 1 July 1992, the government undertook a review of its effectiveness. That was because at the time of its introduction there had been some concerns from practitioners in the area as to how it might operate. The background to the reason why the amendment legislation was introduced is that there was considerable community concern that fraudulent bankrupts were being able to take advantage of loopholes in the bankruptcy act and to escape their responsibilities whilst honest but unfortunate bankrupts were unable to have efficient discharge of their responsibilities and were going through protracted processes before they were able to achieve a discharge of their bankruptcy. So the major objectives of the amendments, which were known generally as the Skase amendments, were as follows. The first was to introduce a new regime of compulsory contributions for bankrupts from their income so that income streams would be taken into account. The second was to introduce substantial new powers to give official receivers powers of greater investigative capacity, to allow them to be better able to seek information and better able to access the resources and assets of bankrupts for the benefit of bankrupt estates. The third was a reformed regime for discharge for bankruptcies, allowing early discharge for bankrupts who were honest but unfortunate whilst at the same time allowing prolonged bankruptcy in the case of against whom reasonable suspicions could be had that they were seeking fraudulently to avoid payment to their creditors. At the time these amendments were passed there was significant opposition from some practitioners. Senator Tate, the minister who introduced those provisions, undertook to have a review of them after they had been in operation for some time. As a result, questionnaires have been mailed to a wide variety of those involved in the industry. I am pleased to say that an analysis of the results of that questionnaire shows that there is now very substantial widespread support for the reforms, including from private insolvency practitioners. The review found that the amendments have been effective in both improving collections from bankrupts and increasing returns to creditors. They have also been effective in their intention to allow bankrupts early discharge where they are able to show, with the stringent disqualification and eligibility criteria, that they are proper candidates for early discharge. A copy of this report, which contains a comprehensive evaluation of the responses, is available through the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. This is a pretty significant review of the operations of the Bankruptcy Act. It is an initiative which has little precedent. I believe it is the first time that the effectiveness of the bankruptcy system has been reviewed in such a way. Its success shows that there is some merit in considering it on future occasions to ensure the continued good operation of the system. I am sure that if that is the case and the department does follow such moves, it would have the widespread support of this House. Asset Sales",79
97,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Minister for Finance agree with the assertion by the honourable member for Melbourne that planned asset sales should be scrapped and the revenue shortfall made up with new and increased taxes? Further, is the minister aware of comments made recently by my friend the honourable member for Reid that 'there is a fair indication around the place that the numbers are not there for the privatisation of the FAC'? In view of the government's decision not to privatise the ANL and the Left's confidence in preventing the sale of federal airports, can the minister inform the House what impact the collapse of government asset sales will have on the budget deficit? Does he have a contingency plan, or will he be joining the queue to raise taxes?",80
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly do not intend joining a queue to raise taxes. I have not seen the detail of comments attributed to honourable members on this side of the House. But I say this: the proportion of asset sales in terms of the government's saving task does decline from this financial year onwards to a point where its impact on the budget is quite negligible. That is about three years out. Nevertheless, the government's deficit reduction target remains in place. If there were any changes in any area to the structure of the budget, including any area of anticipated raising from the privatisation process, it would be necessary to adjust policy to meet it. My position as the finance minister is that we would cut programs to reach that point. We regard the deficit reduction strategy as being very significant in order for us to maintain sensible economic management in this country. It will be adhered to. Pharmaceuticals",80
99,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. What is the government doing to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals to consumers?,80
100,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As honourable members will be aware, the pharmaceutical benefits schedule is a very important part of the universal Medicare scheme available in this country. Obviously, the government is keen to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals to consumers. A major element in our policy is clearly to encourage brand substitution where that is possible. At the moment, that is severely restricted. We are moving to ensure that in the future consumers will have an opportunity to have brand substitution at the level of pharmacy. The pharmacists will be able to see whether generic substitution is possible and to arrange for a drug to be substituted for the one that may have been prescribed. I think it is important for members to recognise that the doctor continues to have a right of veto if he or she believes that there are reasonable circumstances under which that substitution should not occur. In any case, these generic brands have to go through the same process of assessment as patented brands. It is very important that honourable members realise that consumers are to be well protected under this extension of the pharmacy scheme to allow for generic substitution. These changes will be introduced late this year. I am delighted to be able to assist members of the opposition in this matter, because I understand that as late as yesterday they were unable to get a reasonable briefing from the opposition spokesperson on this issue. Mrs Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know that the minister does not pay much attention to legislation and does not come into the chamber",80
101,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,80
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! What is your point of order? Mrs Bishop-My point of order is that the matter the minister is dealing with in answering the question is, in fact, a matter that is before the House, debate on it has begun and it will continue to be debated this afternoon. If she came into the chamber she might notice.",80
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It has always been the practice that explanatory activity around the bill has been pennitted, albeit constrained, when that bill is before the House. The questions as to detail have been pennitted.",81
104,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,81
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have had one from each side. I will deal with it. The honourable member for Mackellar raises a valid point of order and I remarked on that when the Attorney-General came to the dispatch box earlier today. Ministers should know that if legislation is in the House, then there is a responsibility not to debate that or to raise that in questions. The minister is pennitted to continue her answer as long as it does not go to the substance of that legislation.",81
106,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I had, in fact, concluded my response except for the final point, which is an important one. I was providing this information to the House just in case some honourable members had not heard it, particularly those on the opposition benches. I understand that yesterday opposition members had a great deal of difficulty getting a comprehensive briefing from their spokeswoman. I was simply attempting to assist the House in this very important matter. Health Insurance",81
107,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Does the minister agree or disagree with the statement by her predecessor, Senator Richardson, in December 1993 that initial estimates of the cost of Medicare assume that at least 40 per cent of Australians would maintain their private health cover? If not, what level does she believe is critical, in mind that today figures, which just happened to fall off the back of a truck, are to be made available, I understand, that show that as of 30 June 1994 even basic cover is down to 37.2 per cent-less than 40 per cent? Would the minister tell us, at the same time, why she continues to pretend that provider agreements are the answer to the decline in private health insurance when evidence, sited by Mrs Tehan, the Victorian Minister for Health Services, demonstrates that provider agreements which have existed in that state for some time have not arrested the decline?",81
108,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very important to recognise that those figures are public figures. They have not fallen off the back of a truck and they are available to all members of the House and are regularly published. They show that during the last period nationally the supplementary table figures fell to 34.1 per cent. The importance of that figure is that it falls short of the 2 per cent required to trigger discussions with the states under the Medicare agreements. We have only had a 1.7 per cent decline. We have a package of measuresMrs Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Just to help the minister along, Mr Speaker, I was talking about the basic cover not the supplementary cover.",81
109,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member will resume her seat.,81
110,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The critical figures from the point of view of rediscussing the Medicare agreements with the states-and I presume that is what the shadow minister is really interested in-are in the supplementary table and they have fallen by 1.7 per cent nationally. Although we will have a package of health insurance reform measures shortly before cabinet, I am pleased to say that in a couple of cases there has been no decline at all and in other states the rate of decline has slowed significantly. I believe we are seeing a turnaround in all states except Victoria and South Australia. Figures in those states have continued to decline. Figures in other states such as Western Australia and Queensland are now stationbearing ary, and New South Wales and Tasmania have seen very small decreases. Mr Downer-Who did you walk away from?",81
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,81
112,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be delighted to have discussions with the state governments about renegotiating the Medicare agreements, as I believe we will, not this time but probably later this year. Mr Downer-Kim stuck up for his mates. I admire him for that.",81
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition!,82
114,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have to say-and I think it is worth stopping at this point-that we have here a Leader of the Opposition who is doing what he does consistently-interjecting sotto voce, attempting to disrupt the proceedings of this House.",82
115,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,82
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order! The minister might resume her seat for a moment. Mr Downer interjecting,82
117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am happy to take the appropriate action if the Leader of the Opposition does. He has been called to order twice. I ask him to respect the position that he holds.,82
118,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can understand that the Leader of the Opposition does not want to hear about this matter because the problems that our hospitals in this country are facing are almost entirely due to the declines in state government expenditure, except, I might say, in Queensland.",82
119,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,82
120,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It may amuse members opposite to raise a wall of noise whenever there are matters that they do not want to hear discussed. But under the last Medicare agreements, which we are happy to debate with the states when the health insurance levels fall that 2 per cent, you will find",82
121,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,82
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister might resume her seat for a moment. On a number of occasions this afternoon I have had the opportunity, and indeed the need, to draw the attention, particularly of those on my left, to the requirement of standing order 55. Ministers are entitled to be heard in silence and they will be. I now issue a general warning.",82
123,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The important point here is that the Medicare agreements provided the states with an extra $800 million-a very significant increase in every state. Out of $179 million went to New South Wales, $247 million went to Victoria, $114 million went to Queensland, $137 million went to Western Australia and so on. Mr Speaker, you will find that the states have withdrawn funding at about the same rate as we are putting it in-in some cases, at a much greater rate. The honourable member for Mackellar mentioned the Victorian health minister. The Victorian health system is the worse of the lot. The federal government added $247 million to the hospital system there and the Victorians have pulled out $370 million. So, instead of being mesmerised by declining health insurance figures, which are stabilising, have a look at Liberal state governments and see what they are doing to hospital funding in this country. That is where the responsibility for problems in this area lies-not with Medicare funding. Home Child-Care Allowance",82
124,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise the House of the effect on families of the new home child-care allowance and partner allowance being introduced next month?,82
125,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question. As honourable members would be aware, the new home child-care allowance comes into effect from 29 September this year and it replaces the with child rate of the dependent spouse rebate. This represents a major structural reform to the system of assistance to families in this country. Contrary to a number of preposterous claims by the opposition, it does not represent a sleight of hand by the government; in fact, not only does it represent delivery in full of our election promise but also it exceeds our election promise in quite significant respects. Who are the beneficiaries of this change? About 800,000 families will benefit from the increase in the general rate. The home childcare allowance is worth $5 more a fortnight than the old with child dependent spouse rebate. Some 55,000 families whose incomes were insufficient for them to benefit fully that, from the operation of a tax rebate because they did not have sufficient taxable income will benefit to the tune of up to $60 a fortnight. Around 120,000 families where the carer moves in aHd out of the work force will benefit from the added flexibility of the system. If, for example, somebody leaves the work force they will be able to go straight on to the home child-care allowance instead of having to wait until the end of the financial year for a tax reconciliation. The benefits are very substantial. What is the bottom line? The bottom line is that this measure costs some $230 million more than the old dependent spouse rebate. So the opposition spokesman's claims that we are working some kind of sleight of hand is absolutely demonstrably absurd. We are providing an additional $230 miIlion in assistance to families over and above that provided by the old with child rate of dependent spouse rebate. Opposition members have scoured through this matter and have tried to come up with some cases where somebody might possibly be worse off. They have focused on a number of issues, such as the difference in the definition of 'income' between the Social Security Act and the tax act. A small number of people will be affected by that; they will suffer a slight loss. That loss is massively outweighed by the gains from the whole process. Let us contrast what we are doing in this area with what the former Fraser government did when it did something rather similar. It brought in the family aIlowance to replace the old dependent child tax rebate. That substitution was done with a zero net budgetary impact in the long term-not $230 million extra for families. But worse than that, there was no indexation of that payment for the remaining part of the life of the Fraser government which, in effect, produced a $250 million it year saving by the end of the Fraser government's term of office. That is the reality. In other words, it was a substantial real cut. This non-indexation was done in the context of double digit inflation. There is a pretty sharp contrast there. When the tax legislation was being debated in the parliament last night, the opposition spokesman made a number of statements. I understand the bill went through the House this morning, so I am not in contravention of the standing orders. He said a number of totally misleading things. He talked about couples on JSA. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If the minister wants to reply to something that is said in debate on a bill, he can come into the House and enter into the debate on the bill. If he missed the opportunity to do so, he cannot go over it in question time with a prepared speech.",82
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister has been asked a question. He is specifically answering it. I invite him to draw his answer to a conclusion.,83
127,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not go in for a detailed point by point rebuttal of the remarks of the opposition spokesperson in that case. The opposition spokesperson on social security has an interesting way of approaching some of these issues. When the consultant's report on the pensions income and assets test came out, he issued a press release on the same day and then later claimed that he had not received the paper .until five days after it was released. What he had to say about the impact these measures will have on people on part carers pensions, on couples getting part-time earnings and on people on unemployment payments was demonstrably wrong. In the interests of brevity I will not go into detail on that. I would urge all those who may be affected by this new measure to read the material which is being direct mailed by my department and also by the Taxation Office to understand the provisions carefully. This measure is a substitution for the old with child rate of the dependent spouse rebate. Mr Ruddock-Sleight of hand.",83
128,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not a sleight of hand. We have made that perfectly clear from the start. It represents a major increase in the structural improvement in the system of assistance to families. The Lodge: Employment of Casual Staff,83
129,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the Assistant Minister to non-payment of superannuation to employees at the Lodge. Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister's department, presumably with the support of the Prime Minister, has contravened the relevant award and the Superannuation Guarantee Act? Can the minister explain why his department has allowed the Lodge to apply different rules of industrial relations to its employees compared with those which legally bind all other employers? Or is this just another example of imperial exemption?",83
130,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am unaware of whether we have applied different rules to that situation, but I am keen to investigate the matter and will report back. Victorian Bar Council",84
131,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Attorney-General aware of reports that Peter Faris QC has effectively been blackballed by the Victorian Bar Council? What is the impact of this on Commonwealth prosecutions in which he is involved? What is the significance for reform of the legal profession generally?,84
132,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Peter Faris QC is an extremely experienced criminal advocate in this country. He has been in the past and is still often briefed by the Director of Public Prosecutions to conduct criminal prosecutions for the Commonwealth. After some 24 years as a member of the Victorian bar, Mr Faris left the bar and now practises as a solicito-. The Victorian bar operates a so-called boycott rule, whereby members of the bar are not to appear in cases with non-members. In the past the bar has given certain exemptions to the application of this rule. However, recently a junior who was briefed to appear with Mr Faris applied to the Victorian Bar Council for an exemption, and that application was refused. This obviously is a matter which the Commonwealth views very seriously. In fairness to the Victorian bar, it has reformed a range of rules and practices which I think could be very fairly described as anti-competitive and designed to protect the interests of the bar rather than the public. It has revised a range of those rules, but this rule remains in force. Fortunately to date it has not impactland ed greatly on the particular prosecution in hand, but if there is a general application of this boycott to Mr Faris by the Victorian bar it will greatly limit the legitimate choice by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of whom it selects to argue cases. This brings home very clearly the need for genuine competition rules to apply to the professions, particularly the legal profession. That is something the profession itself says it strongly believes, and I understand the Victorian government says it strongly believes it. It was somewhat ironic at last Friday's meeting of the Council of Australian Governments to find that apparently the Victorian Premier expressed the greatest opposition to the idea of the Trade Practices Act applying to the legal profession. Apparently it was argued by the Victorians at that time that the application of uniform competition rules would disadvantage Victoria inasmuch as it would be the lowest common denominator and they wanted to go further in terms of applying competition principles. Here is a perfect case in point: an application of a rule which I do not believe can be justified in the public interest; a clearly uncompetitive rule designed to guarantee the monopoly of the bar. I call on the Victorian bar to reconsider its position on this individual case, but I also call on the Victorian government to reconsider its opposition to the application of competition policy to the legal profession. I believe the profession as a whole accepts the need for competition policy, and it should not be frustrated by stupid arguments about states rights. Drought: Assets Test",84
133,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Given the extreme hardship being caused by the 1990s drought, why will the government not suspend the assets test for affected farmers applying for education and welfare payments, such as Austudy, jobsearch allowance and family allowance, and apply an income test only? Is the government's position a reflection of the Prime Minister's cruel belief expressed in his recent trip to Queensthat drought, no matter how severe, is just an ongoing management problem for farmers?",84
134,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a range of hardship provisions in the Social Security Act which are designed to assist farmers in difficulties. Those hardship provisions provide for the payment of basic pensions and benefits and also additional family payment and basic family payment. They are specifically designed to pick up families in situations where they have low incomes and hardship, and there is provision for either the removal or relaxation of the assets test in those circumstances. Mr Tim Fischer-Removal?",85
135,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is provision for exemption from the assets test in certain circumstances. It is a matter that the government has under constant review. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has travelled extensively in drought affected areas and he has recently brought to cabinet a submission, which the government has adopted, to provide additional assistance to farming families that are encountering significant difficulties. That does include student families in a number of circumstances. We will keep the matter of whether any further changes need to be made in the social security area under review. On balance, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, in his submission, outlined a range of other priorities that should provide significant benefit. On the whole, I think we will need to keep that matter under review. There are hardship provisions there, and the government does care about the circumstances of farming families. As to the question of Austudy, I suggest that the honourable member direct that to the relevant minister. Rwanda",85
136,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. I understand that the minister intends visiting Rwanda shortly. Can he inform the House of the timing and purpose of the visit?,85
137,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Like most honourable members of the House, he is following events in Rwanda with a mixture of interest and horror. I shall be going to Rwanda for three days early next month on my way to the conference on population and development in Cairo. I leave here on the 3rd and spend the 5th, 6th and 7th in and around Rwanda. I am going there to look first-hand at how the massive amount of aid-very generous amount of aid-which has been delivered by Australia is working on the ground and to see for myself in what ways we might be able to the assist as the tragedy becomes, we hope, more slowly manageable as refugees return to Rwanda itself. In so doing, I will conveyand I believe I will be conveying on behalf of every member of this House-my appreciation to the Australians who are working on the ground there, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances, doing an extraordinary job. Secondly, I shall express-and in this answer I express-my appreciation to the Australians who have given so much money to allow those operations to carryon. Mr Tim Fischer-Like Dr Herron.",85
138,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely, and I hope to see Dr Herron when I am there. It is the case that Australia, on both a governmental level and a private level, is amongst the top three or four donors in the world in terms of the amount of money which has been given. We rank only behind Israel, Ireland and the Netherlands in the proportion of GDP which we have given in humanitarian aid from the government, military aid and private contributions-$26 million of private contributions and $35 miIIion from the government. It is an extraordinary outpouring of generosity and I want to convey, again on behalf of everybody here, my appreciation for that. In particular, I will say to our troops who are working on the ground in the field hospital in Kigali that they, too, deserve our gratitude. I intend to go to the major camps, certainly in Tanzania-the rather forgotten camps at Ngara where Australian assistance was first delivered very early in the piece. I intend to go to Kigali, which has become the centre of the in-Rwanda operations in the hope that refugees will return to Rwanda, as they are now doing gradually, but as they need to do far more quickly. I want to go to Butare in the south west, which is likely to be the scene of the next major camp set-up as the French forces withdraw. As well as that, in Kigali I hope to have talks with the the major United Nations organisations \Vorking in the freld and with ministers in the new government. In all of this I hope to bring home a better idea of how Australia can react in the medIum-term to a situation about which I confess I am very gloomy ,because of the potential for tension which exists after the genocide which has occurred. But I believe that we need to know at first-hand what we can do. Indigenous Peoples",85
139,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister is aware that the draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides for indigenous peoples to have the right freely to determine their political status and that this covers the rights to secede and to form independent nations. In July in Geneva at the 12th session of the United Nations working group, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs strongly urged the adoption of the draft and issued a media release giving unqualified support for the draft. Does the government's strong support of the draft extend to the self-determination provision? Has the government ever expressed any opposition to the provision? If not, why not? Does the government regard Australia's territorial integrity as up for grabs?",86
140,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the third time that the honourable member for Tangney has raised this question. I have given him an answer in writing and also at this despatch box. On the last occasion when I did, the opposition kept interrupting the entire time. The government does support the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples consistent with national sovereignty. The declaration to which the honourable member for Tangney refers is in draft form only at stage. It is going to be the subject of a thorough process of negotiation. We expect that that process of negotiation will take some years to complete, so the honourable member will have at least another 14, 15 or 18 months in this place to ask further questions about it. In that time there will be ample time for careful consideration of all the issues and for input from interested parties, both at the national level and at the international level. When that universal declaration is adopted, it will not be legally binding on any country but rather an aspirational document which establishes standards that governments throughout the world can work towards. Motor Cars: Purchases in Country Areas",86
141,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Would the minister agree that there is a problem with people in country areas purchasing cars from city dealers when these cars do not meet the specifications described, usually verbally? The state small claims tribunals seem incapable of giving assistance in these areas. Does the federal legislation offer any' help to these people? If not, would the minister consider taking up the matter with the states and discussing the means of strenthening the small claims tribunal provisions so protection can be afforded?",86
142,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am very willing to look into this matter. The only thing that has been drawn to my attention is the problem with motor vehicle replacement parts. Certainly we are looking into that. The Industry Commission is currently conducting an inquiry into that. In all areas where there is discrepancy between what happens in country areas and city areas and where there is a problem we are looking at it. The recent ministerial council made a decision to look very carefully into all these matters. I will get a more detailed reply for the member.",86
143,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Vacation of Parliamentary Seats",86
144,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, you this would be aware of the factional infighting going on within the Labor Party in Victoria and the attempts to politically decapitate one of its members. If an inducement such as the retention of the glittering prize of the presidency of the ALP were made to a member and if that inducement affected the exercise of his duty or authority, would that offer constitute an offence under any Commonwealth law and, if so, which law? Secondly, could, and in what circumstances would, such an acceptance of an inducement constitute a breach of privilege?",86
145,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Mr Speaker, could you add to that a consideration of whether or not promises of shadow cabinet portfolios in leadership ballots constitutes the same sort of inducement?",87
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,The honourable member for Flinders has raised with some degree of seriousness an issue of concern and I will treat it accordingly. I will have a look at the privilege issues and other matters raised in the question and report back to the honourable member. NA,87
147,Mr SPEAKER,RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA,Pursuant to the Reserve Bank Act I present the report and financial statements 'of the Reserve Bank of Australia for the year ending 30 June 1994 together with the Auditor-General's report thereon. NA,87

149,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The political and economic implications of the Government's mismanagement of the privatisation of public assets. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",87
150,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We now have a government which is engaged in financial incompetence on a grand scale. The ANL disaster is a fully fledged financial fiasco of the dimensions of the State Bank of South Australia, Tricontinental, VEDC and all the other financial fiascos that go with a Labor government. Whilst the Commonwealth was the states in Darwin about the need for privatisation and the need to sell off their assets, there was a boil on the Commonwealth finances that was bubbling away and ready to burst out. It was not the only boil that burst out on the Labor Party this week. The Labor Party is in the process of publicly butchering one of its own, Barry Jones. Broken on the wheel of ruthless political war lords, the faction leaders detest free thinkers and are detennined to run them out of the Labor Party forever. I would not nonnally agree with Barry Jones on much but I feel that I have to represent him because, after all, he is one of my constituents. I have to stand up in here and defend him. One thing we know about Labor members of parliament is that they do not want to live with their constituents. The public butchering of Barry Jones because he is a free thinker should be regretted.",87
151,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will refer to the member by his electorate. He knows better.,88
152,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The current member for Lalor-if that is the way you want me to describe him-is being publicly butchered by the war lords of the Labor Party. He is riding into the valley of the shadow of death like the charge of the Light Brigade. The cannons to the left of him are Carr and Bolkus and the cannons to the right of him are Ray and Keating. He has been volleyed and thundered into the valley of the shadow of death. This is the road to 600, except Barry is 599 short on this one. All the world wondered: Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die ... You are seeing the public butchering going on in relation to the Labor Party broken by the factional war lords who resent free thinking. I refer to the Australian National Line. This government pumped $160 million into this shipping line between 1983 and 1985. It accumulated $96 million worth of losses. So you put in $160 million, but you still made $96 million worth of losses. So approximately $260 million has been spent on ANL. It still owes $180 million. So you put in $160 million and you lost $100 million. In other words, you blew $260 million and it still owes $180 million. After the due diligence study was released, it was found that ANL may have a negative worth of $75 million. The government could blow $350 million on a shipping line. The taxpayers of Australia might as well take their taxes out and wash them down the gully trap rather than pay them to a government that is going to throw them on the high seas in relation to the ANL shipping line. You cannot trust the Labor Party with money. You can trust it with factional deals, heavying over preselections and having its snouts in the trough, but you cannot trust it with money. Mr Beazley interjecting",88
153,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are a little bit clean. You are standing by the disgraced, gaoled Brian Burke. You cannot even stand up and say that criminal conduct is criminal conduct. You used to stand up in this House day after day and defend criminal conduct. But that is your standard, my friend. I suppose that you are part of the 'Get Barry Jones School'. I will tell you one thing: the girth of the Labor heavyweights might match the IQ of the honourable member for Lalor, but their brain cells certainly do not. You are the defender of Brian Burke, the now disgraced former Labor Premier. You are upset that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) would not stand by a convicted man. You should not stand up here and start talking about that kind of thing. You have no scruples whatsoever in relation to that. Of all the limp performances that we have seen over many a year in this parliament, none could have been as bad as that of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in here yesterday. He said that he accepted full responsibility for the losses of ANL. He gave no explanation of how that came about. There was no plan to get the money back. In a report last year, the chairman of the board of ANL talked about the problems of ANL. He said that the uncertainty arising from a lack of progress with respect to privatisation of the company, both within ANL itself and in the wider commercial community, has had, and continues to have, a deleterious effect upon the company. The chainnan reported that it was your policy of delay and no progress that was having a deleterious effect on the company. So what did the minister, who accepted full responsibility, do? He sacked the chainnan. It is like the coach of a losing football team who says, 'I take full responsibility, so I'm going to sack the players and keep my own job.' That is essentially what has happened. ANL is going down, and the minister says that he is accepting full responsibility. He came in here and gave one of the most limp performances that you will ever see. He said, 'Oh well, the opposition's only contribution to this debate has been to suggest privatising it.' Oh, mea culpa! We were suggesting privatisation. What a silly idea that was! It just happens to be the idea of your budget, my friend. Page 3.268 refers to the privatisation of ANL. You have bundled up all of the prices to try to show that in 1994-95 you will get $2.5 billion. You ought to be explaining to the House today how much of that $2.45 billion you got from ANL. Now that it is off, you ought to explaining to the House how you will get the balance of the money. You ought to be making good the answer that you gave in question time and down at the Press Club today about looking at further expenditure cuts. You ought to be detailing to this parliament what you will do to try to get your budget back into order. You ought to be explaining. to the House where you are going to get the money from. The Minister for Transport could not even act on the basis of that due diligence report from Salomon Brothers and Price Waterhouse. They said that there should be a managed trade-down or an informal liquidation. They said that this was the only viable disposal option. In other words, the ship is going down and the sinking ought to be managed in a way in which we minimise our losses. The response of the minister was to say that before it sinks we are going to give the jackals one last chance to pick the carcassand who better to do that than Neville Wran? Could this be the same Neville Wran who gave evidence for the minister in the Botany Council case heard before Chief Magistrate Murray Farquhar? Could this be the same Mr Wran who the government has appointed as the chairman of CSIRO? Could it be the one who is advising the government on northern development? Could it be the one who has been put on the APEC eminent person's group? Could it be the same Mr Neville Wran who is chairman of Turnbull Partners Ltd? Could that be the same company of which Mr Turnbull is a director? Could he be the same Mr Turnbull who has been working so hard for the Labor Party on the Republican Advisory Committee? Could it be that this Mr Wran will be paid $151,000 for a part-time job which is going to take 52 days a year-an annualised salary of $750,000 from the Minister for Finance? Malcolm Turnbull has come in cheap-on an annualised basis he is only getting $700,000 for the services he is rendering in relation to ANL. These people have all got full-time jobs in merchant banks and the CSIRO. You are bringing them in and giving them unbelievable remuneration and pensions-and a parliamentary pension in relation to ex-Premier Neville Wran. You are bringing them in and giving them one last chance to pick at the carcass before the ANL goes down: one more report on the company that has already been investigated by Salomon Brothers, Price Waterhouse and Potter Warburg. This is one more gigantic financial failure leading to one more gigantic rort. If you strike the ANL proceeds out of the budget, where do we go next? Next is the FAC. You said in question time that you had not yet seen the report that Senator Kim Carr made to the members of the parliamentary Left. It starts, 'Dear comrade' and it is signed 'Yours in solidarity'.",88
154,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It didn't come to me.,89
155,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can make it available to you. I think you are going to need this for the national conference. It starts with a resolution rejecting the cynical attempt to pre-empt the national conference and finishes by saying: Accordingly the socialist left calls upon all sections of the party to support the existing party platform of 100 per cent public ownership of the PAC. It contains a whole lot of other things that the left caucus is going to be gunning for you on at the national conference. It will make very good reading. But in relation to the FAC, you now have to admit that your FAC privatisation is in severe peril and jeopardy. Even Minister Brereton is talking about the fact that he might institute long-term leases instead of selling it off. You ought to be in the parliament saying how much of that $2.45 billion set down for 1994-95 has been earmarked for the FAC sale, how much you are going to lose in relation to that particular sale if it not come off and how you are going to make it up in relation to expenditure cuts. That is what you ought to be doing. There would be no company in Australia that could get away with a prospectus that is as rubbery as your budget figures. That bottom line deficit figure is complete fiction. You cannot tell how much money you have earmarked; you can tell how much is already out and you can not tell how much is going to go out when Senator Kim Carr and his faction make sure that there is a full scale onslaught against the government's policyits cynical policy, as they refer to it-in relation to their position paper. The Labor Party is just a collection of warring tribes led by factional war lords fighting each other, trying to divide up the spoils of majorities in safe Labor seats, treating the people in safe Labor seats as voting fodder for the insatiable appetites of the factional war lords in relation to the spoils of office and tribal power, and butchering the member for Lalor in that lust for power, making sure that he has no place, because you have to bring Gareth Evans down to the House of Representatives to pursue prime ministerial ambitions. He is well ahead of you in the queue, my friend. Senator Gareth Evans is no more popular than the honourable member for Lalor, so the public will think that his being brought down here at the expense of the honourable member for Lalor is stupid. It makes no sense at all. Senator Evans cannot go out to Holt because that is too far from the airport. He cannot go into any seat that has a margin of less than five per cent because he might lose it. Here is this bloke who is going to be a great vote winner, and you cannot even put him in a seat that has a five per cent margin. That is what a great vote winner he is. If you want to say, in relation to the people of Jagajaga, Bruce and Isaacs, that they do not think the Labor Party can actually win those seats, that is all right; we will take them, and we will make sure that they are properly represented, not just treated as voting fodder for the tribal ambitions of these factional war lords. There is a ruthless determidoes nation by these war lords to enjoy the benefits of office. There is no competence left in this government, which is squandering taxpayers' funds on loss-making activities. There is no coherent economic approach. There is no trust any longer in the bottom line of the budget. There is no strategy to take the pressure off interest rates, with the Reserve Bank again issuing a warning in its reports which you have just tabled in relation to that. The government is a tired old group of factional war lords fighting for the fruits of office and doing nothing for the people of Australia.",89
156,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This happens to be about the lowest ranked performance from one of the lowest ranked performers that the opposition has managed to cobble together on the front bench. There is one rule in .politics: if you are going to start to sling xour stones, take a look at your own glasshouse and how well it is protected before you do. This fellow rocks into this place trying to lecture us on the subject of factionalism and what might happen to people in this party as a result of it. We all remember how Mr Elliott and Mr Kroger imposed him on the people of his constituency, organising against the then sitting member, Roger Shipton. We can remember that. We do not operate in this place on a 24-hour memory like you do. You rocked into this little chamber to get your backside on that seat over there specifically as a result of factional conniving and activity inside the Liberal Party in Victoria. If you actually want to make a point on that in this House, get somebody else to make the point; you are about the last person who can afford to do it. Every time you stand up in this place, you reveal your terrible ignorance-or stupidity-in some area of economic management. I will give a few examples. You stand up there and criticise the government for putting down a global amount associated with what it considers to be the likely returns from privatisation-trade sales, floats or whatever. This is a big .point of criticism of the government: 'You don't tell us路 what you expect to get; therefore, we can 't put a value against this. You ought to be revealing these documents.' You must be a complete idiot. Do you seriously expect that, when we are out there trying to achieve the best dollar that we can from our sales proposition, we are going to go out and announce in the marketplace what it is that we intend to get from the product we are selling? Do you seriously think we are going to go out there and say that, in order to let everybody out thereparticularly路 those who might路 be prepared, to engage in a trade sale with us-know our bottom line and adjust themselves accordingly and start to bet against us? I wQuld have thought that a modicum of common sense and sensible commercial practice might have told you that. I compare and contrast the performance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), with the one of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) the other day, who quoted the chairman of ANL as saying that he is frustrated by the government's slowness in the area of privatisation. The honourable member for Moore stood in this place the other day and said, 'Why didn't you fire the board earlier and do something about it?' Mr Filing interjecting",90
157,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I mean the honourable member for Ryan. I can guarantee that the honourable member for Moore does not make a sensible contribution in any debate in this place. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition revealed once again his terrible ignorance of his shadow portfolio. He directly contradicted somebody on the other side of the House who knows a bit about company business. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then came in here and asked us, 'What will you lose in this year's budget as a result of the FAC sale?' I would have thought that he, as the opposition shadow spokesman on treasury matters and, prior tei that, the opposition spokesman on financial matters, would know that the government's announced intentions with regard to the sale of the FAC were not incorporated in this financial year's consideration but in subsequent ones. One would think that fact would have slipped into his consciousness some time down the track and been incorporated into his argument about wher- the government was going with this year's budget. If he had wanted to, he could have concentrated on subsequent years;' but it was slipped in there. It was a case of laziness. Fundamentally, everybody on his side of the chamber knows that about him. It is not that he is without intelligence; it is just that he is without bottom. He does not want to work. There is no coherence in anything he does except when making childish, student debating points. School was the last occasion in his political life when he achieved anything, albeit on our side of politics when he was at it. He has been trading on that time to gain a reputation in national politics ever since. We on this side of the House do not share in that reputation. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then criticised the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton)-there was somehow or other a degree of confusion, retreat or whatever on the minister's part when he got up in public; I do not think he did it in this place-for talking about one of the options路 in the 12month process of determining how to sensibly go through with a sale associated with the various airports. One of the options is that 'we ought to sell leases. As common sense might suggest, this was not a product of some concern about what would be a factional attitude in the Labor Party but a common sense approach as to what will produce the best return. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew anything about this, what would have struck him about that statement is that the minister was wrestling, and he has plenty of time to wrestle, with the notion of what will produce the best return. If something is sold off with a lease on crown land, there is a pretty good chance that the protection of the crown will continue to be maintained for the operation. Would-be purchasers might prefer a 99-year renewable lease than owning the land outright, given the protection that might be afforded to people who are in possession of leases rather than those who own the land freehold. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew anything about the subject, he would not have stated that as a point of confusion and he would not have bothered to make the point in this debate. The fact that he does not know anything about the subject means that he got led down the path. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then criticised the appointment of Mr Neville Wran and Mr Malcolm Turnbull as two of the four persons who will work out what parts of ANt ought to be sold and what parts out to be sustained, enhanced or whatever. He criticised their salary levels in relation to that job. Those salary levels were set by the Remuneration Tribunal on the basis of its understanding of what would be paid to somebody in the private sector who was associated with the sorts of processes in which Mr Neville Wran and the others will engage in determining where we should go with ANL. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a criticism of that, let us see some consistency in the Liberal Party. Let us see him start to make a major campaign point about the level of remuneration in consultancies and for chief executives and others in the private sector. If he wants to say that they are paid vastly more than they deserve to be paid, which is indeed vastly more than what the average Australian receives, he should start saying it across the board. He should not rock in here with these snide asides about a person who has now established himself as a very effective business person. This individual is operating not simply just with governments of both political hues but with the private sector generally. A great deal of confidence resides in him because he has good common sense and commercial knowledge. Instead of getting up here in cowards' castle and making those sorts of points, show a bit of guts. Get out there and start arguing for an equality of wages. Get out there and start arguing that the people who floated the Deputy Leader of the Opposition into this show, like Mr Elliott, are receiving or have received far too much in remuneration. Show a bit of guts and nous. Take his friend Mr Kroger. Consider what these people receive from their consultancies and whether or not they are being paid too much. Is he going to argue that they are being paid too much? But do we hear that from him? No. We cannot expect to hear that from somebody whose deputy leadership was organised in those hallowed halls of the Melbourne Club. Another sign of weakness in the opposition, I suppose, is its decision to play on a topic about government strength. It obviously decided to come in here to talk about ANL. The last great furphy of the many great furphies in the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-and the last great furphy in his speech that I think I will bother to pick up on-suggested that this was somehow, in order and dimension, related to the sorts of problems that states experienced with their banking and insurance offices and other GBEs in the latter part of the 1980s. What a joke! If he seriously considers that the dimensions in any way approach that, that is further evidence that he operates in his shadow portfolio on the basis of sleepwalking. There is no comparison whatsoever. To tell a government that achieved $2.5 billion worth of assets sales last year that it somehow does not know how to operate a privatisation agenda, to tell a government which has put in place such massive reforms, including both the privatisation and corporatisat ion of the defence industries, and made savings in the defence budget of something like $350 million a year, which has made it possible for us to put in place a most substantial defence equipment procurement program in a period of steady or declining defence budgets-the government has achieved at Williamstown naval dockyard, for example, in some areas something like an 800 per cent productivity improvement when it put those positions in place-that it does not know a thing or two about privatisation, the deputy leader should at least have a degree of embarrassment about the way in which he devises his topics. He might have honed it down a little further than the silly grab-all proposition that he put forward. It is no easy task to privatise companies that have been in the public sector. Generally, companies that have been in the public sector over the years carry with them a plethora of government. decisions on community service obligations that direct their commercial activities in one way or another. This makes it extraordinarily difficult to uncouple when it comes to dealing with privatisation. It is not simply a matter of exchanging ownership of a normally operating private company with a share register already in place, where it is easy to discern the value and where business can be done in relatively short order. Even in those circumstances, there is usually a substantial time lag between taking up a position of ownership and negotiating to reach that point. Over time, our government business enterprises have served different objectives. It has been a requirement upon us to find ways of uncoupling them in order to get the companies effectively into the private sector. Over the last three years, we have also had the very considerable disadvantage of floating all trade sales in an environment which has been poor economically-not just in Australia but globally. From time to time it has been necessary to pull back from sales because, even if we were technically prepared to go ahead with the sales, it would have been sheer lunacy and a failure on our part to act in a prudent fashion in the management of the taxpayers' businesses. ANL is an organisation which has had a tenuous路 existence for a very long period under successive governments for one reason-and you can argue whether or not it is a good reason but it is a reason that successive governments have thought important-it has been considered important that Australia have a moderate exposure to the international shipping market because we are a maritime nation and it is considered useful for us to have a maritime presence. If it is necessary for that to be organised through the government, then that is the way it should be done. What any set of managers confront when deciding to operate in the international environment is the most predatory situation anyone could conceive of and which has become even more predatory in the last two years; a situation which means enormous adjustments. ANL has made enormous adjustments over the last few years trying to get its root structure and levels of shipping right and trying to get its industrial relations right through the very successful shipping industry reform process. No matter what it does, if ANL wishes to operate in international trades, it is going to operate against both a massive dumping of capacity on the market-which has occurred in recent times-and a couple of shipping companies operating out of China and Russia which have one objective only: the earning of foreign exchange. No matter what cuts are taken in the operational expenses of ANL, they are always going to go under it. That is the situation when dealing with the very small-in terms of the government's overall ownership operations-operation of ANL. That is what we are now putting to rest with a process which is very close to the targeted process suggested by those who assisted us in the due diligence process. The government has nothing to apologise for in regard to its privatisation program which has been conducted with a very high level of success to this point.",91
158,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Contrary to what the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) says, I think that the government does have a lot to apologise for. At a time when rural Australia is desperately suffering from drought and the rest of the country is trying to haul itself out of a government-inflicted recession, this government, instead of concentrating on the main problems before it, is racked by factional brawls and power struggles and is consumed with attempts to cover up financial mess-ups such as the ANL fiasco that we have been hearing debated in this House yesterday and today. At a time when farmers are being forced to leave their farms and when small business bankruptcies are still running at near record levels, this government seems more concerned with devising new methods to pork barrel its mates into gilt lined jobs. Of course, the chief mate, the royal mate, is none other than Neville Wran. He has been labouring on with his boutique merchant bank, in which he is the third shareholder, drawing on $430,000. On top of that, he gets a third share of the dividends which, I am told, amounted to $2 million the year before last, for heaven's sake. He has had previous appointments, which the shadow treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has just detailed, such as in the CSIRO and other areas. He has been given $21,075 to sort out ANL-almost $1,000 a week-the Remuneration Tribunal base amount. I would have thought that that would have been reasonable, but the government has gone to the Remuneration Tribunal and had that topped up to the tune of $130,000 because Nifty Nev is strapped for cash, making a package of $151,000 for two days work a week. If NeviIIe Wran is working as many days as he should be in his merchant bank and in the other jobs he has, he should be working a 28day week, so this work for the ANL should bring him up to a 30-day week. If he were working a full five days a week, he would be getting a salary of $750,000 a year. Of course, his cohort is none other than Malcolm Turnbull, who is very much a favoured son of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) since he embraced the republican line, which has paid very handsomely for him. Malcolm Turnbull is on a salary in his company of $830,000, received a $4 million dividend the year before last, and has been given $12,850 for six months to work in ANL.Of course, that is not enough. That is being topped up by $108,000, which brings it to a total of $121,000. If he takes on any further duties, whatever they might be, he will receive up to an extra $30,000. I contrast that with what the previous board, which was sacked as of yesterday, was getting. Its chairman, Bill Bolitho, was virtually full time on the job. He was a man of some expertise as opposed to those on the new board who have no expertise whatsoeveralthough I am told that when Neville Wran's mother first brought him to Sydney she gave him a ride on the Manly ferry. Bill Bolitho was on $42,155 a year. The other board members were on $17,163 for the full year. What an extraordinary contrast that is! Look at the case of General Peter Gration, who was supposed to be cleaning up the mess in the Civil Aviation Authority. He works not two days a week but 5 1h days a week-full days at that. He is getting $42,155. That is the sort of figure that the taxpayers would expect, as opposed to what this government is handing out for ANL. It appears that, if a person is a member of the New South Wales Right or has spoken favourably of the Prime Minister in the near past, that person can get top-ups in the order of $108,000, with $130,000 a year and $30,000 in extra packages. That is the contrast. That is the royal standard, the mates standard that this government is setting down in this country today. This blatant rorting of the public purse is hreathtaking in the extreme. It displays nothing more nor less than a contempt and an arrogance for the genuine workers in this country and for the taxpayers of Australia. It should be condemned for what it is. We might ask what this new board's job is. Is it going to be to rescue ANL or to wind it up? Consider the situation ANL is in today: it has lost $290 million in value over the last two years; it has a gearing of 160 per cent; it is in debt to the tune of $180 million; it has a negative net worth somewhere between $74 million and $118 mi11ion; and it is about to lose its overseas routes. On top of that, the Hilmer principles are bearing down on ANL, so presumably it is going to lose its monopoly on the local domestic routes and its union imposed monopoly on the trans-Tasman Australia-New Zealand route. What sort of a future has it got? Mr Nehl-None.",93
159,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"None-exactly. That is the only logical conclusion one could come to. As well as that, ANL now has a board with no maritime experience whatsoever, a board that is going to be there for only six months. If it is going to do the thing that the minister says it is going to do afterwards, who is going to come in after the next six months? The minister said yesterday that the government's input over the next six months can save the business. He said: We have to repair ANL and make it a profitable operation. He also said: ... I intend to fix up the situation. He further said: I would see a number of years of ANL repairing its balance sheet and getting back into a position of real profitability and paying off its debt. The minister says that this government is about: ... making sure that this business is reconstructed and trades its way out of difficulties so there is no loss to the taxpayer. I ask: who is kidding whom? I say to the minister, who says that he ac-epts the full responsibility, that these statements sound to me to be remarkably optimistic. They have a ring about them of what the minister was accusing the ANL board of saying-the very reasons that he used to sack the whole board. It is very hard to believe the minister when he says that ANL can trade its way out of this given situation. This is the minister who has just knocked $1,000 million off federal road funding and who says he has not made any cuts at all. Where is the minister? He is not here today. The Prime Minister is not here today. He is on one of his two rostered days off through the week. In fact, the Prime Minister is in my electorate handing out certificates at a Landcare function, for heaven's sake. When I rang his office last night to find out about the matter, his staff were very coy about it. He had not even bothered to inform the local member where he would be. It was said that he would be refusing, yet again, to visit drought affected properties. I mention that to show what type of man the Prime Minister is. We are now being told that the Prime Minister is leaving after the next election. In the tradition of all grand emperors, he wants to choose his successor. Apparently he dislikes Minister Crean and Minister Beazley, who he says are not up to th- job. He wants to shoehorn one of his right wmg mates from the Senate into the lower House. The Prime Minister is going to replace the much loved grey-bearded member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) with the much ridiculed grey-bearded senator for Victoria. It seems that the senator from Victoria is not satisfied with the offer of a seat with a safety margin of four or five per cent. That might mean that occasionally he might have to go near his electoral office and mix with his constituents. Presumably, Captain Biggles will get in a plane with a camera, fly over his electorate once a year and take a photograph out the window where his electoral office might be. That is as close as he wants to be to his electorate. He wants to shift the member for Lalor from his 17 per cent marginal electorate. I think what this government is doing absolutely stinks! The Labor royal family has got so carried away with itself. King Keating of the royal family has tapped the member for Lalor on the shoulder and told him to pick a box, but the member for Lalor can see that the box is indeed a coffin, and he is not accepting it. We now have a situation of conflict between the member for Lalor on the one hand and the member for Blaxland on the other. I can tell honourable members that the coalition is backing the man of the people, the member for Lalor. If anything less transpires, it will be a travesty of democracy in this country. This government, instead of running the country and facing up to the grave problems that exist in this nation, problems largely of its own making, is involved in factional brawling, not handling money and messing up privatisation deals. It is condemned. (TIme expired)",94
160,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, although you would not appreciate it from the contributions of . those opposite, the topic of today's matter of public importance is: The political and economic implications of the Government's mismanagement of the privatisation of public assets. That raises two aspects: firstly, privatisation policy, and its implementation and economic effect; and, secondly, any adverse political implication that might arise from that. I will start with adverse political implications first. Those opposite certainly have standing to talk about such implications because they are so good at collecting them for themselves. In 1987 you were so good at adverse political implications that half of you thought Joh Bjelke-Petersen would make a good prime minister. In 1990 you were so good at collecting adverse political implications for yourself that you lost the election; you followed an actor who was so bereft of policy that the Australian community would not trust him. After making that mistake, in 1993 you took out the policy machine gun and nailed the Australian community to the wall, and it rejected you again. You certainly have standing to talk about adverse political implications because you are so good at collecting them! If you want to talk about the government's implementation of policy in this area, I simply refer you to two speeches made by the relevant ministers: firstly, the address given today by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) to the National Press Club; and, secondly, a speech made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia in Sydney on 28 July 1994. The adverse political implications which you collected as a result of the 1993 election arose out of your policy stance. Just as you have the standing to talk about adverse political implications, you have the nerve to talk about policy in this area. What was your election commitment so far as privatisation was concerned? Your Fightback policy was basically the sledgehammer approach: nog everything off, cut expenditure and impose an unfair tax system. It is a hard right ideological position that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is very comfortable with. What did you say about that policy after the election? I refer to an article in the Australian on 18 March 1993 by the shadow minister for employment, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). He writes: The Coalition's defeat has inevitably led to a spate of attacks on the program from all sides. Whatever else may be said, it is vital that the program was fundamentally a practical and common sense program to restore to Australians sound employment prospects, rising living standards, access to high-quality hospital care and education of international standard. It stands as the only viable alternative set of policiesHe further writes: But it was not ideological. There was nothing ideological about the tax reform program. This is precisely the mantra taken up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and shadow Treasurer, when they first came to office. They said that they stood for was a practical and common sense program, nothing ideological. I will come to what they do or do not stand for in a moment. In recent times we have had some commentary from people regarded generally as good analysts of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is having policy difficulties. Let us look at some of the reasons for this. In an article on 4 June in the News Weekly, B.A. Santamaria had this to say about the Liberal Party: ... a radical change has recurred in the forces which control it today. It is pre-eminently the party of the new-rich practitioners of the money market, of property developers, of the rapidly growing gambling interests, of alleged 'entrepreneurs', and of those who service them. This new class does not talk the language of the ordinary people ... It has no community of interest or even contact with them. That is precisely what you stand for. The shadow Treasurer would no doubt be pleased to hear that I met the former member Mr Roger Shipton in Parliament House today for the first time. We all know about opposition members of parliament from Victoria who have lost their seats. On 31 July of this year in an article in the Sunday Age, Chris Puplick, one of your former colleagues, said about Fightback and your future policies: In recent years, the Liberals' policies have been regarded as far too narrow and exclusionist. He goes on to say: In totally eschewing Fightback, Downer and Costello risk replacing a strategy of having an policies and no politics with a strategy of an to recognise politics and no policies. I have detailed how good you are at politics, so you can leave that to one side. Let us now have a look at your no policy zone. This is precisely the point made in response to a question from Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program by the former leader of the opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), to whom the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition was so loyal. The honourable member for Wentworth said: There was no doubt at the last election that we stood for certain policy changes, and we had established a dominance in the area of policy debate. He further said: Well, I mean, the reaction straight after the last election, on our side of politics, was almost like headless chooks: everyone was saying: oh, we've been there, we've had policy, we don't want policy any more. Let's just lie doggo and go quiet, look warm and fuzzy and try and get across the line. There we have the classic 'lie doggo act' from Jeff Kennett's dog opposite us. What have we seen in more recent times? Just today on the front page of the !).ustralian Financial Review the headline is 'The day business took Downer aside for a quiet chat'. What does business have to say about the no policy zone surrounding the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer? The article reads: Senior business leaders have warned the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, that the Coalition must provide detailed policies if it expects to win the support of business. The demand to spell out policy direction came at a private dinner function on MondayIt goes on: ... Mr Downer told the group that the Liberals would not be repeating their mistake of releasing detailed policiesHere we have the policy free zone. The article further reads: Without details, the Opposition could not expect widespread electoral or business support, Mr Downer was told. The chief executive of a major company said: 'We told him to just tell people-and not just business-what you believe. That is the urging of business: please tell people what you believe. The trouble is that, if they do tell people what they believe, people are not sure whether they can believe them. The main story in the Australian Magazine of July 23-24, which details the political credibility of the Leader of the Opposition, states: After Hewson defeated Howard in the leadership ballot following last year's election, Downer told the Hewson camp that he had voted for the winner, doing his chances of becoming shadow treasurer no harm at all. I assume that this practice runs with the coalition shadow treasurers. The story further states: That surprised the Howard forces, because Downer told them that he had voted for Howard. When tackled on the issue by one of the Howard supporters, he said that, actually, it had been Howard but he didn't feel he could go and tell Hewson now. Then we have the business community urging the opposition to provide some detailed policies and to tell the people what it stands for, and here we have proof that, even if the Leader of the Opposition does tell us what he stands for, we cannot believe him. What sort of policy utterings have we had from the opposition since the honourable member for Mayo took over as Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Higgins took over as Deputy Leader of the Opposition? Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We are not in favour of foreign investment.' That was turned over a couple days later when he discovered two things: firstly, the opposition had a policy to abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board; and, secondly, a speech he had made a few years ago saying that overseas investment in Australia was intrinsically linked to our international competitors and our economy. Then we had the famous letter to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) on citizens initiated referendums in which the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I support this policy; I am in favour of this policy.' He then changed his mind saying, firstly, 'I did not read the letter before I signed it' and then, 'If I did read it, I only signed it so as not to cause division.' The Leader of the Opposition is either dishonest, misleading or simply weak. We then had Mabo and the veto of the Northern Territory Aboriginal land rights legislation. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition said that that would not be disturbed. Then he suddenly discovered that that was wrong so he instituted a review. When asked why he had made such mistakes, he simply said on TV repeatedly, night after night, 'I was tired and emotional.' So this is the policy approach that we can expect. The business community urges the opposition to provide it with detail. A strategic decision has been made by the opposition, in policy and political terms, not to provide that detail and when those opposite do give us some detail we simply cannot believe them.",95

162,Mr MARTYN EVANS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Before we were interrupted by the proceedings of the HOllse earlier this morning, 1 was discussing the aspects of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) as they relate particularly to competition policy and focusing on pathology services and the generic drug debate. 1 think it is important that we have this debate in context. The health system of this country is a very major part of our expenditure as well as our social system. In the 1992-93 financial year it was estimated that Australian expenditure on health and welfare totalled appro xi mately $34 billion. In the current financial year the Commonwealth government will expend in excess of $17 billion on health. That puts this in a very substantial context. We must pay particular attention to the aspects of competition policy as they relate to the health system because the micro-economic reform of the 1990s, while it will have a significant and dramatic impact on many of our major sectors of the economy-telecommunications, industry policy and the like - has not seen substantial debate prior to this. Now that it has commenced we see people, such as the Premier of Victoria, seeking to negate its impact in, for example, the legal profession. I think that is a very retrograde step. Quite clearly, we should focus on the professions and the health industry, in particular. The aspects of competition policy there, because of the sheer size of that sector, are quite substantial, and many of the practices in those professional bodies are rooted in historical concepts which are probably outdated in the context of the economic policy of the 1990s. While I do not seek to imposecertainly the Hilmer report did not seek to impose-the full rigours of an open competition policy on the health industry, because quite clearly there are very special aspects to that sector which need to be taken into account, it clearly needs to be reviewed. I am sure that, if the profession can turn its mind to those aspects on a more outward looking basis, the profession can contribute very substantially to its own long-term success, to the economy of Australia and to the welfare of its citizens in particular. The problems which we experience in competition policy in relation to this are very much those of the states. It will be a matter for the states to review their position in that regard. As I have said, we have already seen some aspects of that at COAG, and I hope that the states review their policies and ensure that they do work with the Commonwealth and the professions to revise that in the future. One only needs to look at the area of specialists, for example, in the health sector to see how competition policy might well benefit consumers in that regard. Pathology is one very particular example of that. There are estimates that pathology services consume about $700 million a year. I believe that, quite clearly, that contains a very substantial element where competition policy might well benefit. If one looks at the process of medical practitioners moving into the pathologist specialty area, one can see that it is very severely restricted. The Royal College of Pathology maintains very substantial barriers to entry to that profession. We must always seek to protect the very high standards of professional care which the profession offers. Indeed, it is quite appropriate to limit entry to specialties where the public must be protected to ensure that the standards are appropriate. But in the case of pathology cases in particular-and that is one of the main subjects of this bill today-one must question whether the standards of entry are solely and wholly there to protect the public interest in relation to the standards of health care or whether there is any element of anticompetitive behaviour in the way those entry criteria are regulated. I will leave that debate for another day. I am certain that the profession will adequately maintain the need for those very strict entry criteria but I would say to the profession that if it wants to avoid the possibility of future regulation, if it wants to avoid those kinds of accusations, it is essential that it looks to its own criteria and ensures that they are adequately defensible on public interest criteria and that no element of anticompetitive behaviour is involved. When we look at pathology, of that $700 million there have been very substantial accusations in the past-which this bill seeks to address in part-in relation to the way those services are earned. It has been alleged in previous debates and in the public arena that many of those pathology companies which have become highly mechanised and highly automated, with minimal degrees of professional service content by individual practitioners, and which have been involved in securing access to that very profitable market, have been less than desirable. Some of those sharp practices and some of the illegal practices relate, for example, to the rental of premises in doctors' surgeries where there is no genuine rental at all; it is merely a device for transferring funds to a doctor who participates in the process and constitutes very much a secret commission. That is one example, and only one, of the way pathology companies have possibly sought in the past to improperly secure access to the market and improve their market share. It is very difficult to know what percentage of that total throughput in pathology services relates to any overservicing or fraudulent conduct because overservicing is very much in the grey area of fraudulent conduct, but some estimates have put it as high as $100 million of the $700 million. It is impossible to verify those figures, and they have to be taken very much with a grain of salt because the detail is impossible to come by. Overservicing is one of those things that is very hard to establish and prove. The Health Insurance Commission attempts that through detailed statistical analysis of services but the long run we really do not have an accurate estimate. We can only seek incrementally to address these problems as they arise and hope that the profession will join with us in ensuring that such practices are stamped out vigorously. Other aspects of the pathology system which I would like to address today include the level playing field aspect of public versus private pathology services. In my own state of South Australia we have a very effective public service run by the IMVS, the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, which provides substantial amounts of pathology service in the state. It provides a highly cialised and effective service based on the Royal Adelaide Hospital campus, but with outlets in a number of hospitals throughout the country areas of the state as well as the metropolitan area. That broad distribution of services is very important. As other speakers have alluded to today, the public sector is not entitled to collect the patient initiated collection fee. That puts at somewhat of a disadvantage. While many of their samples are collected from the Royal Adelaide Hospital and other hospital based services, where collection fees are not particulifesaving lady relevant, others are in the normal day-today general practitioner service. A collection fee would be relevant there and would ensure that the IMVS, along with our public sector pathology agencies, was on a level playing field with its private sector competitors. If there is to be any corporatisation of that service by the state government in South Australia, I would hope that those factors are taken into account. Rather than an outright sale of that group, it is very important that we retain in this highly specialised field, given the substantial amounts of funding which are involved, a significant public presence but on an equal basis. When looking at the state-wide benefits which the IMVS provides we should look not only to the fact that it has agencies in a number of regional and country hospitals providing a very valuable service to country people but also to the potential to address some of those difficulties of locational disadin vantage through electronic means. Indeed, the broadband services debate which is presently being sponsored by the Minister for Communications (Mr Lee) will provide us with significant new opportunities for extending pathology and other medical services into country areas through the use of very high speed data links between country centres, country hospitals and their city based specialist colleagues. By using some of that new technology we can help to remove the disadvantage which country people experience in this area as well as reducing the costs involved. I would certainly commend that to the government. spe- There are a number of pilot studies under way. Indeed, Whyalla hospital in South Australia is one of those, although not in the pathology area of course. I believe that we could significantly enhance the benefits by examining ways in which those new technologies can be of assistance in the medical field. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is just slightly older than I am. It has been around them now for some 41, 42 years and has served the public of Australia very weI!. It started out from humble beginnings. The Chifley government established the process whereby certain drugs would be made available to people free of charge. It was continued very much on a bipartisan basis and was further developed in the 1950s by the Menzies government and by other governments since. But the costs of the scheme are rising. We are now talking figures of the order of $2 billion a year. It is quite critical, with growth rates the last decade averaging some 7.3 per cent per year-a substantial figure-that we examine how this service operates and look at ways of increasing its efficiency and reducing the overall cost to the taxpayers of this country without in any way degrading the level of service provision. That again brings us to that element of competition policy in the dispensing of generic drugs. It is very important that the medical profession very closely examine its practices in this area. If we look at hospital practice, it has been estimated that in many of the world's major hospitals in Western society some 80 per cent of drugs dispensed in hospital are of a generic basis. In the United Kingdom it is about 50 per cent. In Australia. I am sure that the figure is equally as high. When people tum to their general practitioner they should expect the same degree of regard for their health and for the cost structures of drug availability. Once a generic drug is available and has been approved by the appropriate authorities as being an equivalent to the drugs which might otherwise be prescribed in the higher price bracket, pharmacies can provide a very effective service to their clients and to Australia as a whole by ensuring the availability of those generic drugs for dispensing and by performing their professional role of advising the public and the patient on what might be prescribed as the alternative, given that the generic drug will have exactly the same beneficial effects as the higher priced alternative which may sometimes be prescribed-not through any malpractice on the part of the medical profession but simply because in many cases they are very busy people. They are seeing any number of patients. Through habit and past practice it is quite possible to prescribe a particular brand of drug rather than prescribing a generic basis which ensures the lowest cost alternative with the same outcome for the patient. If we can avoid some of the problems which have occurred in the past, which the legislation seeks to do by carefully setting out in the criteria which are to be involved in this decision, we should ensure a positive outcome. To take a particular example, anti-hypertensives, a couple of those drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits list come to some $100 million a year between them. Just two drugs in one area of use, anti-hypertensives, can impact on the cost to the taxpayer of this kind of prescription. We not only have to look at the generic drug basis but also have to ensure that the medical profession turns its attention to the dispensing of drugs as a solution, as in the case of hypertension, and the lifestyle factors which bring about hypertension in the first place. We need to ensure that attention is given to those lifestyle factors which would possibly permit treatment of some of these conditions without recourse to such expensive drugs. The more attention we pay to primary health care, the higher the prospects of reducing the $2 billion account for things such as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the $100 million now spent on anti-hypertensives. Education campaigns targeting both doctors and consumers might have more of an effect than some of the medical care which is now provided. I commend the government for the legislation. While it is in some ways technical legislation and not particularly policy trend setting legislation, I believe that the impact of some of these small measures will be very substantial and reflect significantly on Australia's health system in areas which are particularly sensitive to the public. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme and pathology services reflect incremental improvements to the major schemes. They are designed in a well crafted way to ensure an improvement to our health system, with an eye on competition policy, which is now very much the centre of debate in this country, while retaining the very high standards of professional care which this country maintains.",98
163,Mr NEVILLE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise in this debate to express my concerns about a number of aspects of the pathology segment of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I am not suggesting that this aspect of health delivery has not had a fairly kriotty history. Advances in medical technology have provided a fertile field for health entrepreneurs. I remember quite some years ago, when modem pathology began to spread its wings in Brisbane, a number of my friends going to an entrepreneurial pathologist who conducted a vast array of speculative tests at the rebate level. So the patient effectively paid nothing. This then became the basis of a consultation and check-up with the patient's GP. Clearly, very expensive procedures were being used unnecessarily with the flawed assumption that these tests might tum up something. The boot was clearly on the wrong foot and it was a gross waste. I appreciate that we have now moved into more enlightened times and that the cost of health care is of considerable concern to governments, oppositions and the Australian people alike. I appreciate further that the government must put a stop to wasteful and entrepreneurial activities in pathology. However, I feel that, in its zeal to close off deficient options to a minority group of the profession, the government may have, firstly, placed the responsible majority group of the profession under unnecessary scrutiny; secondly, deprived or limited access to pathology in remote, rural and even some smaller provincial areas; and, thirdly, created a new series of loopholes for the entrepreneurial pathologists to exploit. As honourable members are aware, Medicare benefits for pathology are payable only if the service is performed by, or on behalf of, a pathology practitioner. Part II of the legislatransport tion requires that pathologists give certain commitments to the minister: personal supervision and an agreement not to provide excessive servicing. The degree of supervision is being laid down in the set of principles to be determined by the minister and will be subject to disallowance by parliament. The Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners, which represents 60 per cent of the profession in Australia, is at the coal face of the delivery of private practitioner services. It is in broad agreement with most aspects of the bill. The principles have been sent to the Attorney-General's Department and a draft copy has been sent to the AAPA. However, my sources in the profession have indicated, firstly, that the government appears to be less than enthusiastic about the principles; secondly, that because they run for only 12 months uncertainty is created in the profession; and, thirdly, that the process requires more discussion with the profession. In 1991, when the government set about reducing the number of licence collection centres available to pathologists, it did so on the premise that the proliferation of centres was increasing the cost of pathology. It argued that, by limiting the number of outlets, overall practitioner costs would drop, thus lowering the cost of the various services. The scenario went on further to assume that this would lead to lower fees and hence lower rebates. Ultimately, the government assumed a saving of eight per cent. This policy was flawed in a number of aspects, but I would like to deal specifically these with the effect on remote, rural and even some small provincial city communities. This policy, in effect, closed many collection centres in these communities. People had to travel hundreds of kilometres for tests. In my electorate people had to travel 50 or 70 kilometres in one direction or another. Naturally, people took risks. They played Russian roulette with their tests or, if you like, with their medical well-being. I am sure that a lot of savings were madebut at whose expense? Access is no great problem in capital cities that have public systems. The closing of the odd collection centre here or there is not a major concern. But in small communities, especially those where the local hospital cannot effectively conduct the tests, patients have no alternative but to travel to the nearest provincial city. Over a three-year period those collection centres to be axed, euphemistically known as temporary collection centres, were phased out at the rate of one-third per year. One Brisbane based practice, Doctors Sullivan Nicolaides and Partners, which services my electorate, was forced to close eight centres-Roma, Warwick, Dalby, Beaudesert, Chinchilla, Childers, Maclean and Bellingen. As part of a lengthy and expensive legal action, it took this case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was successful in reversing the decision on only one-Childers, also in my electorate. At the time of the proposed closure of Childers, which was 55 kilometres from the nearest pathology laboratory, my predecessor, the then member for Hinkler, merely dismissed the issue by saying that the practice had been given a set quantity of licences and could distribute them as it saw fit. There are 1,140 pathology collection centres and laboratories in Australia and only 17 are in remote areas. This shows the effect of the government's action at that time. Local businessman Bob Kerr, a Childers resident, made the point at the time in the Isis Town and Country newspaper that Medicare would reap the benefit as 'a lot of people would not travel when their local pathology centre was closed.' 'Besides', he said, 'many people require constant monitoring of their condition via blood tests which are taken regularly at the centre.' Quite clearly, these tests could not be taken regularly without considerable travel on the part of the patient because the centre is 55 kilometres away. Subsequently, the local hospital admitted that it could not handle the level of pathology collection. Quite apart from that, the test would probably have been sent to Rockhampton as Bundaberg had only scientists not pathologist public practitioners. Further, local doctors strongly supported the retention of the Childers unit. This was a successful case but it was at an overall cost of $100,000 to the practice which tried to maintain a service there and in the seven other centres that I have mentioned. To its credit, Sullivan Nicolaides, at the sacrifice of two other centres, has returned to Warwick and Roma. As I pointed out before, of the 1,140 licensed centres in Australia only 17 are in remote areas and four are operated by the firm Sullivan Nicolaides. That is not a good advertisement for the government's stated ambition in this bill of delivering better services to remote and rural areas. Some 17 in over 1,000 is not a very good record and it would need to be improved under the new guidelines. If the government cuts back on local collection centres, as it has being saying in negotiations with the profession, then the bill before us today will become a farce in 12 months time. Under the new determination, practices will be able to trade-off one collection centre entitlement for three remote area collection centres. To the government's credit, at least this is a step in the right direction and does, to some extent, recognise country areas. I would like to take issue with the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) who spoke earlier in the day about the socio-economic aspects of pathology delivery, as he called it. He talked about the concept of managed competition. That might be well and good in the context of closely settled suburbs with well-defined public transport systems providing access to large, well-equipped hospitals with a proliferation of well-developed services and facilities, but I am talking about the most basic of collection services in towns that, in many instances, have now been gutted by this ALP government. That is a country mile away from two or more competitive services. Let us just have one service in these country centres to begin with. This scheme could not possibly have universal application without a further massive injection of state and/or federal funding to provide pathologist practitioners in large or medium sized hospitals. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) may not be aware that, apart from the largest provincial centres, such as Toowoomba, Rockhampton and Townsville in Queensland, the pathology services conducted in those hospitals are not conducted by licensed medical practitioners; they are conducted by scientist pathologists. Under the government's own guidelines, there have to be medical practitioner pathologists in personal supervision. The suggestion from the honourable member for Werriwa is flawed in its primary premise. If the government wanted to achieve what he proposed today, there would have to be a massive injection of funding to provide medical practitioner pathologists to a vast range of hospitals right across Australia. Finally, even if we could achieve what the honourable member for Werriwa suggested, what would happen when the going gets tough, as happened with the pharmacy regime? Would we see the hospital pharmacies force public patients out into the private system? We would see, as occurs with pathology at present, patients being carefully questioned as to whether or not they have private health status. That even applies to patients who come into the hospital as public patients. If they admit to being privately insured, even as public patients, their tests are taken to the private sector in order to take pressure off the Commonwealth-state aspect of the funding of those hospitals. It is not a very good foundation on which to build a quasi, Hilmer-like, semi-competitive system. If the government is going to proceed with something along these lines, it needs to think it through carefully. The new legislation, which was effective from 31 July this year, gives the Health Insurance Commission quite extraordinary powers. It follows that it should exercise this authority with a great deal of good sense and equanimity-not with heavy-handedness. A blow-out of $70 million in costs in the last 12 months cannot be ignored, but the focus needs to be on those who abuse and manipulate the system. There is a view at the responsible end of the profession that the Health Insurance Commission is less than diligent in closing down unlicensed centres. There is also a view that continuing schemes are already in place to circumvent the minister's new determinations and principles. I am advised that the Australian Metropolitan Medical Services Proprietary Limited of Fitzroy in Melbourne has been set up specifically to avoid the new legislation. Its modus operandi involves this firm hiring space in or near a group of doctors. It then employs pathology specimen collectors, who are not necessarily doctors or trained nurses. It then directs them to a licensed APA pathology practice. No explanation is made as to how payment is made to the AMMS. The effect is to have an unlicensed collection centre at arms length from effective scrutiny. I recommend that the government investigates such practices to determine whether they circumvent the spirit of the new arrangements, how the various parties are paid, and whether AMMS and similar bodies employ qualified pathologists. If it is not in conformity with the minister's draft principles as they now stand-and I understand that these have been to the Attorney-General's Department for scrutiny-then such practices should be brought into line. This is a very wide-ranging area of health care. It has been open to flagrant abuse in the past. There is a recognition on both sides of the House that it needs to be tightened up. In ' the spirit of bipartisanship, I suggest to the government that a great deal of follow-up work needs to be done, especially in regard to the determination of these principles. It should instruct the Health Insurance Commission to direct a great deal more of its energy to the irresponsible end of the pathology profession and not to the vast majority of those who are providing a valuable service across this nation.",102
164,Mr JENKINS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I have pleasure speaking in this debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). As was indicated in earlier debate, this is an omnibus bill which deals with several minor amendments to a number of pieces of primary legislation. I do not intend to refer to those amendments relating to the services schedule or the pathology schedule that deal with the Health Insurance Act. I note that a housekeeping type of arrangement will remove some of the anomalies in the 1egislation. The amendments contained in this legislation will substitute the reference to the pensioner health benefits card with the pensioner concession card in line with changes that have been made to the nomenclature by the Department of Social Security. I wish to address my remarks to those changes that have been made in the area of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The first change restricts the issue of safety net concesarises sion cards to Australian residents only. It is generally accepted that the pu-pose of - he pharmaceutical benefits scheme IS to provIde those drugs listed on the schedules to Australian residents. Therefore, what we see is, in part, an attempt to achieve this by restricting the issue of safety net concession cards to those who hold a Medicare card. This does not prevent non-Medicare card holders from being beneficiaries of the subsidised drugs under the schedule. It means that, when they reach the safety net level, they will be unable to get the further subsidies that are available. This measure has the cooperation of those pharmacists who will be asked to do some of the gathering of information. I think that is important. Anybody who has observed the tension-and perhaps that is an understatement - due to the way the pharmaceutical benefits scheme operates between those who are required to cooperate would understand that there is a need to ensure that pharmacists, through the Pharmacy Guild and other organisations that speak on behalf of pharmacy profession, agree with the measures that are put in place. When we look at the potential savings estimated by the government, we see that this is not an inconsiderable measure. It is estimattical ed that the savings for the rest of this financial year will be about $400,000. There is an estimated saving for a full financial year in subsequent years of $1 million. As I said, there has been discussion about its implementation. At the time of the issue of a safety net concession card at a pharmacy, there is a requirement to gather information. It is not too great an imposition to include Medicare number details at that time. I am sure that the government, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) are aware of the necessity to look into the privacy considerations. The second measure contained in this omnibus bill will allow for brand substitution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by an approved pharmacist where acceptable under the relevant state and territory law. This out of an agreement that was achieved at the Australian Health Ministers Conference in March this year. It was confirmed in this year's budget. The success of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme requires the cooperation of a number of people. The overall scheme starts at pharmaceutical companies, the drug providers, and requires the cooperation of medical practitioners as the prescribers, pharmacists as the dispensers, and the consumers, the people in need of medicines and drugs, who play an important role by having an understanding of the proper use of drugs for the treatment or prevention of illness. For some time, of course, generic drugs have been available. Put simply, generic drugs are drugs that have come out of their patent period and which a pharmaceutical company has decided to pick up and manufacture. After the government procedures have been followed for the proper technical consideration of these generic drugs, these drugs can be listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme with a different brand name. Over recent times we have put in place a minimum pricing arrangement that requires generic drugs, if they are considered to be bioequivalent, to be listed on the pharmaceubenefits list at the cheapest price available. If people choose to use the drug that is at a higher price, the difference between the price agreed on by the government and the manufacturer is passed on to the consumer, the person requiring the drug. That has caused some problems. I guess a number of members in this place have received complaints from pensioners wanting to the know why there is an additional cost over and above the pensioner benefit scale. Because of a lack of understanding of the system people want to know why there are differences in the drugs. There has been some concern about whether the little blue round pill is the same as the oblong yellow pill. I understand that consumers confronting those sorts of considerations can be a bit bemused by what is actually going on. Through the stringent testing of these drugs the types of considerations that are important-including the bioequivalence of the drugs-have to be looked into. Therefore the listing on the schedule should mean that the consumer need not have any fear. At the moment if a consumer after having a drug prescribed by a medical practitioner gets into a discussion with the local pharmacist about a higher priced drug, it is very difficult for that person to get the lesser price brand name drug dispensed. This bill will allow, after discussion with the pharmacist-who we must remember is a properly trained, qualified professional with an understanding of the matters that arise out of the use of generic drugs and bioequivalence problems-for that drug to be substituted at that time. At the moment there is a provision, which might be described as being rather clumsy, whereby the pharmacist, the dispenser of the drug, can contact the prescriber to try to change the brand prescribed. Often this can be of advantage if the pharmacist does not have the drug on his or her shelves at that time, because it means the consumer is not inconvenienced. Under the agreement by the health ministers, and where necessary as a result of changes to relevant state and territory legislation, it will be possible for a pharmacist to dispense the other brand name of the drug after coming to an agreement with the consumer. It is important that we recognise that there are several safeguards in the legislation-including proposed section 103 subsection 2A, which sets out the conditions that must be met. The conditions are, first, that a prescriber has not indicated on the prescription that the brand substitution is not to occur. That is, if the medical practitioner, the person who is prescribing the drug, knows of any reason-maybe a history where the particular brand name has not been suitable to the consumer-it can be put on the script that this particular brand is the only brand that the practitioner wishes to be dispensed to this patient. The second provision is that the prescribed brand and the substitute brand must be listed on the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits as being bioequivalent. The third condition is that the prescribed brand and the substituted brand are determined under the act to be allowable brands for pharmaceutical benefits, again after the relevant testing of each of the different brands. The fourth condition is that the supply of the substituted brand does not contravene the law of the relevant state or territory. There is a degree of professional jealousy'jealousy' may be too strong a wordbetween pharmacists and the medical profession. I think that the pharmacists, if they had their wont, would say that it is sufficient for the generic name of the drug-that is, the compound name of the drug-to be the name that is on the script. It is now general practice to prescribe mainly by brand name, whereas in hospitals the chemical compound name tends to be used in dispensing. Pharmacists say it would be better if the decision about the brand of the drug could be left up to them; as long as the drug name is identified on the script they can make the professional judgment about which brand should be issued. As I said, perhaps we are not all that close to that being achieved, but it is a consideration. Pharmacists would say that due to their training that would be sufficient. I note that the legislation goes to the way in which these drugs will be indicated in the schedule of drugs. I just wish to refer to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled Prescribed health, which was issued in three parts. That committee was chaired by me, so that is why I want to get this free kick in about the worth and value of it. In re-reading this report I have to admit that we overlooked making any determination or recommendation about substitute dispensing. I do not quite understand how in the end of our inquiry we did that. Mr Nehl-Have another inquiry.",104
165,Mr JENKINS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, there is no need for any inquiry. The other matters that we went to were definitive enough. I did make some comments about the consumer having some concern about the change in the brand name of the drugs. I was promoting the view that in the main they should not have that concern because the testing and the proper listing should be sufficient assurance for them that the drug has bioequivalence and that there should not be any problems. In evidence that the committee received during the last parliament it was indicated to us that there were problems with a small number of drugs. Here we get into technical terms such as bioequivalence and bioavailability. Perhaps a science graduate in zoology should not attempt to go further to explain the differences between bioavailability and bioequivalence today. Suffice it to say that, whether it be bioequivalence or bioavailability, on some occasions there is the potential for there to be a different pharmacological reaction or therapeutic reaction when the consumer uses those drugs. The committee suggested that those sorts of matters be listed in the schedule. Where it is known that there are elements that cause these slight differences, whether it be the coloured dyes used for the capsules or other filler material used in the formulation of tablets and capsules, it should be identified and there should be cautionary notes to ensure that those who are professionally trained can understand that those precautions should be taken. I am pleased that, in a sense, there has been some form of achievement earlier this year in a form of cooperative federalism. It might be only a minor matter, but perhaps in the larger scheme of things we will also be able to see it. I believe that the changes relating to substitute dispensing that are being made in this legislation are very important. Hopefully they will break down the barriers and misconceptions that abound about the use of generic drugs. I am sure they will go a long way toward it. It is one of those exercises where the proof is probably in the eating of the pudding. Perhaps it should not be dispensed with in such simple terms, but I am sure that the proof of the value of the system and of the use of generic drugs will be further achieved by this measure. There is no actual saving to government, because the saving goes directly to consumers by giving them easier access to the minimum priced drugs. I commend the bill to the House.",106
166,Mr NEHL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 because I am particularly concerned about one area that is involved in the bill, and that is the area of pathology collection centres. 'P' may stand for pathology; however, the 'p' in politics stands for people. I think that, while it is obvious that not only the changes that are forecast but also the changes that have been made already are dollar driven, we should never forget the position of the people that we are all here to represent. I am afraid that in what has happened, not only in this legislation but also earlier this year, the people have been ignored, particularly in remote areas. There is a certain sense of deja vu about this; it is the skin cancer situation revisited. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) will recall that last October the then Minister for Health, former Senator Richardson, announced new guidelines for the treatment of skin cancer. This is very relevant to what we are talking about today. Access to skin cancer treatment in rural, regional and remote areas was decimated as a result of a reaction of the HIC to overservicing in the cities, which had a totally adverse effect on people in country Australia. The parliamentary secretary will recall that, under those new guidelines, GPs, no matter how experienced or expert they are in the treatment of skin cancer with liquid nitrogen, are no longer allowed to provide such treatment. On several occasions I have been to an excellent doctor in Coffs Harbour to have a number of things burnt off, as most of us do from time to time. I will not embarrass him by naming him. He is a GP who is widely respected and acknowledged as being expert in terms of skin cancer. After the new guidelines were announced, no longer could I go to this particular doctor and get that treatment immediately. He would have to take a pathology specimen and send it off to a pathology lab to be examined and then sent back. Then I would have to go back to him or he would have to refer me to a skin specialist. If we are concerned about overservicing and the blowout of the health dollar, I cannot see the sense in that circumstance. Quite apart from that, the impact of this new system on people in rural areas caused a great deal of disadvantage, particularly for those in areas of remoteness-not like in my area, which is fairly close knit. If you are a farmer or grazier living somewhere out of Walgett and you have to travel an hour or more-maybe two or three hours-to get to a doctor, these new guidelines make things very difficult. Instead of these people going once to their GP, who was good at this-and I am not saying that all GPs would be; there are different levels of experience, but I think that by and large most country GPs know their limitations-they would have to go back again. I know that, if a patient went to see my GP in Coffs Harbour about something that was beyond him, very often he would send the patient on to a specialist. That is right proper; it is as it should be. The other side to the matter is that at that time the government was withdrawing licences for pathology services in many country towns. Of course, as a result, specimens had to be sent very much further afield, resulting in long and unnecessary waits for treatment. The point that I believe forms the basis of this current situation is the knee-jerk reaction to the classic example of the glass castles. The glass castles are medical centres in the capital cities. We have all heard many anecdotal stories about overservicing through the glass castles. When I was on the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts in the mid1980s there was a very famous case about overservicing of pathology involving a certain doctor which highlighted one of the problems. We are not going to solve the problem for the people-the 'P' in politics-just by overreacting in this knee-jerk way and not attacking the real problem. If the real problem is overservicing, for the life of me I cannot see any sense in cutting back on the servicing of people in rural areas. I am very pleased that the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), has been working very hard on this. I am totally convinced that, contrary to some unkind comments, she knows exactly what she is doing in this area. I reject and refute the various comments that have been floating around. I know from speaking with her personally about this that she does know what she is doing with it. I thank her for pursuing the undertaking from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to do all that can be done to protect the people that we are concerned about. In speaking to this bill, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) made reference to a number of areas where pathology collection centres had been cancelled. Among the ones he mentioned-I think almost 75 per cent of them are in Queensland - he happened to include Bellingen, which is in my electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know that Bellingen is an absolutely and beautiful town situated in a lovely valley on the Bellinger River. I have not had the pleasure of taking the parliamentary secretary to Bellingen with his cheque for $2 million or $3 million for an aged care facility, but I look forward to doing that at some time in the future. He is always welcome. Former Senator Kerry Sibraa was the last person to bring a cheque to Bellingen. Bellingen and Urunga are two areas where the pathology collection centres were withdrawn. One might well say, 'That is not a terrible inconvenience. Coffs Harbour is only half an hour's drive away. If somebody needs that sort of pathology testing, they could just hop in their car and toddle off to Coffs Harbour.' It is not as simple as that. In my area-indeed, up and down the whole north coast of New South Wales-there is an extremely high number of elderly Australians. The last time. I looked, the number of people aged 65 or more was at least 50 per cent higher than the Australian average. Very often, these people do not have cars and they are in straitened circumstances. There is no public transport. As well as that, we have an enormously high unemployment level. People who are dependent on unemployment benefits are not flush with money and cannot just get in the car and go to Coffs Harbour all the time. Even though Bellingen is a beaut community of about 3,000 people and is a highly desirable place to live, the reality is no public transport there. To that extent, it enjoys a degree of isolation that one would not normally ascribe to a town in that area. But the elderly who have no transport are isolated. Those of any age who are unemployed with no vehicle and very little money are also isolated. One does not have to be out the back of Bourke to be remote from medical services. That is why I feel so strongly about this point. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) mentioned one of the two major companies servicing our area, which are Sullivan Nicolaides and Hampson. They went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and got one reinstated. But it is not really satisfactory. I have had much support from the whole Bellingen valley in opposing the closure of these collection centres. If somebody has to have a sample collected for pathology, what does it matter if it happens there? It will not cost the government any more if it is collected in Bellingen as opposed to Coffs Harbour. If there is overservicing, that is a different matter. If there is overservicing, we should be attacking that, but not by taking away a medical service from ordinary Australians who desperately need it. I say in passing that, apart from having the distinction of having lost its pathology collection centre, Bellingen was host last weekend to the fifth Bellingen jazz festival. For the first time in five years, I was fortunate enough to be able to attend it for a few hours and listen to some wonderful music. This is part of the therapy that one can get from Bellingen. I mention briefly that this was the fifth festival. Brett Iggulden is its driving force. He is a founding member of the Promised Land Jazz Band, which is now the Bellingen All Stars. It is indicative of the sort of community we have that this is a major cultural event. It is growing in stature in the music world of Australia. It exhibits marvellous people like Frances Amaroux and the Aka Bella Choir. I mention them in particular because they are relevant to the debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suspect you may be thinking that I am strayis that there ing from the subject matter.",107
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Rocher)I have to say that I did think it might be a good subject for an adjournment debate.,109
168,Mr NEHL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I thought you might have been thinking that, but I assure you that it is relevant. I have the very colourful and welldesigned program from the BeIlingen jazz festival. The Aka Bella Choir has a marvellous repertoire of four-part harmonies. They say that many of their songs represent the struggle for freedom and equality for which others have fought. That is indeed the relevant point, because we are fighting for justice, equality and equity for the people of Bellingen and all those other small towns around Australia. I use this as an example to dramatise the point that I am making. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have certainly attracted your attention.",109
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, you have.",109
170,Mr NEHL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There are towns and communities around Australia where ordinary Australians are being disadvantaged and being treated with injustice and inequity because of the dollar drive of the HIC. We have to cut overexpenditure. I know that and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know that. Nobody would debate that there has to be an attack on overservicing. But my point is that we will not cure the disease by killing the patient. If overservicing is the problem, let us deal with that. Let us attack those money mad mates in the glass castles; let us not attack the pensioners and the unemployed in small communities around Australia. My final comment is that we in the coalition on this side of the House are totally opposed to retrospectivity when it comes to attacking the taxpayer-the citizen or ordinary Australian. We do not believe that legislation should be retrospective in harming or taking away things from the people of Australia. Personally, I have no objection to retrospectivity which rights a wrong or redresses an injustiCe. Therefore, the parliamentary secretary might convey to the minister the thought that, once the government has solved the real problem and can then address a retrospective creation of justice, we might be able to get to the point where these pathology collection centres could be reinstated to serve and properly look after the disadvantaged people of Australia.",109
171,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (5.47 p.m.)-in reply- Mr Deputy Speaker, as you could see from that last contribution, we have had a very wide-ranging debate. Most honourable members raised relevant points. I thank the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for their contributions. It is good that in this House we have constructive debates of the kind that we have seen here today. It is a pity that sometimes these sorts of debates are not televised so that the people can get a different idea about the hard work that goes into legislation. It would be preferable to the televising of question time, when there is far too much activity that could be performed by members of Actors Equity. I thank all members for their contributions. I want to refer to some of the issues raised. Firstly, a number of opposition members raised the issue of the rural and remote pathology services. I note that the honourable member for Cowper is present. He is always pretty active in trying to ensure that the government meets its targets in relation to rural and remote services. The honourable member does not have much to complain about. I remember opening at least four major centres in his electorate in the last 12 months. Mr Nehl-Only two.",110
172,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No. I think he is mistaken. I do not think we can complain too much about the general social justice policies of the government. But there is clearly an issue here in terms of pathology centres. Again, when legitimate problems of this kind are raised by the opposition and others, we need to respond. It is my intention to announce that some action will be taken in relation to this matter. The rural and remote licence collection centre provisions of the Health Insurance Act were reviewed in consultation with peak professional bodies. These consultations have resulted in the government proposing, as part of the minister's determination of the rural and remote provisions, to allow one licence to cover three centres in specified rural and remote areas. So we are putting in a kind of one for three rule, which is quite an important rule. These areas are identi fied by the Department of Human Services and Health as 'rural other' or 'remote other' in its January 1994 publication of rural and remote areas classifications, which has been based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of statistical local areas. It should be noted that the determination of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is a disallowable instrument and that parliament will have the opportunity to examine the matter in detail. However, I can assure honourable members that the government will develop this determination in consultation with those in the profession and the professional bodies. We are moving ahead with this legislation and I hope that it will result in concrete results which will satisfy honourable members, especially the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). I had the pleasure of recently meeting with the honourable member for Hinkler when I opened an Australian Hearing Services laboratory in Bundaberg. So I do not think they can complain too much about remote and rural areas. The government really has that going and we are intending to ensure that services are provided. Members of the opposition have made an important point that has concerned the government about the provision of health services in rural areas. We still have the problem of the refusal or the reluctance of medical practitioners, especially specialists, to live in rural areas. For some extraordinary reason, amongst all the groups of professionals, doctors are the ones who do not like living in rural areas. We have tried to encourage them to live there. The government welcomes ideas as to how we can solve the problem, which is a problem for us as a nation, of the provision of medical services. I know I can speak on behalf of the minister in saying that we welcome ideas from both sides of the House as to how this problem may be tackled. The point raised by the shadow minister about pharmacists taking on extra work as a result of this new measure is, given the balance of priorities, with respect to the honourable member for Mackellar, not really an issue. It is not up to the pharmacist to police Medicare details. When patients go to have a prescription filled out, it is their to declare whether they have validity under the Medicare arrangements, as they do now when applying for a safety net card. I do not think it is going to lead to a significant increase in the work done by pharmacists, but it will lead to a significant increase in the power of pharmacists in the exercise of their professional expertise. The government is now saying, as some honourable members have mentioned, that if a person gets a prescription from a doctor and goes to a pharmacist and the pharmacist says, 'Even though this is a PBS drug, it is going to cost you the $28,' and then the pharmacist says, 'I'm a bit puzzled as to why the doctor, knowing that there is an equivalent drug didn't give you that one, which is would cost you $5 or $10 instead of $28,' and the person says, 'That is extraordinary; what can we do about that?' the pharmacist, if he or she is really cooperative and interested in going to the trouble, can then ring the doctor and get the doctor's approval to dispense the cheaper drug. But the pharmacist has to get the doctor at that moment and the doctor might say, 'No, I'm not interested in talking to the pharmacist.' Unless we have a really cooperative system, we will have a system that does not work very well. The government is now saying that there will be a principle of equivalence. That means that the pharmacist can say, 'Here is an equivalent drug that is cheaper. We can give you that instead of the one prescribed by the doctor.' But there will be exceptions and rules governing that. If, for example, a doctor has insisted, for medical reasons, on only that particular brand being prescribed, that is a different point. There are also a couple of other criteria. In general, it is true to say that we have a system here that is going to mean fairer and, in many cases, cheaper medicines. It is also going to give us an additional power. Some pharmaceutical companies have been outrageous in refusing to reach a reasonable price with the PBS on some of the medicines. The minister and I, as parliamentary secretary, get letters from constituents all the time telling us that they have gone to the doctor, were given this prescription and it has duty cost so much. We always urge companies, and the PBS system urges companies, to give a fair price. But we will not pay exorbitant prices. We have to keep an eye out for the fact that we have to be responsible in relation to the budget. Some of these companies ought to recognise that there are equivalent drugs. They ought to have similar prices rather than think that they can get some doctors to prescribe a highly exorbitant drug and persuade the patient that that is the only drug available. Therefore, this change is going to benefit a lot of people who have struggled in certain circumstances to get a prescription which will be adequate for the purposes. Although this change seems minor, let us hope that there is a significant change in practice. I also hope it is a change which wil1lead to more responsible behaviour on the part of doctors, pharmacists and the companies supplying the pharmaceuticals. The shadow minister raised a concern about the definition by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of 'equivalence', which has a broader meaning than 'bioequiva1ence'. She argued that the latter should be used. The amendment needs to be read in its entirety. This legislation requires that brands which are to be substituted have to be equivalent and must be identified in the pharmaceutical benefits schedule. Bioequiva1ence is a specific term relating to biological testing. Some brands can be accepted as equivalent without undergoing bioequivalence testing where the Therapeutic Goods Administration accepts that the testing is not required. The government is not trying to open it up to some very general, vague notion of equivalence. We are saying that we do not have to have specific bioequivalence. Where it is required we will have it, but where the Therapeutic Goods Administration, in its judgment, has decided that it is not required it will not be necessary to do that. There is no difference between what the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is suggesting and what is in the legislation. So the suggested change of wording is really not necessary. The shadow minister also raised a concern about brand substitution and its impact on comarketing arrangements, such as those between Amrad and Merck, Sharp and Dohme. We are aware of these concerns and the Minister for Human Services and Health has noted these concerns about the supply of drugs marketed under this arrangement. The minister has instructed the Department of Human Services and Health that where both companies agree such products should not be flagged as interchangeable. In relation to that, a letter was dispatched today from the Minister for Human Services and Health to the managing director of Amrad notifying him of that decision. In relation to those matters, I think we can say that we have tried to meet the concerns raised by the shadow minister. In overall terms, we can say that in these areas we are trying to resolve issues which have a certain technical complexity but which nevertheless in their outcomes can have a big impact on people's ability and the nation's ability to pay for medical services. In that regard, therefore, I think the legislation is worthy of support and I commend the legislation to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",110
173,Mrs BISHOP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I would like to place on record my response to the summing up of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) at the end of the second reading debate and to thank him for acceding to the undertaking that I requested specifically dealing with the need for the principles to be determined by the minister when considering the needs of remote and rural areas. I am particularly pleased that, when the parliamentary secretary confirmed that the principles would so deal with those matters, the provision that I said I was aware was a proposal will be part of those principles. The other thing is that, having dealt with the concerns, particularly of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association-which I believed were worthy of raising-in this way rather than by formally moving amendments, it has resulted in a satisfactory outcome. The statement by the parliamentary secretary that the restricted meaning of 'equivalent' be broadened to 'bioequivalent' as asked for in the suggested amendment by the association has been met, and I thin k that the letter concerning the co-marketing will go a long way to alleviating the concerns of the association. I agree with the parliamentary secretary that this has been a worthwhile debate and that, through the process of that debate, we have negotiated some satisfactory outcomes. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous)-by leave-read a third time. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BILL 1994 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 30 June. Second Reading",112
174,Mr CREAN,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. One of the major commitments in Working Nation is to ensure that the long-term unemployed get extra assistance to enable them to participate better in the jobs growth. The success of lobstart in targeting long-term unemployed assistance is reflected in the drop in the number of long-term unemployed. As I brought to the attention of the House yesterday, the number of long-term unemployed has fallen by 41,000 over the last year and by 76,000 since the last election, that is, out of a total job growth in that time of 376,000 people. This is against a backdrop where, during the 1980s, it took seven years and 1.6 million jobs to cut long-term unemployed by 109,000. This legislation takes the targeting measures one important step further; it significantly extends case management services and opens those services and their provision up to competition. Experience is that this targeting of intensive one-to-one servicing is very successful in improving the opportunities for long-term unemployed people to obtain jobs. Case management will provide a continuing relationship between a job seeker and a case manager. Together they will develop a personalised package of assistance that will focus on effective job searching and matching to identify job opportunities. Where job search activity fails to result in employment, labour market program assistance will be provided. The aim of this legislation is to promote full employment by providing a free public employment service and to draw on a diversity of public sector, community and private sector resources to achieve this goal as cost effectively as possible. This legislation will improve the quality and effectiveness of employment services through enhanced case management services for the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long term unemployed. The legislation provides the framework for development over time of an open competitive environment for the supply of case management services. A new regulatory body, the Employment Services Regulatory AuthoritY-ESRA-will be established independently of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. One of its central responsibilities will be to encourage and facilitate contracted case managers to provide case management services in competition with Employment Assistance Australia, which will be DEET's case management organisation, formed from part of the CES. ESRA will promote competition and fair and efficient market conduct. These arrangements are intended to meet the needs of job seekers, employers and the local community while maintaining high standards of accountability and probity in the use of the public resources provided. The longer term aim of the legislation is for job seekers to have a choice of case manager. The legislation also ensures that there are reciprocal obligations on job seekers through case management activity agreements which will outline an agreed course of action for case manager and job seeker. Agreements will focus the efforts of case managers and job seekers firmly on attaining employment for job seekers. The Commonwealth Employment Service and Employment Assistance Australia The legislation establishes the Commonwealth Employment Service within the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This provision confirms that Australia will continue to meet its obligations under ILO Convention No. 88 to provide a free public employment service. There is provision for the establishment of a national committee to advise the national director on the operations of the CES. A CES advisory committee already operates and will continue to operate under the provisions of this legislation. There is also provision for the establishment of area committees. Working Nation allows for the establishment of up to 60 area consultative committees to consist of representatives from local businesses, community organisations, local and state governments, regional development bodies, training providers and unions. These committees will provide an avenue for local input to program and service delivery decisions to ensure that CES services will complement local development and employment initiatives. The legislation establishes Employment Assistance Australia as a separate organisation, within the department, to provide case management services. As part of its regulatory functions, ESRA will monitor the operations of Employment Assistance Australia and make recommendations to the minister about those operations. The case management system In Working Nation the government made an undertaking to tackle long-term unemployment by providing individually tailored case management services. Case management involves a one-to-one service provided to job seekers with the objective of placing them in jobs by matching their skills and capabilities with the requirement of employers. Case managers will provide continuing support to the job seeker before, during and after the program of assistance. Case managers will work with the job seeker to negotiate a case management activity agreement. This will set out a course of action tailored to the particular needs of the job seeker and agreed between the case manager and the job seeker. The overriding objective is to assist the job seeker to get retain lasting employment. Case managers will provide counselling and job search assistance. This will be supported by access to programs, vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills and community-based work experience or subsidised employment. The case management strategy will ensure that the appropriate assistance is offered, that the job seeker is committed and, indeed, obligated to pursue agreed plans. Participants in the case management system Working Nation provides that case management will be available to: short-term unemployed people assessed by the CES as being at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed; those who have been registered as unemployed with the CES for 12 months and are eligible for the Newstart allowance; those eligible for job compact assistance; and those covered by the youth training initiative. The legislation provides for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to make a written determination of the groups of persons, such as those that I have just outlined, who are to become participants in the case management system. With this provision the government and ESRA will be able to manage the case management system so that the most effective use is made of available case management resources. This arrangement will be used to tailor assistance in the first instance to those most in need. As time goes by, case management can be extended to other groups of unemployed persons or otherwise be modified to reflect changing needs and priorities. Referral to case managers The CES will be required to notify and interview persons as they qualify to become participants in the case management system in order to assess their needs prior to referring them. In making a referral, the CES must have primary regard to the client's preference for a case manager and to other considerations and which are to be set out in a disallowable instrument, including the local availability of case managers and their ability to meet the particular needs of the client. The longer term objective is that clients are able to make an informed choice of case manager and that the CES's decisions would reflect few changes to job seekers' nominations. Case management services One of the responsibilities of ESRA will be to determine fully what are considered to be case management services. This will also be a disallowable instrument. The case management market will be subject to considerable innovation over time and the use of a disallowable instrument will enable ESRA to respond to such changes while ensuring the clients' interests are being met. As part of delivering case management services, a case management activity agreement will be developed and agreed by the case manager and the job seeker. The requirements of the case management activity agreement will give force to the Working Nation emphasis on the reciprocal obligations of job seekers, especially those who have become eligible for the job compact. For example, the case management activity agreement will require a job compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any offer of a placement under new work opportunities or the new enterprise incentive scheme and case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activity against his or her agreement and provide relevant information to the CES. The legislation will also require seeker's compliance with the case management activity agreement occurs. The legislation provides that a case management activity agreement will take the place of a Newstart activity agreement or a job search activity agreement for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1991. Failure to enter into a case management activity agreement or to abide by the conditions of a case management activity agreement will have the same effect for the job seeker as failure to enter into a Newstart activity agreement or a job search agreement or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of those agreements. In other words, it will lead to a loss of allowances for some period of time. Accreditation of case managers ESRA will have the power to accredit case managers and its regulatory functions will - e exercised primarily through the use of thIs power. The details of the accreditation scheme are to be set out in a disallowable instrument. ESRA will make decisions to accredit case managers and to vary or cancel their accreditation. It will also be able to set and vary conditions of accreditation. ESRA may also issue a formal warning if a case manager contravenes a condition of accreditation. The accreditation scheme will stipulate conditions which must be met: before an applicant can be accredited as a case manager; and in the ongoing delivery of and reporting on case management services. The use of a disallowable instrument to set out the detail of the accreditation scheme will allow ESRA to vary conditions of accreditation as the needs of the client group or the industry itself changes. The legislation does, however, stipulate that a case manager may not demand or receive any fees from a job seeker for the provision of case management services. All case management fees are to be paid by ESRA. In addition the legislation requires case managers to lodge case management activity agreements with the CES and to provide information to the Secretary to DEET concerning a job seeker's compliance with a case management that the job activity agreement. One of the more significant accreditation decisions ESRA will be empowered to make is to specify classes of case management services as part of the accreditation scheme. The initial classes of specialist case management services are likely to include, but not be limited to, services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disabilities, youth, people from a non-English speaking background, and people seeking employment in particular industries. ESRA will be able to adapt these classes as expertise develops and increasing numbers of case managers make specialisation in case management services more viable. Once a case manager has been accredited, ESRA may enter into contractual arrangements with that case manager for the provision of case management services. Contracted case managers will be paid by ESRA. Codes of practice The accreditation scheme may stipulate codes of practice, declared by ESRA, which must be adhered to. These codes will be advisory unless they are written into the accreditation arrangements, at which point they will become an accreditation requirement. All codes of practice are intended to be disallowable instruments, thereby allowing the scrutiny of parliament over the regulation of the industry. Codes of practice will also be published by ESRA and their operation will be monitored, evaluated and reported upon. DEET assistance to case managers Under the terms of the legislation DEET will provide two types of assistance to contracted case managers: in addition to what is required in the referral process, DEET may be required to assist case managers, for example, by ensuring that information about the case management systems and local case managers is available through CES offices-perhaps in pamphlet or poster form. Any assistance which the CES is required to give to case managers will be set out in a disallowable instrument; and the departmental information technology assistance scheme, also to be detailed in a disallowable instrument, will cover those aspects of information technology assistance which the department is required to give case managers from time to time. It is envisaged that DEET would charge case managers for information technology assistance on a cost recovery basis and that the details of the charges would be among the matters covered in the disallowable instrument. Establishment of Employment Services Regulatory Authority (ESRA) The government has made the commitment to provide case management services to all long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. This will involve approximately 500,000 people. The services are to be opened up to outside competition to help meet this commitment. Community and private providers are to be funded to operate in fair and open competition with EAA in the delivery of case management services. Wherever possible, people being case managed will be able to choose between government and non-government providers. The government has set clear targets for the numbers of cases it expects non-government providers to manage. In 1994-95, 10 per cent of cases will be managed by external providers. This will be increased to 20 per cent in 1995-96 and 30 to 40 per cent in 1996-97. The commitment to case management and the introduction of competition in its provision will ensure better outcomes for the long-term unemployed, improved levels of services for employers and better value for the money committed to funding these services. As with the introduction of competition into other areas of government monopoly, there is a need for a regulatory authority. The legislation establishes ESRA and sets out its functions, powers and arrangements to allow the appointment of a board and chief executive officer. The legislation allows ESRA to regulate the case management system primarily through its powers to accredit and select contracted case managers. It is also given a specific power to promote competition and to monitor, evaluate and report to the minister on the operations of the case management system. The legislation allows for an ESRA board to be established with a chairperson and between two and five members. The board will have the responsibility to determine policies and will direct the chief executive officer. The Governor General will appoint board members and the CEO by written instrument. Remuneration will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The appointments of both the Chairperson and the CEO are expected to be on a full-time basis. To promote linkages with the activities of NETTFORCE, the Chairperson of ESRA will be a member of the NETTFORCE board. In order to ensure probity and effective performance of board members, the legislation requires declarations by board members of direct and indirect pecuniary interests in any matters being considered by the ESRA board. The Governor General will have the power to terminate the appointment of a board member on grounds of conflict of interest, unauthorised absence, bankruptcy or otherwise unsatisfactory performance. Investigations by ESRA The legislation provides investigative powers for ESRA to ensure the highest quality case management for unemployed persons and stringent measures against fraud and malpractice. ESRA will be able to investigate the action of the CES in referring people and providing assistance to case managers. It may also investigate the adherence of contracted case managers to conditions of accreditation, contractual conditions and codes of practice. ESRA will also be able to investigate any contraventions of the departmental information technology assistance scheme, rules relating to the use and return of case management documents and the duty of non-disclosure of information about clients. Some matters which come to ESRA's notice may be more appropriately dealt with by the Ombudsman, a departmental secretary, the Trades Practices Commission or the Privacy Commissioner. The legislation allows ESRA to refer such matters to these agencies. Obligations in relation to client rights and p-otec颅 tion, such as those covered by the Pnvacy Act, Freedom of Information Act and Ombudsman Act, equivalent to those that apply to the Australian Public Service, will be imposed on contracted case managers. Contracted case managers' adherence to antidiscrimination legislation will exist by virtue of separate legislation in those areas. Monitoring of compliance To further ensure that there are effective anti-fraud measures and safeguards against malpractice, the legislation enables ESRA to appoint inspectors with formal powers to undertake searches, gather information and seize documents. These powers may be exercised for the purpose of monitoring compliance by case managers with the conditions of their accreditation and the agreements under which they are engaged. Review of decisions relating to referral to case managers and decisions relating to case management activity agreements Clients will be referred to case managers by the CES taking into account client preferences, needs and the circumstances of local case managers. The legislation provides for access to a review of this decision by an authorised review officer. Appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is also provided for. There will also be access to these review mechanisms with respect to decisions about case management activity agreement. Review of ESRA decisions A case manager, or a prospective case manager, may request a review by ESRA of a decision it has made about its accreditation or disqualification. The legislation also allows for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision that has been confirmed or varied by ESRA. Annual report As with standard require!llents for regulatory authorities, the ESRA board is to furnish an annual report, for tabling in parliament. It is intended that the report will cover concerns which the CES has reported to ESRA regarding the activity testing efforts of EAA or contracted case managers and will include evaluations of how codes of practice are operating and the extent to which contracted case managers meet the standards required by their accreditation conditions. The annual report will include its audited financial statements and note any directions given to it by the minister. Conclusion This legislation renects a bold and imaginative venture by the federal government. Together with the job compact and new incentives to employers through the training wage and subsidies, it will better equip us to tackle unemployment and, in particular, long term employment. It will encourage into this field many community and business organisations which will bring with them special expertise, local knowledge and links with employers. In doing so they will provide a much wider range of choice of service for job seekers and improve job seekers' chances of returning to employment. This is a radically new approach. There is currently no well developed non-government case management market, and many providers will be learning as they go. Equally for the government and for ESRA it will be very much a matter of learning by doing. While the legislation seeks to be as specific as possible, it also renects the certainty that many new problems will emerge over t!me and there will be a need to set down detailed aspects of the new arrangements quickly to address unanticipated needs and problems. The legislation includes a number of safeguards against inappropriate use of powers. It provides for disallowability of instruments defining a number of key aspects of the arrangements. This will allow parliamentary scrutiny of those arrangements. At the same time the legislation gives ESRA and the minister the power to act quickly and effectively to ensure proper protection of one the most vulnerable sections of our communipurposes. ty-long-term unemployed people-from exploitation by unscrupulous employers. I commend the bill to the House. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994 This bill makes consequential amendments arising from the Employment Services Bill 1994. It repeals part VI of the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, under which the Commonwealth Employment Service is currently established. The CES is being re-established by clause 8 of the Employment Services Bill 1994. The bill amends the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to provide for members of the public to have rights of access to documents relating to case management services that held by contracted case managers. The bill provides for the Ombudsman to investigate complaints about contracted case managers and for the Ombudsman to be able to refer those complaints to the Employment Services Regulatory Authority where the Ombudsman considers the complaint could be more appropriately dealt with by ESRA. The bill amends the Privacy Act 1988 to apply provisions of it to contracted case managers in connection with the provision of case management services. The bill amends a number of provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for the disclosure of information to contracted case managers by the Secretary to the Department of Social Security and to insert notes cross-referencing relevant provisions of the Employment Services Act 1994. I commend the bill to the House.",112
175,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"I rise this afternoon to speak to the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994, both of which raise issues of considerable significance in the overall debate on what can be done to solve unemployment in this country. The Employment Services Bill 1994, the of principal of these two bills, has two main Firstly, it establishes an entity to be known as Employment Assistance Australia within the Department of Employment, Education and Training, giving effect to the case management system announced in Working Nation-the government's white paper on employment and growth-principally for long-term unemployed people and certain other unemployed people considered to be at risk. Secondly, the bill establishes a new regulatory authority, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, as an independent statutory authority within the employment, education and training portfolio. ESRA will be responsible for regulating the case management system within both the public and private sectors. The Employment Services (Consequential are Amendments) Bill 1994 makes consequential amendments to five separate acts arising from the proposed Employment Services Act 1994. These five acts are: the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991. At the outset let me make it quite clear that, contrary to what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) may have us believe, the bills currently before the House are not in any way about creating sustainable jobs. As an integral part of the white paper, these bills are about political survival-the government's survival. The white paper itself, out of which these bills arise and whose proposals they seek to implement, is not fundamentally about solving unemployment; it is, as Professor Helen Hughes of the full employment project has said, about making unemployment palatable to the community, about making it appear as though action is being taken. The white paper is all about training and short-term subsidised schemes designed to reduce the statistical levels of unemployment with both eyes fixed firmly on the next federal election. It is about concealing unemployment. The training and other schemes within the white paper have the potential to hide over 200,000 unemployed people from the unemployment figures. On a conservative estimate, when fully operational, the job compact within the white paper could hide some 120,000 unemployed people, the. parenting allowance could hide some 59,000 and the mature age allowance could hide some 30,000. The government claims in the explanatory memorandum that the aim of the Employment Services Bill 1994-the bill that I will focus on for most of my remarks in the course of this debate-is to promote full employment, a goal which the coalition obviously supports. There is no doubt that securing employment for all those who want to work and cannot find it, or who want more work than they are currently able to find, is the pre-eminent task facing Australia today. It is not too much to say that the future of our society is directly tied up with the ability of our country to provide people with work and with satisfying work. However, given the current policy mix, there is no possibility that this goal will be achieved by this government or that it will be achieved by the year 2000. Growth projections in the 1994-95 budget of 4112 per cent per annum through to the end of the decade make it apparent that unemployment at the end of this time will not be five per cent; it will be closer to seven per cent, and that is the optimistic assumption that there will be no further downturn in the business cycle. Not only does this equate to abandonment of the notion of full employment, but Professor Hughes has expressed the view that during the next business downturn unemployment could reach as high as 15 per cent. In other words, the unemployment ratchet whereby each downturn in the last two decades has begun with unemployment at a higher rate than at the start of the previous downturn and whereby unemployment has reached a higher peak in each succeeding recession is still in place. The unemployment ratchet is still operating in this country. Mr Ronaldson-That's the frightening aspect.",118
176,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"That, as the honourable member for Ballarat has quite correctly said, is the frightening aspect of the current situation that Australia faces. It is in this context that we have to attempt to assess the implications of the government's white paper and, in particular, the schemes to address the problem of long-term unemployment which are before us in the present legislation. The fact that the unemployment ratchet is still in place means, I believe-and I regret to say this-the certain failure of the white paper, because without the full-time jobs coming through as a result of economic growth in sufficient numbers the subsidised jobs under the white paper will not translate into a sustainable transition of long term unemployed people back into the work force. It is because of this that I propose to move an amendment to the bill, which I will read for the benefit of Hansard. It states: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House deplores the Government's failure to provide real sustainable job opportunities"". During the past seven weeks I have travelled throughout Australia visiting every state, including major regional centres, and have undertaken an extensive consultative process to gain a first-hand impression of the extent of the unemployment problem in Australia and reactions to the government's white on paper. I have held discussions with a range of voluntary agencies such as the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, Wesley Mission and Lifeline-some of the agencies which are very likely to become case managers under the scheme outlined in the legislation. I visited a number of training organisations endeavouring to provide young people with the skills they need to attempt to obtain jobs .. I have talked with young and long-term unemployed people, homeless people and those seeking to provide these people with assistance back into the work force. I have talked with many small business people about the reasons why they are hesitating to take on unemployed people and what their attitude is likely to be to the training schemes and subsidised employment proposals of the white paper, the job compact and the case management system. The message that 1I have heard during these discussions is remarkably consistent. The fact is that a- the moment people do not believe the white paper. They are fearful that in many cases its measures to help the long-term unemployed will actually be counterproductive. The vast majority of unemployed people still feel very strongly that the recovery is passing them by. They approach the white paper's promise of further training and subsidised employment with great scepticism and wariness because they feel that they have heard it all before. Small business, which in the end is going to have to create the long-term sustainable jobs, is exceedingly sceptical of the white paper. The task of the government is to create the environment within which confidence in the future can be restored and in which the door to opportunities can be opened. Small business, however, will only create those jobs when it is confident that interest rates are going to once again become a trap, as they did in the late 1980s, when they do not have to cut their way through a jungle of red tape and bureaucracy whenever they want to innovate or employ someone, when the tax burden is eased and the system is less complex and costly to comply with and when every effort to establish an enterprise agreement does not expose them to outside interference by union or tribunal or both. The huge deficit spending which the federal government has indulged in in recent years and, indeed, since the 1992 One Nation statement has vastly expanded is one of the significant elements in holding back a significant revival of business confidence. It is an almost universal view that 1I have found amongst small businesses that they will be exceedingly reluctant to take on new employees under subsidised employment programs because they are concerned that they are already fully occupied in coping with the amount of demand on them by the government. They want to be able to take on people who can make an immediate contribution to the productivity of their enterprise. They would much prefer to take on, where they have the demand and the capacity to encourage them to do so, someone who can immediately come into a full-time, unsubsidised position. So it remains to be seen how many new employees in subsidised positions the small business sector will be prepared to take on. Equally as important, as the Salvation Army and others have pointed out to me on a number of occasions during my meetings with them, the social impact of the worse recession for 60 years has yet to peak. Family breakdown measured by divorce rates has just reached a lO-year high. Appallingly, the number of suicides among young people has been climbing. The demand on the services of voluntary organisations such as the Salvation Army has yet to show any signs of easing in most parts of Australia. In other words, for the almost 900,000 unemployed Australians and their families and the over 300,000-1 notice that the minister in his second reading speech used the figure of 500,000-long-term not unemployed the recession we had to have is still a reality. Let me say right at the outset that the concept of helping the long-term unemployed back into the work force is a good one and an appropriate one. It is one that we advocated very strongly in our programs in the last election campaign and put forward a number of very constructive measures to address through the Austrain scheme and through the local community employment boards. In the present circumstances it is absolutely essential that the dire circumstances of the long-term unemployed be addressed. There is no doubt whatever that the problem is major. It is getting worse for those who are long-term unemployed. The social distress, the individual distress, that the long-term unemployed are suffering is growing at present without any sign in their eyes of short-term relief. There is, I believe, a universal recognition in this country that the mismanagement of Australia's financial and economic affairs over the last decade has led to the development of a new underc1ass in this country, and that this underclass is becoming increasingly entrenched. I believe it is the case that the white reveals that the government has at long last, after many years, become aware that this problem will not go away and that it must be addressed. The issue is whether the white paper and the measures in the legislation we are considering this evening have identified and will implement the solution. In our view, while there are good features to aspects of the proposals which the government has put forward, it has not provided the solution to the problem. Partly that is because it has not put in place the essential prerequisite for the success of any intensive and sustained attempt to help the long-term unemployed, which is sustainable growth in long-term employment at a rate sufficient to increase the demand for long-term unemployed people in the work force. The second aspect is that the measures which are implemented through this legislation are unlikely to be successful. The core of the government's proposal is the jobs compact. The key element of the jobs compact is the offer of a job to people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more. These people are to be offered case management, assessment of the employment barriers they face and additional training where required to help them become job ready. In return, there is imposed on them a reciprocal obligation. I believe that is quite appropriate. The government has done the right thing in making it clear that this is a part of its arrangements. However, most long-term unemployed people are going to have to wait a very long time to get assistance under the job compact. The job compact is to be phased in over four years. It offers no immediate hope in the near future for most of the long-term unemployed. It will be literally years before some people who are presently long-term unemployed will be offered jobs under the job compact. Indeed, the white paper spells out clearly that people who have been receiving benefits for over 18 months will have received a job compact offer by the end of 1997-98. I do not think that is going to be of great comfort to a great many long-term unemployed people. In relation to case management, many of the organisations that I have met with are paper simply adopting a wait and see attitude and believe that case managers operating under the new system wilI simply not have the time or the resources to effectively deal with the enormous problems which many long-term unemployed people have. I understand that in the early years, perhaps this year in particular, in the implementation of the case management system there will be a particular focus on people who have been unemployed for five years or more. The fact that there are sufficient numbers of these people to provide a focus shows the severity of the problem. If you speak to bodies that are concerned on a daily basis with helping people who have been unemployed for that long they will tell you that it can take up to two years for somebody in this situation to become job ready. Mrs Crosio-If they don't start, it will take forever.",119
177,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"The question is, though: is the program going to provide sufficient support for these people to come back into the work force? There is going to be a major preoccupation by the government with people who have been unemployed for a very long time. A culture of unemployment has grown up. The first question that will have to be answered by this system is whether a focus on these people through the case management system as implemented under this legislation is going to provide these individuals with sufficient support. All I report to the House tonight is that I have found that those bodies that are implementing case management in their own way in the community are sceptical. A very widespread scepticism exists. The question has been raised with me on a number of occasions whether case management as understood in this legislation is going to be case management as it is understood by these agencies. The feature of case management and the philosophy of case management is, as the minister says, to attempt to address all the needs of the unemployed person. The unemployed person needs to be assisted on the basis of his total life situation. The whole person needs to be taken into account in suggesting appropriate programs. There is going to be enormous pressure in this case management system to get numbers of people through it. Whether or not there will be sufficient time available for the case manager to provide the sort of individualised support which is absolutely necessary for people who have been out of the work force for five years or more, let alone some briefer period, remains to be seen. That is one of the great challenges this system faces. There is certainly a feeling at the moment that the white paper is coming into position very slowly. I think it is true to say that the white paper does not exist in practical terms in the CES, let alone in the wider community. The training is not yet there and the system of assessing whether or not unemployed people are at risk and whether they are suitable for entry into the case management system is still not in place. The CES is currently relying on old, previously existing systems. The information about how the system is to work is not available and the CES does not know whether offices are going to get additional resources when they move staff into the case management system. All these questions are very much in the minds of CES managers around Australia at the present time. I have found that they do not know the answers to these questions at the moment. They are waiting for the white paper to arrive. It appears that there are delays in the appointment of case managers. I understand that the target for the number of case managers to be appointed by December this year is between 3,000 and 3,500. At the end of July, I believe, there were some 1,400 case managers appointed. It is quite possible-and this another challenge that the government facesthat the target for the number of case managers will not be met by the end of this year. There are presently some 35,000 people in case management because the case management system was established in some form within DEET before the release of the white paper. However, there are another 49,000 people on the waiting list. These case managers are faced with a huge load. Not all of them are full time; most of them are either untrained or undertrained; and many of them, I understand, are attempting to deal with newstart interviews as well. At present, a huge load is being placed on the CES. It is running behind schedule, and there is every possibility that the white paper will be extremely slow to get into operation. Indeed, in relation to the long-term unemployed, the white paper intends a very long phase-in period. . I also understand that the initial work on the job seekers assessment instrument has not been going smoothly and that people presently in case management have been selected according to the old criteria and may not fall within the target group. DEET has never been known for its capacity to manage data with integrity. My understanding is that there are very significant problems with the information that is coming through and being entered into the system. It has been mentioned to me-and I do not know whether it is true-that possibly up to 50 per cent of cases have incomplete data, which would make it extremely difficult for them to be properly handled within the case management system. There are a large number of practical concerns about the arrangements, but there are also concerns about the strategy which is being adopted. I will illustrate my point by drawing the attention of the House to the concerns of many people in the skillshare area and other programs for training unemployed people. Under the arrangements to be set in place by this legislation, the case managers will be asked, they understand, to focus their attention on people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more and, in the ,first is instance, possibly people who have been unemployed for much longer than 18 months. When I have asked these people what the implication of this proposal is, the answer I have received is that it is a system which will inevitably create more long-term unemployed people. Once we focus our efforts on people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more, we are simply not going to be able to offer assistance to those that we have been assisting up until now-those that have been unemployed for less than that time, possibly six months or 12 months. We are receiving no additional resources and our existing resources will be diverted into the target groups that the white paper has identified. Mr Crean-There are additional resources.",121
178,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Additional resources for case management, but bodies like skillshareMr Crean-They don't have to do it.",123
179,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"They are strongly of the view that they will be required to do it. There will be a great deal of pressure on them to do this because these will be the people coming through the case management system. They see that their resources are being diverted. That means they will be unable to offer the sort of support they have been offering to people who are not long-term unemployed, and they will not be able to assist those people until they become long-term unemployed. Mr Crean interjecting",123
180,Dr KEMP,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"That is a quite common belief amongst the skillshare bodies that I have been to. I would be very pleased if you were because there is great concern about this point. The legislation also ranges very widely in setting up a contracting out system for case management. And the coalition applauds this initiative. It is good that the government has moved in the direction that we outlined before the last election, which is to assist unemployed people through the mechanism of contracting out. In establishing this system, however, the government has put in place a body known as ESRA which has exceedingly wide and extensive powers. This body will be able to regulate the case management system, define the conditions of accreditation, stipulate of practice, effect terminations, inspect premises, search and withdraw items, and seek reimbursement of debts from a contracted agency. It will have the power to investigate matters relating to the operation of the case management system. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will be empowered to investigate complaints about contracted case managers. Both agencies will have the power to refer complaints to the other and will be expected to enter into a memorandum of understanding which will set out detailed arrangements for referral. It is because of these new and sweeping powers that have been accorded ESRA, including the very laudable objective of ensuring that fraud does not occur within the system, that we believe that this piece of legislation should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs so that there is an opportunity for those agencies that may participate in the case management system to make representations and express their views and so that we can ensure that the very wideranging authority given to ESRA will be exercised in a way that is both appropriate to prevent fraud and appropriate to encourage the development of the private or non-government case management system which is envisaged. The coalition has already expressed concern about the way in which ESRA has been established and the appointment of former Victorian Premier Mrs Joan Kirner as the head of the board. Mrs Kirner has no formal business experience and is well known for her negative attitude towards the private sector. I do not believe that her appointment will give a great deal of confidence that ESRA is going to operate .in a way that will really establish a competitive case management market. In the coalition's view, the appointment of Mrs Kirner merely confirms that the white paper is more about repackaging and representing the politicians responsible for Australia's high unemployment policies than it is about offering genuine hope for victims of those policies. I also draw to the minister's attention the codes concern expressed to me by voluntary agencies which may well be interested in offering case management that they will become policemen on behalf of the government in terms of monitoring the activity agreements and that this will interfere with their relationships with their clients which they have built up over a long period. This fear very definitely needs to be addressed, and presumably will be considered by ESRA in establishing the system. If these fears are not allayed, it may be difficult to get these voluntary agencies to finally offer to become case managers under the system. Given the tenns of the legislation, I think this is a real fear because there are responsibilities on these contracted case managers. These responsibilities may interfere with the relationships which these voluntary agencies like to have with their clients and which are based on trust and confidentiality. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House deplores the Government's failure to provide real sustainable job opportunities"".",123
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES, Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ruddock-I second the motion enthusiastically and reserve my right to speak. .,124
182,Mrs CROSIO,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (7.01 p.m.)-I rise in support of the Employment Services Bill, which is before the House, and object most strenuously to the amendment that has just been moved. I would like to say a number of things about this bill because I think it is a very exciting piece of legislation . I listened intently to the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who is the shadow spokesperson on education. I am sure that he will not mind my saying that I thought it was the most pessimistic speech that I have heard in this House for a long time. I asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who was sitting next to me at the time, whether I could re-read his second reading speech because I thought that it must .have contained the same points that he mentioned in an answer he gave to this House yesterday with respect to the long-tenn unemployed when he said that the statistics, which are public knowledge, have shown very clearly that 41,000 people have now found jobs over the last year and that 76,000 people have found jobs since the last election. The honourable member for Goldstein blamed this government for the recession, for the divorce rate and for the suicide rate. I was waiting for him to blame us for the drought. I thought that may be something that the government has not taken the blame for. Perhaps he should have added that in his speech. What more does he expect this government to do? We now have about five per cent economic growth and 1.7 per cent inflation, and yet we have this type of negative approach. The honourable member for Goldstein said that he had been talking to the unemployed and to skillshare groups. He should come to New South Wales and we will show him what is happening, where it is happening and why it is happening. Quite frankly, what is happening is quite different from the message that I was getting very clearly and loudly from the honourable member for Goldstein. The government has introduced many programs, and many opportunities will be provided by this bill before the House and the white paper. I say to the honourable member that, when we present so-called facts in this House, we should make sure that they are facts. I have full confidence in what the minister said both yesterday and today in his second reading speech. He made an honest and factual remark which is backed up by the statistics and the information that is readily available. I refer to change with respect to CES employees and our skillshare people. If we had listened to some of our population, we would never have got out of the caves. Sure, people do not want change. But the government has shown very clearly through legislation that we acknowledge that there are problems out there. We acknowledge that we have a very high unemployment rate anc-, most particularly, we acknowledge that steps need to be taken, and we intend to take them. That is what this bill before the House is about. Of course, it has to be phased in, as far as our case managers are concerned. We just cannot magically pluck that many skilled people out of the air overnight and say, 'Here they are; here's the problem; here's the solution; here's how we're going to do it.' It must be phased in. This government and this minister would be condemned if it were not phased in. We need to have a common sense approach in how we tackle a problem that has not been created overnight; it is a problem that has been there for quite some time. It is a problem that has been fully acknowledged by our government, and we are now taking steps to overcome it I greatly support the skillshare programs and what they are able to achieve. Ironically, I am getting reports from skillshare programs in my electorate and in neighbouring electorates that they look to this as an opportunity for them to expand the expertise which they have had an opportunity of developing through the programs which we have created and then take that expertise and that knowledge one step further by going to the next area, which is to help those long-term unemployed. They have repeatedly come to local and federal government members and said, 'We have the expertise. Give us a go; give us the right to do it.' This bill and the white paper will provide that opportunity for those people to come forward. As the minister said, they will not have a gun at their head and be obligated to come forward. It will be those who choose to do it. I can assure honourable members that a lot of people out there are waiting to choose. I return to what the bill before the House all about. Unemployment is this government's highest policy priority. Our Working Nation white paper is the most comprehensive and coherent challenge to this problem in the Western world. Working Nation is about the future of this country. As the 21st century approaches, this government realises that what we do for the remainder of this decade will determine the sort of Australia that enters the next century. Furthermore, it will be our future, and not an imposed future. It is a very dynamic piece of legislation. I believe that it underlines what the white paper was about. It is no bandaid. This bill and the white paper are about the restoration of certainty. They are about the development of our young people and the enhancement of our existing work force through training and education. They are about new skills and new capabilities for our working people. But they are more than this. They establish a framework for providing a sustained attack on the problems associated with persons trapped in that long-term unemployment circle. Working Nation is a call to all Australians for new thinking, for new attitudes and for renewed commitment to doing the right thing for those who will come after us. That goes for employers, governments and workers. I believe that circumscribing this commitment is the retention of those fundamental values of fairness, decency and compassion. Regrettably, these values seem to have been lost on those opposite. as their very tepid response to the Working Nation proposal continues. I believe the opposition's absence of any strategic focus for tackling the future of the nation is highlighted by the presentation of this bill and the comments of the shadow spokesperson on employment and education. This bill does not come out of thin air. It is the product of more than a decade of Labor government which has delivered a restructured, internationalised economy. It is a Labor government which has delivered phenomenal job growth. Some l.6 million jobs were created between 1983 and 1990 and a further 360,000 jobs have been created since the last election. It is a government which has delivered industrial harmony, higher productivity, is enterprise bargaining, economic certainty and secure award based safety nets. We can add to this the accelerated participation opportunities in post-secondary education and training, and vast improvements to the social security system and health and housing infrastructure. I would also like to remind the House and in particular our colleagues opposite, as I have done on a number of occasions, that into significant advances are now being made by women at every level of society under the direction and the guidance of this government. It is our government that remains committed to tackling the tough issues associated with the rights of and the opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the disabled, our ethnic communities and all of those people who make up our multicultural Australia in the 1990s. It is only a Labor government that could have cared sufficiently to make the changes that were necessary to ensure that our society remains fair, decent and prosperous. This bill now extends that commitment. Let us look at the central objectives lying behind this piece of legislation. I ask that those opposite recall the framework outlined a few moments ago within which Labor strategic planning is undertaken as we examine the key objectives underpinning this legislation and the programs that will deliver them. The Employment Services Bill enables the creation of a sophisticated, competitive job placement system to aid job seekers who are either at risk of becoming long-term unemployed or are already listed as long-term unemployed. It is a welcome further addition to that framework. Five hundred thousand job seekers will be eligible for case management in 1994-95. Working Nation is designed to ensure that unemployed people share in the economic recovery. The committee on employment opportunities in its paper Restoring full employment estimates that the combination of economic recovery, case management and proper screening can reduce the pool of long term unemployed by 75 per cent by the tum of the century. Case management draws on specialist skills available in the community and the private sector to assist the unemployed move through the appropriate cycle to employment. Organisations associated with people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will have the opportunity, subject to the appropriate accreditation, of coming case managers on a fee-for-service basis. To prevent the very young falJing into long-term unemployment, the youth training initiative coupled with the individual case management will help ensure that newly unemployed young people gain access to suitable education, training or work experience opportunities. Compassion, fairness and decency with equity and access are the hallmarks of this government and they are certainly the linchpin of this bill before the House. The programs flowing from the passage of this bi11 wiJI fulfil the objective of maximising the opportunities for all Australians to participate in the nation's prosperity. Over the next four years we wiJI be spending a total of $10.3 biJIion in employment and training initiatives. There was never a better opportunity for business to increase staff levels and productivity. Of the $10.3 biJIion to be spent over those four years, $3.17 billion, over 30 per cent, will go directly to employers in the form of staff subsidies. This is not a handout. Training must be structured, portable and certified. Training itself will be responsive to the requirements of the employers. By 1995-96 there will be some 360,000 labour market program places per year available for non-compact unemployed people. Added to this, government funding wiJI provide support for 94,000 apprentices and trainees. The joy of speaking to this biJI is the fact that it is designed to address the day-today concerns experienced every day in the electorate office. I have seen first-hand the obstacles faced by our young people, migrants, disabled and older workers in an economy which is changing rapidly. I have also seen the benefits to my electorate of the government's training, education and employment policies. Retention rates at school to year 12 are so high that I now have the three largest high schools in New South Wales within my electorate of Prospect. University enrolments increased 115 per cent between 1986 and 1991. TAFE college enrolments in the city of Fairfield increased in the same period by 61 beper cent. The value of education and training as a pathway to work is recognised by the men and women of the Prospect electorate. It will give them great heart to see the vigour with which the government is now tackling that very vexed question of long-term unemployment as weJl as enhancing the postsecondary vocational options for our young people. Complementary legislation, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, is soon to be introduced by my coJleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) via the Main Committee in this session. This legislation picks up and develops the white paper commitment to training. Coupled with changes to the social security legislation, the government's legislative program wiJl make the unemployment system more responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. By 1995-96 there will be, as I have said, some 360,000 labour market programs places per year available. Added to this, we have given support to our apprentices. I believe that with this legislation the fundamentals now in place for sustained economic Low inflation is now recognised. We have declining unemployment; successful industrial relations and trade policies; and the right macro-economic settings. The introduction of a rigorous, independent employment services regulatory authority promote competition between case managers to accredit, evaluate and regulate the case management system and to advise government on the progress of the system is timely. It another link in the chain that sees industry, government and workers embracing a future that is founded on compassion, fairness and decency and is a recognition of the rights all Australians to prosper. Before I commend the bill there are two areas in what the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) had to which I would like to touch on briefly. concerns the huge load of CES officers. He said that no-one is now able to handle the workload in the CES offices because of what we are doing with this job compact. I would like to say to him that the load they are experiencing is what they are already carryhas ing. The job compact will relieve that once the case managers are in place. I believe it is the input of the CES, with the assistance of the government, that has brought this type of legislation into being. Those officers are at the coalface; they see the problems. They also see how they can readily adjust to what we believe are the solutions for the future. That is a tremendous input from our workers in the CES offices. At times need people in my office have also said they have been stressed by some of the problems they have been experiencing, but they certainly before? welcome the white paper and the initiatives this bill. They are only too ready and too appy to be involved in what our government es as the future for our long-term unemWhat oyed. I support the bill before the House. I ask e opposition to be a little more generous of spirit and, when they speak, to compliment or commend the minister and the government on the legislation-and to also be factual. I very publicly commend the minister and the are government for the legislation which is now recovery. before this House.",124
183,Mr RUDDOCK,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,"Berowra) (7.12 p.m.)I wish to participate in this debate in the most constructive way possible because, quite frankly, members on this side of the House lament very much the situation where we to have so many young people unemployed and so many people with so little in the way of a future. The sort of future that was available to me, my spouse, members of my family and is my contemporaries is not available to young people today. I see that in my own home as my children compete with so many others for the few opportunities that are available for of young people in our community. It does have a very dispiriting effect and is a matter of to the House, . very real concern. It is in that context that I come to discuss say the Employment Services Bill. I ask the One government to do a good deal more than speak about the bill in generalities and a good deal more than the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) did. I would have liked to hear her speak about these matters in the context of the area in which she some portfolio responsibility. There are a number of questions I wish to raise about the government's schema. I want to make a point that is not meant to be uncharitable. The editorial of the Canberra Times of 5 May posed a real question about the white paper and the job compact that was to be developed out of it. It said: The job compact is to be welcomed for what it isa sort of up-market bandaid for those who most it. But we are entitled to be a little sceptical: will this elaborate job program be of any greater effect than the many programs that have gone of That brings me to the situation that we face. Undoubtedly, long-term unemployment is one of the worse social problems of our time. must not be forgotten when debating these new so-called radical approaches that the government is putting forward is that the government is desperately attempting to find a cure for a problem which in my view is purely a creation of its own. This bill deals with only half the story. operation of the job compact will be reliant upon a great deal more information than have at this stage. It will be reliant upon guidelines and disallowable instruments which we have not seen. Undoubtedly, people are having to work on those matters at the ment. I suspect that the reason we are not definitions. seeing the complete guidelines is that people are still not really sure about how the system will operate. The Employment Services Regulatory Authority that we have heard about is still something of a mystery. This body will be responsible for regulating the case managetake ment system within both the private and the public sector. While the bill informs us of functions this new body would perform, we dressed, are not informed about how it would operate. So far it is reaIJy a shell. Until we see internal workings, we will not know a great deal about it. A question has been raised as to what sort of people wilI be able to become case managwhich ers. After all, this is a vitally important of the workings of this system. I do not think statistics. that is yet to be seen. Some people have said that skillshare folk are looking forward playing a part in this, and I think the private sector was mentioned in the white paper. still do not know the nature of the people who will be appointed, the skills that they will bring and their ability to manage these tasks. These things will be crucial to the success of this system. These case managers will be required negotiate a case management activity agreeactivity ment with a job seeker. We have an accreditation scheme which is to be set out as a disrefer allowable instrument, but ESRA will have the power to accredit managers. We are yet to see the disallowable instrument, and we know tary. little about the qualifications to be required this important position. All we know is that a case manager may not demand or receive any fees from a job seeker for the provision of case management services; a case manager must lodge a case management activity agreement with the CES; and a case manager must provide information to the secretary to DEET concerning a job The seeker's compliance with a case management activity agreement. The job compacts will we have the consequence of reducing long-term unemployment figures-albeit artificially, because no new jobs are being created as a result of this process. We are dealing with moprograms. In part, we are largely changing It is not difficult to be cynical about any claim by this Labor government that it has reduced. unemployment, because one of Labor's major achievements under this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been to introduce a number of new measures and benefits which people off unemployment statistics without actually finding them a job. Because the of the way in which this matter is being adthe complexity of it, and the fact that we have a totally new department that will be its handling the income support arrangements and setting up a totally new regulatory regime, I suspect that this process will only compound even more all of the difficulties we have seen to date in relation to part other initiatives for compiling unemployment The job compact will increase the comto plexity of the process through which unemployed people will have to go. The case We management activity agreement wilJ be the third agreement which an unemployed person may have to sign in the space of a year or so. At the moment these people have to do so in relation to jobsearch agreements and, after 12 months, newstart agreements. Now they will to have a third situation-a case management agreement-with a different authority. EssentiaIly, through this legislation-and I particularly to clause 32-people wilI be asked to sign an activity agreement for certain activities approved by the employment secreIt is very difficult to find any substantial in difference between what is proposed here for an activity agreement and what is proposed in relation to the jobsearch agreements and newstart agreements which are already negotiated with the social security department. What is of interest to me is that one of the activities which it might be proposed people undertake-it was referred to in the white paper-is voluntary work. It is very interesting that we have had a situation where voluntary work has been an available option under these jobsearch and newstart agreements-all of the other employment activities that can be chosen here are of similar character-yet in relation to those programs which are working already in the social security area we have no substantial evidence that they have been able to achieve significantly different outcomes. One has to ask the question: what is so different now about the terms of the case management activity agreements that are being proposed under this legislation? That brings me to the central point I wish to make in relation to this particular legislation. I do not know the inner workings of the bureaucracy and how initiatives such as Working Nation emerge from the processes through which they are developed. Clearly, the Department of Social Security had a role, as did the industry departments. If we look at Working Nation we find that there are numbers of changes to social security payments. One could address those matters in debates on other legislation which will undoubtedly come before the parliament later. There is a great deal of material in relation to the regional development strategy, there is a little material in relation to industry opment policies, but when we read the material in relation to development of the youth training arrangements, which we are discussing under the ambit of the Employment Services Bill tonight, we find that there is nothing that explains why these particular initiatives have been developed in the context of moving the income support arrangements from the Department of Social Security to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. When we look at the way in which these new arrangements have been developed, we see that we are faced with a minefield of problems for administration, for the unemployed and for those people who want to understand the unemployment difficulties that people experience in our community. I will be interrupted shortly, but when I resume my remarks-presumably tomorrowI will take the House through some of the administrative difficulties that arise through the structure the government has brought forward without any attempt to justify it. I would have liked to have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security as to why the government is developing a separate payment arrangement through a new department. It will be administered through the Department of Social Security, it will have different appeal arrangements to those that normally apply in relation to social security areas, it will create enormous difficulty in terms of understanding the new administrative law-making regime and it has the potential to develop legislative inconsistency between the employment services legislation and that which operates in the social security area. The officers of the Department of Social Security, who have to administer this program in addition to understanding all of the nuances of the legislation, will have to have the capacities to deal with the new arrangements under this legislation and all the problems that result from that. That seems to me to be a major move and I hoped the minister in his second reading speech might have given us some understanding of why a substantial part of the income develsupport arrangements that are provided in Australia for the unemployed need to be administered by a separate department under this new, complex arrangement. I think they are important questions that the government will have to address and answer in relation to this legislation. When I continue, I will certainly detail some of the greater complexities that are yet to be addressed in relation to this matter. Debate interrupted. NA",127
184,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Cinema",129
185,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (7.30 p.m.)We are now working through the many 50year anniversaries of the Second World War towards the centenary of Federation in 2001 as we search to establish our place in the world. The year 1995 is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which was probably the most cataclysmic event of the 20th century. But 1995 is also being celebrated as the centenary of probably an even more important event-the invention of the cinema. The invention of moving pictures has been, for better or worse, arguably the major influence in the cultural, artistic, social and political life of the century. It has virtually swamped all other art forms and means of communication. Indeed, Australians are amongst the most avid consumers of movies in the world. It is estimated that Australians saw films 1.8 billion times in 1993. While the cinema has been an international force cutting across parochial nationalism, nevertheless our cultural identity both here and abroad has largely been shaped by our film industry. The cinema became the dominant mass medium in the first half of the 20th century. Since then, its death knell has been forecast many times, but it has shown an amazing resilience. The film industry passed through the advent of TV in the 1950s, the video revolution of the 1980s and is facing an explosion of new technologies in the 1990s. Yet in recent years it has embarked on its first major expansion plan since the 1930s with the development of many new venues throughout the country. The cinema remains a crucial element in Australia's cultural life, acting as a showcase for other outlets, such as broadcast television, videos and pay television. Many Western countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, have seen fit to mark out and celebrate the centenary of the cinema for similar reasons. In France, the centenary is a major cultural landmark where a multiplicity of events have been funded and planned between 1994 and 1996 with the full backing of its ministry of arts. This includes special film seasons, lectures, symposiums, exhibitions, publications and other works. Given the value attached to the heritage of the Australian cinema and the support given over the last 20 years by successive state and federal governments, it is fitting that the Australian government should make a special financial allocation to support a range of projects not only to celebrate this significant centenary but also to understand the history of cinema with all its cultural import and ramifications. The centenary of cinema offers the possibility of various projects to help place Australian cinema within a global context and to disentangle the mystique that has pervaded this cultural phenomenon. Earlier this year, the Australian Centenary of Cinema Committee was formed to coordinate and network the variety of activities that will mark the centenary of cinema in 1995-96. This committee represents a complete spectrum of notable persons drawn from the film industry, the education sector, heritage institutions and film funding bodies. The committee believes that the centenary of cinema is far more than a simple anniversary. It is an opportunity to extend and enhance cultural understanding in the best sense, focusing on not only the achievements of Australian cinema but also the cultural dynamics that have made world cinema such an enduring phenomenon. It wants all Australians to know and take pride in their heritage and the achievement of putting Australia on the screens of the world. The committee has already set out an impressive framework of events over 1995-96. I hope that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) announces suitable funding in the near future. I also hope that the minister's imminent announcement of the national cultural policy will also include approval for the National Gallery of film project in conjunction with the Museum of Contemporary Art at Circular Quay. This is one of the more outstanding and worthwhile projects of recent years and will provide enormous benefits to Australia in terms of Australian arts and cultural life, our heritage and the film industry. Located at Circular Quay in the heart of Australia's largest city, it would, in addition, be a magnificent contribution to the urban design of the area and to tourism. It could be completed at a fraction of the cost for the misguided proposal to remove the Cahill Expressway. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the removal of the freeway would not provide any substantial public benefitfunctionally or aesthetically. It would more likely degrade Circular Quay as a public place in both the short and long term, as well as wasting huge public resources. Whaling",129
186,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"It is almost a year ago since I moved a private member's motion opposing proposals from Japan, Norway, Iceland and other countries favouring the resumption of commercial whaling, and calling for support of the French proposal for the creation of a whale sanctuary in all waters south of 40 degrees south latitude. I am very pleased to be able to stand here tonight and say that the latter of these two objectives has been largely realised. On 27 May this year, the International Whaling Commission voted 23 to one in favour of the creation of the sanctuary, which links with the existing Indian Ocean sanctuary. The new sanctuary covers 21 million square kilometres of the southern ocean, where 90 percent of the world's whales go to feed. This means that more than one-third of the world's oceans are now a safe haven for these magnificent animals. Future generations will recognise with gratitude the position that the Australian government took on the issue of the sanctuary. The energy and enthusiasm for the proposal shown by the government, environmental organisations and particularly the former minister for the environment, the honourable member for Canberra (Ros Kelly), in their well-documented support for the sanctuary ideal went a long way towards realising the goal. It has been estimated that the sanctuary protect some 450 blue whales-the majority of the estimated wild population of this, the largest species, which is down from the prehunting level of an estimated 300,000. The sanctuary will also protect 2,000 right whales of which there were originally 100,000; 2,000 pygmy blue whales; 4,000 fin whales of which there were originally 500,000; 4,000 sei whales out of an original population of 160,000; 12,000 humpback whales, a large proportion of which travel up and down the coasts of Australia each year, from an original estimated population of 150,000; 700,000 minke whales; and 100,000 killer whales. The plight of the blue whale is particularly precarious, and the Worldwide Fund for Nature has said that it fears that the sanctuary may have arrived too late to save this already very rare species. Its numbers have been so decimated that it may not be able to increase its numbers sufficiently from such a small breeding population. So the move by the government to devote more scientific resources to monitoring whale numbers is also very welcome. From an Australian point of view, the decision on the sanctuary means that whales in Australian waters will have protection from the Antarctic to the tip of Cape York. Any move which benefits the whales will ultimately benefit Australian coastal communities as well. These cities and towns were once members of one of Australia's first major export industries-the whaling industry. The whales are still returning money and jobs in areas such as Hervey Bay, Maryborough, and even Brisbane's Moreton Bay. This is also happening at places such as Byron Bay in the north of New South Wales. In the months ahead, people will be able to go to those parts of Australia to see the whales returning. The whale watching industry has been estimated to be worth in excess of $30 million per year, and it is still only in its early stages. This places Australia third in the world in regard to whale watching. Before I conclude, I would like to bring to the House's attention the current moves under way in Russia. About a week ago a story broke that the Russian fisheries department will is lobbying its government to join Japan in protesting against the sanctuary, even though the Russians supported the sanctuary at the IWC. Russia has already lodged an objection to the worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling. It was a matter of great concern to me when the World Wildlife Fund's chief executive officer in Australia said last week that these moves could allow the Russians to hunt limited numbers of minke whales in the sanctuary and to sell the meat to Japan without either country breaking the rules of the conventions or having to leave the IWC. These are real concerns that we, as a nation, should be aware of, given Australia's important stance in protecting whales. As I said before, whales are very important to the tourist industry in Queensland in particular and to many towns on the northern New South Wales coast. Some of the recent television news coverage of whales off our coast has been quite outstanding. I pay a compliment to the media for the way in which it has covered many of the aspects of the visit by whales along our coastlines. It is very important that we should try to support the environmental groups that have been so outstanding in their efforts to protect these animals. I would like to congratulate the major environmental organisations in this country and around the world for their unflinching devotion to the well-being of these magnificent creatures. I wish them well in their long-term determination. I hope that Australia will continue to support them, which I am sure we will under our new minister. Faulkner, Mr and Mrs R.",131
187,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (7.40 p.m.)I rise to speak on behalf of Reg and Sylvia Faulkner, who have been residents of Fairlight in my constituency for many years. They have been reduced to virtual destitution because they believed that the Commonwealth's word was its bond. Unfortunately, this matter has a long and tortuous history. To simplify it, the matter began when Sylvia Faulkner invented an award-winning clip with wide application in industry. On the strength of representations made by the senior army officer in charge of procurement-that the army would purchase this clip-the Faulkners invested everything they owned in its production. The army failed to act on the representations made, failed to order the clip and, as a result, the Faulkners were bankrupted. Naturally, the Faulkners sued through the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this was only the beginning of their troubles. I quote from a document concerning this matter: Let me give some examples of maladministration ... In the area of civil action, the classic case has been the Faulkner litigation ... It is an action in contract for damages brought initially in 1974. The matter wallowed along in the Crown Solicitor's division with no action being taken ... I took up the matter in 1981. I have had an extraordinary saga of unanswered correspondence ever since. The speaker went on to list a series of letters and follow-up letters,路 all of which were fobbed off. That speaker was Senator Gareth Evans, who said this back in 1982. I mention this not to score a political point but to stress that it is high tirne that justice finally be done for a couple who are I)ow old, tired and sick. Before the matter finally came to court in the mid-1980s, Greg Woods QC said: ... the first part of the claim will, in my view, undoubtedly succeed with very substantial damages. In fact the claim failed. In part, it failed because the Commonwealth was able to discredit Reg Faulkner as a witness on the basis of allegations that Faulkner made, which the Commonwealth knew at the time to be true but which it ridiculed in court. Documents subsequently obtained reveal that the relevant army officer admitted that he had represented to the Faulkners that the army would purchase the clip. In other words, the Commonwealth knew that the central fact in the Faulkner's claim was true, yet it denied it in court. Further documents reveal that the relevant army officer, who left the army under most questionable circumstances, was 'required to .say he acted without authority' when making this representation to the Faulkners in order to receive his pension. The Commonwealth not only knew that the Faulkners' central contention was true, but the Commonwealth also placed pressure on a key witness to deny that very truth. It is not my purpose to exhume old wrongs and question the actions of officials who have long since left public office just to correct a continuing injustice. The current Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) strikes me as an honourable man who would rather correct an injustice than bury it in the bureaucracy and wait for death to remove the complainants. I have been informed by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who has taken a close interest in this matter for several years, that the Attorney has recently rejected the Faulkners' latest for justice. I suspect that this was done on departmental advice and not on the personal involvement of the Attorney. I just cannot believe that the minister would be so hard hearted. I am not sure whether the Faulkners have totally exhausted all their legal remedies, but I am sure that they have totally exhausted their time, their money and their strength. I ask that the Attorney-General return to this matter, personally review the conduct of this case and renew the settlement offer which was made in 1987-but which was disgracefully withdrawn after the Commonwealth realised that the Faulkners lacked the finances to prosecute their case. This is a blot on the Commonwealth's record, and it should be remedied before it is too late. Freeman, Ms Cathy",132
188,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (7.45 p.m.)Earlier today, just before question time commenced, I had a brief opportunity to refer to the Aboriginal athlete, Cathy Freeman, who today won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, and who was attacked by the opposition for carrying an Aboriginal flag in her lap of honour. I had not seen the event at the time, but I have since caught up with the incident on television and would like to add to my comments. First, on behalf, I believe, of all decent Australians let me congratulate Cathy Freeman on her gold medal in the women's 400 metres. Cathy is the first Aboriginal woman to win any individual event in the Commonwealth Games history. There is no finer role model for Australian sports men and women, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal than Cathy Freeman. Her achievement is something of which all Australians should be proud. In particular, it is a moment that should and no doubt will be treasured by Australia's indigenous people for whom Cathy Freeman is a proud representative and ambassador. Cathy's victory is certainly something for Cathy and all Australians to celebrate, larly our indigenous people. But what do we hear from the federal opposition? The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in this plea chamber today, attacked Cathy Freeman for daring to carry an Aboriginal flag on her lap of honour. This is yet another typical example of the ignorance, insensitivity and downright prejudice displayed by many of those opposite towards indigenous Australians. Let me make a number of points about this. Firstly, as I said earlier, the spirit of these events, whether Commonwealth or Olympic Games, is first and foremost about individual sports people-the best sports people in th world-competing against each other, not so much about national representation, or who wins the most gold medals. So if an individual athlete chooses to carry an Aboriginal flag, a Union Jack, any other flag or no flag at all, that is surely his or her perfect individual right. We hear a lot from the Liberal Party about being the party of the individual but when it comes to the crunch, it fails the test every time on that issue. Secondly, Cathy Freeman did in fact carry both the Aboriginal and the Australian flag on her lap of honour. Surely under the unique circumstances involved in this special moment in history, this action was entirely appropriate-any reasonable person would say so. Thirdly, it is impossible to put into words, especially for a non-Aboriginal person like me, the significance of this achievement for indigenous Australians, and the pride they must feel. We hear a lot about symbolism, and of the importance of our current national flag for those Australians who fought for Australia in wars, or indeed for that matter, those Australians who represented their country in sport. We especially hear a lot of rhetoric from the opposition about this. So surely even the opposition can understand that Aboriginal people, too, have their symbols and that their flag means a lot to them. The sight of Cathy Freeman carrying that flag around the stadium would have swelled the hearts and brought tears to the eyes of many Australians of all backgrounds. But the opposition will never ever learn. Look what happened when the leader of the particuOpposition (Mr Downer) went to Central Australia. He made a complete fool of himself and the Liberal Party, on the question of Aboriginal issues-so much so that he has now been banished from any comment on any social policy. That is hardly surprising after his performance in Central Australia. But the opposition will never learn and it will never change. That is becoming increasingly obvious in this term of parliament since I have been here. The opposition will never learn and it will never change, and that is why the current federal Liberal Party will never govern Australia again. It is sad that this had to be political issue, but let us all congratulate Cathy Freeman on a fantastic achievement and one that we should all be very proud of. Nuclear Waste",133
189,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Once again this government has demonstrated its executive style and arrogant indifference to governing Australia through the imposition of a decision affecting an area near Woomera in my electorate without consulting the people of the region. That decision dealt with the dumping of nuclear waste. The federal government has called this a temporary waste site; however, I believe that the sudden decision taken without public consultation shows at best poor management and at worse very deceptive politics. In 1992 the government first called for public consultation on where to put the waste now stored at Lucas Heights. This year, the government named a number of potential sites. Woomera was one of those sites. Another site was a station in South Australia, Billa Kallina which is also in my electorate. Members of the House may be interested to know how the station owners found out that their land had been listed as a potential nuclear waste site. The first they heard was when they were contacted by the local radio st-tion and, unfortunately, that is the style of thiS government. The government pays little attention to what people are thinking and certainly does not ask them. This week we found out that, due to some court action in New South Wales, things apparently had to be speeded up. There was no time for public consultation. The nuclear waste must be removed from Lucas Heights within the next five months. So, circumventing the consultative process, the government promptly decided to temporarily store the waste at Woomera, apparently for a couple of years. My first question was: why can the government not find a permanent site for this waste within the next five months, as the court had obviously indicated that it had five months? I have been advised that it will take approximately a year for suitable below-ground storage to be built. Obviously, the site must have long-term stability and minimise risk to a people's safety. I have also been advised that the government has been stalling the Lucas Heights court case for some time. Surely there was enough time to develop a contingency plan and begin work on an alternative storage site. After all, the government had been working on this waste storage project since 1992. Yet this government has now found itself with only five months to do something with the nuclear waste. It is a bit like the government suddenly finding out this week that its shipping line had gone broke. I suppose the Australian people will clearly remember Mr Wran's $3,000 per day fee. Little wonder there are grave doubts about the government's management and business abilities. It still does not answer the question of whether the public could have been consulted about the temporary site. I believe that they could have been. The government had until 30 September under the existing formula. Obviously, this issue of nuclear waste is a highly sensitive one. Not many would like it ' in their own backyard. The term 'nuclear waste' has negative connotations and concern has been expressed in the Woomera region that this might have an impact on tourism in the region. The waste will be stored on the rocket range away from the township; however, in the words of a local, 'people do not read the fine print.' Woomera may now be associated with nuclear waste and undoubtedly will be. This is only one of the things which the people of Woomera could have considered about the site but they did not have the opportunity to have a say in the matter. Because of a court decision in New South Wales, South Australia has been forced to receive the waste on its doorstep. As the editorial in today's Adelaide Advertiser stated, 'This is not a rubbish tip for New South Wales.' The irony is that the government has had the capacity since 1992 to consult, find the permanent repository and deal with the issue. But its arrogance is too typical of its casual indifference to dealing with these individuals who just happen to be my constituents. Community Theatre",134
190,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I would like to address the House on the subject of community theatre and its valuable role in communicating to people from all walks of life on topics of vital interest as diverse as aspects of their working lives or dealing with terminal iIIness comment on political events of the day. I believe that this is an important subject to talk about in this place because it is through our art, music, poetry, literature, film and theatre traditions that we as a nation have established and will continue to develop for ourselves our own sense of self as a nation and as a culture. The role of the arts is fundamentally important in critical thinking and reflection about where we have come from and where we wish to go as a nation. The success of our Australian film industry over the last two decades provides strong evidence of that. As we move into the real issues in the debate concerning whether we should remain a constitutional democracy or become a republic, our own ideas about our identity will be examined and re-examined. We need to involve people from all walks of life in this process. Community theatre, which aims to take the theatre and issues to people who may not often experience theatre, is of great importance in this task. As Australians, we want to see our values and aspirations expressed in our own ways, by Australian voices on the screen and in the theatre. The federal government has supported one area of strong growth in the arts industry over the last decade and that is the growth of community theatre. In South Australia we are fortunate to have a first-class model for community theatre. The Junction Theatre Company is located at Thebarton in the western suburbs of Adelaide. Vital issues that affect the lives of working people and their families are a primary focus of Junction's work. The Junction Theatre Company has always demonstrated its commitment to the values of social justice and cultural diversity. Its aim is to create accessible, innovative theatre which recognises the diversity of Australian society. Since 1984 it has grown into one of Adelaide's leading theatre companies and has provided a decade of visionary theatre to a broad audience. By working closely with a wide range of progressive community based organisations, Junction Theatre has developed powerful and comic plays which reach sections of the community traditionally untouched by theatre. Low income earners form a high percentage to social of Junction's audience. Some examples of the political themes tackled by this theatre company include the difficulties and problems for families with disabled children in Square Pegs; the experiences of the terminally ill in This Dying Business; and domestic violence from both male and female perspectives in Flowers and Chocolates and The Keys to the Animal Room. Eight individual unions have financially supported Junction's work over the last decade by sponsoring various productions. This not only adds to the financial resources of the company but also indicates that there is substantial community support for Junction's work. For ten years now, Junction's work has been toured to workplaces, schools, hospitals, prisons and other community centres throughout Australia. The excellence exhibited by this group is demonstrated by the company having five plays nominated for the prestigious AWGIE awards since 1990. These awards are presented by the Australian Writers Guild in recognition of script excellence. This year, The Keys to the Animal Room, written by South Australian Peta Murray, was announced as the golden AWGIE winner. An indication of the very high calibre of script writing achieved by Junction Theatre is that The Keys to the Animal Room, in winning the golden AWGIE, was chosen as the best script over high profile opposition including the film scripts for The Sum of Us, Muriel's Wedding, and Sirens, television scripts for G.P., Police Rescue, Heartland, Mother and Son and all new main stage plays for 1993. This represents a great achievement for the Junction Theatre Company. In the past four years Junction has commissioner 12 new Australian plays, presented 362 performances, attracted an audience of over 39,000, employed 151 South Australians, generated box office income of $173,000-plus and earned non-state funding of $815,000. The federal government has provided this community theatre organisation with about 27.4 per cent of its funding. It is to be hoped that the level of funding from the state liberal government will continue. Compared to other sources of funding, state support has lagged behind, rising by only four per cent since 1989. Other sources of income have risen by 77 per cent. Junction's future looks very positive with new strategies for developing new audiences, product development and attempts to work in partnership with other Adelaide community theatre companies for industry development. Partnership with the community will be continued as it has always been a key to Junction's success. There is no doubt that community theatre companies such as Junction have an important role to play in Australian life.

(2) Will the owner-operator requirements now being considered by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in relation to Commonwealth fisheries allow companies to continue to own and exploit Commonwealth fishing licences.",172
210,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's first question is as folIows: (1) The Corporations Laws of the Commonwealth (which applies in relation to the ACT), the States and the Northern Territory operate as a single national Corporations Law. That national Corporations Law does not deal in any way with the rights of companies, company nominees, agents for the or trustees of companies, seeking to become involved in abalone fishing. (2) The honourable member's second question relates to matters within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Resources, the Hon David Beddall MP, who has advised that: (a) the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is not at the present time considering any general policy that would require the holder of a fishing concession to be the operator of the boat; (b) in areas of Commonwealth jurisdiction, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority may restrict the granting of access to abalone fishing in accordance with responsibilities and powers available to the Authority under the Fisheries Management Act 1991; and (c) the extent to which the Australian Fisheries Management Authority would seek to control who could hold, own or operate Commonwealth abalone fishing entitlements would be determined in accordance with any fishery management requirements applying from time to time in that fishery.

(3) How many complaints were the subject of inquiry and what was the result in each case.",173
211,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is well established in Australian jurisprudence that the external affairs power under the Constitution can be used by the Commonwealth to give effect to obligations under various international treaties, including certain obligations arising under ILO Conventions. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 allows the Commission to inquire into any act or practice that may constitute discrimination on the grounds covered by ILO Convention No. 111 and the Convention forms part of the Schedule to that Act. The Government is not considering making such discrimination unlawful but it is developing a national policy on discrimination in employment and occupation as required by the ILO Convention. (2) The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has advised me that it has received one complaint of discrimination in employment and occupation on the basis of social origin since 1986. (3) The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has advised me that the complaint is currently under investigation.

All weapons in new condition. Commercial manufacture not machine gun const."" in capital letters. (2) Is it a fact that having sampled the rifles and certified them as not being of machine gun construction, the AFP subsequently changed its mind and ruled that the rifles were of machine gun construction and therefore a prohibited import after Mr Owen had sold many of the rifles to clients: if so why. (3) Has the Government considered the considerable cost to Mr Owen caused by the actions of the APP and the ACS. (4) What are the specific reasons for the Government not compensating Mr Owen.",174

(6) What international (a) treaties, (b) conventions, (c) protocols and (d) other agreements are being considered for (i) signature and (ii) ratification by the Government. (7) What consideration does the Government give to the Constitution and existing State and federal laws when considering becoming a signatory to, or ratifying, international treaties, conventions, protocols and other agreements. (8) What process does the Government follow to gauge opposition to or support for an international treaty, convention, protocol or other agreement before signing or ratifying it. (9) Is the Minister able to say which countries when becoming a signatory to, or ratifying, an international treaty, convention, protocol or other agreement do so subject to a reservation that domestic laws or constitutional arrangements are not breached. (10) Why does the Government not follow a course similar to that followed by countries referred to in part (9). (11) Is it a fact that obligations assumed through international treaties, conventions, protocols and other agreements can erode Australian sovereignty and reduce national independence. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) and (2) The information sought by the honourable member has been published in the Australian Treaty Series (ATS) as follows: ATS 1971 No. 1 (all treaties, etc. to end of international (i) treaties, 1970); ATS 1972 No. 1 (treaties, etc. for 1971); ATS 1973 No. 1 (treaties, etc. for 1971 and 1972); ATS 1974 No. 1 (treaties, etc. for 1971, 1972 and 1973); ATS 1975 No. 1 (treaties, etc. for 1974); ATS 1975 No. 52 (treaties, etc. for 1975); ATS 1976-1993 No. 1 (treaties, etc. for 19761993 on a year-by-year basis); Monthly lists for 1994 have been published in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade magazine ""Insight"". A consolidated list of all Australian treaties to 31 December 1989 was published as ATS 1989 No. 38. (3) In Australian practice (which conforms to international practice), ""treaties"", ""conventions"", ""protocols"" and other international ""agreements'"" are all binding in international law: there is no legal distinction between them. They are referred to generically as ""treaties"". Depending upon the provisions of each treaty, countries (known internationally as ""States"") may become parties either by signature alone, signature followed by ratification, or accession (the last is a single step, sometimes described as acceptance, approval or adherence). When Australia is bound by a treaty, it is obliged under international law to carry out the provisions of that treaty. If Australia consents to be bound by a treaty before the treaty enters into force, it is not bound by the treaty's provisions until general entry into force although from the moment it consents to be bound, Australia is obliged not to do anything to frustrate the object and purpose of the treaty. Similarly, once Australia has signed a treaty, it is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, unless and until it decides not to become bound by the treaty and makes known that decision. (4) Obligations assumed through international treaties, conventions, protocols and other agreements cannot override the Constitution, or the federal system established by the Constitution. Any impact of treaties and other international agreements on the current division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States for particular matters can only occur if the Commonwealth Parliament chooses to assert responsibilities for a matter pursuant to the legislative powers available to it under the Constitution. (5) See answer to parts (1) and (2). (6) The information sought by the honourable member is contained in the 20 June 1994 edition of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade publication Insight. (7) As part of its consideration whether to sign or ratify international treaties, conventions, cols and other agreements an examination is normally made by the Commonwealth government of the adequacy of existing legislation, whether Federal or State, to enable compliance with the particular obligations. As is recognised in the existing Principles and Procedures for Commonwealth-State Consultation on Treaties, the Commonwealth ""will consider relying on State legislation where the treaty affects an area of particular concern to the States and this course is consistent with the national interest and the effective and timely discharge of treaty obligations. However, the Commonwealth does not accept that it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to commit itself in a general way not to legislate in areas that are constitutionally subject to Commonwealth power"". (8) The Government regularly consults the States and Territories and interested groups about whether it should become a party to a treaty and on what terms. The States and Territories are advised of treaty negotiations in which Australia is involved every six months via the Commonwealth-State Standing Committee on Treaties. On request, States and Territories are given detailed information on specific matters. However, the Standing Committee, which is essentially a notification mechanism, is not used to conduct Commonwealth-State/Territory negotiations on specific treaties. Consultations with the States and Territories on specific treaties occurs through a variety of mechanisms-Ministerial Councils and associated meetings of officials are often used. Industry groups and other non-governmental organisations are consulted on treaties in which they may have an interest. This consultation provides the opportunity not only for gauging domestic support for specific treaties but also for shaping the Government's approach to particular negotiations. (9) From time to time, some States (including Australia, the United States and Canada) make unilateral statements about treaties which indicate that their obligations will be implemented in a particular way, in accordance with relevant constitutional arrangements. These statements rarely take the form of a formal reservation, and are usually simply an indication that a sub-federal administration (such as a provincial government) will in fact implement the treaty obligations, which has no effect on the extent of the obligations imposed on the State in question. I am not aware of any countries that make a practice of making a reservation of the kind referred to. (10) See parts (4) and (9). There is no need to make such reservations, since treaty obligations cannot override the Constitution, or the federal protosystem established by the Constitution. Nevertheless, consideration is given in appropriate cases to the making of a statement at the time Australia becomes a party to a treaty to signal that Australian States will playa role in the implementation of the treaty. (11) No. When Australia signs or becomes party to a treaty, that is an exercise of sovereignty. International committees or other bodies established by treaties have no power to change Australian laws or policies, even if Australia is a party to the treaties which establish them. Changes to Australian law can only be effected by decisions of Australian (Commonwealth, State or Territory) parliaments or courts, and changes to Australian policies can only be introduced by Australian governments.

Such items include, for example, Fringe Benefits Tax and Comcare premium payments. National Health and Medical Research Council (Question No. 1286) Mr Hicks asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 9 June 1994: (1) How did the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) come into existence. (2) What is the role of the NHMRC in the community. (3) What are the (a) names and (b) qualifications of the members of the NHMRC. (4) How and by whom are members chosen. (5) How often does the NHMRC meet. (6) Is an ongoing assessment of its deliberations available; if so, how may it be obtained. (8) To whom is the NHMRC accountable. (9) What is the cost structure of the NHMRC, including salaries and travel costs. (10) Who pays for the NHMRC's expenditure. (11) Is the NHMRC subjected to quality assurance.",179
220,Dr LAWRENCE,AUSTRAC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The NHMRC was reconstituted as a statutory authority in 1992 by the enactment of the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 (the Act). The NHMRC was originally established in 1936 and operated under an Order in Council before the Act came into force. (2) The role of the NHMRC is to advise the Australian community on the achievement and maintenance of the highest practicable standards of individual and public health and to foster research in the interests of improving those standards. (3) The membership of the NHMRC is based on categories defined in the Act. The current membership is as follows: (a) the Chairperson-Professor RA Smallwood; (b) the Secretary to the Council- Mr RWells; (c) the Chairperson of each of the NHMRC's Principal Committees. They are: (i) Australian Health Ethics CommitteeProfessor D Chalmers; (ii) Medical Research Committee-Professor J Whitworth; (iii) Public Health Research and Development Committee-Professor C Ewan; (iv) National Health Advisory Committeeappointment pending; (v) Strategic Planning Committee-Emeritus Professor J Ross. (d) an officer of each State or Territory health instrumentality nominated by the Minister having responsibility for the instrumentality: (i) NSW-Dr G Rubin; (ii) VIC-Dr C Brook; (iii) QLD-Dr D Lange; (iv) SA-Dr K Kirke; (v) WA-Dr A Penman; (vi) TAS-Dr. J Sparrow; (vii) ACT-Dr C Mead; (viii) NT - Dr M Dunjey. (e) an officer of the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health nominated by the Minister-appointment pending; (f) a person having knowledge of the health needs of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islander persons, nominated by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission- Mr D Rathman; (g) a person with expertise in health care training-Professor C Ewan; (h) a person with knowledge of professional medical standards and expertise in post-graduate medical training-Professor N Saunders; (i) a person with a background in, and knowledge of, the medical profession-Dr B Nelson; (j) a person with a background in, and knowledge of, the nursing profession-Ms E Percival; (k) an eminent scientist who has knowledge of public health research and medical research issues and who has no current connection with the NHMRC-Professor A Basten; (I) a person with a background in, and knowledge of, the trade union movement-Ms P Staunton; (m) a person with a background in, and knowledge of, business- Mr R Kelly; (n) a person with a background in, and knowledge of, consumer issues-Dr BR Walker; (0) a person with knowledge of the needs of users of social welfare services-Dr JF Hausfeld; (p) a person with knowledge of environmental issues-Ms A Reeves; (q) a person with a background in, and knowledge of, public health issues-Dr. J Hall; and (r) no more than two other persons with expertise relevant to the functions of the NHMRCappointments pending. (4) Council members, other than the Secretary, are appointed by the Minister after seeking nominations from prescribed bodies related to the expertise categories set out in (3). In respect of the appointment of the Chairperson, the Minister is required to consult with other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference before making an appointment. The Secretary to the Council is designated by the Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health. (5) The full Council usually meets twice a year, in June and November. It is supported in its work by an Executive Committee, Principal Committees, working committees and expert panels. The meeting patterns of these bodies are dictated by the work requirements of the Council. (6) Ongoing assessment of Council deliberations is available via the printed Session reports produced after each Council session and via published reports, advice and recommendations arising from NHMRC consideration of issues. NHMRC's current body of published work is contained in its publication entitled ""List of Current Publications and Update on NHMRC Activities"". (8) The Act provides for the Council to be accountable to the Minister and to the Parliament. (9) The resourcing of the NHMRC is an integral part of the functions of the Department of Human Services and Health and there is not separate accounting for it. However, it is estimated that in 1992-93 the resourcing of the NHMRC would have cost approximately $7 million including $2.2 million for salaries and $2.2 million for committee support. A broad range of oncosts account for the remaining estimated expenditure. (10) Funds are appropriated through the Department of Human Services and Health. (11) The processes adopted by the Council in undertaking the development of recommendations, guidelines and advice build in quality assurance. The usual practice is for recommendations, guidelines and advice to be developed by working committees, reviewed by Principal Committees and then submitted to the Council for endorsement. Further, the Act provides for the Council to be informed by a two stage consultation process before issuing guidelines or making recommendations that it is intended should be given legal effect in or Territory. Royal Australian Navy (Question No. 1296) Mr Taylor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 June 1994: Are two ex-US Navy (UN) landing ships tank (LSTs) being transferred to the RAN; if so, (a) when and where will the transfer take place, (b) what is the total acquisition cost including ships' company travel and accommodation costs, Australian structural modifications and logistic support, what were the UN complements of the vessels, (d) how will the RAN complements vary from the UN's, (e) what are the expected RAN (i) service life and (ii) running costs of the LSTs, (t) will the vessels be modified to improve their helicopter carrying capacity; if so, (i) what will be the carrying capacity and (ii) who will carry out the modifications, (g) what will be the vessels' roles in the Australian Defence Force and (h) will the Army assume part of the budgetary provision for the vessels' running costs.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. On 16 December 1993, the Government approved the acquisition of two Newport class ships, US Saginaw and US Fairfax County, which are being decommissioned by the United States Navy. (a) Subject to the US Government's approval, it was originally intended to decommission the first ship from the US Navy and commission it into RAN service on 28 June 1994 at Norfolk, Virginia. Australia was advised some two weeks prior to the ceremony that there was a delay in consideration by the US Senate Armed Services Committee. As a consequence, Congressional and Presidential approval is now unlikely before August 1994. As soon as those approvals are received, arrangements will be made for the first vessel to proceed to Australia with a RAN crew. On present planning, the second vessel will be brought to Australia by a US crew prior to commissioning into the RAN. (b) Total acquisition cost for both ships, including travel and accommodation, logistic support and planned future modifications is some $124 million at December 1993 prices. (c) The UN ships' complement varies but is in the order of 250. (d) The RAN complement will be approximately 180. The reduction is made possible by the removal of deck equipment which is not required for the a State intended use of the ships by the RAN and by differences in training and manning policies. (e) (i) The LSTs were originally designed for an active service life of 35 years. The ships are now 22 years old but are robust and well maintained and are assessed as having a further 20 years of service life remaining. (ii) Based on UN experience, running costs for the two vessels are estimated to be in the order of $50 million per year. This is approximately the same as the combined running cost of HMAS Jervis Bay and HMAS Tobruk which the LSTs will replace. (t) Both ships will be modified to increase their (c) current aviation carrying capability. (i) After modification both ships will have three helicopter landing spots available for Black Hawk helicopters, two of which can be used by Sea King helicopters. A hangar on at least one ship will allow stowage for four Black Hawks or alternatively, a minimum of two Sea King helicopters or one Chinook helicopter. (ii) the modifications will be carried out by Australian industry under a contract to be awarded by open tender. (g) The primary tasks of the two ships in the ADF are to: (i) conduct sea and aviation training for RAN junior officers and sailors; (ii) deRloy and support ADF land force operations in the defence of Australia and Australian interests, including medical support; and (iii) support ADF forces and other Australian Government agencies when deployed in protection and evacuation of Australian nationals in the region in the event of serious civil disturbance. Secondary tasks of the ships include: (i) support disaster relief operations both in Australia and within the region; (ii) provide medical support to RAN Fleet units; and (iii) support United Nations operations. (h) No. New South Wales South Coast Labour (Question No. 1300) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 28 June 1994: Has his Department provided funding for positions on the NSW South Coast Labour Council since 1991; if so, (a) what funding, (b) which positions in the council were funded, (c) who occupied the positions, and (d) what reports have the persons responsible for the funded positions provided to his Department since 1991. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training has provided funding to the NSW South Coast Labour Council through Office of Labour Market Adjustment Regional funding. This amounted to $40,000 for an initiative which commenced in September 1992 and ended in September 1993 and $48,000 for the next stage of that initiative which commenced in June 1994 and will continue until June 1995. (b) The position funded on both occasions was a Union Liaison/Project Officer who is effectively introducing new employment to the region and assisting long term unemployed to access that employment. (c) Mr Frank Jackson occupied the position on both occasions. (d) Mr Jackson provided regular progress reports on a quarterly basis during the initial funding period. An audited statement of the moneys received and the purposes for which they were spent was also provided. Mr Jackson is required to provide monthly reports to DEET staff during the second period of funding. Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees (Question No. 1301) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 28 June 1994: Has his Department provided funding for positions in the Port Kembla, NSW, branch of the Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees; if so, (a) which positions in the council were funded, (b) who occupied the positions and (c) what reports have the persons responsible for the funded positions provided to his Department since 1991.",180
221,Mr BRERETON,AUSTRAC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. Council (a) One position of Ethnic Liaison Officer was funded under the Migrant Workers' Participation Scheme, for the Port Kembla, New South Wales Branch of the Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees (FIMEE). (b) Mr lice Musarevski was engaged by FIMEE to occupy the position. (c) FIMEE has fulfilled contractual obligations for a project which ran from 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993 by providing quarterly progress reports, a final report and an audit report. FIMEE has also provided two quarterly progress reports for a 12 months project which commenced 22 December 1993. Pensions: Effect of Un realised Capital Gains (Question No. 1310) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 29 June 1994: (I) How many pensioners in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay have lost (i) all or (ii) part of their pensions administered by his Department as a result of the Government's treatment of unreaIised capital gains as income and the calculation of rates of return on their investments for the purposes of the pensions income and assets test. (2) What is the net saving to his Department of the new provisions and the cancellation of part or all of the pensions of recipients in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay. (3) How many extra staff have been required to implement the new provisions in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information requested by the honourable member regarding the effect of the Government's treatment of unrealised capital gains as income in terms of cancellations of pensions, rate changes, program savings and staff resources is not available by federal electoral division. The answer to the House of Representatives Question No 1077 on 27 June 1994 provided information on the Australia-wide effect of this policy but I am not prepared to authorise the use of the considerable resources that would be required to extract and collate the necessary information in response to this question. Pensions: Effect of Un realised Capital (Question No. 1313) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 29 June 1994: (1) How many pensioners in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay have lost (i) all or (ii) part of their pensions administered by his Department as a result of the Government's treatment ofunrealised capital gains as income and the calculation of rates of returns on their investments for the purposes of the pensions income and assets test. (2) What is the net saving to his Department of the new provisions and the cancellation of part or all of the pensions of recipients in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay. (3) How many extra staff have been required to implement the new provisions in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department has advised me that its management information system does not enable it to provide this level of information about service pensioners with managed investments/shares. The Department conducts quarterly updates for all pensioners with shares and managed investments in order to take account of the latest rates and to reassess pensions accordingly. Because a range of changes such as Consumer Price Index increases, rates of return changes, rent assistance increases, etc are actioned on the same payday it is not possible to identify changes relating to one specific aspect such as shares/managed investments. However, the January 1994 quarterly update did not include any significant changes other than . shares/managed investments so it is possible to use these figures to estimate the numbers of pensioners in the electoral divisions nominated. It is known that the total number of service pensioners in each electorate in question is: (i) Fisher 5,148; (ii) Fairfax 3,936 and (iii) Wide Bay 3,756, a total of 12,840 or 3.6% of the national service pensioner population. Of the total service pension population: 0.2 % of all service pensioners with shares or managed investments had their pensions cancelled as a result of the assessment of unrealised capital gains on their investments; and 16.5% of all cases with managed investments or shares received a reduction in their service pension of $7.30 per fortnight. Extrapolating the population figure for these Gains electorates, assuming pensioners in these electorates are representative of the national trend and comparing it to the national figures arising from the January 1994 update of Departmental records, it is possible to estimate the number of pensioners living in Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay affected by the January update. It would therefore be reasonable to expect that as a result of the assessment of unrealised capital gains on their managed investments and/or shares at the January 1994 update, that of the pensioners living in Fisher, Fairfax or Wide Bay: (i) less than 25 or 0.2 % would have their pensions cancelled; and (ii) less than 2120 or 16.5% would have lost part of their pension. (2) Exact savings figures are not available as reassessments of service pensioner entitlements often correspond to changes in financial circumstances unrelated to the assessment of unrealised capital gain. However, the Department estimates savings for 1993/94 resulting from changes to the assessment of shares and Managed investments will total $7.24M. It therefore follows that as 3.6% of pensioners live in the electorates of Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay, then on a percentage basis, $260,000 of the total $7.24M relates to these electorates. (3) No new staff have been specifically employed in Fisher, Fairfax or Wide Bay. Nationally the Department allocated $787,000 for system programof return ming changes to accommodate the provisions introduced in 1993. 1.6 staff were allocated to oversee implementation of the new provisions for managed investments and shares at a cost of $60,000 per annum. Ongoing costs consist of one additional staff in NSW to administer the new share database at a cost of $40,000 per annum. Australian Protective Service (Question No. 1315) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 29 June 1994: Has the Australian Protective Service in Queensland bought any playground equipment; if so, (a) why, (b) what items were bought, (c) from whom were they bought, (d) what was the cost and (e) where will it be located.",182
222,Mr KERR,AUSTRAC,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised of the following answer: No. The Australian Protective Service has not bought any playground equipment in Queensland or in any other state or territory. However the APS, in its role in managing the day-today operations of Immigration Detention Centres at Maribyrnong (Question No. 1214, Hansard H. of R.

(3) What total sum is forgone annually by pensioners who fail to lodge a form for a full-rate single pension upon the death of a spouse. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As at 18 July 1994 there were 3,825 pensioners with the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), receiving half the married rate of pension. (2) Approximately 3,240 would be eligible for the single rate pension from DSS. Nil are eligible for single rate pension from DVA at this point in time. (Note: From 20 March 1995, widowed pensioners will no longer have to transfer to receive the single rate of pension from DSS. The higher single rate of pension will replace the married rate from the payday 30 March 1995. Those pensioners who choose to remain with DVA will no longer be financially disadvantaged).

Tourists: Tertiary Studies (Question No. 1334) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Emgovern- ployment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 30 June 1994: Did the University of New South Wales contend that demanding to see passports or birth certificates before enrolling 24,000 local students would be a huge administrative burden which could not be borne under present funding; if so, has the Government accepted this as an argument against implementing a means of eliminating the fraudulent pursuit of tertiary studies by tourists. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am not aware that the University of New South Wales contends that requiring all students to present a passport or birth certificate before enrolment would not be possible under present funding. The University has confirmed that it has made no public statement to this effect. In order to meet the conditions upon which the Commonwealth provides funding to higher education institutions under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, institutions must satisfy themselves that, in all cases, students have the correct enrolment status. It is a matter for each higher education institution to decide how best to fulfil to ensure that students are enrolled according to the correct status. Tourists: Tertiary Studies (Question No. 1335) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 30 June 1994: (1) Has the University of New South Wales stated that there is no express requirement for institutions to check the residency status of those who claim to be students. (2) Is the University denying an obligation to prevent the illegal undertaking of studies by tourists. (3) What measures is his Department taking in cooperation with other agencies and universities to ensure that universities are involved in preventing the improper use of Commonwealth funds allocated to tertiary studies. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1),(2) I am not aware that the University of New South Wales has stated that there is no requirement for it to check the residency status of its students or that it has denied an obligation to prevent tourists undertaking studies illegally. The University has confirmed that it has made no public stateits obligation ment to that effect. (3) All higher education institutions were reminded recently of their obligation under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to ensure that students are enrolled according to the correct status. For example, where a person applies for enrolment as a HECS liable student on the basis of permanent resident status, institutions must verify that status against a list of visa classes provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and set out in the Commonwealth's Administrative Guidelines Manual for higher education institutions on HECS and Fees.",184
