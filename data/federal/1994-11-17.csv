2,Mr LES SCOTT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of this package of taxation bills which covers a very wide range of concerns. I will, however, concentrate on just a few subjects that are dealt with in these bills. The bills have been around for a while. I am sure other members are pleased to have the opportunity to debate these bills today. In Australia we have been witnessing over the last 12 months an impressive economic recovery, thanks to this government's responsible economic management, I would suggest-a recovery that has seen nearly 200,000 jobs created in the last year, economic growth travelling at or near 4.5 per cent, productivity increases at historic highs, corporate profitability higher than it has been in many years, and the lowest inflation rate in decades allowing business to grow and prosper. It is certainly important that business take advantage of the opportunities available to it. Interest rates and the movements in interest rates will always be a subject of debate. It is inevitable that interest rates will rise or fall as the demand for funds grows or declines, and interest rates are affected accordingly. There is a lot of good news for growth and prosperity in Australia at the current timeno-one can deny that-despite the efforts of those opposite who go around scaremongering at every opportunity and playing down Australia's prosperity instead of getting behind it and promoting it. Whilst it is undoubtedly good news, more can always be done to promote growth and jobs. They are important to all of us, especially those less fortunate job seekers in our community. They are always a major priority for members on this side of the House. Many of the long-term unemployed are already being assisted through the various government initiatives contained in the Working Nation white paper and will continue to be assisted where that assistance is needed. They will not be thrown on the scrap heap like some members opposite would propose. One of the most pleasing aspects of the initiatives in Working Nation is that they place an emphasis on finding long-term, selfsustaining jobs for these people-jobs that will be there for many years-allowing them to plan and build a future for themselves. A great emphasis is placed on providing jobs in emerging or, in some cases, completely new industries that will take advantage of new markets that are only just being identified. These jobs will be there for many years because they have a commercial future. This sort of assistance is to be encouraged and this emphasis on providing jobs for a commercial future should be applauded. Although employment is increasing to the point where we now have more than eight million people in work, more can always be done. I always emphasise that point. In particular, providing initiatives for industry in regional areas of Australia to invest and grow is very important. The amendments to the regulations applying to pooled development funds in this legislation will encourage more regional small and medium sized enterprises to invest and grow and therefore provide jobs in regional areas. In Working Nation, the government announced that the rate of tax on income derived by a pooled development fund from its investments in small and medium sized enterprises will be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. This change,which is designoo to increase the attract.iveness of the PDF program to investors, will apply to the assessment of PDFs for the 1994-95 year and later years of income. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) will divide the taxable income of the. PDF into two components. Income from investing in small and medium sized enterprises WIll be taxed at 15 per. cent, and the income from other sources will be taxed at 25 per cent. Simple rules will allocate . the allowable deductions and the capital gains and losses of a PDF between the two components of taxable income. This legislation seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the rate at which income derived by a pooled development fund, or PDF as it is often referred to, from its investments in small and medium sized enterprises is actually taxed. The amendments cover a range of areas but the main ones are: providing for intercorporate dividend rebate allowable on dividends derived by a PDF to be calculated at the rate of tax applicable to the small and medium sized enterprises component of taxable income; setting out the rules for calculating the two components of PDF income---SME income component and unregulated investment component; making specific provision for the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses. of a PDF in calculating each component of taxable income; and reducing the concessional tax rate for PDFs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in small and medium sized enterprises. These measures follow some of the other initiatives designed to encourage PDFs to invest in small and medium sized enterprises developed earlier this year as part of. the legislation .that gave effect to the PDF initiarules tives in Working Nation. One of these was the removal of the restriction that PDFs may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises. That was a good initiative that will lead to greater investment in SMEs by the pooled development funds. These further amendments moved by the legislation we are debating today will enhance the attractiveness of SMEs as possible areas for investment by the pooled development funds. It is very encouraging to see these attempts being made to make better use of the PDFs. Pooled development funds were introduced in the One Nation statement of February J992 by the Prime Minister (Me Keating). The legislation has two objects. First, it is to establish a scheme under which companies and their shareholders can qualify for certain tax concessions. Secondly, it is to encourage the provision of funds to small and medium sized Australian companies. Under the legislation, eligible corporations may be registered as pooled development funds to provide funds to corp()rations with assets not exceeding $30 million. To qualify as a PDF, a company has to comply with a number of criteria, including that it be incorporated and will implement capital raising and capital investment plans. The objective of these changes is to encourage more long-term investment in small and medium sized enterprises. The reason for the changes was expressed in Working Nation in the following way. It states: Past attempts to increase the provision of equity for SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) have not proved to be sufficiently effective. In particular, the Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) have not been attractive to inve-tors. This legislation will try to overcome that problem. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has also said in the Pitst that the PDF program has not had the anticipated. impact on creating a pool of investment funds as only $35 million has been raised by PDFs., This is because there is a view that the incenti,ve available under the programÂ· is not sufficient to compensate for the risk associated with this class of investment aiid because some. of the operational have been seen as being overly restrictive. The sentiments expressed above have also been' echoed by the chairperson of the Pooled Development Funds Registration Board, who stated in the annual report for 1992-93: In fact, the PDPs have reported great difficulty in generating investor interest given the limited incentives that the Program offers. There is no incentive for superannuation funds to invest in a PDP and there has been a general lack of enthusiasm from banks and large corporations who obviously perceive the incentives to be insufficient. Whilst everyone accepts that POFs could certainly have done better over the years, I think it is wrong to use such strong language to condemn them out of hand. Indeed, in the Senate a few months ago Senator Short, in one of the few examples of dissent over the POF amendment, used the term 'abject failure' to describe the POFs. As I said, few people would deny that POFs have not been as successful as hoped. Any incentive designed to give small and medium sized enterprises a helping hand cannot, in all fairness, be called an abject failure. Certainly the incentives to invest could have been greater, and the government acknowledges this. But I would remind Senator Short that anyone can be wise in hindsight. In any case, the purpose of this bill is to offer greater incentives for POFs to invest in the small and medium sized enterprise areas. The lack of incentive to invest in the SMEs is not related solely to the tax on profits. The Kelty report, for example, found that in the private sector the size and nature of the taxation benefit and the restrictions on what POFs can invest in are blamed for the lack of success. Further, it states that private investors and money managers also complain that the taxation benefits offered are not significant and that benefits are structured so that investors do not receive them until the pooled development funds begin earning money, which sometimes is five years or more after their establishment. The incentives that this bill offers include the reduction of the tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the profits of such funds and their investment in small and medium sized enterprises. That is the core of it. This is sure to stimulate further activity in the small business sector, which is quite often rightly described as the backbone of the economy. It is a very important area, which i I am sure everyone in this place acknowledges. The majority of new jobs that come about as a result of the recovery will be created in this sector. It is hoped that the changes proposed in this bill, and the other POF legislation passed earlier this year, will contribute to this. For example, the raising of the limit to $50 million means that the pooled development regime may be opened up to companies too small to raise equity capital by way of a public float. In addition, the requirement that pooled development funds invest no more than a total of five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises has been abolished. This will encourage pooled development funds in sunrise and other high-tech industries. In addition to this, POFs will now be entitled to invest up to 30 per cent of their capital in a particular investee company, whereas previously it was only 20 per cent. This move will make the due diligence costs to POFs prior to investment more efficient. There can be little doubt that these changes will lead to more and more money being invested in small and medium sized enterprises from the pooled development funds, and the particular benefits to flow from this to regional areas will be substantial. Mr Speaker, most of us are representatives of regional electorates, including yourself, and it is always a great priority for us to focus on the needs of regions. Speaking as a representative of a regional electorate, and also coming from the banking and finance sector, I can certainly vouch for the fact that raising equity and start-up capital is much more difficult for a regional enterprise than it is for a major metropolitan one. That is simply because of the size alone and often the isolation and lack of understanding of what regions can actually offer, and some of Bill Kelty's work has really focused on the need to promote our regions a lot more. I can never emphasise that enough in this place. The reason for this is obvious: there isa limit to the level of debt that any enterprise can bear; but the - profit margin for regional enterprises, isolated, as they often are from large consum-r populations, tends to be much slimmer in the majority of cases, making access to equity capital all the more important for them. PDFs have been made more adaptable to regional areas in order to address this problem. I spoke before about the need to make the jobs recovery substantial not only in terms of numbers, as it already is, but also in terms of sustainability. The jobs have to be in industries that will still be 'going concerns' years from now. By necessity, that means that some of those jobs will be in industries that are only in their early stages at the moment or perhaps the opportunities have not even been identified yet. As we continue toÂ· expand the operations in the Asia-Pacific region, many opportunities will come up for those small and medium sized enterprises. These new and emerging industries have the potential to create many new jobs in the private sector, a significant proportion of which will require skills in technological fields which are very important .fields that we should take every opportunity to expand in the future and certainly at the current time. - ut, traditionally, banks and investment houses have been reluctant to take a risk on businesses like these and provide them with start-up capital and finance through those important early years,. although there are encouraging signs that that attitude is changing. It is one area that certainly must change if we are going to help our industries grow and provide those much needed jobs. Of course, this makes smalland medium-sized enterprises perfect investment vehicles for the pooled development funds. They are the logical ones-particularly the SMEs in regional areas, as I mentioned before-and they must be supported. One of the most attractive characteristics of the PDFs is that they allow individuals to invest in the region they live and work in. Those enterprises and PDFs belong to them, which is very important. They also tend to be better focused than the large financial institualso tions on the needs of smaller communities. Their smaller size and regional emphasis makes it easier for regional development organisations to develop and sustain projects suitable to the needs of regional areas. On Friday, 4 November, I had the pleasure of officially opening such a project in my electorate. In that capacity, I represented the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). I refer to the new Ipswich Transition Centre, which is a pilot project that is quite unique. It is quite well managed and well run. I expect that it will develop in other parts of Australia before too long. The minister has taken a great interest in the project. I am sure that the unemployed in my electorate of Oxley thank him for his substantial backing of employment initiatives in and around the city of Ipswich. The transition centre is a unique concept in training for the long-term unemployed. The great part about it is that it is actually working. The participants in the scheme are actually identifying gaps in the market where particular products are not available either locally or in Australia, and they are then producing the goods to fill those gaps. All of them are long-term unemployed. This sort of training is giving them not only the skills they need but also the industry they need. These people are actually creating new domestic industries by concentrating on import replacement and supplying the goods those industries need. The centre is already having a lot of success and has secured commercial markets for its products, which include sophisticated manufactured equipment for the medical field, particularly medical aids for the handicapped, such as wheelchairs and things we often just take for granted. These people are picking up opportunities and running with them. I congratulate them for their initiative in this regard. But the great thing is that the people at the centre did not say, 'Somebody is already doing that.' They said, 'We can do it better and do it locally,' and that is what has made this a great success story. As a result of this attitude, the centre is not only adding to Australia's productivity but producing skilled workers, many of whom have already found employment in the private sector even before they have finished their time at the centre. I have spoken to people there who have been out of work for up to two or three years and who are now developing their own. enterprises and getting back into work. In some cases, skilled tradesmen who previously could not find employment are being picked up by the centre, being motivated and are developing' their own enterprises and creating their own employment. So it has been a great success. The centre would be a perfect investment for a pooled development fund. I will certainly be doing everything I can to encourage the centre to get involved with pooled development funds. With these PDFs;'hopefully the management will deCide to expand and take up opportunities in future operations. They will give theÂ· necessary commercial backing to the transition centre; After a time, it should become self-sufficient, but it will become self-sufficient only if it gets that support from a good investment finance provider. I am sure that the pooled development funds can actually provide that for it. The bill also contains amendments to give effect to the research and development initiatives contained in Working Nation, which is another fine incentive by this government. The first change is that the shading-in rules, which currently apply where a company's research and development expenditure is between $20,000 and $50,000, will be eliminated. The full 150 per cent deduction will be allowable for 1994-95 and later years of income where total research and development expenditure is more than $20,000. A second amendment will allow certain expenditure incurred on research and development activities conducted outside Australia to be eligible for concession by, firstly, amending the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred on research and development activities conducted outside Australia that have been given prior approval by the Industry Research and Development Board; and, secondly, by amending the Industry Research and Development Act to give the board the power to approve proposed overseas research and development activities of companies that meetÂ· certain eligibility criteria. This will give the board power to develop public guidelines specifying the criteria that companies must satisfy for their activities to be approved by the board. i A third amendment will make changes to the Industry Research and Development Act to reduce the expenditure threshold from $1 million to $500,000 for companies registering jointly on or after 1 July 1994 with respect to the proposed research and development projects starting on that date. This change will facilitate the use of significant structures for smaller research and development projects, which is expected to benefit small and medium sized companies. These amendments before us today are extremely important. This government has put a lot of emphasis on restructuring and making our taxation system more adaptable to our companies in Australia to promote employment and industry growth. I was speaking yesterday to. somebody about the tax law improvement project which is going to streamline our tax system. This government is bringing a lot of things together to ensure that.we have a fair and equitable tax system in this country.",11
3,Mr WAKELIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Today we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994 and cognate bills: the Income Tax (Former Complying Superannuation' Funds) Bill, the Income Tax (Former Non-resident Superannuation Funds) Bill, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), the shadow Treasurer, last Tuesday spoke about the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman standing up for taxpayers and about how the Ombudsman's office had provided considerable assistance to 'persecuted taxpayers dealing with zealotry in the tax office'. The issue of taxation brings out an adversarial role in many people-in most of us perhaps at some time or another. Most importantly the tax office has to be seen to be fair. It has to be seen to conduct its affairs with due regard to the rights of individuals. In the last few days we have heard a lot in this place about the rights of individuals. I wonder whether we should. not apply the similar standards to the rights of individuals in the payment of taxation. There is great enthusiasm about defending people's privacy and making sure there is a whole range of civil rights out there, but when it comes to the payment of tax it seems that the Ombudsman's office is used more than would seem reasonable. The coalition does not oppose the measures contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) relating to credit unions, pooled development funds, research and development activities, the rates of interest for calculating the superannuation guarantee charge and the development allowance. The deficit deferral tax imposed by the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill is consequent on changes to the instalment arrangements for the payment of company tax. The provisions relating to non-complying superannuation funds are significant improvements, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acknowledged that fact. But the provisions governing employee share acquisition schemes are a somewhat different matter. The issue that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition brought out on Tuesday bears repeating. This bill will add another 28 pages of legislation to the FBT Assessment Act. Apparently the first step in simplifying an act is to add another 28 pages-extend the net before you can even get around to simplifying it. We hear constant criticism of the tax act. I am sure all members receive this criticism from time to time. The tax act is increasingly complex, and I have just given a very good example of this: in order to simplify the tax act, we have added another 28 pages of legislation. Let us consider the amount of revenue raised through the FBT. In 1986 the FBT raised $535 million. In 1994-95 it is forecasted to be $3.2 billion. It seems quite anomalous to me that a tax that was designed initially to tax some unreasonable perks has suddenly become such a milch cow for the government. Apparently, the FBT results in wins and losses for government. The FBT on parking was expected to raise $90 million, but it raised only $32 million. My understanding is that Treasury has moved to abolish the FBT on parking. I wish to raise the issue of national savings via employee share acquisition schemes, superannuation, et cetera. The FitzGerald report alerted the nation to its appalling savings record, particularly by historical standards. If we as a nation wish to control our flow of money in such a way that an imbalance in the system results in too much of it going to Treasury and not enough remaining in individuals' hands, then that ultimately takes away incentive for individuals to save and it brings to the fore the whole issue of our national savings program and investment for the future. One does not have to hold an honours degree in economics to understand our weakness in this area. The government acknowledges it; the previous Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, acknowledged it. But nothing happens. The taxation juggernaut still rolls on. It has been a long time since this country has come to terms with the correct balance between investment, revenue and savings. I do not think anyone can put better what has happened in recent times than former senator Peter Walsh. Most of us would have seen the article in this week's Australian Financial Review headed 'Banana road to republic'. I will quote a few dot points because they are worth remembering. His first paragraph is a real gem: Australia is on track to become the world's most politically correct banana republic. He says: Â· The current account deficit is blowing outprobably to 5 per cent of GDP or more. Â· The Budget-which according to One Nation's slack fiscal objectives was supposed to be in surplus next year-is now projected to be still in deficit by 1 per cent of GDP the year after next. Â· That permissive target recedes every time (about every second month recently) ... Â· Largely because of slack fiscal policy, interest rates have been rising. The lO-year bond rateand we all know thisis higher in real terms than it was in 1989-90. Peter Walsh also talks about the increase in the Australian dollar. Whilst acknowledging that it is perhaps contrary to the view that we are heading towards banana republicanism, he warns us that the dollar can crash just as quickly as it rises. In last week's Australian a small headline appeared, 'Forecast warns tax rises may be needed', under the name of George Megalogenis. The article says that the pressure on the federal government's budget strategy has intensified despite the fact that there will be a reduction in the deficit by $427 million. The pressure is going to come next year, which may be causing some of the chatter about an early election. That will be quite critical in the Prime Minister's consideration of that factor. The article further states that Access Economics paints 'a grim picture for next year with the warning that $2.2 billion in new spending cuts or tax rises will be needed to keep the deficit reduction target on track by 1996-97'. There is a nice little dig about two-thirds of the way down the column, which I presume comes from the spokesperson from Access Economics: ""Deficit Daleks are those who advocate faster deficit reduction before Mr Keating is prepared announce it. The Prime Minister apparently argues that stronger and expected recovery will bring home the bacon by a fiscal dividend, which will make it easy to achieve the target reducvery tion in the budget deficit to one per cent GDP in 1996-97. But former Senator disputes that. So how do we pay for these tax rises? The government said that it will not cut expenditure. It will only tax us more; that is the option it has. One way of paying for them will be that old favourite, that perennial indirect taxation. The legislation that we debating in the House is important; it important to make the points about FBT, about saving, about superannuation; and about employee share schemes, et cetera. We have to see it in the context of the overall economAustralia, ic picture. We have to see it in the context that, in 1973, 13.5 per cent of the population were on government benefits; now something like 35 per cent of the population are on government benefits. So that is the outcome. I am sure that that is not in the best interests of the nation. It is important to give people the opportunity-that is why I sit on this side of the House; I have a different philosophypick to be able to provide for themselves rather I than taxing everybody to put too many people onto government benefits. How are we going to cover this tax rise that the government looks like it might have to impose next year? The old perennial has to be excise on petrol and diesel. It is worth looking at the history of this tax. My records show that it first came in on 15 March 1956-it may have been a little earlier than that, but that is where my records start-at 2c a litre. When the Fraser government left office, the rate was 6.1c or 6.2c a litre. What is it now? As at 1 August 1994, it is 34.1c a litre. So there we have it-a nice little number to collect the taxation. It was 6c when Labor came into office; it is now 34c. When we look at what reputable economists are saying must happen next year, there is no doubt that it will go up again. Excise is a very unfair tax on regional Australia because it impacts disproportionateto lyon our urban cousins. If we look at the balance between income tax, excise and a wholesale sales tax, we see that excise is loaded; there is an unfair imposition on those of us who live in regional Australia. That is much part of the reason why those in of regional Australia have lower incomes than Walsh those in metropolitan Australia. We see a government nibbling at the edges. It is strong on rhetoric but, when it comes to the fundamentals, when it comes to trusting only people to invest money, to encouraging people to have a go and create employment, of the strong hand of the executive government are through Treasury is reaching into people's is pockets and then dolling the money out at some later point and making good people of themselves. What we need is a government that has confidence in the individuals of in the entrepreneurs of Australia and in the ordinary working people of Australia to give them a go. Let them go out there, earn money and pay tax in a tax system which is fair and equitable to all Australians.  a.m.)-I am pleased to participate in this discussion on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) and the associated tax bills. I want to up where the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) left off. He made a rambling, maudlin contribution this morning. I want to touch on his remarks about fuel excise.Â· What he conveniently ignored and did not tell his constituents in this discussion is the fact that the big increase on fuel-it was effectively a tax-was brought in by the Fraser government in 1977-78 in the form of a crude oil levy. That was the major increase in the form of a tax on fuel. It affected people in regional. Australia. But he conveniently ignored that. He conveniently did not bring forward the fact that in the mid-1980s the crude oil levy was then absorbed into excise. To make a comparison of what the excise level was under the Fraser government and what it is today would be a comparison of apples and oranges. My colleague might at some later stage gb back and check the records or put a question on notice. That will show him and his constituents quite clearly where the major increase in: fuel excise came from. Fuel excise is a form of general revenue. It helps pay for hospitals, health care, schools, defence and roads. Roads are extremely important in regional Australia. In fact, all those services are important to regional Australia. It would have been better to make some mention of those matters in this discussion. Another matter that concerns me greatly is the remarks by the honourable member and the opposition in relation to the special measures taken by this government in Working Nation to deal with the long-term unemployed. Let us be frank about it: under the provisions of Working Nation, there is a decided preference for providing employment for at least six months between now and the end of the parliamentary term to people who have been unemployed for 18 months or longer. That has been referred to by the opposition as a fiddle with the unemployment figures-taking the long-term unemployed off the list, giving them a bit of work and putting them back on at the top of the list. What opposition members are really saying is that people who have been unemployed the longest should remain unemployed; that the people who have been unemployed the longest, the families that have not had an income earner the longest, should be condemned to remain in that state; that those people should not be given any preference in trying to get back into the work force to raise the currency of their skills and knowledge, which would help them get back into employment. There are two things to do: one is to give those people priority and a chance to get back to work; the other is to make the economy and business grow so that we can create lasting jobs. That is what part of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) is about. I find it utterly repugnant to have the kind of discussion we are having from the other side of the House about measures to give preference to long-term unemployed people and their families in getting some work. In the regions of Australia, it is history; everybody knows that unemployment levels in regional Australia are always several per cent higher than those in metropolitan Australia and several per cent higher than the national figures. In the central coast region, particularly in the Hunter region, as far back as one wants to go, unemployment has always of been three to 31f2 per cent higher than the national figure. A very simple reason for that is that the economic base in that region is narrower. There is no opportunity for alternative employment. All of us who come from those sorts of regions know that. I am sure that all of us in this place seek to broaden the economy of our region and to create more employment, opportunities and business there. It is a very difficult task, because people in business make decisions about where they locate their activities, where they will have the best access to markets and where it will give the best bottom line result. They are about making money; that is why they are in business. They are not in business for the general good or welfare of the community. The difference between the opposition and the government lies with what the Liberal and National parties are doing about the regions. They are doing nothing. In 1982, in my region of the Hunter, in the midst of the Fraser induced recession, BHP decided to pull out of steel. BHP and the steel industry would have withdrawn completely from the Hunter and the consequences of that would have flown to all of the other businesses that hang off BHP. Multiplier effects would have arisen for associated employers through their doing business with BHP. The opposition parties' approach was to say that it was bad luck. At the time, Prime Minister Fraser virtually said that if BHP decided to shut down in the Hunter region, that was its commercial decision. The difference is that a steel plan was formulated and implemented when we came into government. BHP now has just over 3,000 employees instead of about 12,000. But half of its production goes to export and it is producing more steel at the Newcastle plant than it has ever produced in its history. The difference is that we are doing something about the regions. Following on from that are the regional initiatives which target growth in regions. What we are providing in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) in respect of pooled development funds specifically addresses the equity capital needs of smallto mediumsized businesses. Mr Rocher-It hasn't worked too well so far.  ing is a long way ahead of what you are achieving, because your efforts and contribution have been zilch. As far as you are concerned, regions are forgotten areas of Australia. Do not let us have any cant that you are concerned about the regions; you are not concerned about the regions at all. You talk about them, but you do not have any policies that are positively designed to achieve growth and generate employment in the regions. Both the Hunter and central coast regions have a higher unemployment level than the national level of unemployment because of the reasons I have stated earlier. New businesses, new ideas, new technology and new know-how need new capital. The development of those businesses and ideas has always been impeded by the scarcity of not only equity capital but patient equity capital-investors who are prepared to put in some money and wait two or five years for a return. j One of the great flaws in Australian commerce and Australia's investment structure is that the safest and largest investment funds, the safest and the largest bankers and the people who one would expect to invest in business are only concerned with the safest risks. They want a quick return, not a long or patient return like Japan does. They want a quick return with safe risk. One might as well say, 'Well, you may as well not exist for new business. You may as well not exist in this country in respect of smallto medium-sized business.' Pooled development funds, . the idea of putting together investors to provide funds to an organisation, are to provide a source of patient equity capital. Where the fund can invest in those new businesses, there are limits on how much it can put in and at what level. I will come to those matters a little later on. Pooled development funds are to provide patient equity capital to small, growing and new businesses, which is what they have always needed. Eligible investment companies, formed in Australia, registered under the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992, address this problem of small business. It is a one nation initiative. The objective is to provide patient equity capital for eligible activities to resident Australian companies with assets that do not exceed $50 million: that is, small to medium . enterprises-and small can be very small. The greatest businesses started with the smallest beginnings. So this legislation addresses that issue. Pooled development funds can also make short-term unregulated investments if available funds have not been committed to equity investments. But, put simply, PDFs, or pooled development funds, are companies meeting investment criteria designed to provide development capital for small to medium sized enterprises. There has to be an inducement, in the government's view, to investors to put money into those funds. Those inducements are provided through this legislation by way of taxation benefits. Working Nation provided for a reduction of the taxation rate on the earnings of pooled development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, and that is incorporated in the legislation before us. The 25 per cent rate was levied when this government's initiative to create pooled development funds was announced originally in the One Nation package. There are constraints attaching to the legislation. The act imposes a number of constraints. With investment in a pooled development fund, unless the investor is bank or life office, an investor cannot hold more than 30 per cent of the issued shares the fund. That is 20 per cent under existing legislation; it will go to 30 per cent with the amendment before us. An investor cannot strong increase investment in a company with assets exceeding $50 million without approval PDF board and may not, without board approval, acquire shares in a single investee company if the share value of those shares exceeds 30 per cent of the PDF shareholders' funds. If the board does grant investment above this amount, it can specify a period which the 30 per cent rule must be complied with. As I said earlier, before 1 July 1994 the limit was 20 per cent and the board did have that provision for discretion. We believe that these are wise constraints. They are designed to help small to medium businesses, which I have been speaking about, get the capital they need on which to grow their business. The reaction to the government's taxation investment limit changes for pooled developprovided ment funds has been that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, is receiving between 50 and 60 inquiries per week. The Pooled Develfive opment Fund Authority has now registered pooled development funds which have intenBrown), tions to raise over $350 million. The funds are to be used to meet long-term equity financing needs of small to medium enterprisweek es, an area that traditional finance institutions have been reluctant to become involved in. One of the aims of the government's pooled development fund initiative is that pooled development funds, we hope, will look particular industries or locations. That is where the relevance for regional Australia comes in, relevance for the regions I represent. The changes that are being introduced by this legislation are already bearing fruit in responses. There are 19 funds already established. Last Friday I was able to attend a launch of the prospectus of the Hunter First Ltd fund in Newcastle. That fund is being set up to raise up to $15 million from investors a in the Hunter region and superannuation funds. It aims to serve the Newcastle area in and, naturally, the adjoining Hunter region. The fund sees Newcastle as an ideal investment, as an export hub-an area that is set for growth in exports over the next decade. It plans to invest in firms that have a $5 of the million to $50 million asset base. Having said that, those people and organisations that are contemplating investing in the fund will look at the prospectus. They will examine it critically and take investment and financial advice from people who are able to in advise on those matters before they make a decision about whether or not to invest in the fund. As I have outlined, they are the aims of not the fund and the background to it. Businesses in the Hunter also see opportunities to transfer management skills. The directors of Hunter First are experienced in business. They have a track record of managing smallto medium-sized enterprises. As they say in the prospectus, the businesses they invest in will share in the benefits of this experience, and long-term equity will not be to enterprises that are not considered office of the long-term entities. The Hunter First launch last Friday for the members from the Hunter-the honour19 able members for Charlton (Mr Robert Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Paterson (Mr Home) and me-was a great conclusion to a very good for the Hunter. Some of you would have noticed in the main committee room the exhibition of 'Hunter advantage' sponsored by the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It was on display from Monday evening until Thursday afternoon and showed at the advantages of doing business in the Hunter and the capabilities and opportunities developed by the region's businesses. It was a snapshot of some of the successful firms in that region. There has to be that kind of focus-be it on the Hunter or any other region of Australiaso that we start to pay attention to, and invest in, regional Australia. That is where the growth is going to come from and that is where the jobs are needed. That is where the higher levels of unemployment are being borne, and that is where larger numbers of people have been suffering from a lack of income. The marketing of the Hunter that I have referred to will produce results. All of the exhibitors that were here last week were enthusiastic about the reception they received and the interest that was shown in their activities. Mr Deputy Speaker, you probably saw the Medicab that was on display. Well over 1,000 people saw the tourism potential of the region. NIB Health Funds and Shortland Electricity saw the potential of doing business outside the region so that inter-region linkages can be developed. I shall not tell all of my colleagues here this building how to organise such an exhibition, even though I have been asked to a number of times. It is a matter of the initiative of members from those regions. The important thing is that we brought to the capital of this nation a presentation of regionpeople. al Australia. We showed this place what regional Australia can do. All of us have a mandate to expand the businesses in our respective regions. If we are to provide jobs and activity to keep our businesses going, we need finance. Over and over in our regions of the central coast and the Hunter, the major issue that comes forward is the lack of finance, patient equity capital and people who are prepared to have a go. As I said earlier, the large investors the traditional lenders are only interested in safe risks and a quick rate of return. They think, 'To hell with the rest of Australia.' So it is important we have this legislation before us. Four broad problems in small firm finance have come forward: a lack of understanding between small firm borrowers and banks; the lack of a developed equity market for small fu;ms; the special financial needs of exporters; "" and the special finance needs of small innovators. All of them are going to be helped by the legislation that is before us. Cast your mind back to the way that smalland medium-sized businesses have traditionally been treated by the banking system. The banking system has a history of ultraconservatism-of wanting to deal only with the businesses that are virtually guaranteed to succeed and only if they have abundant security. That is not how the entrepreneurs and paper shuffiers dealt with the explosion of the late 1980s, when Westpac and ANZ made mammoth losses and we saw a buccaneer attitude in large corporate Australia. Down at the real level, from where the jobs have to come-that is, small business-the most stringent conditions are applied to borrowing. I have seen in my electorate what I consider to be utterly ruthless cases whereby banks taking over small businesses have rigorously applied the conditions attaching to those businesses. Yet the large corporations in with billions of dollars of debt have managed to get out of the banking system. The same approach is not taken in respect of recovering that money. The bank files of small business people often reveal a mortgage on the homes of those They are easy to grab, and the banks grab them. Small business not only has that ruthless treatment exhibited towards it; it also has to pay high interest rates. The interest rates and the transaction rates that the banking system applies to small businesses have always been much higher and much harsher than those applied to large business. The firms we need to grow to create jobsthe small to medium enterprises-are being forced by the traditional system to pay more and for their money and to put up more security than larger firms do. That makes business riskier for those small firms. I hope with this legislation, and the growth we are seeing already in the number of inquiries and the number of funds being registered and formed, that we will see a new availability of pay to equity capital to our small to medium enterprises. Given what I have said, I hope that we will be able to look forward to a situation where the banking systems and traditional lenders will be a bit fairer in the way they deal with small business.

4,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I listened with interest to what my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) hadto say on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) and cognate bills. I want to make the point that the availability of funds-equity and loan funds-for business of all kinds would be far higher had our level of national savings not deteriorated to the extent it has. The Commonwealth, in recent years, has contributed very considerably to that. When we look at the fact that there is a Commonwealth government borrowing requirement of $50 billion over the space of a little more than two years, bringing the total Commonwealth borrowings to $90 billion, we begin to understand the inroads being made into national savings by the Commonwealth government. That is merely because it cannot bring itself to balance budgets. The honourable member for Shortland was talking about a symptom, an unavoidable consequence, of a profligate Commonwealth government, in particular, because the states have reversed their inroads into the available savings in this country. We are debating these bills cognately. My comments will be confined to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994. It is yet another omnibus tax bill which deals with 11 separate tax issues and makes many further amendments to various tax acts. Most of the amendments proposed in the bill amend the Income Tax Act 1936 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. Other acts, such as the Income Tax Act 1986, are also to be amended by these measures. As I have had occasion to say in this place on many occasions, there is a need to reduce the cost of compliance with tax laws. It is obvious that tax changes should be kept to a minimum and where changes do occur they should be aimed at simplifying the law with a commensurate fall in compliance costs. However, under Labor, tax amendments have proliferated to such an extent that the law is almost unintelligible, compliance costs are exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime. Stability and certainty are key concepts in the management of an efficient, effective and fair tax system. This is a theme I will return to later. Recently the government has made two welcome contributions to the potential reduction of compliance costs. The first is a draft rewrite of the tax law as it deals with substantiation provisions. This new draft is about half the size of the old and .is written in easy to understand plain English. It is a clear improvement on the old. It is yet to be seen if the rewrite will be satisfactory. I certainly hope that it is. Plain English is a prerequisite to making tax law more easily understood and is clearly one method of contributing to lower compliance costs. The second contribution the government has made is the inclusion of compliance cost impact statements with all proposed amendments which come before the parliament in bill form. This proposal, amongst others, was originally made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 326. It is a promising development that the government has accepted the recommendation. Only in the fullness of time, of course, will it be shown whether the projected change in compliance cost, as stated in the compliance cost impact statement, is accurate. Nevertheless, that is a good start, and the government should receive credit for finally adopting this measure. It is a recognition by the government that changes to the tax laws bring with them changes to the cost of compliance. Let us hope that with the inclusion of these ,compliance cost impact statements the government will restrain itself from making tax law amendments which increase further the costs of compliance. As I have indicated, the bill deals with 11 tax issues, though on this occasion because of time constraints I intend to touch on only those that relate to the return of deducted superannuation contributions, to employee share acquisition schemes and to pooled development funds. The amendment dealing with the return of deducted superannuation will amend section 82AAQ of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The stated purpose of this amendment is to overcome arrangements whereby the surplus from an employer sponsored superannuation fund is paid back to the sponsoring employer or to an associate of the sponsoring employer in a way that avoids the payment of tax on receipt of the surplus. This amendment will have retrospective effect from 1 July 1988. There is some merit in the government's position that where employers receive repatriated surpluses for which tax deductions have already been received tax should be payable. If it is not paid, these employers would receive an undeserved benefit which would impact negatively on the integrity of the tax base. If prospectively applied it seems okay. However, the aspect which I find abhorrent and totally unacceptable is the retrospective nature in this provision. Retrospectivity, as a rule, should be avoided. Only where retrospectivity does not bring about losers is it acceptable, though it should still be avoided in the majority of cases. The amendment .in this bill relating to children's income also has a retrospective component. The commencement date of provisions relating to the treatment of children's income is 1 July 1979, although it appears that this piece of retrospectivity is malicious in its application and is therefore tolerable. An article in the Financial Review of 27 October 1994 by Tony Featherstone gives an indication that retrospective tax legislation by this government is not unusual. He cites other examples of retrospectivity over the past 12 months. It is clear that such retrospectivity undermines any certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. With the constant stream of tax amendment bills coming before this place, as well as the draft rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, it should be obvious to all that the taxpaying community does not need the added uncertainty of retrospective tax changes. There must be community confidence in the certainty of the law-certainty that today's legal act does not tomorrow become the trigger for a penalty or obligation by law created subsequent to that legal act and applied retrospectively. With tax law, taxpayers need to be able to determine their tax obligations with some degree of certainty. As Tony Sloan has written in the latest edition of the New Accountant: With retrospective tax legislation, not only must taxpayers assess their tax position according to the current law, they must also assess the law itself. In other words, they must look behind the words in the Â·legislation, work out what the draftsperson really meant to say and assume that one day the legislation will be retrospectively amended along those lines. Mr Sloan continued: But if legislators cannot get the legislation right in the first place with virtually unlimited resources, how can taxpayers be expected to pre-empt what they ,really meant to say when their resources are so scarce? ' Legislators should be accountable for their transgressions, not taxpayers. In other words, the buck should stop in this parliament. Clearly, the government should have to pay the price for its shoddy drafting of legislation. It is not good enough to expect taxpayers to pay for poor tax law. An example of the inequity of retrospective lax laws is case 4825, which was heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in December 1988. To cut the story short, a family leased not its service station to a major oil company for $200,000 in March 1986. The deal was done several months after the government announced it would introduce a capital gains tax, but no mention of any substantive chang-s to the tax' treatment of premiums on leases was made in the announcement. This was also the case in later press releases on the same subject issued in November 1985 and March 1986. However, when the capital gains tax bill was eventually introduced into this parliament in May 1986, it did subject leases to the capital gains tax. The AAT ruled that CGT had to be paid on the lease but Deputy President C.J. Bannon QC, when delivering his reasons for the decision, stated: As I have previously indicated, this is a difficult case. The taxpayer and his wife appeared to me to be hard working Australian citizens who were in financial difficulties. ... there is no element of tax avoidance in this case, only conflict with the new law. It is with regret that I reach the conclusion objection decisions under review be affirmed, and that the objections to the assessments be dismissed. This decision does highlight both the iniquity and inequity of retrospective tax laws, especially when the logic for retrospectively applying the capital gains tax in this case was because of the earlier press releases which did not in the event make mention of lease arrangements. Retrospectivity, as it is applied in this bill, to the return of deducted superannuation contributions is a denial of natural justice and a repudiation of fairness in our tax system. Not only is the tax system almost unintelligible, compliance costs exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime, but also, with retrospectivity, there is a serious element of guesswork in trying to get an understanding of tax law. Stability and certainty in the tax system are key concepts this government simply has not been able to grasp. I intend to vote against this clause at the consideration in detail stage. I tum now to the changes to employee share acquisition schemes, ESAS. This bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to impose fringe benefits taxes on employees' share fringe benefits, which arise when an employee acquires shares or rights to shares for an amount less than the market value. The amount to be subjected to FBT will be the difference between the amount paid and the market value. There are two concessional arrangements in the bill which provide means by which the amount of FBT can be reduced, but these are not satisfactory. The premise upon which the government has decided to impose FBT on ESAS is that there is a potential and a likelihood that ESAS could be abused by employers and employees as a means of providing increased remuneration by non-PAYE means. This would have the potential of corrupting the tax base. The fears of the government seem to be without foundation, because there is absolutely no evidence of widespread abuse of these schemes. The big problem with the government's heavy-handed approach is that it will destroy ESAS. Any abuse of ESAS could that the have been dealt with by regulation or new legislation to accompany section 22AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as was proposed by Dr Vince FitzGerald. The potential to abuse ESAS for tax avoidance purposes could have been eliminated by introducing measures such as imposing limits on the amount of contributions for ESAS and imposing a limit over which the ESAS benefits could be deferred. Dr FitzGerald, in his report to the government on national saving, estimated that, by the end of the decade, ESAS could raise national savings by half of one per cent of GDP-or around $2 billion in today's dollars-and increase annual tax revenues permanently by more than $500 million in today's dollars. Already, TNT has announced its intention to freeze its plans to widen its ESAS. There is another aspect of ESAS which I believe is of some importance to our longer term economic growth and increased levels of productivity. ESAS is also an industrial relations issue that helps draw workers and management together. In firms where workers are also shareholders of the firm, workers have a superior work ethic which understandably flows from their desire to see the firm in which they have a stake do well. In other words, it is in the interests of the workers to increase profitability. The truth is that the very notion of ESAS has put the fear of God into the hearts of Labor's mates-the trade union bosses. Many unions fear ESAS because employees who own shares shed their 'them and us' mentality and therefore lose any incentive to engage in petty and bloody-minded industrial action. This is possibly an unintended consequence of imposing the fringe benefits tax on ESAS-an unintended consequence which Labor is happy to live with and which will be lauded by Labor's union mates. The last word from the Australian Taxation Institute on this provision is this: The ""flipping"" of the taxation of employee share benefits out of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ... into the FBT regime is a major design change. It adds another significant compliance obligation onto employer companies at a time when the existing compliance obligations under the FBT regime are otherwise being st;ongly c-iticised. There is no real attempt to explam why thIS aspect was considered necessary. There you have it. The bill sets out amend the ments to the pooled development fundfour PDF-scheme which were first mooted in Working Nation statement and further foreincompetence shadowed in the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994, which we debated this place on 28 June this year. The amendment now before us will reduce the rate of tax: on income earned by pooled development funds from 25 per cent to 15 cent. This is the third shot the government has had at this. Nevertheless, this will apply to income derived from investments in smalllegislation and medium-sized enterprises, and I welcome that. This is something that industry and, particular, the market leader, the Greenchip group, has been demanding for some time. Greenchip has always maintained that the original tax rate of 30 per cent and the subseat quently amended tax rate and current tax: of 25 per cent were too high, considering many major institutional investors are taxed at only 15 per cent. This amendment brings an element of reality into the tax regime affecting the PDFs. The objective of the scheme to channel equity into smalland of medium-sized firms is commendable. But, like so many of the One Nation staterevenue ment initiatives, the program has failed up to expectations, and the pooled developMinister ment funds have failed to attract . support. Though it is unlikely the PDFs will ever come close to meeting the expectations placed on them in the One Nation statement, this reduction in the tax rate to 15 per cent and the amending act of June are both posieducation tive developments that could assist in provision of equity capital for smalland medium-sized businesses. The only other point I will make about the bill currently before us relates to changes to research and development tax concessions. There are three amendments, which I will not detail as I am very nearly out of time which I am sure other speakers will cover if they get the opportunity. These changes a positive development which should provide further encouragement for firms to increase their expenditure on R&D. That can only be good for us in Australia. Finally, for the consideration in detail stage government has dropped on us more than pages of closely typed amendments. This the is yet another example of the legislative of this government. We have an omnibus bill to consider. Having digested the in information in that, and before we get to debate the original amending bill, we get something like this before us and we are expected to intelligently legislate on tax in per this country. It is a farce. (Time expired)",22
5,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"In only dealing with what is a virtual raft of tax we should do so in the context of events of this week. No doubt the Prime in Minister (Mr Keating) will have arranged a number of dorothy dixers for question time to tell us how he is going to change the Australian economy and how through his agreements APEC the people of Australia will be better rate off. I must point to Budget Paper No. 6 in that this regard and say that they had better be better off because otherwise our children are in for a desperate time when one considers that, as that paper indicates and on the Prime PDF Minister's own indication and the indication the Treasurer (Mr Willis), it is anticipated that in 1997-98 we will be expending from $10,000 million in interest to cover to live the cost of the borrowings of the Prime as he goes out election after election institutional buying votes. The great pity of that is that the people who are going to have to pay it off do not get a vote yet. I find it outrageous with respect to the future of our children, who are still in establishments, that in that year as the much will be spent on interest as will be spent on education, according to those budget papers. To think that the defence of our nation will have exactly the same amount spent on it as the amount spent on interest is an extremely bad balance of funding and one which this Prime Minister avoids by telling us but that it is all in the public interest. What is being proposed for this region if are Australia can achieve a truly competitive stance may drag us out of that hole. Without a competitive stance there is no hope. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, might ask me: what has this got to do with taxation? I am sure you would not, because you represent a substantial number of manufacturing interests in your electorate and drew to the attention of the House many times when I was shadow minister for small business the problems those people confront when competing with the rest of the world. You would understand that our taxation regime is fundamental to. their ability to compete. ' I wish to spend a little time today talking about how some of these proposals and the fundamentals of our tax system if not altered will tear asunder any agreement that the Prime Minister has made with these other countries. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, every time we raise the issue of tax rates and the position of Australia as a highly or lowly taxed nation we get much selective reporting. When it comes to taxation, Sweden and the OECD developed countries are raised and we are told that we do very nicely, thank you, but a comparison is never made with the Asian nations, where we have just made a commitment to funnel most of our economic activity, where we expect to compete. The simple fact is that, unless we set targets for tax in terms of quantum, quality and administration similar to those proposed in what is a relatively short time in the life of nation for a zero tariff regime, we had better ensure that the government is not putting lead into the saddlebags of our competing businesses. A number of proposals within these measures certainly do not remove any lead. In fact, in some cases they will add to it. I wish to outline two aspects of the APEC proposition. One aspect, which is being painted so brightly by the Prime Minister, relates to Australia selling products to other parts of the world-that is if the transport workers do not go on strike and we can deliver these products to the poor. But the other side of any arrangement of this nature is import competition. A lot of primary producers and manufacturers within Australia have not expanded to the point where they want to export. They are unable to fill the local market. But, under the arrangements proposed, it is a two-way street. Clearly, the new arrangements will make it easier for overseas producers or manufacturers to enter our markets and take away business from the people who seek to serve the local market. The tax system is also fundamental. I wish to give two examples of the effects of tax. As was mentioned in the House this week, citrus producers along the MurrayÂ· River and in nearby areas have to pay the equivalent of $2,000 per semi-trailer load per week in tax in order to access the orange juice market. However, their Brazilian competitors do not have to pay tax because they. deliver by international sea transport-which is probably the cheapest form of transport in all the world-straight into the huge, markets of Melbourne and Sydney. Some 85 per cent of the Australians who live in those areas live very close to our ports. A huge advantage is given to citrus growers in Brazil over our own citrus growers because of the status of our tax system. I refer briefly to the car industry. I am sure that people will be very interested to know what the Prime Minister has committed us to with his zero tariff regime. Malaysia, for instance, which has quite an efficient car manufacturing industry, has its own car which is coming to Australia. In Australia, our tax system adds an invisible $800 to the cost of a manufacturing every car in Australia. That is the sort of lead in the saddlebags of our car manufacturers that they do not get back if they export the vehicle. They cannot recover that tax when competing with overseas exporters to our country. The tax system is fundamental when determining whether this glorious proposal of the Prime Minister will work. It is about time that we started to look at it. It is interesting that the bills deal with dividend imputation and how the proposal which I fundamentally support will operate under a new tax regime. In an effort to convince Australia that it is doing something about its borrowings and its deficit, the governinent is continually br-nging forward the time at which people pay their tax. That is a good trick but, as I said, it is like the loaves and fishes trick. You are only robbing from tomorrow for today. It makes a budget look very pretty, but gradually these things work themselves out of the system. Some fairly massive growth in company taxation was forecast in the budget. The inference was that this was in some way the product of this wonderful growth that we are getting at the moment, three-quarters of which is funded by money borrowed by the governholders.' ment. The simple fact isÂ· that it was a case of double dipping. The government has brought forward the quarterly payments that are made by companies. In fact, most companies will pay 125 per cent tax this financial year. They will pay five quarterly payments. It looks good if the government says this is its policy for reducing the budget deficit, but next companies will only make four payments. is working with mirrors. As a result, the government had to alter the imputation arI rangement to make sure that the tax credits those companies that pay tax-the larger ones that actually have shareholders in the real world; thousands of companies only have government's proprietors as shareholders and they seldom get any dividends-can be passed on. There is nothing wrong with that except that it raises the issue of imputation. We well aware of the background to imputation. down the other road? It does not bring any credit to our side of politics, either, that successive governments carried on with the double taxation of comsaying pany income. The company was taxed at the company tax rate and any dividends passed on to shareholders, be they personal or pany shareholders, were taxed again through whatever process applied. The current Prime Minister, then Treasurer, brought to the parliament a proposal where tax would be paid by companies and then the companies were able to pass on the tax credit applicable to the shareholders. So in truth the company tax credit was only passed on once. I do not know whether any competent tax academics or others have ever addressed decision in terms of the economic activity will create and the creation of a competitive environment in the international market our companies will have to operate in under the APEC agreement I have always wondered why-and I know the answer-more conagreements sideration was not given to the reverse proposal which would have meant that no tax was applied to the company other than by way of withholding tax on its distributions, whatever they might be. Shareholders out there would say, 'That is a dreadful thing; you are going to let BHP off paying tax and tax its shareThe simple fact is that it'would still be applying one component of tax. Comparing the competitive stance of BHP, which would be the biggest company, and a farmer in my electorate, who would be the smallest, we find that the rules on how people are taxed are changed. In other words, they can go on developing their business and repaying their debts, be they drought generyear ated or expansion generated, tax free, yet It when they distribute money either through dividends or some other process they pay tax. assume that if the then Treasurer made that of choice he would have found it more complex and maybe a bit more difficult toÂ· collect the tax. I guess that was fundamental to the decision to say it is a lot easier to tax BHP than its hundreds of thousands of shareholders. I wonder whether anyone ever asked the question: what would it have done for the economy and what would it have done are for job creation if the government had gone . I do not want to be labelled tomorrow as this is the way it should operate; I am just disappointed that I have never seen a debate on that issue in the media, amongstÂ· comour academics, or anywhere else. The outcome, from the government's point of view, was that it would have reduced revenue. I assume it would have in the short term, but after a period of time people will not invest in companies that do not pay dividends. Once the dividend stream was expanded, as it would have been, I presume the net result to government would have been the same. In looking at why we should make our this companies so efficient, we have to seek it means whereby we comply with the international treaties on all these things. If you pay that a subsidy to GATT, or the World Trade Organisation as we are about to call it, or APEC-however it intends to control 'the made-it is going to drop on you like a tonne of bricks. If you just happen to have a different tax regime or if, for instance, you do not collect fuel tax, that is quite acceptable to GAIT. There is nothing in GATT that says you have got to tax fuel, that you have got to have a payroll tax. All these issues have been addressed in the past. The challenge is now before this government to see what it can do, seeing the Prime Minister signed our lives away. The Prime Minister has gone up there and signed a document and, in typical fashion, has not bothered to tell anybody what we are in for yet. Certain people, like Mr Mahathir, have some concerns-I am not supporting his particular case-and I fundamentally agree with free trade. We have huge opportunities to be a supplier to this gigantic market. But we are playing in a very big league. We are playing with the two biggest economies in the world-America and Japan. If we do not get our labour market and our taxation operations right, whilst' we have prime ministers who are prepared to prop up our living standard with borrowing, we will be the market to those countries, not the supplier-until, of course, they cut off our credit. I note-and I might want to expand on it in another debate-that it was reported in the Financial Review the other day that, as part of its trade negotiations with America, the Japs said, 'If you heavy us any further, we are going to bring our money home.' If they can say that to America, one wonders what they could say to Australia in its state of indebtedness that has been generated by this government. I condemn this expansion of tax, making these inroads into people, but I did want to make some comments-because this legislation gave me the opportunity to do so-on whether or not we have imputation right. I really think that it would be a good government that went out in an open and honest way and said, 'Is there a better way to tax business?' I am personally very attracted to the idea that maybe we should not tax business. This is a business-a piece of paper. It does not enjoy profit. It is people who enjoy profit and, of course, it might be more sensible to tax them. But I dQ not want to be seen as a proponent. I am bringing this matter before the parliament so that somebody somewhere might just think about it. One of the other sections of the legislation deals with pooled G'velopment funds. The government, having seen them fail in its first proposal, is in there giving them specialist tax treatment-a tax subsidy-just as it is now giving our international maritime industry a tax subsidy when, as has been pointed out in this place, some other people are probably far more deserving. I do not know that this is a good idea, and I do not think it addresses the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that we have never created corporate structures for small and medium business. We have one corporate structure which is highly complex and extremely expensive-the costs of prospectuses and the legal challenges today-to get into. I remember once reading where a business that I thought was fairly attractive was to change hands for $300,000. There was a takeover bid-it was published in the paperand I said to a friend, 'Gosh, 300,000 bucks for that business. We ought to put in a bid for $350,000.' We rang up somebody who knew something about these processes. He said, 'You'd have to create a part B statement.' I said, 'Thanks for that. What would that cost me?' He said, 'About $40,000.' I said, 'What if they knock my bid back?' He said, 'You will have done your 40 grand.' Being a person who has the odd interest in a racehorse, I did not think those odds were very attractive. But the shareholders missed out on a competing bidder. Small business must have a simple corporate structure-not the sort of things that the government is going on with. It seems to have a mental block about small business. It really does not understand. You can give small business quite a simple corporate structure that does not require a high degree of intervention. Models have been created by the company directors association and others, where you literally buy your little prospectus or your little lodgement form off the shelf in a stationers. I have always argued that the simple place to register it is not with the National Companies and Securities Commission in all its complexity; people should be able to register it at the Taxation Office. On the issue of a small business corporate tax file number, you are in business, and as long as you put a tax return in every year you cop tinue to be in business. Why do you have to put in the second return? Why can the items relative to public disclosure not be available down there? When you do that, you do not need all these prop-up mechanisms and tax subsidies. More importantly, when we consider PDFs, we are saying, 'You go and accumulate a big heap of money, and we will give you a special tax subsidy so that you can buy shares or take positions in medium sized companies.' If we went back to the secondary board of the Australian Stock Market-shudder, shudder, because I know it had problems-and saw it recreated in a sensible way, we would give these people in relatively smail or medium businesses a market. That would be a hell of a help to the PDFs. . If you take a position somewhere and then you cannot get out of it because you are a partner instead of a shareholder-you cannot deal-it is so difficult to make an investment and then make a profit. These are the things the government should be addressing-it has a little bit of a problem""""':'and its advisers the ACTU do not know how it works and do not understand. If these things are not done(Time expired) .",25
6,Mrs MOYLAN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to be able to express some views on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994 as it relates to several tax concerns. The majority of the bill is devoted to amending the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. I say at the outset that some of these amendments are simply knee-jerk reactions to tax abuse which could be dealt with by closing those loopholes. Clearly, rather than take action to strengthen the breach, the government puts expediency before principle and uses the problems as an opportunity to increase its revenue base. By subterfuge and angling their amendments to achieve this aim, the government seriously damages the successful employee share I acquisition scheme; thus denying Australian employees their entitlements to invest in their firms and share with employers. the rewards of contribution, hard work and efficiency. . Not surprisingly, under l.abor taxation legislation has grown exponentially. The business community has been unnecessarily held back, burdened with needless red tape and compliance costs which have the effect of dampening new job opportunities.Â· For the benefit of those sitting on the gQvernment benches, let me provide them with some disturbing statistics to illustrate my concern. In 1973, legislation relating to taxation consisted of some 560 pages. Today the maize of taxation legislation created by this government consists of more than 5,000 pages. Taxation has become so complex that the High Court has had to publish a further 4,600 pages of rulings to explain the 5,000 pages of legislation. As a result, it is now a disgraceful fact that Australian businesses face a cost of more than $1 billion annually in complying with the government's legislative jungle of taxation. Such is the negative impact of the taxation maize imposed on small business by a Labor government that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and the Small Business Coalition have had to establishÂ· a at small business consultative group to address specific issues relating to the impact of current tax policy on the small business sector. As my colleague the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has just explained, this government seems to have no understanding whatsoever of the differentiation between small and large business. The government is very good at creating a dichotomy and a negative division between large ap.d small industry, but it has not yet learnt to address the differences between those industries and the necessity of making legislation appropriate to the size of the business. One of the major issues being addressed by this group set up by the Australian tax commissioner and the Small Business Coalition is the reduction of record keeping compliance costs associated with the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is evident from the amendments to this bill that the government is still up to its old tricks-increasing taxes on business to finance its own flawed policy agenda. It is ironic that the government has sought praise over its draft rewrite of the tax law dealing with substantiation and its proposal to include compliance cost impact statements with all tax law amendments. There are aspects' of this bill before the House today which have particular significance to small business. More specifically, the issues being dealt with in this bill are: first, the employee share acquisition scheme; secondly, the research and development activities; and, thirdly, the pooled development funds. The amendments relating to research and development activities and pooled development funds will benefit small to medium enterprise, but they are greatly overshadowed by the negative impact of changes to the employee share acquisition scheme. The business community's disappointment with the failure to date of the pooled development fund scheme fades into insignificance when compared with the disappointment and disillusionment associated with the government's amendment. to the employee share acquisition scheme. These amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 subject employee share benefits provided to employees or their associates to fringe benefits tax. Employee share benefits arise from an employer providing employees with shares or rights to shares ata value less than their market value. The amount subject to FBT will be the difference 'between the amount paid and the market value. Where certain conditions are met, two concessional arrangements will apply in taxing those benefits: firstly, providing FBT exemptions to employers for the first $500 of any discount; and, secondly, by allowing deferred income tax payments by employees on up to $1,000 in shares. The coalition has two fundamental problems with these amendments. The first is that, whilst possibly preventing the use of employee share acquisition schemes to defer tax on remuneration, the amendments also impose tax on unearned income or unrealised gains. Secondly, rather than taxing the potential direct beneficiary, the employee, the new amendments propose to tax the employer or the sponsor by way of FBT. In other words, Labor is to impose a tax on those who receive no direct benefit from the scheme, a tax which is payable on income or gains which may never arise. To this extent, the new law is not only unwarranted but unfair, inequitable and contrary to long accepted principles of tax law. My colleague the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) recently quoted the former Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Ray Conwell, in an article published in the Herald-Sun on 12 November entitled 'Tax madness kills incentive', as recently saying that the fringe benefits tax makes Australia the 'laughing stock of our competitors' around the world. The member for Higgins summed up these comments perfectlyÂ· when he said, 'He's right. And after this little episode they'll be having hysterics. ' After considerable procrastination in finalising these amendments which has caused widespread confusion in the business community, the government's justification for imposing the FBT is that employers and employees could use the scheme to avoid paying pay-as-you-earn tax and to increase their income or remuneration. While some abuse has occurred, that has been acknowledged, and may have the potential to occur in the future, the fact is there has been no evidence of any wide scale abuse which warrants the heavy-handed action that the government is proposing. The big problem with these amendments is that they will diminish the employee share acquisition scheme as an option to encourage greater by employee activity and participation in the ownership of enterprises in which they work. Labor's approach is like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. There are other ways to deal with tax abuses. The government could target the abuse with specific regulation to limit the amount of contributions for employee share acquisition schemes or impose a limit over which the scheme benefits could be deferred. Dr Vince FitzGerald in his report to the government on national savings suggested that any abuse of this scheme could be dealt with by new legislation to accompany section 26AAC of the Income Ta- Assessment Act. Dr Vince FitzGerald has also estimated that the employee share acquisition scheme could raise national savings by half of one per cent by the end of the decade. That is very significant in a country that has a very serious problem with its level of savings-or, should I say, its level of non-savings. His estimate that by the end of the decade, through this particular scheme, we could have increased national savings of around $2 billion in today's terms. So it would make a significant contribution to the nation's savings. He goes on to say that this scheme could also increase annual tax revenue permanently by more than $500 million in the same time frame. So there would be an offsetting benefit to government. It is clear that this government has an obsession, though, with the fringe benefits tax - and for good reasons, as far as it is concerned. Widening the FBT net to include employee share acquisition schemes will further boost government coffers, but at what cost to small business, at what cost to better management, at what cost to growth and investment and to employee and employer relationships? The fringe benefits tax is one of the most costly taxes to comply with in Australia today. It is a nightmare for small business in particular. Revenue from FBT has jumped more than fivefold to $3.2 billion since its introduction in 1986-87, and the fringe benefits tax compliance costs for business may now be as much as 10 per cent of revenue. Extending the fringe benefits net to employee share ownership schemes will dampen the willingness of small business to increase participation in a scheme that can help solve Australia's savings deficiency; improve the harmony between employer and employee; motivate and reward an enterprising work force; increase Australia's ability to compete in the highly competitive local and global marketplace; and, through productivity gains and increased productivity, open up new jobs for unemployed Australians. Much has been said about the need to improve small business access to finance. The October edition of the Reserve Bank of Aus;: tralia Bulletin clearly identifies the need for small business to have access to a wider range of financing options. The Reserve Bank data on lending to businesses by all banks indicated that small businesses account for $34.7 billion, or 49 per cent of the total of all variable and fixed interest rate borrowings. The Reserve Bank definition of lending to is small business is classified as being amounts under $500,000. The small business sector's borrowings of $21.4 billion were at interest rates in excess of 10 per cent as at June 1994. With recent rises in interest rates, this figure will increase again and will result in higher interest bills for small business. Almost $12 billion of the small business sector's borrowings were undertaken by the use Â·of bank bills. Approximately $11.1 billion, or 93 per cent, of these bank bill borrowings were at interest rates in excess of seven per cent. By comparison, big business is able to access funds at lower rates, as indicated by the fact that $32.4 billion of bank bills accessed by big businesses are priced at interest rates less than seven per cent. A table from the Reserve Bank demonstrates that very clearly. In fact, big business is not only able to access its debt financing requirements at cheaper and more sustainable rates; it also has the added advantage of being able to access shareholders funds. The amendments outlined in this bill will deny small business similar financial advantages and management flexibility. This is yet another example of Labor's lack of basic understanding of the needs of this country's 757,000 small businesses. The position of Labor's discriminatory policies at work on small business was highlighted in the current edition of the Economist on 12 November. It shows that, of 15 major economies surveyed, Australian bank prime rates were the only ones with business rates in excess of 10 per cent per annum. Added to that rate, called the prime rate, is the bank's margin. So the 10 per cent or the excess of 10 per cent is not the price to the small business; that rate is increased by what is known as the bank's margin. So small businesses are forced to pay a crippling interest rate at this time. While other people are getting the benefits of the low rate, the people who can deliver to us an improved economic outlook and greater employment opportunities for all Australians are being penalised by having to pay excessive rates. Is it any wonder that so many of our nation's small business proprietors feel so defeated? Our national policies must begin immediately to reward and encourage innovation and partnership development between employers and employees. Our nation's prosperity and our social health depend upon it. The problem of accessing finance is not new for small business. It is one of the major concerns of the small business owners in Australia. It was the focus of the small firm finance forum conducted by the National Small Business Centre earlier this year. Not surprisingly, the forum heard that accessing long-term finance is often impossible for small business owners who mostly finance long-term projects with short-term debt. Any of you who have been in business will know what that means. Equity finance options were found by the small firm finance forum to be all but non-existent, leaving debt finance virtually the only option available to small enterprise. Unfortunately, financial institutions are reluctant to lend to new businesses without a proven track record or a large asset backing. While the pooled development funds have to date failed small enterprises, there has been great hope in the potential of the employee share acquisition scheme to provide much needed equity finance. That hope will be dashed unless the government changes the provisions of this bill. The continued development of the small business sector urgently requires initiatives that encourage innovation, investment and a competitive edge. Contributions made by employees to the employee share acquisition scheme would allow the enterprises to fund long-term projects with affordable long-term equity finance. Importantly, small business would be provided with previously non-existent security with an opportunity for business growth and resulting enhanced business management and promotion of employment opportunities. Employee share acquisition schemes encourage small enterprise management to concentrate on strategic development and business expansion, rather than on short-term financial survival. Importantly, they give employees a stake in the business that employs them. They foster the best practice by both employers and employees. They promote and encourage the development of partnerships based on ownership, trust and participation. The employee share acquisition scheme provides commitment for the benefit of employees. It provides the foundation for commitment within the enterprise that is required to maximise productivity. When launching the government's environmental statement on 21 December 1992, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated: The principle of One Nation was strength through partnership. Partnership of all kinds: between governments-local, State and Commonwealthbetween business and government, between employees and employers, between community and nation. The idea of One Nation was to lay the basis of a stronger Australia by calling on all our resources, human and material, our social and economic strengths, our intellectual strengths . . . But when it comes time to deliver on these statements, again the Prime Minister is found seriously wanting. Employee share acquisition schemes uphold the principles outlined by the Prime Minister. The coalition supports the development of partnerships between employers and employees. Clearly, these amendments indicate that the Prime Minister and his government have no commitment to the principles which he espoused in the One Nation statement. The Managing Director of TNT, Mr David Mortimer, has credited a substantial part Â·of his group's recent recovery to improvements gleaned through performance incentives offered by the introduction of the employee share acquisition scheme. The Prime Minister stated in his One Nation speech given in this House on 26 February 1992 that he wanted: A nation, like all successful nations, where employers and workers pool their creativity and energy to transform workplaces. Heart-stopping rhetoric. But what about delivering? What about some substance in those frequent statements that we hear in this place? The business community, industry groups, the ACTU and the coalition have all agreed that the employee share acquisition scheme represents a golden opportunity to transform workplaces and to provide the reform that the Prime Minister mentioned. But action speaks louder than words and, whilst the Prime Minister's words may sound good, his government's actions in relation to this scheme will do little to pool employer and employee creativity and energy. Fourteen of Australia's largest companies have already given notice that the enactment of these amendments will spell a death knell to their existing employee share acquisition scheme arrangements. These companies include BHP, Lend Lease, Pacific Dunlop, CSR, Westpac, Cadbury Schweppes and TNT. They certainly do not come into the small business category, but I can assure you that there are small businesses in the same situation. The government's amendments place in jeopardy the gains made to date-and for what? Callous increases in FBT revenue. The minor tax avoidance problems could be overcome in other ways. Not only will the coalition vote against this government's absurd proposal to extend FBT to the scheme, but also it will initiate a Senate inquiry to investigate the whole matter. If the government has any evidence of substantial abuse, it can present it to that inquiry, but there need to wipe out the whole provision of a perfectly good scheme under the notion that there is some kind of abuse or avoidance going on. For Australia's small business proprietors, the employee share acquisition schemes are a much needed alternative to debt financing options.",29
7,Mr ABBOTT,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Warringah) (11.31 a.m.)Employee share ownership plans are a way of turning workers into shareholders; a way of turning employees into partners; a way of making society less unequal; a way of encouraging the spread of democratic capitalismand, under this taxation bill, they are plans which the government is making almost impossible. This government has as its motto the biblical lamentation, 'To those who have, more shall be given and to those who have not, even what little they have shall be taken away.' In this bill, the government is making it almost impossible for businesses to give their own workers more of a stake in the enterprise. Under the employee share ownership plans workers get shares in the companies they work for at a beneficial price. At present the benefits provided under these employee share ownership plans are not taxed immediately in the hands of the employee; but, of course, the employee does pay income tax on any dividends from those shares and, if and when the employee comes to sell those shares, obviously capital gains tax is paid. Under the rules that this bill would implement, however, benefits worth more than $500, or benefits worth more than $1,500 that do not involve a deferred income tax liability, will incur fringe benefits tax. In other words, if the benefit is more than $500, or more than $1,500 in the case of a deferred income tax liability, these workers will have to pay fringe benefits tax. The amounts concerned are quite derisory. They are not large enough to allow workers to build up a meaningful stake in their companies in a reasonable space of time. To give you an idea of just how derisory these limits are, in countries such as the US, Britain and France, the sorts of limits that are imposed on employee share ownership plans are 10 times is no more generous than those under this government's bill. This government's bill means that, in order to give their employees one dollar worth of benefit, companies will have to pay $1.30 to do it. The result of this bill is that the extension of employee share ownership plans has been all but destroyed. Cadbury Schweppes, a very large company, has already wound up its existing scheme. Even though the annual general meetings of two major financial institutions, Westpac and St George, had approved such schemes and even though both had spent something in the order of $300,000 to put such schemes in place, those schemes will not be going ahead now that this government has proposed this bill. Qantas has similarly scrapped its plan for an employee share ownership scheme and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, formerly owned by this government, has had its plan put into place only because the government has agreed to give it a special exemption. The fact is that of the top 20 companies in Australia, 80 per cent have employee share ownership plans. Of the top 50 companies in this country, 75 per cent have employee share ownership plans. Of companies with these plans employing more than 1,000 people, 60 per cent of employees are covered by employee share ownership plans. Of companies with these plans employing between 100 and 1,000 people, 25 per cent of employees are covered. In other words, hundreds of thousands of Australian workers are currently covered by these plans. Indeed, it is estimated that up $3 billion has been added to the savings pool of this nation under the existing tax regime thanks to these plans. Do not let anyone tell you that these plans are a perk for the rich because, under the plans in place, as of 1991 $3,100 on average had gone to benefit executive staff but $2,400 on average had gone to benefit shop floor staff. These plans have been a way of breaking down the inequalities not only between workers and bosses generally, but between blue and white collar workers and between shop floor and mahogany row employees in our Australian companies. I will go through some of the companies that have employee share ownership plans or which plan employee share ownership plans. It is a veritable cavalcade of the top companies in this country. It is a veritable who's who of business. We have names like AWA, the Advance Bank, Amcor, Apple Computer, the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Bank of Melbourne, Baulderstone Hornibrook, Boral, Brambles, Burns Philp, Cadbury Schweppes, Clyde Industries, CocaCola, Commercial Union Insurance, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Country Road, CRA, Fletcher Jones, Gillette, Goodman Fielder, Henry Walker, Hills Industriesproducer of the famous Hills Hoist that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) hates so much when it is sitting on the quarter-acre blockJames Hardie, Jennings Industries, Kraft Foods, Leighton Holdings, Lend Lease Corporation, National Australia Bank, Newcrest Mining, Normandy Poseidon, North Broken Hill Peko, Pacific Dunlop, Pasminco, South Australian Brewing, St George Building Society, the Australian Gas Light Company, Broken Hill Propriety Company, Tubemakers Of Australia, W.C. Penfolds, Westpac, ANZ, BTR Nylex, CSR, Email Ltd, Mayne Nickless Ltd, Pioneer International Ltd, Rothmans Holdings Ltd, and Western Mining Corporation. All these companies have employee share ownership plans and all of these plans are put at risk by this government's bill. In fact, if you believe what has been said by government speakers, every one of these companies to is a tax cheat. What a slander on these great companies. In particular, I draw attention to two of those companies-the Australian Industry Development Corporation Ltd, a former wholly owned company of the federal government, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, 50 per cent owned by the federal government. If all these companies with employee share ownership plans are tax cheats, the federal government, on its own words, is complicit in tax cheating. Isn't this ludicrous? And isn't the government's bill one that we could well do without? The interesting thing about this bill is that the government has even let down the ACTU. By bringing in this proposition to attack the ordinary form of employee share ownership plan, it has left plans based on negative gearing as the only form, or the most tax advantageous form, of employee share ownership plan. Those are plans that the ACTU has warned workers against and are plans which could actually end up leaving workers with significant debts, not significant assets. This is the result of this government's misguided plan. The fact is that, under the proposal of the federal government, an important vehicle for increasing national savings has been put at risk. Vince FitzGerald, an academic who is often commissioned by this government to do work on economic subjects, has estimated that, under the old tax regime applying to employee share ownership plans, national savings could be increased by half a percentage point a year up to the year 2000-'-that is, $2 billion a year that could be added to our national savings pool under the old tax regime. That is $2 billion a year that is going to be sacrificed under the plan that this government has now. What is more, FitzGerald estimates that, if the government were prepared to leave the old regime in place, it would gain $500 million a year more tax than under the proposal it has put before us in this bill. In other words, to get a little bit of short-term gain, this governcially ment is prepared to sacrifice a long-term benefit to itself, to taxpayers and to the whole Australian community. This bill is typical of the government's propensity to tax first and think later. That is what this bill demonstrates. It also demonstrates a pedantic, treasury driven world view and a complete failure to address equity issues in our society. This bill-this attack on employee share ownership plans, this attack on democratic capitalism-is going to make society even more unequal. It is going to exacerbate the equity problems that this government has enshrined. Under this government's policies, we already have a situation where 24 per cent of all Australian families have no-one with a job. Nearly one million children live in families where no-one has a job. We have a situation, thanks to this government, where nearly 2112 million Australians are either unemployed or underemployed. We have a situation where, since 1983, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. We have a situation where the number of people living below the official poverty line is something like 14 per cent higher than in 1983. There are two million people living under the official poverty line in Australia today, 300,000 more than in 1983. This bill to wipe out worker democracy and worker participation and this bill to entrench inequality in the workplace is just going to make the situation worse. The fact is that it is typical of this government to preserve privilege. It is preserving a situation where the rich get richer. f The cruel irony is that we have the richest Prime Minister in history presiding over a government which will not allow workers to get shares beneficially in their own companies. The Prime Minister can have his big house-his mansion, his palace-in Woollahra but workers cannot even have a few shares. The Prime Minister can have his lucrative piggery investment, which he has just sold at what is thought to be a massive profit, but workers cannot even have a few shares in their company. The Prime Minister can buy from and sell antiques to his mate Warren Anderson but workers cannot even be benefigiven a few shares in their own company. The Prime Minister can hobnob with the directors of the top 500 companies but those selfsame directors are no longer able to give a few shares to their own blue-collar staff. There is nothing wrong with getting rich, but there is a lot wrong with people who get rich while keeping other people poor. The great flaw of the market economy is not inequality itself but entrenched inequalitythe idea that property begets property and lack of property simply begets further lack of property. Marx was right to highlight the struggle between the haves and the have-nots, but he was wrong to assume that the solution was to abolish private property. The problem was not the existence of private property but the existence of gross disparity of private property and, hence, gross disparity of bargaining power and gross disparity of effective freedom. The solution was not to abolish private property but to ensure that all had reasonable access to private property of their own. That is what employee share ownership plans do-at least, that is what they did until the government proposed in this bill to take away their existing tax treatment and to subject them to the fringe benefits tax. Employee share ownership plans are a way of giving workers a stake in our society; they are a way of giving expression to that great Australian ideal of the fair go; and they are a way of enabling Jack and Jill to be as good as their masters by making them their own masters. It is not surprising that this . flint-hearted government is yet again hurting its own constituency. Let us face it: this government has betrayed its light on the hill; it has betrayed Ben Chifley's great aspiration to work for the betterment of mankind...,.,.not just but wherever we can lend a helping hand; and it has taken away the ability of companies to lend a helping hand to their own workers. Under governments up to 1983, the great achievement of Australian society has not been to implement democratic socialism-as the Labor Party once wanted to do-but to irnple-e.nt democratic capitalism. But, under this government, there has been a fair bit of capitalism-often capitalism of the worse sort-but precious little democracy. In proposing this bill, the government is saying to Australian workers, 'If you are a wage slave today, a wage slave is what you will remain. ' It is most noteworthy that, after years of moving to the right in tandem with the Australian Labor Party, this opposition is now returning to where, I would say, our heart has always been-to the middle ground of common sense and a fair go for everyone.",33
8,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Thank goodness the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) just sat down, because putting up with bibble-babble like that really tests your patience. I started wondering whether the honourable member was talking about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) and cognate bills before the House. He was talking about whether the government was making it easier for people to own shares. The answer is yes, we are making it easier for employees to own shares, but you would not know about it from having listened to the opposition member. The government has been asked why we are bringing share benefits into the fringe benefits tax net. The simple answer is: because they are income. Under the present arrangements, the shares are not going to the workers, whom the previous speaker was talking about; in the main, the shares are going to executives. So all of the benefits are going to executives and, by and large, the workers out on the work floor get very little. But, through the proposals the government is bringing in, we are saying that firms have to offer these benefits to all employees. If they do that, then they get the benefits. The simple fact is this: the best way to make sure that employees share in the benefits of a company by owning shares in a here company is to make sure that, where benefits are given, a company is required to extend those benefits to all employees and not just to a chos-n few. In debate we have also talked about compliance costs and about the employer having to pay the tax. I thought this had been argued and won back in 1986. It has been a long standing arrangement that the employer, because he gives the benefit, collects the tax. That is clearly much more efficient. For instance,. we have heard about the 50,000 employees. Imagine those 50,000 employees having to do the sums and provide the tax. It is clearly more efficient, if we are talking about compliance costs, for one employer to do that. That argument was won a long time ago. As I said, the proposed measures are about fair play. What we are saying""to employees is, 'If you want concessional treatment for share benefits .you have to provide them to all employees. If you wish to provide these benefits to a select few, then tax must be paid on the benefits as they would be on any other benefit.' An employee who gets an increase in salary of, say, $10 a week pays income tax on it. The government is not prepared to condone arrangements where share benefits worth millions of dollars are provided to top executives free of current taxation. The opposition wants to provide a tax break to the top"" few and is opposing the extension of these concessions to the ordinary workers. We are saying, 'We will provide liberal tax concessions if you provioe share benefits to all workers rather than just a select few.' I cannot reiterate that often enough. We are told that Coles Myer and BHP were each providing share benefits to around 50,000 workers under their share plans. The previous opposition speaker, the honourable member for Warringah, was shedding tears about the fact that these companies were scuttling these schemes. But what the opposition should know is that a company could under the proposed measures provide $500 of share benefits to each and every one of its employees absolutely free of tax-no fringe benefits tax, no income tax. What is more, the $500 worth of non-tax share benefits can be provided every year-not just once but every year. But the story does not end there. If a company issues shares at a discount to give each of its 50,000 employees share benefits of $500, it will get a deduction of $20 million in calculating its taxable income. That gives a saving of around $8 million in income tax. The government is offering to provide these tax benefits to companies that put in place genuine employee share schemes available to all employees. There is also the option, if you like, of a deferral concession of $1,500. That means that employees can defer tax on up to $1,500 of share benefits every year for between five and 10 years. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the nature of this measure is such that a reliable estimate cannot be .provided. The measures will have a significant impact in protecting the revenue againSt erosion through potential widespread abuse of the current provisions. They will stamp out this abuse and restrict the open-ended tax deferral advantages offered by existing share schemes. However, the measures will also involve a revenue cost depending on the number of companies that take advantage of the very liberal tax concessions proposed for genuine broad based employee share schemes. The government anticipates that, once the benefits of the new concessional arrangements are fully understood, a significant number of companies will take advantage of the concessions to provide share benefits to all of employees. For many schemes only modest changes would be required for them to fit within the new concessions. Indeed, this is already beginning to happen Let us have none of the debate we hear from the opposition that the government is stopping employees from gaining shares in their own companies. We are making sure that more employees get these benefits, and doing it in a more efficient and fairer way- In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who participated in the. debate. .

APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1994-95 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 199495 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1994-95 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 November, on motion by Mr Willis: That the bill be now read a second time.  Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) are being addressed cognately. I will address each of the bills in the,ir tum and then I propose to make the much needed observations on the manner in which the government continues to fail the taxpayers of this country with its blundering and inept approach to the management of the economy. These bills are of importance as they are the means by which government seeks moneys in order to fund its operations. However, it is more important for us to consider that these pieces of legislation are the approval process by which this parliament can vet those programs for which the funds are to be used and, subject to that process, provide the government with the financial capacity to carry out those programs. Appropriation Bill (No.3) seeks to appropriate from consolidated revenue the sum of $676 million. This appropriation of $676 million is in addition to. the amounts sought under Appropriation Bill (No.1) which formed part of the budget presented to this parliament in May this year. This bill makes provision for additional funds across the board for government departments that have been required to meet salary increases and also general increases in running costs of departments which were not calculated at the time of the budget. There is also the impact of previously announced government initiatives. The total of these amounts is approximately $167 million. The Department of Defence seeks an additional amount of $215 million for the following purposes. It seeks $186 million for equipment and stores. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), we were simply told that the need for this increase in funding was due to a carry over from 1993-94, provision for the payment of fuel excise and reprogramming of approved projects, together with a number of new equipment approvals. I have yet to see any supporting papers to indicate to me that these expenditures are necessary or that they have been properly costed. No doubt the minister will be able to provide the House with his assurance that he has examined all the relevant reports that would indicate that these sums are necessary to keep our defence forces at a required level of readiness. I strongly suggest that all the minister has done is to respond to the requests without giving them even a cursory glance-a trait that appears common in all of these requests for the use of additional taxpayers' funds. But more on that aspect later. Let us examine a few of these requests. A request of $13 million is made for defence facilities. We are told that the bulk of the requirement is due to a slippage from the 1993-94 upgrade of the sewerage system at Holsworthy. An examination of the portfolio overview for this program attributes the need for these additional funds to increased provisions for costs associated with the connection of Holsworthy to the New South Wales sewerage scheme. Perhaps the relevant minister would be able to make the choice as to which it is before the taxpayers are expected to foot the bill. At the same time, it may well be helpful if the minister at the table, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear),gave us the courtesy of some explanation of the end use of these additional funds. In the portfolio estimates, a provision of $8 million is made for the refurbishment of the Prime Minister's VIP Boeing 707. What concerns me is that this figure is likely. to already blowout to between $11 million and $14 million. It is not acceptable to this parliament that the opening estimate is not the full costing likely to be spent on the refurbishment of the Prime Minister's Boeing 707. A request of $11.7 million is made for defence housing, mainly reflecting an increased capital subvention to the Defence Housing Authority. This is how the Minister for Finance describes this payment in his second reading speech. I have reviewed the papers, and in particular the portfolio additional estimates statement, and the only reference I could find for the provision of increases in capital subvention payments is in respect of a $750 million capital program, where an additional $13.5 million is being sought. How can you expect the parliament to accept the numbers on this broad statement? The failure to provide this parliament with the detail necessary to make an informed judgment will no doubt be remedied in another place. This is, to me and to my colleagues on this side of the House, just another example of the contempt with which your party, and in particular your financial planner, the opera singer Placido the Great, treats the Australian people. This taxpayers' money we are concerned with is not yoursÂ· and it is not mine. We are charged with the most serious responsibility of ensuring, when moneys of the taxpayers of this country are to be spent, that that expenditure is warranted and necessary and being spent in the best interest of the taxpayers of this great country. We deserve an overview from you, Minister",37
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.  from you, Minister, that is more in keeping with your duty",39
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"No, from the minister.  from the minister that is more in keeping with his duty rather than his government's contemptuous attitude to the taxpayers' hardearned dollars. It is interesting go through these additional estimates, the consistency by which ministers have allowed their departments to rely upon appropriations to cover the early miscalculations by their department. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who in previous times made an art form of not knowing what went on around her and sat idly by while Labor in Western Australia wasted a billion dollars, is on the same path of inadequacy in her current job. A claim has been made for an additional $11 million for corporate leadership and resource management services. They have explained this additional claim as an adjustment to the price calculation-or, in plain English, they got their sums wrong. The adjustment for legal services of $107,000 means, in plain English, 'We miscalculated, Minister.' This is typical of the way in which your mob, to borrow some of the eloquence of Placido the Great, continues its disjointed policies-policies that will inevitably lead to higher interest rates and a continued growth in the current account deficit. While on the s\Jbject of the ex-Premier of Western Australia, her colleague in the other place, who job shares with her, will probably bumble out an explanation for her management deficiencies. Under the program for child-care fee relief there is a request for an additional $34 million with explanations in the portfolio estimate statements such as 'funds were higher than estimated', 'adjustment to budget estimates' and 'revision of projections'. This is simply not good enough for the taxpayer. While the Labor Party appears more than happy to embrace these explanations, I must say that members of the opposition are appalled at the inadequacy of these explanations and at the cheek of those charged with the care of the taxpayers' dollars to come to this place and put their hand out for more funds to cover up their fiscal ineptitude. I could continue an examination of the items comprising the balance of this bill, but continued examples of where this government has failed to take prudent care of the taxpayers' dollar will be the only result of such an to note, as we examination. The second bill we are examining today is the Appropriation Bill (No.4). This bill is brought before the House to seek authority from this parliament for the appropriation of the sum of $399.214 million from consolidated revenue. The Minister for Finance, in his second reading speech, listed a number of items for which these appropriations are sought to cover. Amongst these payments are $11 million for drought relief payments and $10 million for the matching dollar for dollar contribution to the farmhand appeal. In the request by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for additional funds, we have an amount of $926,000 sought under the program management support and advice. I must take a moment to remind honourable members of the objectives of this program: high quality and timely support services and advice delivered efficiently and effectively to meet the program objectives and the needs of the minister and the departmental program management. It is when the incompetence of the minister comes to the fore-incompetence that wastes taxpayers' dollars-that this parliament has the right to be severely critical. Again, hamstrung by the lack of detail, we can only surmise how much of the additional claim for $926,000 has been as a direct result of an incompetent minister seeking expensive legal assistance to try to get himself off the hook from the myriad of inquiries that he will and should be facing. The taxpayers should not have to bear the financial burden of this minister's incompetence. The solution was simple. As suggested by my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), he should have resigned; then we could have saved a lot of money and a lot of embarrassment to the taxpayer. Among the other programs identified as requiring additional expenditures are a numyet ber within the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio. Something that I believe should the tolerance of Australian taxpayers is request, on top of an amount of $1.5 million, for a further $370,000 to cover will celebrate events that will support the international year for tolerance activities. are spending $1.5 million to work out how spend $370,000. That should surely test the tolerance of anyone in respect of the fiscal negligence of this government. We shall watch with great interest the explanations the minister gives in the Senate estimates hearings as to the financial rabbiting in area. The final bill to be examined is the Appropriation (parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). An amount of $7 million is sought for the additional costs associated with the recurrent expenditures of this building. I have noted that, in the portfolio additional estimates, Joint House Department and the Department of Finance have agreed to finalise their deliberations on funding requirements for future years in time for the budget deliberprovide ations that will take place in is a move that I laud both departments for. It is important that, if we are to be at all critical of ministers and departments for their use additional estimates as another means budgeting, we should get our own house order. The items sought by this bill relate primarily to assets that require replacement. Again, I trust that the Joint House Department will be able to stick fairly rigidly to the year plan. One aspect that does concern me is the tendency for members to allow others to use the facilities of this House that are provided for members' use by the taxpayers. Of course, I am referring to the matter raised last day by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) concerning the use of photocopiers in the hallways of this House by people who were camped outside the parliament. When I spoke in the House on appropriation bills No. 1 and No. 2 on 7 June this year, I made the point that I considered that the government's land fund represented a cynical attempt by the government to buy off another interest group, and further that we have already seen it do this with the environtest mental lobby groups, the sporting fraternity the and women. This package of bills continues this cynical and unprincipled use of projects that taxpayers' funds. Within the community, this government's We targeting of particular interest groups is well to recognised for what it is-vote buying at the taxpayers' expense. After being caught in the sport rorts affair, Placido the Great and his minders are now making an art form of it. that Poor old Western Australia has been seen as a lost cause by the Prime Minister. We got rid this of his mob; we even provided him with an ex-Premier to advise him of how high on the nose his mob in WA is. No thanks to her, I might add. The reward is that we are not part of this cynical targeting that took place in his so-called cultural policy. The hypocrisy of this government and of this man that leads it the does not stop there. For those who are unfortunately the victims of the government's policies and have been unemployed for the long term, there are necessary measures to them with the assistance to return to that area. That the work force. The emperor-the person who gave us the recession that we had to have; who created, of with a bit of help from his camp followers, of over one million unemployed people-now in comes seeking further taxpayers' funds to remedy the. matters that were his doing in the first place. Government with responsible economic policies would not be involved in fivethis continual hypocritical use of taxpayers' money. The emperor takes great pride in making pontifications for all the good works he sponsors. It is almost akin to Nero giving a subsidy for musical education to buy. the arts vote and making announcements on fire Thursprevention measures in the next breath. These appropriation bills continue the big spending, high deficit policies of the Labor government. It is these policies which will undermine our economic growth and induce yet another boom-bust cycle in the Australian economy. As an Australian, the most frostrating thing about this government's economic policy is the absolute refusal of the Prime Minister to learn from his past mistakes. It not as though the Prime Minister has the weight of numbers on his side; he does not. His list of critics is long and distinguished, and includes the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Treasurer, Treasury, the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia and the majority of media commentators. But, no, the Prime Minister knows more about economic policy than all of them. He is the receptacle of divine insight into the economy and sees something that no-one else can see. No-one denies that fiscal policy has a role to play when the economy is struggling, as Australia was during the recession-that we did not have to have, I might add. But the time for that has passed. The economy is now growing, and it is time to pull back the deficit-to wind back the debt and consolidate the nation's accounts. Running such a large deficit during the great growth phase we are now in is economic vandalism. It runs up needless debt, places pressure on the current account and interest rates, and undermines the fight against inflation. Let us turn to debt. The Commonwealth is already paying $7.3 billion in interest payments. That is not paying off capital, just interest obligations. By 1997-98, this will have risen to $9.5 billion. As a taxpayer, I would rather this money go into education, roads and health. The Labor government would rather give it to the financial markets. It now seems as though the Prime Minister is trying to do a Kirner and endlessly notch up debt until, in the end, government financial flexibility is severely restrained by the need to repay debt. The elected government cannot readily set its own priorities because the banks are taking a bigger and bigger share. Is the Keating vision for Australia to have the Commonwealth government and taxpayers loaded down by debt? Failure to now reduce debt will see Australia go into the next downturn with a significant deficit and no buffer. If people believe that we will have an extended period of surplus to repay this debt, they are kidding themselves. By 1997-98, when we will still have a deficit of $2 billion, the economy will have been growing for seven years. If people think that, after seven is years of growth, we will then have a period of further sustained growth to get the debt levels down, they are again kidding themselves. What will happen is we will go into the next downturn with high levels of Commonwealth debt already in place and we will add to an existing mountain of debt. The Keating legacy to Australia, both to this generation and to the next generation, is debt, debt and more debt. Of course, the government will say that I am talking down the recovery and our prospects. But I am not; I am simply facing the reality. Of equal concern is the great restriction on Australia's economic growth-that is, the current account. Again the government is doing nothing to prepare Australia to deal with this current account blow-out. As the economy expands it is clear that there will be some deterioration in the current account, but not to the extent that we are seeing right now. The current account will not just overtake the government's forecast, it will blow it right out of the water. The government must play its role in increasing national savings and take pressure off the current account. It must do this by reining back the deficit. It will not do this; rather, it will just go on saying, as it has been doing to date, that everything is okay and we do not have to worry. It must be sadly ironic for those hundreds of thousands thrown out of work by government policies to now see the government sitting idly by allowing the current account to again grow beyond sustainable limits. The government has acknowledged that both fiscal and monetary policy have to play a role in our economic recovery. At the moment, the full weight of dealing with inflation is going into higher interest rates. With demand growing strongly there is no reason for such. a large deficit. All it is doing is fuelling inflation, increasing debt and undermining the current account. It should be wound back to help prolong the recovery. As alarm bells start to ring with growing intensity, what does this government-a government of words, not actions-have to say? Absolutely nothing. It has been said that this is the best set of figures for years and that we are on the verge of a golden era. This all sounds very familiar. It sounds like this is the one that will bring home the bacon. We have been in a golden age before, but it ended with one million people unemployed. The government ignored the warning signals then and it is ignoring them again. The current account is again spiralling out of control, interest rates are going up and the government is saying that everything is great and we have nothing to worry about. I am sorry, but things are not great. This government has not got it under control. We have a chance to consolidate this recovery, but you on the other side are blowing it, and for that you should hang your heads in shame. If you do not believe me as to how important deficit reduction and its elimination is, I will quote a source closer to your hearts. Do you remember this: Next financial year, the Commonwealth Government will budget for a surplus in excess of $3 billion. In other words, we will be repaying debt, rather than adding to it. Government saving through surpluses helps our external accounts in three ways. First, it means the Commonwealth can repay some of its own foreign debt. Second, more private funds are available for investment in export and import competing industries without borrowing from abroad. And third, curbing government spending will help to hold down domestic demand and import growth while the new industrial capacity is given time improve our trade balance. Mr Deputy Speaker, who do you think said those words? It was not Bernie Fraser, the Secretary to the Treasury or some of the financial management market analysts. The present Prime Minister said those words when he was the Treasurer in 1988. It is interesting. How soon we forget. The then great Treasurer in 1988 has forgotten the words he said then. Now he is too busy buying votes and racking up debt to worry about correct economic policy. He certainly knows what needs to be done, though. All we need to do is reflect on his statements of 1988. He simply lacks the backbone to do it, and the Australian people will pay for his weakness with lower growth and higher unemployment. The government will stand condemned for its weakness on this issue. Former senator Peter Walsh was attributed with calling Bob Hawke 'Old Jellyback' for his weakness in not taking hard decisions. I am sure that the former senator would now find a new holder for this title: he would now attribute it to the current Prime Minister. The Australian people will not thank the present Prime Minister for the debt mountain and his repeated mistakes. It is time that the government got back to the things that really matter to ordinary Australians: long-term sustainable growth, lower interest rates and jobs-jobs that still are not there for the long-term unemployed. Complacency and wishful thinking will no longer fit the bill.",39
12,Mr DODD,COMMITTEES,"I want to take this opportunity during the appropriation debate to bring a very significant report, commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research, to the attention of the parliament. Martin Bell of the University of Queensland and Rick Carr from the Cairns Economic Research Unit of the James Cook University of North Queensland released their study of Japanese temporary residents in the Cairns tourism industry last week. The subject of the report is very topical in Far North Queensland. The tourism industry in Cairns and Far North Queensland is booming. The natural to splendour of Far North Queensland is attracting domestic and international tourists in record numbers. The last decade has seen the tourism industry develop into one of Australia's key export dollar earning industries. In 1992 the tourism industry generated foreign exchange earnings of $8.2 billion. In 1991-92, the industry contributed about 5.5 per cent to GOP. The tourism industry provided 25 per cent of the gross regional product of the city of Cairns in 1992, according to the federal government's Industry Commission report on impediments to regional industry adjustment released in September 1983. In 1989-90, 18.7 per cent of international inbound passengers arriving in Queensland disembarked in Cairns. In 1980-81 it was only 3.7 per cent. A report prepared by the Queensland government's statistician, entitled Tourism Statistics in Queensland and the Queensland Tourism and TravelCorporation, shows that Cairns stands alone as the flagship for inbound international tourism. The report shows that, since 1988, inbound international traffic to Cairns has climbed 228.5 per cent. The success of the tourism industry in North Queensland is the result of a combinamarketing tion of factors, namely, appropriate governland ment policy, the initiative and foresight of local business community and substantial foreign investment, which, in the Far North, has come mainly from Japanese companies. In terms of government policy, I believe the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage listing of the wet tropics rainforest by the federal government in 1988 have ensured that international tourists know about these two great tourist attractions. Just as importantly, this government has ensured that they are both preserved and properly managed. More recently, Cairns got the lion's share of Queensland grants under the federal government's regional tourism development program in 1994. Over half the grants for the state came to the far north, including and $158,000 to go towards the implementation of the Cairns regional tourism strategy. The Far North Queensland Promotions Bureau has been a trailblazer in terms of regional tourism planning, and its current contribution to the Cairns regional tourism strategy is no exception. The strategy is comprehensive and addresses the interests of the many stakeholders in the Cairns tourism industry. The strategy recognises the need preserve the integrity of the key tourism resources of the region-the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics rainforests.,. - in interests of the tourism industry. I would like to congratulate the former manager of the FNQPB, Mr Geoff Donaghy, and its current manager, Mr Steve Noakes, for their success in driving the strategy. The Cairns business community has embraced the strategy with its. characteristic enthusiasm and foresight. This community had the wisdom to recognise the critical role an international airport would have for the growth of tourism commissioned by in the region. This year is the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Cairris international airport. The decision to build the airport was visionby ary and has had a dramatic impact on the development of Far North Queensland. But it is not just the building of an airport terminal Far that has led to Cairns's success; it is the of Cairns and Far North Queensas a destination of both domestic and the inbound tourists that has provided extraordinary growth in visitor numbers. The Cairns business community got another pat on the back this year in the form of the MCKinsey report. The report was commis-Â· sioned by theÂ· Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to survey business in regional areas. There is no doubt that Cairns came out the success story of the five regions that were reviewed. The study also looked at the experience of regions overseas and highlights the pivotal role of local leadership and shared vision in building regional investment. Cairns is geographically close to Asia. Cairns and Far North Queensland have always had close links with Asian countries. In the last decade, the Japanese, both as investors visitors to the region, have been a large part of the impetus to growth in the Far North Queensland tourism industry. For example, the number of Japanese tourists visiting the Cairns region has grown from 2,000 in 1985 to 170,000 in 1992. Increased Japanese visitor numbers have accounted for 42 per cent of the growth in international tourist numbers into the Cairns region. In fact, 33 per cent of all international to visitors in 1992 to Far North Queensland were from Japan. Just as importantly, Daikyo is the largest single tourism investor throughout the Queensland. In North Queensland, the company employs over 1,000 people. Japanese investors own 92.46 per cent of total foreign owned hotel rooms. It is not surprising, therefore, that there a big demand for Japanese speaking tour guides in the tourism industry in Cairns, which is where the thorny issue of immigration policy enters the debate. A report entitled Tourism 2000: Key directions for human resource development estimated that 1,200 Japanese speaking tour guides were employed in Australia at the end of 1991, up to 80 per cent of whom had temporary resident status. Many Japanese citizens are currently working in Cairns as tour guides or in other jobs in the tourism industry on temporary visas. Sectors of the tourism industry are in fact calling for the government to deregulate the temporary residents program to allow easier access to the Australian labour market for non-residents. There was previous controversy in 1992 when there was a push to import 2,100 Japanese tourist guides and the federal government refused entry. This led to the establishment of a Japanese language training course at Cairns TAFE. Training and proper accreditation must be a part of any future resolution of the problems that I will outline in this speech. In order to put some tour operators' push for further deregulation of the government's temporary residents program into context, I will briefly outline the current rules. The government's temporary residents program is designed to facilitate the entry of people who will contribute to the social, cultural or economic development of the Australian community.. There are. a number of principles that govern the entry of temporary residents. Employment must be available as a first priority to Australian citizens and permanent residents; the entry of temporary residents should not result in financial cost to the Australian cOmmunity; except for top management and senior academic staff, temporary residents should eventually be replaced by people recruited and trained locally; persons with specialist skills and abilities should be admitted whereÂ·this particularly enriches local talent and results in net employment benefit to Australian citizens. and permanent residents; and employment conditions and remuneration of persons admitted for temporary is residence must not be inferior to those of Australian citizens or residents doing comparable jobs. Working holiday-maker visas are also available to provide the opportunity for young people to holiday in Australia while supplementing their income through incidental work. The underlying objective is to enhance international relations by promoting cultural understanding on the part of both the applicant and local residents. As at June 1993, Australia had reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan. Young people between 18 and 31 years from these countries can enter Australia and stay for a maximum of 12 months. The conditions that apply to working holiday visas are: the main reason for entering Australia is to holiday and any employment is incidental to that purpose; the applicant has a reasonable prospect of gaining full employment in Australia; the applicant has sufficient funds for personal support; and the applicant is only permitted to work for anyone employer or in anyone location for a maximum of three months. I have received a number of complaints from Australian residents about these guidelines being breached in spirit, if not indeed in law. Just on anecdotal evidence alone, it is hard to accept that many of the tour guides from Japan came here on holiday and that their employment was incidental. In other words, it is hard to accept that many are not selected for positions before they leave Japan. When they get to Australia it has been suggested to me that some-I emphasise 'some' - tourist operators are prepared to bend, if not break, the rules to keep them in jobs for longer than three months. l will read into Hansard a letter from a constituent, an Australian Japanese speaking guide in the tourism industry, who has requested anonymity because of fear of victimisation: The letter rea.ds: Basically, there can be a major company (who may be a wholesaler of inbound tours) who for the sake of our example we will call COMPANY (A). Most of the larger companies occasionally use ... smaller guide companies. Such companies are very keen to please the much larger COMPANY (A) as they are usually a good source of work/income for them. We will call these companies (B), (C) and (D). These companies also use Japanese working! holiday visa guides. A co-operative is formed in which company (A)'s guides will in theory be paid by company (B), after their first 3 months is over, company (C), after 6 months etc. However in reality, the people concerned are always working for the original Company (A), but records will officially show that they have changed employers. Of course this arrangement is reciprocal, so all companies involved can theoretically keep their staff for the maximum of 12 months that their visas allows them to stay in the country. After this 1 year period many of the workers apply for working visas, under the sponsorship of the companies. It can take between 3mths-8mths for an application to be processed. In the mean time the visa holders concerned are able to work. Many receive their working visas which allows them to stay for a further 2 years. If they are in a relationship, (of which the majority are after 1 year) they can sponsor their boyfriend/girlfriend as a defacto, allowing them to stay and work also. The major problem for Australians, is that guides staying longer than 3 mths are being trained to do the more illustrious jobs, when they wouldn't otherwise be trained if they were only staying 3 months. If the 3 month stipulation was adhered to, companies would actively seek out Australian residents to work for them as they would not require retraining every 3mths, and would be trained to handle the more sophisticated jobs leaving the more menial jobs to the workingfholiday visa guides. This I feel would be more in line with the spirit of the workingfholiday visa program, ie; they are used to plug the gaps in the work-force that Australian residents can't fill, and not squeezing Australian residents out of the gap and blocking entry to it (for newcomers to the industry ie; school-Ieavers, graduates etc), which is the current status-quo. In some cases quite serious stand-over tactics used, giving small operators (who are dependent on work from the larger companies) no option but to co-operate. These small operators can be one man operations (Australian) who basically risk their livelihood, and consequently feel they have no choose but to cower to the demands of Company (A). If you require more information, or specifics please feel free to contact me. I appreciate your time and confidentiality. I A serious allegation has been made in that letter. It must be emphasised that we are talking about only a part of the tourism industry in Far North Queensland. Many operators go out of their way to employ Australians as tour guides and most do not flout the rules. These concerns make the subject matter of the report into Japanese temporary residents in the Cairns tourism industry that I referred to earlier very timely. The report found that working holiday-makers were the largest single visa class in Australia as temporary residents. As of July 1993, there were 4,368 Japanese working holiday-makers in Australia. The report notes that, while not all of those were necessarily working at any one time, they represent a substantial potential addition to the Japanese born work force. The report found that some employers surveyed preferred Japanese tour guides because they were more culturally sensitive and ultimately brought more money into the business. However, other employers preferred Australian resident tour guides because their Japanese clients wanted contact with real Australians. ThisÂ· debate will continue to bubble. What concerns me is the possibility that there are suitably qualified Australian resident Japanese tour guides who are unemployed or underemployed in a casual industry. I have assisted in forwarding all allegations of rule breaking to the immigration department in Cairns. As I understand it, the department is currently investigating a number of complaints. Cairns has a mutually beneficial relationship with Japanese foreign investors and Japanese tourists; however, it is not acceptable for some Australian citizens to miss out on job are opportunities because some-I stress sometourist operators are rorting the immigration rules. I finish my speech by reading the last few paragraphs of the executive summary of the Bell and Carr report into Japanese temporary residents in the Cairns tourism industry. It accurately sets out the current issues facing the government and tourism industry in this regard. It states: Although access to temporary residents has been an important element in the growth and development of the Cairns tourism industry, the skill profile of Japanese temporary residents sits uncomfortably with the ostensible goals of Australia's skilled temporary residents program. Certain groups of Japanese, such as clerks, tour guides, and sales and service workers, appear to be in relatively lowskilled occupations which border on being contract labour rather than professional transients. Even in the case of Managers and administrators, it appears doubtful that the roles performed by this group meet the expectations set down for the Executive class of temporary residents. There is also some evidence of exploitation of the system in the form of pre-arranged itineraries for working holidaymakers. Moreover, it is apparent that once granted entry, temporary residents tend to become part of the pool of available labour, moving relatively freely between employers. These problems reflect the progressive shift that has occurred in Australia's temporary residents program towards liberalisation of labour market testing, and reduction of skill requirements in the interests of promoting economic development. The burden of contemporary opinion is towards further liberalisation of the rules to open up the Australian labour market to overseas competition, matching similar moves with respect to lowering of tariffs on commodities and opening up of financial markets. In the long term, such liberalisation may confer significant benefits. However, the formulation and implementation of migration law in this field is ultimately a delicate balance between furthering economic development and ensuring that Australian residents are not disadvantaged. The difficulties involved are heightened by the concentrated impacts of temporary residents on specific occupations, industries and regions, as this particular study serves to demonstrate. This report argues that until a great deal more is understood about the dynamics and impacts of the temporary residents program, particularly in localised contexts, such calls for further liberalisation of labour markets premature. In my view, this appears to be an understatement. Whilst I welcome cultural exchange, it must not be at the expense of jobs that Australians can perform. This is not the intent of either working holiday visas or temporary resident visas. In the future, the tourism industry should work with the employees, their representatives and government to provide training and career paths. I have already spoken to leaders of the tourism industry and they have agreed with this proposition. The report to which I referred requires considered reading. A copy has gone to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). The minister has announced the formation of a committee to inquire into 'temporary entry of business people and highly skilled specialists', to be chaired by the Managing Director of Fujitsu Australia,. Mr Neville Roach. I look forward to a policy outcome which promotes tourism, training and cultural exchange but which also provides long-term employment to Australians currently in the labour market, as well as to future generations.",42
13,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"Curtin) (12.39 p.m.)Appropriation Bill (No.3) and cognate bills demonstrate that the 1994-95 budget has yet again failed to provide the required financial responsibility or common sense in the management of Australia's finances. When the federal government brought down its budget in May, Australia needed it to initiate a program of budgetary reform to restore a promise of balance to the nation's finances. Instead, Labor has shamelessly given us its 1994-95 budget with more of the same old recipe that sent Australia into the worse recession since the Great Depression, a recession from which many are still recovering. This was a budget of missed opportunities. More ominously, it was a budget from a government that has become not only complacent but downright irresponsible in power; a case government that is starting to believe its own flawed political rhetoric. Repeatedly in this House, we have heard are the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) speak of his government as one of renewal and innovation. Let me categorically say that there is nothing new, let alone innovative, with Labor's destructive approach to economic management. Rather than adopting responsible policies in the current upturn, Labor chooses to adopt a loose fiscal approach, again subjecting Australians to another one of its economic and fiscal gambles. It is a gamble in which the Prime Minister is using the hopes and aspirations of all Australians as his betting chips in a game where the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against our entire population. The government is betting that the present recovery will turn into the longest economic expansion in Australia's recorded economic history and will painlessly solve all of its deep-rooted fiscal problems. But the very real risk of the government's gamble is that everything will not go as the. Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) hope; that the recovery will peter out sooner than they believe and that the government will condemn the country to going into the next economic downturn with a substantial budget deficit. To illustrate the reality of the scenario, the 1994-95 budget assumes a rise in business investment of 14.5 per cent. Business investment needs to sustain a record annual growth of 10 per cent for the next five years if Australian output is to grow by an average of four to five per cent a year for the rest of the decade. Unfortunately for Australia, history is not on Labor's side. It is merely a pious hope. History tells us that, in the past 2S years, Australian business investment has not been able to achieve double digit growth for two consecutive years, let alone over 10 years. Furthermore, in order to sustain output growth of four to five per cent this decade, we need business investment to rise by double digits for the next six years. In investment terms, the government needs a miracle. The reality is that Labor has burdened our economic recovery with a fiscal policy that has added, and will continue to add, unnecessarily to the current account deficit and, as a consequence, to our already enormous foreign debt. Those sitting opposite would no doubt spout their usual rhetoric and argue that our economic prospects seem to be glowing. To quote Mandy Rice-Davies from the Profumo spy scandal affair, 'They would say that, wouldn't they?' After all, they would say growth has improved, there has been little officially recorded inflation and it seems likely that the budget forecast of 4.5 per cent for the fiscal year 1994-95 will be met. I for one am not convinced by its polish. When one looks under the surface, the economic reality is far from glowing. History shows that somewhere down the track, sooner rather than later, there will be an unpredicted shock: the business cycle will / simply reassert itself and the economy will slide. If the budget deficit has not been reduced fast enough or far enough during the present upswing, our scope to counter any downturn by loosening fiscal policy will be much more limited than in the 1990s, leaving the all too familiar prospect of a return to even higher unemployment levels. My concerns are not without foundation. There are fundamental signs in the economy that I and many others regard as disturbing. The message that all is not well is becoming increasingly evident right across the broad spectrum of economic and social indicators. There is no doubt that this government is ignoring these signs in pursuit of a policy agenda that not only is jeopardising our economic recovery but is sure to spell disaster for Australia's longer term economic prosperity. For those sitting on the government benches opposite, I will provide some disturbing facts that illustrate my concerns. Despite the government's claims, unemployment is still a major economic and social problem in this country. It is the main cause of family breakdown, poverty and crime, and it represents a major underuse of our resources. It is also a drain on the budget. Even without including the masses of people who are conveniently left out of unemployment statistics, there are still some 800,000 people-or 9.1 per cent of 'our work force-out of work. But the real picture is much worse. Underemployment is a real factor. What is the government doing to solve our unemployment problems? Is it tightening fiscal policy and reducing the budget deficit? Is it stimulating investment and microeconomic reform? Is it fostering lasting growth in the economy? The answer to each of those questions is clearly: no, it is not doing any of these things. It is continuing its wasteful practice of throwing money into mostly pointless and often unaccountable training programs. Indeed, one of the appropriations in these bills currently being debated proposes to throw another $30 million of taxpayers' money into this bottomless pit. The reality of the situation is that such schemes do little more than improve official unemployment statistics by temporarily taking the long-term unemployed out of the unemployment equation. Even the participants would agree that these programs offer little to improve their employment prospects. Expressing concern for the unemployed on face value is easy, but we should begin to judge by actions and not by words alone. Formulating efficient, effective and equitable policies to permanently reduce the numbers of unemployed-particularly long-term unemployedis much more difficult and requires more than just throwing money at the problems, as this government has become accustomed to doing. What about our foreign debt? Australia still has a massive debt problem. Our net foreign debt is currently around $160 billion and our gross foreign debt is in the order of $200 billion. Net foreign debt has grown around sevenfold in the last decade of Labor's regime, and will continue to expand rapidly as investment spending accelerates and as our call on foreign savings to finance investment increases. Labor's unacceptable build-up of foreign debt is making our economy vulnerable to swings in investor confidence and is compromising what is left of our economic independence. At a time when state governments are adopting a responsible approach to economic management by bringing their levels of debt under control, the level of Commonwealth debt is continuing to rise at an alarming rate. Federal government debt alone threatens to rise. to an outrageous $90 billion in the very short term. Furthermore, our current account deficit is expanding at an alarming rate, particularly given that the investment pick-up has barely begun. In fact, Australia's whole set of national accounts is disgraceful. The September current account deficit was $1.8 billion in seasonally adjusted terms. That followed the August deficit of $2.2 billion and the July deficit of $1.7 billion. At this rate, Australia will record a deficit in 1994-95 of around $22 billion, or 4.9 per cent of GDP, which will exceed the government's own budget forecast of $18 billion, or four per cent of GDP, by a massive $3 billion. The government continues to carry on about keeping interest rates low in the wake of the recession, yet we have already seen official interest rates rise and pressure on them to rise again. No matter what Labor's rhetoric would suggest, interest rates in Australia are extremely high by international standards. Australia has close to the highest real interest rates in the developed world. The OECD predicts that by 1995, that is next year, Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates in the OECD. Furthermore, the Economist magazine shows that Australia has the highest prime lending rate of all the OECD countries surveyed. The signs continue to get worse. Our current level of savings is close to the lowest as a proportion of GDP that we have experienced since the Second World War. This and accumulated government budget spending are the main causes of our balance of payment problems. Alarmingly, the level of gross savings, which measures private and public consumption of fixed capital as saving, is only about 16 per cent of gross domestic product. It is substantially less than is needed to finance the level of investment demand required to sustain an economic recovery without overheating the economy and the attendant risk of sending us back into recession. Implicit in our savings woes is the doubt hanging over our ability to sustain adequate levels of investment. While our investment levels have been very low for a long time, business investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is close to reaching its lowest level in 40 years. There are some indications of investment picking up but this is yet to be confirmed. However, even 14.5 per cent, as predicted in the budget, is not all that good coming off such a low base. Australia suffers from serious structural flaws in its economy, such as high interest rates and a highly centralised industrial relations system, which pose long-term barriers to investment. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) rants and raves and boasts about his industrial relations reforms but the fact remains that nothing of any substance has been achieved. We are told that there are over 2,000 enterprise agreements but most of them are identical, having been inflicted by unions on employers, snared in a net with no alternative, nowhere else to go. Because of the incompetence of the Minister for Industrial Relations, the situation in many circumstances has become substantially worse. One need look no further than the ANL saga. The government has capitulated to the demands of its union mates, regardless of the damage this will do to industrial relations reform and to competition in this country. And the government's incompetence does not stop there. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2), which we debated in the House earlier this week, not only highlights just how weak the minister is in implementing real industrial relations reform but also provides a classic example of the extremes to which this government is prepared to go to appease its union mates. There are other worrying signs. In particular, there is concern over the possible consequences of emerging wage pressures. Mr Bernie Fraser, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, in his talk to the 23rd conference of economists commented: A free-for-all in wage and price setting, which threatened a major breakout in inflation, would be countered by much larger increases in interest notwithstanding possible consequences for activity and employment. What do we see in the light of Mr Fraser's remarks? Just this week we have learnt that the Transport Workers Union is once again bent on holding the country to ransom with demands for wage increases over 15 per cent that carry with them the strong possibility of industrial unrest and a national strike, on top of the inflationary impact. Let there be no misunderstanding here: the large wage increases being pursued by the powerful unions have the potential to seriously undermine any sustained economic recovery. The undeniable fact of the matter is that, until we achieve real workplace reform, Australia will never be able to compete on an even footing in world markets. There is no doubt that the reform to which I am referring will never be achieved by a government, such as the current Labor government, which is only too happy to jump into bed with its j union mates, regardless of the consequences of such action for the well-being of this country. Despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and other ministers, the fact remains that Australia still faces substantial immediate and longer term economic problems. As much as the government is trying to obfuscate and hide it, I am not the only one who recognises this fact. BIS Shrapnel has recently released its long term forecasting report which shows that Australia is still very much caught in a boom and bust cycle. The report forecasts that the economy will falter in 1996-97 with interest rates and inflation rising, a blow-out in the current account deficit and growth reduced to less than one per cent. The report stresses the long-term damage that the period of low investment growth since the last recession has done to the economy. The report aptly states: The seeds of the next downturn have already been sown by the failure of the federal government to induce sufficient investment in the recovery stage of the business cycle. Access Economics similarly issued a warning over the medium-term economic outlook in its October publication of Economics Monitor. The report said amongst other things: rates, The government's medium-term policy focus has been thrown off course by the sharp rise in global long bond yields and the rapid deterioration in Australia's current account deficit. That report maintains that the government's unwillingness to adjust its loose fiscal policy means that there will be a rapid run-up in short-term interest rates which will impact quickly on cash flows. The fact is that Australia is now facing international competition which is stronger than ever before. In the face of this competition, we have the option of either making a concerted effort to improve our economic performance, which means tightening fiscal policy to reduce deficit spending, or continuing to go down the path of acute cyclical ups and downs. From the depths of the recession of its own making, Labor has had to make a choice: it could have seen strong growth as an opportunity to tighten its economic and fiscal policy and implement faster structural and micro-economic reform within the economy or it could have become complacent and decided that the best policy would be to continue down the same old course and not rock the boat before the next election. Sadly for Australia, Labor has quite clearly opted for the latter, easier option. By choosing not to rock the boat with an election in mind, Labor has well and truly missed the boat. Australia is suffering a government that has run out of steam when it comes to implementing reforms needed to secure economic prosperity, a government that has run out of ideas and a government that Australians will have every reason to vote out of office at the first opportunity.",46
14,Mr GIBSON,COMMITTEES,"In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and Appropriation (parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), I would like to remark on an issue of very great importance to me and a number of my colleagues from Queensland, and that is the issue of the allocation of tertiary places. The issue goes to the very heart of this government's commitment to the fundamental importance of the principles of fairness and equity. As you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, being the excellent Queensland member that you are, there is a funding disparity in the allocation of higher education places in Queensland as opposed to other parts of Australia. Despite the ugly head of parochialism which has arisen in some sections of the Victorian and South Australian academic and political community...,..I will comment on that later-it is easy to establish that Queensland is under-resourced. At the moment, 17.6 per cent of the national population lives in Queensland. That share is growing year by year as more Australians realise the error of their ways and move from the rust-belt states of South Australia and Victoria to the sun-belt state of Queensland. However, despite having 17.6 per cent of the national population, Queensland is currently receiving only 16.6 per cent of Australia's university places. On the other hand, 25.3 per cent of the population lives in Victoria-and that percentage is going down-and Victoria has 27.1 per cent of tertiary places. That amounts to an overallocation to Victoria of more than 10,000 tertiary places. Since 1974, when the federal government assumed responsibility for fully funding tertiary places, the number of publicly funded places in Queensland has always been under the national average. Queensland also has the second highest retention rate of school students to year 12. At 82.9 per cent, it is the second highest rate of all Australian states, and yet only 48 per cent of year 12 students gained admission to higher education courses in the following year. The overall effect of these statistics is that Queensland continues to have a level of tertiary qualifications significantly lower than the Australian average. Queensland is experiencing an economic growth rate of 6.5 per cent, with' an increase of 100,000 jobs in the past four years. The state needs tertiary qualified and highly skilled people in its work force. The issue is not about the expansion of Australia's tertiary education system through greater funding of under-represented states such as Queensland; the issue is about the reallocation of existing resources within the system to achieve fairness and equity. In August this year, the joint working party of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council made the following comment: There is certainly no overall demographic imperative for further immediate publicly funded expansion of the system. Despite the fact that the Australian population will increase by over three million between now and the year 2011, there will be an absolute decline in the population in the age cohorts from which higher education participants are predominantly drawn. Importantly, the places already allocated to the higher education system will allow substantial growth in age participation rates into the next century. The discussion paper went on to say: The Working Party is strongly of the view that the Commonwealth must take action to ensure that imbalances in the supply of Commonwealth resources for higher education between States and Territories are not exacerbated. I could not agree more. Since 1990, my federal Labor colleagues from Queensland and I have been extremely active in our campaign to improve Queensland's share of tertiary places. Our constant lobbying for places has seen the total number of undergraduate student places grow from 52,090 in 1990 to 69,460 in 1995. That has been a substantial achievement. However, it is regrettable that Queensland will still be over 4,000 student places short at the start of the 1997 academic year if the current ratio of distribution of places across Australia is maintained. However, this inequity is not confined to Queensland. Universities in western Sydney, northern New South Wales and Western Australia are also significantly disadvantaged by the current distribution of places. Because of this fact, over 30 federal Labor members of this parliament from those areas-western Sydney, northern New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland-have joined together to form the Fair Share Task Force to fight these distribution inequities in our higher education system. We are continuing the hard work on behalf of the families in our electorates who have suffered in the past, and we are continuing to work on behalf of students in all of our electorates to gain a fair share of tertiary places. We have been having regular meetings with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), whose door has been always open to us and who has listened to us in a very positive way. As convenor of the Fair Share Task Force, I would like to reaffirm our support for the education policies and programs of this government, which have witnessed record retention rates for secondary school students to year 12. Nearly eight out of 10 young people now complete their final year, compared to less than half that figure in 1982, and in 1993 there were nearly 90,000 more tertiary commencements than a decade earlier, with an increase in Commonwealth funding of higher education of over 50 per cent for the same period to a figure now of $4.6 billion. These are substantial achievements by this government and show our commitment as a government to higher education. Successive . federal Labor education ministers have very effectively restructured the Australian higher education sector to make it a relevant and competitive sector of the Australian economy. Our Fair Share Task Force supports the contributions of the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training and acknowledges his commitment to redress the imbalance in student places suffered in states like Queensland and Western Australia and, of course, in most parts of New South Wales. The DEET Higher Education Council working party identified three categories of options which the federal government could adopt to redress the imbalance of places. These were, firstly, the redistribution of some proportion of existing places currently available to the higher education system; secondly, the funding of additional student places from within the resources currently allocated to the sector, either through the use of an efficiency levy, the redirection of existing postgraduate subsidies or utilisation of non-operating grant funds; and, thirdly, the funding of growth through the utilisation of private resources. The first option is one that will provide the long-term benefits to redress the imbalance for Queensland students. I agree that there is no further need to expand the tertiary sector with an additional injection offunds, but I do believe that justice for Queensland has to come through the redistribution of existing places currently available in the system. This should involve Victoria and South Australia conceding some of their higher education positions to Queensland, Western Australia and parts of New South Wales. However, I do call on the government to initiate action to create some additional student places for 1996. It is clear that we are not able to take action at this point to provide places for 1995, because funding commitments have already been made and institutions have already made decisions based on that allocation of funds that had been determined previously. But there is some scope for us to address this issue in 1996, and with the renegotiation of the triennium period that starts in 1997 a redistribution should definitely occur from that date. The fixing-up for 1996 should be done by using the discretionary funds such as the quality assurance money, which was one of the options discussed in the DEET Higher Education Council working party discussion paper. It said in that paper: The Quality fund was seen by a majority to have served a useful purpose, and to have generated much positive change. But it was also argued that it may be desirable to amend the existing Quality process in the future, especially noting that an annual recurring cycle after the first two or years may be of increasingly marginal benefit. Therefore a less frequent cycle of Quality funding could be contemplated, freeing up some funds for additional places. So it is clear that the expert committee that the government established to review this whole question backs up our claims that in 1996 we should get access to some of that quality assurance money, because the higher priority is funding of places toÂ· those areas which have been significantly disadvantaged until now. In 1996, $75 million has been set aside for the quality fund, to be used at the discretion of the minister on the recommendations of the quality committee. On behalf of my colleagues in the Fair Share Task Force, I call on the minister to use a proportion of these funds to allow more Queenslanders and students from those other disadvantaged states who are unable to gain tertiary admission a chance to come in from the cold. Quality assurance funds should be used to fund additional growth places in these institutions in 1996. That will be a short-term solution for 1996, but a long-range problem will require substantial renegotiation of the triennium funding for universities, and decisive action will be required by the government to address those longer-term needs. Despite the commitment of increasing places in this funding triennium and the expectation of considerably more places for Queensland at the start of the new triennium in 1997, it is important that we take action as soon as we can. That will require decisions next year to reallocate the quality assurance money so that in 1996 some of those funds can be used to purchase additional places. Quite simply, on all of the mainstream indicators for higher education resource allocation-age profile of the population, retention to year 12, sustained demand for higher education, economic growth, graduate employment and distribution of employment across the various industry groupsQueensland has an established case for a fair share of higher education opportunities. Thankfully, this case is recognised by the current federal Minister for Employment, three Education and Training, who has stated his position on several occasions. Members of the Fair Share Task Force realise that we have the support of the minister, and we appreciate that support. We also realise that the budgetary demands under his responsibility do not allow him to take any financial decisions for next year. Rather than sensationalising this emotive issue of access to education, it is our aim and desire to see this imbalance rectified fairly, constructively and with a high degree of financial responsibility. Unfortunately, some states are openly hostile towards achieving fundamental equality in the distribution of tertiary places. Not surprisingly, this attitude comes from some elements of the academic and political communities in Victoria and South Australia, the two states which at the moment are enjoying an unnaturally high number of tertiary places. On 1 November this year, the Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education in South Australia, Mr Bob Such, wrote to his state's senators urging them to reject moves towards making our higher education system fairer. He said: The State Government has joined with the three SA universities to reject the unsubstantiated and illogical notion that distribution of growth in the higher education system should be juggled in the ways being considered by the DEET-Higher Education Council. He continued: I now understand that 31 Labor MPs from the so called 'growth states' ... The figures clearly show that we are the growth states and that we have received some backing from our federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who is a Queenslander and who recognises the disparity that is occurring. Mr Such continued, in his ill-conceived manner: It would be outrageous if Federal Cabinet was to accept the notion that university places should be taken from some States and given to others purely on the basis of an outmoded State{ferritory borders mentality. This is a rather amazing comment coming from a state that often espouses states rights and accuses the Commonwealth of interfering with the rights of states. Yet when we actually seek to have some redress in the imbalances that have occurred he says, 'You should not use states as the boundary for determining whether or not people should get funds.' He is saying it is okay to discriminate positively in favour of South Australia and Victoria; it does not matter if students in northern New South Wales or western Sydney or Queensland or Western Australia continue to suffer. What"" an illogical attitude he has. His parochialism is clearly unhealthy and unfitting of a man of his stature in the national political system. I am sure that his attitude would surprise many people, particularly his Liberal Party colleagues in South Australia and throughout the rest of Australia who have always espoused very strongly the notion of states rights. I also register my extreme disappointment at some of the statements emanating from sections of the Victorian academic community. When they realised that their stranglehold on teaching and student places was under threat, people such as the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, Professor Mal Logan, had the hide to describe Queensland as an academic backwater. Comments like that do not help the debate. They display an arrogance and a culturally superior attitude which are similar to those of Mr Such from South Australia. I can only conclude that this is the result of being continually given a silver spoon when it comes to higher education places. Their rhetoric may continue to flow but, on the hard evidence that we have put forward in this House today, their case does not measure up. Following research conducted by my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), we can also identify further silent discrimination against many of the newer tertiary institutions in growth states such as Queensland, as well as against the I University of Western Sydney, which is in the electorate of the member for Werriwa. Apart from the University of Queensland, which was founded in the early decades of this century, most of the higher education institutions in Queensland and in these new growth areas are still in relatively early stages of development. In this respect, they lack the considerable networking power of the older, established universities, which receive considerable sums in endowments and private donations. In 1993, universities in Victoria received over $48 million in private funding, as opposed to just over $8 million for the Queensland tertiary sector. Whilst no-one should begrudge the Victorian institutions this significant advantage, it is a factor that needs to be highlighted. It is a further head start which most Queensland institutions do not enjoy at this stage. I have taken an obviously pro-Queensland stance on the issue of additional tertiary positions. However, I hope I have been able to make constructive comments which show that I believe that this is an issue of fairness and equity. I am privileged to have in my electorate one of Australia's most progressive and innovative universities, Griffith University. Although it commenced operations only in the early 1970s, it has fast acquired a national and international reputation, particularly in the field of environmental sciences. From a straight degree-based program in environmental studies, Griffith University is now integrating an all-important environmental aspect into a range of other degrees, including engineering and town planning. I want to witness Griffith University and other tertiary establishments within Queensland and the other growth areas of Australia reach their full potential. Like any organisation, a university is only as good as its human and financial resources. If a university is going to reach its full potential it must have the staff, the students and the funding to achieve its best. In conclusion, I quote from the Queensland government submission to the DEET working party: The availability of a highly skilled workforce is critical to advancing Australia's place in the global economy, particularly as those sectors of the economy which are based on intellectual capital increase their share of total economic activity. Higher education has a major role to play in underpinning this growth. It also has a major role to play in building an Australian society which is socially just, democratic and tolerant In this context, equality of access to higher education opportunities must be a national goal. I urge the minister to make additional places available to Queenslanders in 1996 and beyond to ensure that fairness and equity are achieved in this important area of government policy.

I do not intend to canvass them again, except to state once again a consistent approach I have adopted to retrospective measures; that is, they are Ilot acceptable to me. As a general rule, they are not acceptable to the coalition. However, the coalition, in its wisdom, has decided on this occasion not to register what I think is the right position, which is that retrospectivity in our law, particularly our tax law, should not be given any place at all.",54
16,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"What we are talking about here is tax avoidance. That is why we are putting this particular provision in. Firstly, let me just say that, in relation to perks for selected executives who benefit from unlimited tax deferral under existing employee share schemes, there is a blatant tax avoidance schemeMr Rocher-I rise on a point of order. This item refers to superannuation funds; it has got nothing to do with share schemes. If the minister does not understand that, he should keep quiet.",54

20,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I was referring to superannuation. In fact, superannuation can be considered to be a perk. In relationÂ· to superannuation, which alsoMr Connolly- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister clearly does not know the government's policy. It has it in law that superannuation is now a requirement of employment. It is not a perk. ,",54
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,There is no point of order.,54
22,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"We are talking about retrospectivity; we are going back to a former time when that was the case. The situation here is very simple: when an employer contributes superannuation for an employee, he gets a tax deduction for it. If too much superannuation is put into a fund and money is paid back to a company, we expect that to be assessable, because we have already given a deduction for it. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a fairly simple concept; it has been around for a long time. In fact, the relevant provision in this case has been there since 1964 and is fairly well understood. But what we are talking about here is where the excess funds are not paid directly back to the company that p,rovided them but are paid to a third party, such that the company that paid them can still effectively use those funds. We are saying that they should not be tax free. In cases like that, where the intent of the law is clear and there is an arrangement in place that seeks to get around that law, of course the government is going to use retrospective legislation to protectÂ· the revenue. Any competent government would do the same.",54
23,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) condemns himself out of his own mouth. He quite rightly says that the law has been around for a long time. But, apparently, the law was not around on 1 July 1988, because that is when the measure is to take effect from. So, clearly, the law to deal with the problem has not been around. Whose fault is that? It is not the fault of the people in the wider community acting in accordance with the law as it is written; it is the fault of this government. That was six years ago. The government has had six years to find this out. I have no objection to this item as it is applied prospectively; it is a legitimate measure. But to penalise people who have been acting in accordance with the letter of the law for six years in the way that is now proposed is unconscionable, and that is the situation we invariably get into. It was a fault with the drafting of the law but, if it has been a problem for six years, when was it first picked up and why was it not picked up earlier? We are not just talking about retrospectivity; we are talking about six years. Apparently in that time the law has not been adequate to meet what the minister now says has been I always intended. The government has not got a very good policing system if this has been allowed to go for so long. Sure, there might be some smart alecs out there who have regarded the situation that prevails as a loophole, something to be taken advantage of in their tax planning and tax minimisation schemes. But there are other people who are acting innocently, and it does not matter whether they knew or did not know what the government's intention was. Neither should be penalised in this way. No burden should be imposed retrospectively. Item agreed to, Mr Rocher dissenting. Schedule 1, items 89 to 91-by leavetaken together, and agreed t6.

25,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I will not hold the House up for long except to say I have not seen the explanatory memorandum which has just been produced. It is just another occasion on which to register dissatisfaction with the way these matters are dealt with. I did touch earlier on the introduction of more than four pages of government amendments to a bill which has not been off the press for all that long, perhaps three or four weeks, from memory. But here we have the government at the death knell, as it were, introducing more than four pages of detailed amendments to an already substantial omnibus tax bill. It does not serve any good purpose, it seems, to complain about these matters. It is far from the first occasion, and the arrogance with which the government tends to treat this chamber suggests that it is going to continue. But Jguess it is worthwhile registering my objections once again. We cannot possibly be in a position, not having seen the explanatory memorandum, to pass judgment on the detail of these amendments. It is foolish to even pretend that we can. Such are we legislators in this country that the parliament is unable to seriously discuss what are, after all, pretty important measures to taxpayers and in principle, I suspect, to Australians generally.",56
26,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I rise in response to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). If the charge he makes were true, the government could be held up to the sort of criticism we have just heard, but I am told that the Treasury spokesman had these amendments on Monday, so it seems to me that the opposition has not got its act together in distributing the 1992 amendments to the members who wished to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill. I point out that once again it can be seen why members opposite are in oppositionthey just cannot get a piece of information, vital as it is, from the Treasury spokesman to the people who are going to speak on the legislation. I make a point in my office of making sure that people who are going to speak on bills which I am sponsoring are acquainted with all of the material. So all of the government members had their material, and I am surprised to learn that the opposition members did not have it when it was available to them.",56
27,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Curtin) (1.31 p.m.)Firstly, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) says the amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill have been available since Monday. It does not take the heat out of my criticism, because the bill has been around for four weeks and this measure was to be debated on Monday. Had the government schedule been followed-but members know how the government manages to mismanage the program in this place-I would not have had the material, and there would have been no reason for me to believe that it was available. Secondly, the minister says that everyone on the government side had it, and he also said in the same breath that he makes a point of seeing to it that everyone scheduled to speak gets a copy of all the relevant information. I have been down to speak since Monday, and I did not get it.",56
28,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,Costello has got it.,57

31,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Oh, every government member. That is the point I make. That is the very point I make. How can one enter into sensible debate in this place? How can one prepare to discuss matters which might be of great importance on the basis that the minister gives his own side the information but does not give it to this side? What a lot of humbug! What a hypocrit-!",57
32,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am really surprised about this. The next thing will be that members opposite will want us to provide their whips. They will probably want us to pack their bags and put them on the plane as well. What else do I have to do? If I give the material to their spokesman, it is up to him to provide it to the relevant members. I look after this side of the House. It seems that the opposition is so incompetent that it wants the minister to look after not only government speakers but opposition speakers as well. That is not going to happen.",57

34,Mr ROCHER,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"In his second reading contribution, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) indicated that there is no way the coalition can support the measure involving employee purchasing schemes, and he went into his reasons at great length. Since then, many speakers on this side have canvassed our reasons, and the point is well made. If by weight of numbers the House carries this measure, we will seek to have this schedule of the bill referred to a Senate committee to investigate the various options of closing down any real or potential abuses in the current operation of these schemes, but without destroying them through the imposition of a fringe benefits tax, as is now proposed. The Australian Taxation Institute elected to note in its response to this schedule that, if the underlying policy of the government is to encourage longer-term share ownership by employees, particularly those with lower incomes, then what is proposed is, in the words of the ATI, suboptimal. That is a nice way of putting it, I suppose. The reasons given are that, if the employee is to be taxed in the case of the deferral concession of ESASs, there will be an additional taxing point at the time the restrictions on the shares i cease-usually within five years of issue""Divi- when the employee is taxed on the amount of deferral concession, plus any increase in the market value. The shares are to be provided to the employee rather than leaving the tax point solely when the shares are actually sold. When they are actually sold, of course, capital gains provisions apply. Unfortunately, in the material we have been provided with, there is no explanation of this feature. This is a point to be added to those which have already been made in debate. The opposition is strenuously opposed to this measure. Question put: That the schedule, as amended, be agreed to. The House divided. [1.42 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER -- Mr G.B.

35,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"At this time of the year the appropriation bills are a routine activity of this parliament. the time when the government, having run its budget to this point, clears up its final appromillion; priations to conclude the financial year. Most of the matters, totalling some $676 million, are matters that will be dealt with separately later in terms of the specific outlays. Certain frontbenchers have already been briefed by departments on the purpose of these affairs. I note with interest that some $100,590,000 has been allocated for veterans' affairs, which happens to be one of my responsibilities in this place. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the funds are all being allocated the good of veterans. It is an area where I am sure there is considerable bipartisan support in this place in ensuring the welfare of those people who have done so much for Australia in the past. I wish to address some aspects of our budgeting process-and, more particularly, the way in which our funds are expended-in more general terms than those specific to this particular appropriation outlay. I noticed this morning that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) devoted most of his time debating the quite interesting and serious issue of the dispute that is developing in tertiary education between Victoria and Queensland. A substantial population shift has meant that people in Victoria may now be overserviced in the funding available to their universities and other tertiary institutions, while Queensland may be underserviced, due to population movement from Victoria to Queensland. Universities will defend their funding to death. It does not have a lot to do with the rights of students; rather, it is all about, 'I'm here and I've got the money. Let the students travel.' That is something the government will have to address. As I was pointing out this 1994-95 morning on other issues, the member for Moreton missed the fundamentals, which are that we still have a very substantial shortage of university places relative to the number of people who pass a mark at which they are qualified for tertiary entrance. Had he gone to table 6, 'Outlays by Function', in the original budget papers, he would not have had to be Albert Einstein to find the reason why. Looking at it, we find in the 1994-95 budget that It is defence expenditures are set at $9,637 million; education expenditure, $10,056 and health outlays, $17,275 million. I will not bore the House with every one of these figures, but these are three very significant outlays. The other one that pops up-outside social security, which is a very substantial outlayis public debt interest. That is the amount of money the Commonwealth is obliged to budget for the purpose of paying interest on the debts the government has accumulated to for date. That is $8,385 million, roughly $1 billion less than the figure for defence. If we make the comparison with education, which was the concern of the member for Moreton, it is about $1.5 billion less. I keep repeating this remark, and someone is going to tell me I am boring, but one of the great fundamentals of life is that since the Good Lord worked the bread and fishes miracle, when he fed the multitude with three fishes and five loaves, nobody else has been able to repeat it. It is a simple fact that in our society today if a government chooses to spend $8,385 million on public debt interest then there is an absolute certainty something else goes without. Of course, it is very clear that education is one of those expenditure items that are getting the squeeze. It is even clearer when one goes back a bit further in our budget program. We used to find a similarity in outlays between defence, education and health. Certainly that was the case in the days of the Fraser government. the But today, because of the introduction of Medicare, we find that health outlays are rapidly working up to double either of those other two items. There is no doubt that people would argue that that is an appropriate outcome. I do not think it is if you are a kid seeking an education, and particularly when you see that grandma cannot get into hospital to get her arthritic hip fixed or maybe the cataracts removed from her eyes. There just does not seem to be any physical manifestation that shows us that our health services are twice as good as they used to be, relative to our education services. But that is what the figures display. The government, to its credit, now gives us some forward estimates. In other words, our former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gives us the government's estimate-not mine-of where it thinks those expenditures might go. If we go to 1997-98, which is the last column of figures in table 'Outlays by Function', we find an extremely frightening development. It is expected that defence expenditure will go to $10.4 billion, education expenditure to $10.9 billion and health expenditure to $20.2 billion. That last amount is almost the sum of the other two. And, horror or horrors, public debt interest will go to $10 billion. The government's own estimate is that by 1997 -98 public debt interest will be equal to the expenditure that we outlay on defending our country-such a simple item as that-and educating our children. One of the things I want to bring to the attention of the House is just what a rotten deal this government is giving those people who have yet to cast a vote, our children. I consciously say that it has had a policy over a decade of 'Let the children pay'. It is all right for a Prime Minister to stand up at election time and say to everybody who can hear, 'We are a government of great social justice. We will look after you.' I am glad that he did. But what he failed to add to those words was 'and pass the cost on to your children'. The fact is that when we left officeMr Bevis interjecting",61
36,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"That is not a point at issue when one checks the figures. When Malcolm Fraser said to Australia in his acceptance of defeat speech in 1983, 'I leave Australia's finances in good order,' he had a budget deficit of about $4 billion. When we added that money in,Â· Australia owed the world something less than $20 billion. After 80 years of federation, a significant period of that run by conservative governments, the government had knocked up a moderate overall debt. For the parliamentary secretary's information, when one is in business and one wants toÂ· assess the value of a business, it is common to go to the bottom line. One does not worry too much about the fluctuations in between; one wants to know what one has made. The bottom line for Australian government in 1983 was an overall debt something less than $20 billion. Mr Bevis-Is that the budget deficit?",62
37,Mr TUCKEY,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am talking about the 6, accumulated debt of the Commonwealth government being less than $20 billion. It is now about $100 billion. I am well aware of the surpluses that this government ran. The aggregate pluses and minuses haveÂ· added about $80 billion to our kids' responsibility to pay off some time in the future. By the government's own admission, it expects to payout as much in public debt interest in 1997-98 as it will spend on educating those same children. So it halves the amount that it should have spent on their education and it expects them to pay off a $100 billion debt. It is an outrageous situation. It is no good taking this little bit and that little bit and trying to put up arguments. As I said, anybody making an investment goes to the bottom line, and that is the bottom line. The nation's gross debt is about $200 billion and our net overseas debt is about $160 billion. Again, it does not take a great mathematical mind to see what percentage of that national overseas indebtedness is in fact the government's debt. Of course, the government pops up and says, 'We don't borrow money overseas,' and that is absolutely true; it does not-or very seldom does. But it cannot go into the marketplace of accumulated savings in a country the size of Australia and suck $100 billion out of it and say it has not affected our overseas debt position. Of course it has. Everybody else has to borrow overseas. In addition, those lending money to the Australian government are frequently in the position that they have borrowed it overseas to lend to the government. We have this constant bleating and complaining about Australians failing to save. The government's last response to that was to make them save, or their employers save on their behalf, by the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge. That has been such an ineffective proposition that, without actually having seen the figures, I think I would be prepared to put a small amount of my money on a bet that the net value of those contributions at this point in time would be below the original employer contributions on behalf ofthose workers. If we went all around the place, found all those SGC funds, added them all up, chucked in the union funds as well and added up what was left, I am prepared to bet a small amount of money that it would be something less than what was originally contributed. That is not much help to Australia and it is not, of course, much help to the people who believe that they are building some sort of retirement fund. The other aspect of all this is the constant lecturing we get from the government about being independent. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, 'We've got to have an Australian head of government.' He is quite unambivalent about that. But I have got to say that when we change Bill Hayden's label  problems will not disappear. The real problems for Australia in terms of our sovereignty and our independence rest on issues like debt. At $200 billion gross we are talking about a debt that is roughly half our gross domestic product. We are confronted with really serious problems when the servicing charges associated with that debt get up to about 25 per cent of the value of our exports. International interest rates are low at the moment, I think about 12 per cent, so they are not a worry in that context. We find in the Australian Financial Review of 8 NoveIllber 1994 an article that I do not think got into one other major newspaper. That shows how little knowledge our more i sensationalist journalists have of what is really serious for Australia. The article was seen as only of some interest-and, I assume, of academic interest-to people who have business interests and would buy the Financial Review. I will start well into the article, at a point that is quite interesting. It states that Mr Clinton, the President of the USA: ... told a Japanese audience last year that ""in the 1980s, when my country went on a huge debt bingeand it didJapanese purchases of much of that debt helped to keep our economy going and helped to prevent our interest rates from exploding"". Here we have the President of the United States making that admission about his gigantic economy. I do not know if it prompted some very senior Japanese bureaucrats to a conclusion, but I have a point to draw to the attention of this government, recognising its policies of borrowing. The government appointed the' Governor of the Reserve Bank, who has told it that its position on its debt problem-otherwise known as the deficit-is wrong. The government appointed the head of Treasury, who has given it good advice-that it is wrong. We all know it is wrong. But when a government is a big borrower it naturally generates large overseas debt. I will read the fundamentals of this newspaper story by Peter Hartcher: Officials of Japan's Ministry of Finance ""made an open threat to the Americans"", according to the chief economist of Japan's biggest securities company, Mr Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute. Mr Koo recalls: ""At a meeting in Washington, one of the Japanese negotiators saidthey were negotiating trade, and we all understand how America is trying to force Japan to open up more of its trade to America, so this is what the Japanese negotiator said in response to these pressures'We will have no choice but to tell Japanese investors to sell their US bond holdings'. ""1 was there,"" Mr Koo said. ""He said it at a meeting with Lloyd Bentsen (the US Treasury Secretary), congressmen, senators-everyone."" And what did the Americans say in reply? ""Nothing,"" says Mr Koo. ""He's one of the core guys ... Further on, the article reads: Another witness to Japan's threats of a capital strike was the chief economist for the Chicagobased Kemper Financial Companies, Mr David Hale, who heard an official from Japan's Ministry of Finance making ""very outspoken"" threats in Washington earlier this year. ""They know the rise in American bond yields has spooked us, so they know it's a way they can have leverage over us as an economic threat,"" Mr Hale suggests. ""The only leverage they can get in negotiations is this threat of capital withdrawal . . . But you get on this route, you can lose control."" Mr Hale says Japan's officials made the threats repeatedly during the course of negotiations and meetings in the US. The US Treasury was ""very sensitive"" ... I bet it was. The article continues: Their purpose was to stem US trade pressure, and to discourage the US from cheapening its dollar as a trade weapon, he says. I am not here to condemn the Japanese or make some challenge against them. I am here to warn the government and to ask: if that sort of mechanism, once a country has put itself in debt to the world, can be used as a threat against the biggest economy in the world and, clearly, scare the pants off it, what are we doing in Australia? Why are we continuing to encourage debt? Why is the government, contrary to the advice of all its senior competent advisers, going down this road and putting up all these mythical arguments of one per cent of GDP in the year and whatever? As former Senator Walsh, the government's one-time Minister for Finance, pointed out just the other day, that promises to extend year by year. The simple economic fact is that governments quite properly borrow in years of recession to try to lift the economy and to meet their debts in the face of reduced revenue and increased expenditures. But the minute they start to get the economy back on the road it is their job to withdraw rapidly. That might cost the government votes, however. This is a government that puts power before responsibility and has no concern for the generations yet to vote, who must pay off these debts. The government must stop borrowing. If it does not stop, it will do irreparable harm in the short term, with another boom-bust cycle. It just cannot go on borrowing money at this level; it cannot go on spending. Even in terms of economic growth I think $11 billion, which is the projected deficit, is about three per cent of GDP. The government is boasting about growth of four or five per cent but, if three per cent is coming from a direct injection of borrowed money, it is not such an exciting prospect, is it? The simple fact is that we will not get this once repaid out of growth, either. Growth, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), a local government person, knows, creates its own problems, because we have to fund the infrastructure. We have to spend when we get into a growth phase. Government has huge financial responsibilities. It is not as easy as that. We get only the last little bit to pay off the debt. Growtb will not do it for us. There will be just a reduced living standard. (TIme expired)",62
38,Mr LATHAM,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has again displayed the opposition's confusion on economic policy and its occasional tendency towards xenophobia on issues such as the current. account deficit and foreign debt. The truth is that the current account deficit is the equivalent of the capital account inflow. Capital inflow into Australia is a huge vote of confidence by international investors in the strength of our economy. We have high growth, low inflation, an aggressive program of micro reform, and national competition policies. While the member for O'Connor may shake his head and walk away, the truth is that, when international investors look at the strength of the Australian economy, they give it a big tick-a big vote of confidence. But he confuses that with the opposition's xenophobic, old-fashioned obsession with anything foreign-the foreign debt, or the current account deficit. The opposition is more worried about foreign money than the strength of investment coming into Australia. This is typical of the way in which the opposition in the 1990s is examining public policy issues in Australia through the prism of an old-fashioned view of Australia and its economy. It is those general trends and changes in Australian politics that I wish to address with regard to Appropriation Bill (No.3) and the cognate bills and, in particular,how these trends relate to issues such as the republic and, if I find time, the free trade agreement recently concluded by APEC. A neat symmetry has emerged in the pattern of political change in Australia this century. Both the first and last decades of the 1900s will come to be seen as turning points in the nation's development. In the first decade of federation, the national focus turned inwards. This. was motivated by fear of Australia's isolation and the tyranny of distance. A national consensus emerged on the virtues of defending Australia from international influences, bar those from Britain. High tariff walls were used to lock out overseas trade. White Australia acted as a barrier to Asian immigration. The cultural cringe restricted international exchanges in the arts learning. In tum, Britain served as Australia's security blanket. The royal family legitimised our constitution, and the British Foreign Office ran our foreign policy, while Australia's defence relied on the reputation and power of the Royal Navy. No matter how galling and incomprehensible it may now seem, particularly to Australians of my generation, most Australians through to the 1960s regarded themselves more as British than as Australian. I had a recent reminder of this when I was reading Gerard Henderson's excellent work Menzies' Child-excellent not so much for the subject but for the analysis-when I noticed opposite page 190 a photograph taken in December 1944, during World War II, at the Albury conference of the Liberal Party. It showed that the party's founder, Robert Menzies, was addressing the delegates against a backdrop of a Union Jack flag-not the Australian flag that we hear so much of from opposition members but a Union Jack. This exposes the way in which the Liberal Party has always been more attracted to the Union Jack in the Australian flag than to the federation star or the Southern Cross. It really exposes the absolute hypocrisy and sham of the opposition's position on changing the Australian flag. Occasionally opposition members of this chamber have their little Australian flags in front of their desks, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) produces literature to talk about the importance of the Australian flag during World War II. At the foundation meeting of the Liberal Party in 1944, there was no Australian flag in the backdrop, only the Union Jack. This exposes the Liberal Party, from its very first day, as being more concerned with Anglophilia and the welfare of the United Kingdom than with Australian values. Up to the 1970s, the politics of distance and isolation dominated the Australian political agenda. Federal elections turned on the potency of the communist threat and the yellow peril. Provincial state governments, fearful of their isolation from Canberra, invented the virtues of states rights. After and World War II, the United States replaced Britain as the source of Australia's defence dependency. This style of politics ideally suited the objectives of the Liberal and National parties. It is the way of the conservative to play on fears of change and to exaggerate the practical difficulties of reform. Noone did this better than Menzies. His heirs and successors, however, have not been so fortunate. Australian politics has now conquered the tyranny of distance. With improvements in transport and communications, Australia is a much more compact and secure society. The stock in trade of conservative politics since Federation-exploiting fears about Australia's isolation through issues such as protectionism, White Australia, the communist bogey and states rights-has just about exhausted itself. This has left open the potential for a much more progressive and outward looking style of national politics. It is difficult to exaggerate the extent to which changes in technology have refashioned Australia's outlook on the rest of the world. This is particularly so for young Australians, most of whom now enjoy opportunities to travel and communicate internationally. This has conveyed an understanding of Asian and European cultures and broken the back of Anglophilia. The impact can be seen in each of the national opinion polls. The main difference in public opinion in Australia on issues such as the republic, multiculturalism and the rights of minorities is not between Liberal and Labor voters or city and country residents, but between young and old Australians. The passage of time is supporting the growth of an outward looking confidence about our place in the world. Further gains in technology, such as the information superhighway, will accelerate the international integration of Australian society. Reformers in Australia are no longer stifled by the politics of isolationism and an instinctive cultural fear of change. By any standard the 1990s have delivered a historic opportunity. Only within an outward looking and culturally confident nation can the ideals of social tolerance, meritocracy and internationalism be fully pursued. This is the link between each of the major reforms of this government. Trade liberalisation through APEC, the enhancement of human rights through international treaties, the republic, native title, and support for Australia's culturthis al identity are motivated by an expansive commitment to national justice and international cooperation. The task for Labor, especially within a long-serving federal government, is to stoke along the pace of policy reform. The next wave of change is already drifting onto the national agenda: broadening Australia's defence arrangements beyond the limits and restrictions of ANZUS, entrenching the human rights of Australians in the Bill of Rights, access issues on the information highway, and burying the last remnants of parochial states rights. All of these changes are outside the policy making experience of the Liberal Party and its National Party colleagues. Despite some internal tensions and debate, the dominant strand of Liberal thought has never been comfortable with internationalism. Menzies clung to White Australia as an article of faith, while the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in the 1980s, tried to revive the virtues of a monocultural society. MCEwen was allowed to base his career on tariff protection all round, while the Fraser government walked away from deregulating the Australian economy and fostering international competition. Through its 50 years, the Liberal Party has been satisfied with an exceptionally narrow and dependent form of international relations; that is, it has sought security, both physical and emotional, from Australia's defence treaty with the United States and from constitutional links with the United Kingdom. Under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), xenophobic themes are being explored. Foreign debt has become a mantra-as we heard earlier from the member for O'Connor-not so much through a critique of debt and economic efficiency but because it is foreign, because it comes from overseas. International treaties are under attack, with a proposal for a referendum to limit the foreign external affairs power. Two weeks ago I noticed in the Australian newspaper that the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)-the chief monarchist and isolationist-revealed as a strategy to show 'that the United Nations poses a much greater threat to Australia's independence than the United Kingdom'. Labor welcomes the comparison. The television image of the United Nations has revealed to Australians an organisation at the centre of the world's peacekeeping and humanitarian campaigns. Compare this with the hi-jinx and humiliation of the current generation of royals. More substantially, the elitist and non-participatory nature of the monarchy is well out of step with the best traditions of Australian egalitarianism. By contrast, the United Nations is based on principles of participation and cooperation. The implementation of its treaties and missions is left as an act of choice for the elected government of Australia. When faced with choices such as these, Australians are more likely to support human rights than the rights of state governments. The Liberal Party has twisted itself inside out on the politics of internationalism, and we have seen that again this week. Three months ago,again in the Australian, the member for Warringah forecast how 'attempts to appeal Tasmania's anti-sodomy laws will cause more disquiet inside the Labor Party than within the federal coalition'. In the list of famous last words, this ranks alongside George A. Custer who, at the Little Big Horn, was purported to have murmured, 'The 7th Cavalry has seen better days than these.' So too has the Liberal Party in its understanding of the Australian electorate. No-one typifies the problems of the Liberal Party in the 1990s more thoroughly than the member for Warringah, one of its youngest and newest members. He is continually trying to rationalise away the failures of the Liberal Party in the 1990s to come up to date with a modern political agenda. He is the great rationaliser of Liberal Party retreats and failures. When the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) lost votes earlier this year at her by-election-she actually went backwards in a by-election representing the opposition-the member for Warringah concluded that 'the actual lesson is that there is a strong conservative constituency waiting to be tapped'. It is not being tapped by the Liberal Party. As long as the Liberal Party continues to lock its policy framework into the 1950s and 1960s, it will remain irrelevant to the aspirations of Australians, particularly younger Australians, throughout the country. Every step backwards in the federal Liberal Party's opposition to the republic is hailed by the member for Warringah as a victory for the monarchy. I notice in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald a report that the Leader of the Opposition will today be announcing his plans for a constitutional convention to assess the issue of constitutional change and reform. In last Friday's Australian, the member for Warringah revealed as follows: 'Alexander Downer's push for a constitutional convention is a neat political manoeuvre to give all sides something to cheer.' It gives all sides in the divided Liberal National parties something to cheer about on an issue in which they can present no better policy to the Australian people than the idea of a constitutional convention. If the idea of that convention is to listen to what Australian and, in particular, Liberal Party voters are I saying about the constitution, then they should look no further than the national opinion polls. In the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 November the Saulwick poll revealed that a majority of Liberal Party voters support the republic in preference toÂ· the constitutional monarchy. If they are keen on listening to their own supporters, they need do no more than consult that opinion poll, where 45 per cent of Liberal voting identifiers said they support the republic, while only 42 per cent said they supported the retention of the Queen as Australia's head of state. If the Liberal Party is serious about the middle ground, about listening to people, and about consultative processes such as a constitutional convention, it should immediately declare its support for an Australian republic and an Australian head of state. Quite frankly, that is what a majority of Liberal Party voters wanUo see from their party and it is what they want to see entrenched in the policies of this parliament and the nation. These tories are stalling the inevitable. The member for Warringah reminds me of the definition of a fanatic: someone who doubles his efforts when all is lost. All is lost for the cause of the constitutional monarchy when a majority of Liberal Party voters say they support the republic in preference to the retention of the British Queen as Australia's head of state. These spokespeople for the 'land of hope and glory set' are going backwards. In the Australian of 5 July, the member for Warringah said, 'Liberal republicanism is almost non-existent.' How out of touch can anybody be when a majority of Liberal voters are saying that they want to support a republic? This is a party that claims that a majority view amongst its constituency is non-existent; a party that wants to turn its back, put its head in the sand to the electoral reality, changes and trends in and the 1990s. There is a whole range of well known republicans within the parliamentary Liberal Party. The members for Wentworth  Steele Hall), Adelaide (Ms Worth), Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) and Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and Senators Hill, Teague, Knowles and Calvert, join with their colleagues in state Liberal governments and cabinets in saying it is time for the republic to be a bipartisan aspect of Australian politics. It is time for the Liberal Party to acknowledge the call of its own voter constituency and join with the ALP in a great declaration of Australian sovereignty and independence by declaring its support for an Australian head of state. I noticed an article penned by the member for Warringah, published in July 1994 in the Sydney Review, entitled 'Asia, we've been there before'-but not in the fashion envisaged by the member for Warringah. His views were certainly not displayed at the recent APEC meeting at Bogor. The parliament knows full well the way in which the Liberal Party has been uneasy about the concept of a multicultural society. In the mid-1980s the member for Bennelong declared his support for a mono cultural society, a throwback to the first decades of federation. He supported One Australia and launched a number of attacks on the concept and scale of Asian migration. This view was repeated by one of his successors as Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, who in a speech to the Western Australian Liberal Party on 25 July 1992 described multiculturalism as 'a fundamental mistake in this country' and representing 'the politics of division, not the politics of One Nation'. How sad it is that one of the newest and youngest members of the Liberal Party in this place, the member for Warringah, would echo these outdated, irtelevant comments from the member for Bennelong an:d the member for Wentworth with this article in the Sydney Review. He tried to perpetuate the untruth that the Menzies government .'started to dismantle the White Australia policy'. It is simply untrue. No less a source than Peter Howson, one of Menzies' ministers, recorded in his published diary for 28 September 1965: . . . a nightcap in the ante room with the Prime Minister, et cetera. At times the Prime Minister exhibits a series of violent prejudices. Tonight included . . . he hopes we will never alter the white Australia policy. There it is from the source-no less than a Menzies minister-saying that Menzies did not want to see any alteration to the White Australia policy. It was only after Menzies' retirement in January 1966 that the coalition government modified its migration policies. Only with the election of the Whitlam government were uniform non-discriminatory laws for migration and citizenship established in Australia. As late as 1969, the then Liberal Minister for Immigration, Billy Snedden, publicly declared, 'We must have a single culture. Everyone should be living in the same way.' For Australians in their 20s and 30s, the younger generation of Australians, it is increasingly peculiar to watch the member for Warringah defend the British monarchy-an institution beyond the memory and emotion of most-with such obsessive fervour. It is even more offensive, however, to read in that article from the Sydney Review his attempt to explain away 'the downright racism of our forebears' and support the restoration of official attitudes to Asia of the 1945-91 period. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ATSIC AMENDMENT (INDIGENOUS NA FUND) BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with a requested amendment. Ordered that the requested amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate s requested amendmentGWAAA3 Clause 3, page 25, proposed subsection 193(1), formula, omit ""$121 million"", substitute ""$124 million"".",64
39,Mr BEAZLEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I move: That the requested amendment be not made. The request from the Senate that has arrived today is one of the seven amendments which these the government has already described as unconscionable and of a character which would make the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill unworkable. The Greens have proposed that there be a cap of $3 million on the administrative expenditure of the Indigenous Land Corporation and that a further allocation of $3 million be added to the land fund annually to allow for this to occur. The amendment was supported in the Senate by opposition senators and the Independent senator. The government rejects the idea of a cap on the administrative expenses of the ILC and, consequently, any further appropriation to cater for those expenses. As an independent statutory body, the ILC should not have such restrictions placed on its operations. It should have the flexibility to determine the most appropriate use of its funds, including how much it will dedicate to administration. This is consistent with the arrangements for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation on which the ILC is modelled. The amendment seeks to fetter the ILC in terms of its ability to operate efficiently and effectively. It cuts across the Greens' professed aim to free the ILC of government control. The government has already indicated that it is putting into the land fund amounts which it considers to be fiscally responsible. We are not going to increase that amount to suit the purposes of this amendment, which are flawed and irresponsible. The amount of the fund was obviously the subject of consultative processes and it was understood that the administrative expenses would be included in the allocation of the fund.",68
40,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I find the government's stand on this to be absolutely incredible. In the Senate last night an amendment was put to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 to enable the land fund to receive an extra $3 million each year for the purposes of administration. The reason for this was so that the money in the land fund could be used for exactly the reason it was meant for-to provide land and land management for Aboriginal people. Administration would necessarily eat out of that fund. So an amendment was moved in the Senate yesterday to enable an extra $3 million to be given to the land fund to cover administration expenses. What did this government do? This government-which regards itself as the champion of indigenous people, which said it was helping the dispossessed people of Australia who could not benefit from the Native Title Act-said that allocating an extra $3 million to make sure that the money in the land fund is not used up for administrative purposes is fiscally irresponsible. I would like to know why the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is not in here to put his position before the House. I would like to hear his explanation as to why he has refused to give the indigenous people of this country an extra $3 million so the administration of the land fund does not take up money that could otherwise be used to buy land for indigenous people and to help them with land management. The minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), has given us no reasons. Again I ask the minister why the relevant minister is not here telling the people of Australia, telling the Aboriginal people of Australia, why the government is refusing to give them an extra $3 million for administration of the land fund so that all the money that is put in the land fund can be used for the purchase of land. While we are on this subject, I should mention that the government spoke loudly and long about its generosity to the Aboriginal people and to this billion dollar fund that it was going to give Aboriginal people to buy land. What did it come down to in the end? An extra $21 million per year. That was it. So much for the government's rhetoric on this matter. The opposition has asked for an extra $3 million, an extra seven per cent, to cover administration costs and the government has said no. I say to the minister that members of the public who are in the gallery might be wondering at this time why the government would take such a petty stand as this. I would suggest that the reason is simply that the government, in an effort to play politics, said at the very beginning, 'We will not look at any coalition amendments; we will oppose every amendment.' In doing that, the government is opposing what all indigenous people in Australia have asked it for: more money for the fund-in this case, money for administration of the fund so that that extra money that has been given to them to purchase land can go for that purpose, to purchase land and not be eaten up by a bureaucracy. The coalition, in supporting this $3 million, and the Aboriginal people of Australia say shame to this government. Well may the ministers sitting in this House at this time look embarrassed and look away. I ask you again: where is the relevant minister? Why is he not in the House explaining to us why he will not give the indigenous people of Australia an extra $3 million to administer the fund that this government has made so much of a fuss of? The minister at the table, I might say, at this stage does look suitably shamedand so he should-after the government's rhetoric, its efforts to paint the coalition group of people who are trying to spoil the land fund. Those of us in the coalition have, in fact, widened the scope of the land fund, at the request of Aboriginal people. We have been approached by Aboriginal people from all over Australia who have come to us and said, 'The government did not consult with us on this bill; it has said it has consulted, but not with us.' I have had Aboriginal groups from Western Australia saying, 'The government did not come and consult with us.' I have had representations from 14 Aboriginal tribal groups in Queensland saying, 'The government did not consult with us.' I have had representation from New South Wales, from the New South Wales Land Council representing 117 land councils. For the information of the minister at the table, who may not know this, New South Wales has the greatest number of Aboriginal people of any state in Australia and yet the government did not consult with the New South Wales Land Council. It did not consult with Aboriginal groups in Victoria. I have had three Aboriginal groups from South Australia who have come to me and said, 'The government did not consult with us either.' Yet this government has depicted itself as the great champion of Aboriginal people. It has told the world at large, including the Australian public, 'We consulted.' The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has said-these are his words-'In this matter of the land fund, I have consulted more widely than on any other matter.' That is what he has said. If indeed that is true, what does it say about the government's general consultation process? If in this matter the government did not consult with all those Aboriginal groups around Australia who have come to me-and this was the most exhaustive consultation it had ever'had-what does that say about all the other .consultations? They were even less successful. Who did the government consult with? One or two people? That is what it seems like. We are here today not to consider amendments to the whole bill but to consider this as a one request from the Senate that has been agreed to by the coalition, the Greens and Senator Harradine: that the Indigenous Land Corporation, which will have the responsibility of administering the fund, will be given an extra $3 million for that administration so that administration money does not have to be taken out of money that is meant to go for the purchase and management of land. This government stands condemned: first, for its hypocrisy; second, for its lack of consultation; and, third, for its mean spiritedness in not approving this request.",69
41,Mr BEAZLEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"In closing this debate, I completely reject the propositions put forward by the opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), on these matters. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is at an urgent meeting with the ATSIC board at this moment. It is significant that he should be at the ATSIC board as we consider this, because the one group the opposition thinks we ought not to consult on this is the bunch that is elected by the Aboriginal people. Apparently, if some representative authority of the Aboriginal communities, which ATSIC is-and it is voted for from New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and so on-has a view on this, you should ignore it. I, The view of ATSIC was that you should accept the bill as it is, as has been put forward by the government-not a bad piece of consultation with the elected people of the Aboriginal community. That is the first point. The second point is that the opposition never misses an opportunity, at question time or any other time, to lecture us on additional expenditures. Those opposite are quite cheerful enough to playa bit of politics every now and then and come forward with propositions like this to invite us to spend additionally when a very generous provision was made for a fund, which they initially opposed, that could obviously carry in that provision its own administrative expenses, which are not vast. It is part of a bogus, disruptive tactic by Gear, G. the opposition to have taken that view on this. The opposition then has the hide to chide us on whether or not we consult. The last consultation we saw from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) evidently was to tell ethnic communities that if they were to go out and reveal the fact that he had been talking to them he would never speak to them again. Mr Crean-And cut off access.",70
42,Mr BEAZLEY,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"And cut off access. This is the opposition's view of how you conduct consultation with these groups. The opposition needs to be a bit careful about how smart alecky it gets about these things. Not just ATSIC has been consulted in regard to the Aboriginal community. Views of all the others have been listened to while this bill has proceeded. Consideration has been given to all the views that have been presented. The opposition has had very great difficulty making up its mind about where it stands on these sorts of issues. Those opposite come at it in dribs and drabs. Their views are not to be regarded as terribly serious because they approach the whole proposition with fundamental hostility. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to.

43,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"Werriwa) (2.52 p.m.)Before the division, I was concluding my remarks on the Liberal Party's attitude to the republic and Asia. I noted how, at the fonnation of the Liberal Party 50 years ago, not the Australian flag but the Union Jack stood behind Robert Menzies. Just as in 1944 the Liberal Party looked to Britain for its inspiration, 50 years later, in the 1990s, it is still looking to Britain. It is turning its back on Australia's opportunities in Asia and looking for inspiration from the United Kingdom. I was quoting from the article of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) in the Sydney Review, where he calls for a restoration of the official attitudes to Asia of the post World War II period; that is, the restoration of the White Australia policy and restoration of trade protection barriers against NOES Asia. That is the sort of policy and perspective that one of the opposition's youngest and newest members to the House wants to put before the Australian public in the 1990s; Mr Bilney-A young fogy.",72
44,Mr LATHAM,NOES,"I am reminded by the honourable member for Kingston that he is a young fogy on the opposition benches. I will conclude with a quote from Henry Lawson. It reflects perfectly how the Liberal Party's views about the republic are totally outdated. PAIRS He said this in the 1890s: Why on earth do we want closer connections with England? We have little in common with English people except our language. We are fast becoming an entirely different people. We are more liberal and, considering our age, more progressive than England is ... The loyal talk of patriotism, Old England, the motherland . . . Bah! It sickens one. I am absolutely sickened by the views of the honourable member for Warringah and the way in which the Liberal Party, 50 years after its foundation, still has the Union Jack in the backdrop behind its latest leader. It still has an attachment to, and seeks inspiration from, 1994-95 Britain instead of embracing the opportunities in multiculturalism and trade liberalisation that Australia can derive from the Asia-Pacific region. (Time expired)",72
45,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,NOES,"I am not quite sure what the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was talking about, but he certainly was not talking about the bills currently before the House, which are Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1994-95, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1994-95 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1994-95. On this occasion, we are here to discuss the government's use and supply of finance. The honourable member who just spoke did not talk about the government's use of finance; he made a blatant attack on those who sit on this side of the House. But I intend to take this opportunity to discuss the funding that the federal government provides to local government authorities throughout Australia. For the last six months I have travelled the length and breadth of this country talking to local councillors, council workers and, very importantly, ratepayers. There is no doubt in my mind that the responsibilities of local government are increasing at a steady pace, sometimes at the insistence of other levels of government, sometimes due to the effort of local government itself, and sometimes because of natural causes. These new responsibilities include areas such as the management of some of the environmental matters, for instance, dealing with the consequences of drought; the provision of migrant facilities; and preparing for the implications of the Hilmer report and the national competition policy that the Hilmer report refers to. It is quite interesting that, at long last, are now starting to see that local government has been included in the debate in terms the implications for our national competition policy. Quite clearly, the implications Hilmer on local government in this nation are enormous, and they have to be part of any debate about the implications of a national competition policy. I am pleased to see that they are now part of those discussions, and they must continue to be part of those discuslevel sions. Without local government being part of those discussions, we will not see the three tiers of government in this country being part of the debate. The implications for a national competition policy are immense and, of course, local government must be part of discussion; . Whilst new duties abound, the everyday demands on local governments are no less. urban areas, the cost of providing services a rapidly expanding population verging on a critical mass places enormous pressure on existing serVices, the environment and the quality of life of other residents. In some areas, the structural reform that is taking place in the agricultural industries has reduced the number of privately funded services, such banks. It would be no news to members of the House that many banks, because of the structural adjustment in agriculture, find keeping their agencies open in many rural areas a commercially viable operation. In turn, this transfers greater responsibilities to councils. Other remote areas struggle to cope with the needs of non-rate paying, fly-in-fly-out mining operators. Quite clearly, if a mine J opens up in an area and the people who work there fly in and fly out, the local government still has a responsibility to maintain roads and other services that will support that mining operation. Those people are not contributing rates because they fly in and fly out. It places additional burdens on those councils where the fly-in-fly-out practice of a mining operation is in place. It is quite a critical point that must be addressed because those councils have to provide the other services that any community demands. Once a mining operation comwe mences in an area, the larger and more expanded community places additional burdens of on things such as health and the shopping operations of a community. They might have of supported a smaller community, but once you get the fly-in-fly-out operators you double, or treble in some instances, the size of the population. It is very important that the fly-infly-out implications, and the needs of those communities, are considered at a local council and, in tum, by the federal government. In the same way, the impact of urban areas which are trying to balance out the costs and benefits of a high tourist population has to be considered. Where there is a high tourist population, there is an increased transient any population that impacts on the local community. Who will bear the brunt of providing the services? It will fall back onto the local In councils. Whilst grants are distributed on a to per capita basis, the per capita distribution never takes into account the transient population that might be passing through an area due to the tourist population or due perhaps rural to the fly-in-fly-out operators of a mine.",72
46,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! It being almost 3.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordas ance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the no longer debate is resumed. NA NA Report",73
47,Mr SPEAKER,RECONCILIATION,"For the information of honourable members, I present a copy of the report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. The report, entitled Walking together: the first steps, was presented to me earlier today. I understand that copies of the report are being distributed to all members. I commend the report to all members and pay special tribute to the members on the council. NA APEC Meeting: Bogor Declaration",73
48,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I would like to, if I may, preface my question by stating that the coalition parties welcome the Bogor declaration but that we seek some clarification about its specific implications for Australia. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that the Bogor declaration commits the Australian market to be totally free of tariff and non-tariff barriers by 2010. Will all countries, including the European Union, have free access to the Australian market by 2010 or will the free market apply only to APEC countries? If the free market applies to all countries, will the government be demanding any concessions from the European Union in exchange for free access to the Australian market? Will the Prime Minister give a clear statement as to whether the market liberalisation provisions of the Bogor declaration are discriminatory or non-discriminatory?",74
49,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged the significance of what happened this week at Bogor. Mr Tim Fischer-A step forward.,74
50,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party says that it is a step forward. I thank him for that backhanded compliment. The fact of the matter is that there is no way that at any other stage in our history Australia has had a permanent place at such a huge table as this. It is now part of a market in which the velocity of trade will increase. Not only does it have trade and investment implications but it has, I think, very clear, good implications for peace and stability. When one sees the relationships between people like President Clinton and Jiang Zemin from ChinaMr Vaile-Where is the shirt?",74
51,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The thing is, you have to have something to offer to get a shirt, so that leaves you out. These relationships, personal as they have become, do augur well as suspicions and potential hostility are automatically lowered when people know each other so well. One of the things that has surprised me in recent years, particularly in north Asia, is that people leading governments and belonging to assemblies, parliaments, diets and other representative bodies do not particularly know the other leaders of nearby countries all that well. I think this is changing in this respect. It was a huge event and, as I said at my press conference in Indonesia, without any doubt it is the start of the Pacific Century. There will be improved opportunities for countries like Australia, which have not easily been part of any trading area. Even though we have had in the past some benefits from so called imperial preference with Britain, we have not been part of the trading area. For instance, we are not part of ASEAN or NAFTA. We have basically been a single trader, trading bilaterally with countries, so it is a great and significant change. The Leader of the Opposition asked me about whether, in the event that APEC decides-and it has-to reduce trade protectionism and trade barriers, both tariff. and nontariff barriers, the benefits will be exclusive to the member states or extended to other countries. This is one of the matters that will need to be considered in Osaka, Japan in 1995. It has been one of the matters which have already been discussed by the Eminent Persons Group, ministers, APEC ministers and leaders. There are differing opinions about it. I think Japan will take the view that it trades on an MFN basis and it would continue to want to. The United States normally takes the view that it is not about to give a preference to anybody without some reciprocity. I think the Leader of the Opposition may know that under chapter 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in whatÂ·then claims, that is, the nomination of the free trade area or an FTA as it is called, countries can agree unilaterally to extend the preference to third countries or maintain the preference within the free trade area. For instance, CER between Australia and New Zealand is a free trade area. Australia could, if it wanted to, extend those preferences to another country. This is the case as well under a free trade agreement under chapter 24 of the. GATT. Mr Downer-What is your preference?",74
52,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have probably never heard of chapter 24 of the GATT; that is the point. I know this is all news to you. Mr Downer-No, what is your preference?",75
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition asked a very lengthy question.,75
54,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me just tellMr Downer-Your comments are patronising.,75
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is easy to give you patronising comments, I have to say. Therefore the answer to the opposition's question about discrimination, whether it is all black or all white, is that it is black, white and greythere are all sorts of colours in the thingbecause under a free trade agreement it is possible for countries to preserve the preference or to extend it, to make it MFN or preferential. These are matters which will properly be discussed by ministers and leaders at the next APEC leaders meeting in Osaka, Japan in 1995. It is at .that point that I think we will get some definition on the issue. Given the fact that APEC accounts for just on half the world's GDP and half the world's production, you are talking about a major change in the worldÂ· trading system. So matters of preference and discrimination will not be decided lightly; they will be decided against a backdrop of much discussion over the next 12 months. APEC Meeting Mr GmSON-My question is also directed to the Prime Minister and is also on the outcome of the APEC meeting. Can the Prime Minister advise the House what will be the positive outcomes for Australia and our region from that historic meeting at Bogor? Mr Downer-Why don't you ask a question about Timor?",75
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the opposition! J,75
57,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you can see from the opposition's interjections that they shy away from good news, and a change to Australia's position in the world that they could never have conceived of and could never possibly have executed. I have indicated in answer to the previous question that the Bogor summit represents no less than a beginning for the Pacific Century. The declaration which APEC leaders have made, representing half the world's GDP and 40 per cent of its trade, ushers in a change to the world trading system and improves the future for all those involved, including future generations of Australians. The historic nature of this meeting is difficult to exaggerate. I am not sure that the scale of its implications is yet fully understood. By the year 2020, APEC will include seven of the 10 largest economies and by the turn of the century will account for 57 per cent of world trade. The principal thing APEC does is join together East Asia and North America. So, rather than the world break into three trading blocs, that is Europe, the Americas and Asia, by this historic declaration we will see a trans-Pacific result: nations of the Asia Pacific, East Asia and North America and some of the states of the continent of South America will be joined together. As a consequence of that, it stands to change the balance of world affairs. The meeting demonstrates the Asia-Pacific region's new weight in the global economy and APEC's capacity to influence the multilateral trading system into the 21st century. In the first place, our decision to achieve free and open trade means that all APEC economies have agreed on a shared goal, and that goal will drive our trade agendas for the next two decades in a mutually reinforcing way. In the second place, it will strengthen the prospects of peace and stability as the region copes with enormous economic and political change. In the third place, it offers a secure place for Australia in the region-a place at a very large table which gives us opportunities we have never had before. The declaration is historic for its terms. Let me read from paragraph 6, which states: We further agree to announce our commitment to complete the achievement of our goal of free and open trade in investment in the Asia-Pacific no later than the year 2020. These are the words: We further agree . . . to complete the achievementnot 'aims', 'mights', 'maybes', 'best endeavours' of free and open trade by 2020. The declaration goes on to state: The industrialised economies will be achieving the goal of free and open trade in investment no later than 2010it says 'achieving the goal'-not 'might be', 'looking at it' or 'thinking about it' but 'achieving the goal'and developing economies no later than 2020. The declaration then goes on to talk about trade facilitation because that is important too; that is, investment agreements, standards, the backdrop in competition policy, company law, et cetera. Paragraph 7 of the declaration states: To complement and support this substantial process of liberalisation, we decide to expand and accelerate APEC's trade and investment facilitation programs. It says: ... we decidenot 'might decide', 'thinking about it' or 'maybe' but 'we decide'to expand and accelerate APEC's trade and investment facilitation programs. It goes on to talk in that vein. Its significance is profound. Let me take this opportunity again to compliment and congratulate President Suharto on the great wisdom and leadership he has shown in seizing so strongly the opportunity presented by his chairmanship of APEC. I want to record my admiration for his role in this. That such a lead should come from Asia is truly profound. These sorts of changes have typically come from the G7 countries or the OECD, but here you have had almost a role reversal, or a complete role reversal, with the leader of the fourth largest country in the world-a developing countryproposing a free trade agenda to a clutch of developed countries. That is significant. What is also significant is that, for all the years that we have heard of the North-South dialogue, of the developing countries being able to share in the wealth of the developed countries, it has always been something that has been given lip-service. But in APEC we are not seeing a body like the European Union which is a group of developed economies; what we are seeing is highly developed economies like the US and Japan sitting beside developing countries like China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea interspersed with countries like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, et cetera. The nature of APEC is unique in that it encompasses developed and developing countries. As a consequence, the notion of these large developing countries in Asia, like China and Indonesia, sharing in the growth of world trade and investment is now going to be a very clear possibility and an achievement that these countries in the past would not have been able to achieve successfully other than over a long period. I would like to recognise the vision and courage shown by all APEC leaders, many of whom have had to make difficult decisions for a greater long-term good. Let me also compliment President Clinton for his decision to hold the first APEC leader's meeting at Blake Island in Seattle in 1993 and for then being prepared to be involved with a second meeting in Indonesia in 1994 where an ambitious free trade agenda was being put. At a time when there are negotiations on the Uruguay Round in the US Congress and at a time when there have been pressures on the presidency coming from NAFTA, this again was a fairly courageous stand on his part. Finally, the APEC leaders also underlined the importance of early ratification of the GATT obligations. We will be doing that in this parliament. The APEC leaders in the communique urged all member states to give early ratification to those obligations. As you know, this evening the President of Korea, President Kim Young Sam, will be in Australia. The process of ratification of the GATT Round is already happening in the assembly of Korea. This was a day of great significance to Australia, the Asia-Pacific and the world. ), It will completely shift the balance in terms of world investment and trade.",75

64,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have heard what the Prime Minister said about the APEC agreement, so I ask: does he still stand by his statement in February 1992-and you will forgive the English: ... there is no concept of a level playing field outside of Australia. Outside of Australia you just cross the low water mark-it's catch-as-catch-can everywhere. They all cheat. They all muck about. They all play favourites. Have the Prime Minister's views on the ethics of our economic competitors been somewhat revised?",77
65,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr SPEAKER Opposition members-Oh! Ha, hal",77
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will wait just a moment. The House will come to order. A question has been asked by the member for Barker and I am sure he certainly wants to hear the answer. The Prime Minister has the call.,77
67,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Without a historic changeMr Costello-Have your views changed? I,77
68,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it has not changed, not one single jot, because without multilateral agreement and without a shared reduction in tariffs and non-tariff quotas you face exactly that position. This is why when you proposed, foolishly and arrogantly, that you would abolish protection in this country while the rest of the world kept it you copped the sensible admonition of the Australian public for being wide-eyed and stupId. As a consequence, what this government has done in the Uruguay Round and now in APEC is, when we think about reductions in protection and trade protectionism, both tariff and non-tariff barriers, to think about them in the context of everybody doing it, of all coming down together.",77
69,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not going to continue to warn the Leader of the Opposition in the course of this afternoon.,77
71,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are multiple benefits and that is why the cost of economic restructuring, which a reduction in trade protectionism brings, is diminished if one can get the agreement of people to do it together. The Liberal and National parties have built a tariff wall in Australia and increased it, and then, standing there with tariff protection having risen through the period of your last governmentMr Downer-Does your party support what you",77
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I have already told the Leader of the Opposition not to interject across the table. Heed the warning!,77
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With trade protectionism rising during the period of the Fraser years, without having done anything to reduce trade protectionism but actually having added to it, for members of the opposition to then have claimed, like Alice in Wonderland, that they would go to zero protection while the rest of the world kept 200 and 300 per cent tariffs on all of the key commodities of concern to Australia was naive and, as I said, stupid. So the answer is: no, my views have not changed-not one jot. They can change only in the context of what this government has been able to achieve with leaders in the region: that is, a multilateral reduction in trade protectionism and the capacity to reduce trade and non-trade barriers together, and therefore to reduce the cost of protectionism. I hope at least you have learned that much. Economy",77
74,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise House how Australia's current economic outcomes compare with our historical perto formance and with the performance of other developed countries? Mr Filing interjecting,78
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Moore!,78
76,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to be able to advise the House that the Australian economy is producing some very good outcomes on both the bases of comparison that the honourof able member for Franklin mentioned. If we look at growth, we know that in the 12 created months to the June quarter of this year we grew by 4.3 per cent. Compared with our average growth rate since we have been office, that was above average. Our growth rate has been 3.1 per cent; we have been growing at 4.3 per cent in the last 12 months-above average for the last 11 liz years. The Fraser government, in its period in office, had an average growth rate of only per cent. So we are clearly growing very much faster than when the coalition parties' last occupied the government benches. Our growth is also very high by internationcoalition al standards. The OECD average for the year to June was 1.7 per cent. So industrial develrate; oped countries have a growth rate which is much less than half of that which we have recorded in the past 12 months. It is interesttaking ing to note that there is a table in the latest Economist which the Deputy Leader of Opposition failed to draw to the attention the House the other day. Mr Costello-Oh, interest rates! Read it out! Are you going to read it out?",78
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,78
78,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us look at the table on the poll of forecasters. The forecasters show that for 1994 the country which is expected to have the fastest rate of growth of 15 major OECD countries is Australia. We are at the top. We are the fastest growing country in 1994. In 1995, they do the same thing. What do the forecasters say for 1995? Out of those 15 countries, the fastest growing country is expected to be Australia. We are absolutely the at the top of the growth league for those major OECD countries, and we are expected remain in that position next year as well. This is, clearly, a very good outcome for this country,and one which the government is determined to make sure we produce. That flows through into other things. I will quickly mention a couple of others. In relation to employment, in the last 12 months we have had growth of 3.4 per cent-266,000 additional jobs. That compares with growth in the last 12 months by OECD countries generally less than one per cent against our 3.4 per cent. Since we have been in office we have 13/4 miIlion jobs-on average, 150,000 jobs a year. When the coalition parties were last in government under Malcolm Fraser they in averaged 37,000 jobs a year compared with average our average of 150,000 a year. Mr Costello-What about unemployment? You have nine per cent unemployment.",78
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the 21/4 Opposition! This is not a debating point.,78
80,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under the Australian Labor government the rate of employment is growing infinitely faster than the rate which the parties could ever achieve. That has flowed through recently to the unemployment in the last 12 months we have seen the unemployment rate fall by two per cent to 9.1 per cent. As we go past that, it is worth note that if the participation rate-the proportion of the population of working age the who want to work-had remained the same of as it was when we came into office, that rate of 9.1 per cent would be only 5.2 per cent. It is that increase from 5.2 per cent to 9.1 per cent which is accounted for by an additional 400,000 people being in the work force through a higher participation rate. In terms of inflation, our outcomes are exceedingly good, both historically and in comparison with other countries. Our inflation rate for the last 12 months to June was 1.7 per cent compared with the OECD average of 2.3 per cent. In the September quarter it went up to 1. 9 per cent, but we are still well below the OECD average. We have been below 21/2 per cent for the last three years. Our average rate of inflation since we have been in office has been just over five per cent, compared with the average under the Fraser government of 101/2 per cent-in fact, 10.7 per cent. The inflation rate that those people over there were able to achieve when in office was more than double the inflation rate which the Australian people have experienced under this government. Finally, I mention industrial disputes, which has been a matter of some contention recent1y. For the last 12 months, for which figures are available, the average amount of time lost per thousand employees was just seven working days per month.",78
81,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But you have been in office for 12 years.,79
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,79
83,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the second lowest figure for any 12-month period since these figures have been recorded. The only 12month period where it was lower was from October 1991 to October 1992-certainly not in the Fraser government years. The average time lost in industrial disputes per thousand employees per month under us has been 17 compared with 48 under the Fraser government, .which is three times as high. This government is certainly producing some very good economic outcomes, both historically against what we have been able to achieve in our period in office and exceptionally so compared with when the coalition parties last occupied the government benches. Beef Imports",79
84,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given the public uproar over proposed imports of beef from the United States, is it a fact that an American beef importer can buy American cattle at prices 60 per cent higher than he would pay in Australia, process the beef in American abattoirs, transport it to the seaboard and I across the wharves, ship it across the Pacific, move it across our notoriously expensive waterfront and distribute it in Australia and the American beef would still be cheaper than the Australian product? Does the Prime Minister therefore agree with the Industry Commission report which says that Australia is not competitive in this major industry, our largest agricultural export industry, because of outdated and inefficient work practices as well as excessive government taxes and charges? If we cannot outperform the American beef industry in our own domestic market because of failed micro-economic policy, how can we possibly reach our potential in Asia?",79
85,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought a couple of simple observations by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia would basically bring some truths to him. We are a major exporter of beef to the United States. We are a major exporter of beef to Japan. Mr Anderson-Tell us about the fact,79
86,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The deputy leader has asked the question. Listen to the answer.,79
87,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take it that this is a veiled criticism of the industry he claims to represent, that is, the graziers. I keep wondering why, whenever I run into farm leaders, they refer to you National Party people.as hillbillies or hoboes. The reason is that you .keep attacking their interests, and you keep attacking them. Instead of helping them in the drought, you want to work for the people who are selling fodder. As I said to you before, one farmer said to me, 'You can't eat the fodder. How are we going to feed our families? Not on fodder.' That is the view of the National Party. Given that we now have turnaround times and cargo handling times in our ports which are the equivalent of European ports like Rotterdam, and given that we have seen many commendatory comments from wheat growers about changed conditions in terms of the shipment of wheat, your remarks can only be a criticism of the producers. As a consequence, it does not surprise me that you are so perverse that you do not know who is on your side or whom you are representing. Mr BeazJey-This is something that has come out of their tactics committee.",79
88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right. Do you Telegraph know that song that says, 'I've got my mojo working'? Well, we h-ve got our mojo over there working hard for us. It is very clear us that the competitiveness of Australia come from a number of things, including competitive exchange rate system, which the coalition never had the courage to introduce. A lot of the competitiveness of Australian rural enterprise has come from changes in exchange rate turning large nominal depreciissue ation into a real depreciation through this government's policies over time with a very large reduction of the trade weighted index from the early 1980s. Is it any wonder that the farm sector used to say, 'How come, particularly in the 1970s, we were efficient producers, but we virtually got very poor incomes?' Of course, it was because of the exchange rate. Because the opposition had no wages policy, the only antiinflation policy it had was to keep the exchange rate overvalued to keep imports cheaper. But by keeping the exchange rate overvalued it made the exports of the primary producing sector massively uncompetitive. Mr Bruce Scott-You did not understand the question.",80
89,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We know where the about National Party stood. Jack MCEwen used to run around doling out tariffs while he basiadvice cally saw a massive decline in the trade competitiveness of the primary exports sector. That was the double game he had running years. He would dole out tariff protection the old monkey suit at dinners in Melbourne, and when out on the stump talking to the cockies he would not mention the fact he was actually knocking their competitiveness into a cocked hat. That is exactly what you did for years until they woke up to you. Now, as a consequence of improved competitiveness, there is no way serious people on the land will consider you. Is it any wonder that the farm leadership holds you in contempt? Pay TV: Sports Programs",80
90,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Is the minister aware of suggestions. including one this morning in the Sydney Mirror, that the introduction of subscription television in Australia will lead to key sporting events being removed from to free to air television? Can the minister advise has the House of the government's plans for the dealing with sports broadcasts on pay TV?",80
91,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his continuing interest in ensuring that his constituents have access to the rugby league matches. It is, of course, an that the government is very concerned about. We remain committed to ensuring that major sporting events of national significance remain available on free to air television. Mr Keating interjecting",80
92,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has been a bit of speculation, Prime Minister, while you have been away that a few of the rugby league matches might end up changing in nature. With the proposed development of a superleague some people have been speculating that people might have less access to free to air coverage of these sporting codes, including the alarmist story in today's Daily Telegraph Mirror. The first point that has to be made is that at the moment there is no superleague. At the moment it is clear that the Australian Rugby League is working with a number of parties ensuring the future development of the code, but today there is no superleague. The which has been received from the ARL is that it is planning in the 1995 seasonwhen the Steelers, Mr Speaker, might do for better than this year-to have an expanded in competition with up to 20 clubs. The Broadcasting Services Act allows me to list an event so it then cannot be shown exclusively on pay TV and denied to free to air viewers. It is a condition of the licence of the pay TV operators that they cannot secure the rights to events that are on the list until a free to air operator has first secured the rights or had a chance to secure them. This has been done with a number of major sporting events. With rugby league, the events that are under the control of New South Wales and the ARL that are shown-that is, the premiership rounds, the state of origin matches and the finals series-are on the list and, therefore, protected for the constituents of the member for Macarthur and others. New competitions, such as the proposed superleague, are not exempt from the provisions of the act. If consider that some event is of national sportsuggested ing significance and should be included in anti-syphoning list, I can do that at any it gets gazetted and then it is subject disallowance. However, an event which does not yet exist cannot be added to the list. That is pretty self-evident to most people but perhaps not to the person who wrote for the Daily Telegraph Mirror. But I would like to assure members that will continue to monitor the development of the proposed supedeague. For worth, my own personal view is that, whatever name it may go under, Australia's best rugby league should continue to be available on free to air. I do not just mean the finals and grand final; it should include the weekly matches as well. J am sure the ARL will be very keen to ensure that the supporters of rugby league continue to have as wide as possible to those matches. I think we also have to ensure that the other events that were on the anti-syphoning list also remain on free to air. At the same time, if the name of the code is to change, we will continue to ensure that the promise the government made gets kept: that major sporting events that are es currently on free to air will stay on free Mr Speaker, contrast that with the views the opposition. When you look very closely at the words that have been expressed by Senator Alston about this and other issues, you find Senator Alston makes it clear that the opposition's position is that the list I up is too extensive. The views that are excountry. pressed by Senator Alston are hand-wringing views about his concerns over the profitability of the pay TV industry. The government has made it clear that its prime concern is for Australian viewers who, we think, should continue to have access to these events. East Timor",80
93,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed a to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime it dramatically. Minister agree with his colleague the member for Melbourne who said that his government's I actions had virtually legitimised bloodshed and misery in East Timor? Or does the Prime Minister agree with his colleague the member for Moreton who said yesterday that Australia. I had little credibility on human rights-and he that, if you did not believe him, the you should ask the family of those killed in time; Santa Cruz whether Australia had achieved to anything for their rights and freedoms? At what stage of your overseas trip did you support the United States and again raise the East Timor problem with the Indonesians?",81
94,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have raised the issue of East Timor forthrightly, fully, on a number of I occasions with President Suharto, with Foreign Minister Alitas. I believe that in a rela':' what it is tionship of substanceMr Halverson-Was anybody else there? Opposition members-Ha, hal",81
95,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are easily amused over there. I have always told you: one of the salient things about being over here is to keep you happy over there. It cheers us up that you access are content with your position. As a consequence, the relationship with Indonesia today is not a thin foreign policy of relationship which is sitting on the knife edge of relations over East Timor, which for many years is what it has been, but rather recognisthe fact that this is a country of just on 200 to air. million people which has brought huge changes to that community. I refer to the of distribution of wealth through Indonesia and a change in the lifestyle. The fact that 60 per cent of Indonesians were living below the poverty line 10 years ago and that has now fallen to 17 per cent represents a remarkable drew change in the distribution of wealth in that It is apparent for anybody who goes through it to see. Here we are talking about a country which is eight flying hours across an archipelago of thousands of islands held the together by a common language and which is administered in such a way that there is growth and employment, because that economy has been growing at about eight per cent year for the last 12 years. This is changing Bringing Indonesia into part of the world community and. staging an international meeting of such circumstance and moment as the A,PEC leaders meeting, and the President of Indonesia playing such a key role in the leadership of that communique in its aspirations, and in garnering support for it, means that Indonesia has a much larger stake now in the Asia-Pacific region in a community of countries amongst whom some have liberal values---:small 'I' liberal values, on these questions about the rights of the individual. Therefore, I think it is important to underline that, through a policy of engaging Indonesia, when Australia disagrees with it over things like what happened in Timor, and seeks to improve the economic capacity of the province of East Timor, those things are taken notice of. Australia is now contributing substantial funding to East Timor for that very purpose; that is, to try to alleviate poverty, provide job opportunities and improve education. Mr MCGauran-So you didn't raise it?",81
96,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, stop that. Mr MCGauran-Did you raise it or not? Yes or no?",82
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Gippsland asked the question. Listen to the answer. MrKEATING-I was asked at a press conference. I did not raise it. I said before I left I would not be raising it. I do not think it is my responsibility every time. I fly into Indonesia to go through a litany of issues on this. The primary requirement of Australian foreign policy and trade policy on this occasion was to get the Bogor declaration upand get it up we did. I do not know whether the bpposition quite understands-I have said it before, and I will say it again-that the event of greatest positive strategic significance to Australia in the postwar years was the election of President Suharto's new order government. Had it not been for that cohesive event-if the archipelago was breaking up-we would not be spending two per cent of GDP on defence; we would be spending six or seven per cent. Of course, if there, were a coalition government around, we would be spending even more, in the sense that it never seems to be able, to relate to that country at all. It is time for the coalition not to be in the business of opportunism, but ratherMr MCGauran-Why didn't you raise the question? Look at what Gibson said.",82
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the memI might addber for Gippsland.,82
99,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to focus on a multi-tiered relationship with Indonesia within which one can express one's views forthrightly. I have had no problem putting my views about East Timor as hard as nails to the president; neither has Gareth Evans. But because the president and the government there know we are trying to build a broad relationship, they listen to our views. On recent performance, notice has been taken of them. President Clinton was being enjoined by people in the United States happened there. Mr Tanner-What is your position on it?  position is what is in important.",82

101,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to not provide MFN status to China on the basis of human rights, and President Clinton rejected that view. He was right to reject that view; that is, the whole relationship with China, bringing China into the developed world and into the GATT, will produce over time far more freedoms in China than would simply a policy of disengagement and abuse or confrontation. So he explicitly rejected that path. It is completely consistent for him to raise questions about East Timor with President Suharto as this was his first visit to Indonesia. But we have already done that, and we have done that over and over again. This government does not lower the flag on human rights and it will not. Mr MCGauran-What about Gibson; what about Tanner?",82
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,82
103,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And nor it should. There are people with very strong feelings about this issue. It has gone back a long time to 1975 and the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia. At the time there was a hopeless colonial power in Portugal which did absolutely nothing for those people in East Timor. I cannot remember the Fraser government going up there confronting Indonesia over the incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia, or banging the drum. Mr Downer-What are you doing about it?",82

106,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indonesia is our largest, closest neighbour, a friendly country that has a huge development process going along which is alleviating the poverty and lifting the opportunity of its people. That is something to be supported. What is not to be supported are incursions against individual rights and human rights. In a mature relationship, Australia puts its views-views which come from its deep-rooted democracy and sense of liberty that we have traditionally held. I see these being completely consistent in a relationship of substance. Aboriginal Children: Separation from Families",83
107,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. What action is being taken to address the continuing problems arising from the past practices of removing Aboriginal children from their families?,83
108,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In rising to answer this question, could I thank you, Mr Speaker, for your participation in today's events with the reconciliation council. I am sure it will be remembered as a very memorable event by all who attended. The question asked by the member for Capricornia raises issues of great sensitivity and hurt for many Aboriginal people. The member for Capricornia, as an effective woman member of this House and as a mother, would appreciate the particular sensitivity of this issue. Regrettably, a great many non-Aboriginal Australians do not realise that generations of Aboriginal people were separated from their families as a result of policies of state and I territory governments, of institutions and, indeed, of the national government itself when it had responsibility for the Northern Territory. This practice of separation continued under state and territory governments in the lifetimes of most living Australians and in the lifetimes of virtually all the members ofÂ·this House. The policies were starkly brought home to all of us with the statistics of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which showed that 43 of the 99 people whose lives were examined by the royal commission were people who had been separated from their natural families through intervention by state authorities, missions or other institutions. That figure of 43 out of 99 is a particularly chilling one. In the Commonwealth response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, we significantly boosted the resources available to Aboriginal community based organisations-the link-up groups-to try to assist in reuniting Aboriginal people with their families who had been separated because of government policy. Significantly, however, much more remains to be done. There is no doubt that the scars of this practice continue to be felt today, and there are many matters associated with the practice that remain unresolved and in need of attention. In response to calls by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission representatives and other community representatives, I have given my public support for the idea of establishing a study into that former practice of removing Aboriginal children from their families. Today I can inform the member and the House that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and hence the government, will be giving further consideration to such a study in the context of the social justice package-being the government's third stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case. Finally, I remind the House that, should the parliament adopt a just and effective proposal that the government advocates for the establishment of a national land fund, among the people who will greatly benefit as a result of this initiative will be the people who have been separated from their families. I take this opportunity to advise the House of the unanimous decision of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission National Board of Commissioners which has reaffirmed its support for the government's proposal for the land fund in its original form. I table before the House that press release from ATSIC. I urge the coalition and the Western Australian Greens to rethink their position on this issue. Interest Rates",83
109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, who is so embarrassed about presiding over the highest prime bank interest rates in the industrialised world that he could not even mention it.",84
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will get to his question.,84
111,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In August and October of this year, the Reserve Bank lifted official interest rates in the name of keeping down inflation. Yesterday, a member of the Reserve Bank board, Bill Kelty, urged unions to 'Go for it' on wage claims which will obviously fuel inflation. Do you concede Mr Kelty has an .obvious conflict of interest in being a member of the Reserve Bank board and in encouraging wage claims as secretary of the ACTU? Who should we believe-the Reserve Bank governor who wants to keep inflation down or one of his board members who wants to stoke it up?",84
112,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that Mr Kelty said the impact of any wage claims on the economy would depend on the degree to which they were backed by productivity and profit sharing. Of course that is true. The point we have been making is that there is nothing wrong with workers getting increases in wages in advance of the rate of inflation so long as they are backed by increased productivity. If companies are prepared to offer their employees a share of increased profits, and the profits are at high levels, that is also right. What is not all right is increasing unit labour costs in a way which will push up the rate of inflation, lose the comparability that we have with the inflation rates of our major trading partners, damage our competitiveness and damage our prospects for future economic and employment growth. That is clearly not all right. I do not see anything in what Mr Kelty is saying that indicates he is pursuing some irresponsible course. He is clearly saying in the interview which appears on the front page of the Australian Financial Review today that productivity and profit sharing are a basis upon which the economic impact of wage increases can and should be limited. Wage earners, those making wage claims on their behalf and those who are responding to those claims, need to bear in mind that if the outcome of all that is not in line with the possibility of keeping the underlying rate of inflation in that two to three per cent range, that will have clear implications for policy, because policy will need to be changed in order to ensure that we do remain somewhere within that range. The government and the Reserve Bank have made it absolutely clear that the great structural change that has occurred in Australia, above all others-certainly there have been a lot of structural changes-is getting low inflation. We certainly will not see that enormously beneficial structural change thrown away. If the outcomes of wage determination are such that they are not compatible with the maintenance of low inflation, obviously policy will have to be tighter than it would otherwise need to be. All those involved in wage determination need to understand that. Corporations Law",84
113,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What progress has been made towards the comprehensive simplification of the Corporations Law?,84
114,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jn the next sitting week there will be introduced into the parliament the first of the simplification bills. They will introduce three major changes to the Corporaall tions Law in relation to share buy backs, company registers and, very importantly for the small business community, reforms to proprietary companies. This will allow single individuals to incorporate and, for the vast majority of Australian companies, do away with the need to lodge annual returns with the Australian Securities Commission. This will mean a major reduction in compliance costs for Australian companies. I am also releasing today a further proposal from the simplification task force on the issue of share capital rules. At the moment, they form a complicated and convoluted set of largely technical rules. The reform proposals will greatly reduce the complexities currently in this area of the Corporations Law. They will do away with the notional value of par value shares, streamline provisions dealing with the granting of financial assistance to companies to purchase their own shares, and simplify the court procedures which are required in gaining approval for these transactions. This, added to a range of other proposals the simplification task force-those dealing with company names, audit provisions and the incorporation of companies, which have been released throughout this year and will be released early next year-will mean that a second bill will be able to be introduced by the middle of next year. With the passage of both the first stage and second stage, the core requirements of Australian company lawcertainly those dealing with the vast majority of proprietary companies-will, by the end of next year, have been simplified. That is a major achievement for this government. It is a major piece of microeconomic reform. It will put Australian companies and their legal structures on terms which are the equal of any of our competitor nations, not only in the region but anywhere in the world. I can inform the honourable member that we are making extremely good progress with this major set of microeconomic reforms, which have been well received, and rightly so, by the Australian business community. ATSIC: Land Fund Legislation",84

118,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the minister inform the House, firstly, why he failed to consult with the indigenous community when drawing up the land fund legislation and, secondly, by why he claimed that the consultation process leading up to the bill was the most exhaustive ever taken by the government on indigenous issues? Does this mean that the minister's consultation on other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues is even less adequate than it was in relation to the land fund or in this instance did the minister mislead the House?",85

134,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I was making when I was interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition is that the government has conIts policies on consultation on indigenquesous affairs are vindicated by the public opinion polls that respect the government's achievements in this area. The Bulletin poll of 24 October showed an unprecedented response from the Australian public in support of our policies on Aboriginal affairs. Fiftytwo per of the people polled supported the government; only 17 per cent-the lowest in any area of policy-supported the coalition. That is because of the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has bungled Aboriginal affairs policy and has allowed important issues of principle to be linked up with important issues of suchMrs Gallus- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is not addressing the points that were made in the question. If he wants to raise other points, he might tell the House why he failed to give the Aboriginal people an extra $3 million that the opposition asked for.",86
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, now you are debating the issue. The minister was asked a question about consultation and, as I hear it, the minister is responding on that. I am sure he is winding up.",87
136,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly am. Mr Speaker, can I tell you precisely what the process was. It was a process of consultation involving not only a number of the indigenous organisations referred to by the member for Hindmarsh in her question; it was also a process of consultation that involved the Leader of the Opposition. I would be the last one to pick on my very good friend the member for Wentworth, but it was also a process of consultation that involved him. The problem was that, when the Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition leader did not even bother to respond. The fact of the matter is that the bill introduced into this House was the subject of an exhaustive process of consultation and of a very significant face-to-face meeting with the Prime Minister of this country and key indigenous organisations, a number of which were referred to in the question. As a result of those consultations, the government introduced a bill in the House. I make this point in conclusion: I ask the people of Australia to judge just one of the amendments that has been supported by the I coalition and by the Western Australian Greens. You tell me if this is good public policy. Does anyone on this side of the House think it is good policy for there to be an availability of grants not only to individual Aboriginal people but for there to be no prohibition on the immediate disposal of that land following the grant? Does anyone support that? Government members-No!",87

Above all else it asks for an opinion, and you should rule accordingly.",87
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. There was no expression of opinion called for. The Prime Minister.,87
148,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the key ingredients in growth, activity and employment has been to lift the level of investment in this .country from the trough of the 1970s. This happened through the 1980s, with a very large equipment and investment phase in the Australian economy. I am pleased to say it is happening again. Despite some questioning and some scepticism on the part of some commentators and,of course, cynicism on the part of the coalition we are now seeing quite strong investment figures coming through. As a consequence that is coming from a very high level of profits in the economy. It is coming from a low inflation rate. It is coming from a pick-up in consumer confidence as high as we have seen it at any time in the last 20 years. Therefore, the state of business opinion matters a great deal in respect of public policy and the government. I was very pleased to see that a number of leading business community figures are supporting the government. Mr Ritchie from MCDo-ald's said recently: The Labor Party have an outstanding group of young ministers and those people behind the minister are a formidable opposition to take on. But he went on to say of the coalition: They are not half as good as the Labor Party group. It seems to me they have lost their way. One of their most important constituencies was the business community and my observation is that they've lost the business community. In fact I pointed out that what the Labor Party has achieved in the last eight years was probably more than the Liberals had done in any of their previous terms. I think what the Liberal Party need to do is to decide what they're really on about, what their platform is, what their constituency is and until they do that it really doesn't matter who them. He went on to say: What their major policy lines are is very unclear. In fact I know that there is a thought amongst the Liberals that, you know, the less they say about policy the better and at the last minute they will whack John Howard in there and get elected at the next election. I think they're dreaming if they're serious in that thought that they have considered that I have heard expressed. Mr Ritchie is not alone. In the Financial Review recently one chief executive of a large finance company put his criticisms succinctly: Business is not so worried about the Liberal Party because there's not much to care about. It is a pathetic party at every level. Who wants to give money to a loser? And I regard myself as a Liberal. The Chairman of the Business Council, Mr Ian Salmon, said: I think there is certainly a need for the opposition party to regally state its case, stick to it and be seen to be a true alternative government. So the state of the parties does matter. The support of the business community does matter. It matters in public opinion terms. It matters in political terms. It matters in the climate for investment. It matters in regard to the confidence with which the business community undertakes investment knowing that the government is in charge of the economy and society, knowing that low inflation and a healthy profit share in the economy will be maintained and knowing that the government has the policies that can actually deliver the goods-and not just the government, not just the existing cabinet and ministry, but a significant group of people in the back bench of the government who in the future could qualify for ministerial office. These are all key and, I think, important judgments by the business community which reflect poorly on the opposition. I finish on that point. I have often said, 'With the Liberal Party, the problem is not the jockey but the horse.' That is exactly the point Mr Ritchie is making. Until you get your policies straight over there, it will not matter who is leading you. Prime Minister",88
149,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to is leading the Prime Minister. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the claim by Ms Laura Tingle at the launch of her new book Chasing the future that her book' documents your 'greatest culpability in the lead-up to the recession', which was that you 'consistently lied about the fact that the government was pushing up interest rates in 1988'. Given this documented history of dishonesty in relation to economic policy, why should anyone believe you when you say that you will not push up interest rates to 14 per cent or more? Why should anyone believe that you have abandoned the policies which have caused mass unemployment, which have widened the gap between the rich and the poor in our society and which have made Australia a more unequal and inegalitarian society?",88

He knows because he was around as Secretary to the Treasury and as governor of the central your visits. bank. I have read in this House before things which the former governor had to say. He talked about dealings with the government and said that the propriety of them and the way in which the government related to the bank were such that there was never any pressure, other than proper discussion about a shared interest in the monetary environment. He said, 'You have to be around a long time to know that this was not always so.' Do you dispatch boxremember that quote from Bob Johnson? Guess who he was talking about? I am surprised that Laura Tingle even implied any of this. When I resigned as Treasurer in June 1991, there was a tear her eye at the press conference. I was both touched and flattered. I thought, 'Well, you've got the cut and thrust of all these things the journos pushing questions to you but, you are going out, a little tear here and is rather moving.'

177,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs a question concerning the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. What has been the response of veterans to the they introduction of nicotine patches under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme? How many veterans have taken up the nicotine patch prescriptions?,90
178,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. About 65 per cent of all costs associated with new disability pensions are smoking related. Something like 2,500 to 3,000 people per year die as a result of smoking related diseases-cigarette smoking mainly. On 1 August this year the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme had nicotine patches listed on the scheme. As a result, members of the veteran community, who argue that smoking caused a lot of their problems and that they were actually given smoke rations during World War II, now have the opportunity at a concessional rate to get nicotine patches. As at the first week in October, approximately 823 had availed themselves of the nicotine patches-only about 10 per cent of those we thought would. 1 hope now that we can redouble our efforts to get more people there. 1 would tell you more about it, but it is getting a bit late.",90

As I notice that exhibition has a curator who is an officer of the parliament, have you apIf proved the symbol that is displayed very prominently around that exhibition? As that symbol is part of the Australian flag, showing as an Australian Southern Cross-the Southern Cross is not peculiar to Australia but to every country in the Southern Hemisphere-and as the Australian flag was part of the process, evolved from the process, of federation, and as it would seem appropriate that it be shown in that exhibition, will you instruct the people involved to ensure that the Australian flag is displayed appropriately? Will you tell them that to show only the Southern Cross in form they have would suggest that the nationland al symbol-the national flag-which is still endorsed by two-thirds of Australians in the latest poll should be shown proudly, whatever the latest form of political revisionism suggest.",91

185,Mrs GALLUS,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Last night in the Senate, Senator Murphy made a speech on the adjournment debate imputing motives to me which question my integrity as a member of the House of Representatives.

He said: - really ?ring- into question why Chris Gallus got Involved In thIS and what her interest was... on If y-u look. at wh-t C-is Gallus did prior to A enterIng parlIament It mIght throw some light on the question of why she got involved. we were to look at her CV, we would see that she was an advertising executive-I do not know for which company. But one would have to assume, I said, on the basis of the information I have from my own investigations, that Mrs Gallus rang up on behalf of another advertising company. An accurate account of what happened is that or earlier this year I was contacted on the basis of my well-known interest in the environment and, I believe, on the assumption that I was still shadow minister for the environment although I no longer held that portfolio. I wainformed that there was a move to erect large the billboards along the green space on CSIRO between O'Halloran Hill and Darlington in South Australia-a strip of about two kilometres which is at present free of structures of any kind. Following this call; I might .contacted the Mayor of Marion, Mr Colin Hayes, whose local government area covers O'Halloran Hill. The Mayor of Marion inme that his council had not been approached about the erecting of billboards pn The the green space and that, were they to be approached, they would oppose it and would expect considerable community opposition to erecting anything of this nature on the space. Following this I called the CSIRO, which told me that, as a Commonwealth statutory organisation, legally it did not need council approval to put up billboards and that, after being approached by an individual, it had agreed to lease space on its land for the purpose of erecting the billboards. I told the that, as a member of the community, I was totally opposed to billboards going up in the green space. I believed that the rest of the community would be similarly outraged if it were to go ahead. I told the CSIRO that it was unconscionable",91

220,Mr SPEAKER,VOTES AND PROCEEDINGS,"Members will be aware that the Evidence Bill 1993 passed the House on 19 October 1994 and is presently listed on the Senate Notice Paper for consideration. When the bill was before the House, the Acting Speaker and I wrote to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) expressing our concern that the bill did not specify that the Votes and Proceedings constitute the official record of the House of Representatives. We suggested that this could be achieved by retaining the provisions of subsection 7(1) of the current Evidence Act 1905. In reply, the minister noted that subsection 7(1) of the 1905 act removes the need for strict proof of the documents referred to in this subsection by providing that purported copies of the documents may be tendered and admitted into evidence. Importantly, it also noted that subsection 7(1) does not specify what are the official records of the proceedings of the House of parliament and does no more than is achieved by existing provisions of the Evidence Bill 1993. Given this, I believe that it is appropriate for the House to determine the status of the Votes and Proceedings by formally recognising that the Votes and Proceedings are the official record of the proceedings of the House. I have consulted the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Howard) and the chairman of the Procedure Committee about this matter. I am advised that an appropriate way to address the issue is for the House to declare by resolution the Votes and Proceedings to be the record of the proceedings of the House and by moving an amendmentÂ· to standing order 38. I present for the information of honourable members draft notices of motion for these two recommended actions. NA APEC Meeting",94

I call upon those members who approve. of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",94
222,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is with great pleasure that I. propose this matt-r of public importance recognising the achievements in Jakarta of the APEC trade deal. The conclusion of the APEC deal should be one of those rare occasions in this parliament where we as a parliament and as a community on a bipartisan basis congratulate the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on their substantial achievement. In 20 years time, when this country is deriving the benefits of this historic agreement and when most of the members of this House will be long gone, the role that the Prime Minister and the government have played in this historic agreement will be well and truly remembered because, while there will be winners and losers in this deal, there is absolutely no doubt that Australia is a very big winner from the A:PEC deal in Jakarta. It is a big winner in terms of our long-term economic future. We have secured through this deal our long-term economic future because this free trade agreement brings together half of the world's production. and communities that span four continents. It means that, by the year 2020, we will have a trade community where seven of the world's 10 wealthiest economies are coming together in a trade agreement. The agreement reached at APEC marks, I think,probably the most significant. foreign policy achievement for Australiasmce the decision by John Curtin in 1942 to embrace a new security policy future for Australia. In 1942 he turned away from the United Kingdom and turned towards the United States. The achievements at Bogor were made possible by Australian political leadership, particularly by the leadership of our Prime Minister, our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and our Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan). APEC really is an Australian political innovation forged by Australian Labor governments. As a concept it was sold to a sceptical region to the point where now it is part and parcel of the policy superstructure the world. Five years ago this achievement would simply have been inconceivable. When an Australian Prime Minister first proposed that APEC should become an annual heads of government meeting, many people in this country and in the region thought that we had overreached ourselves; they thought that it could not be done. We had not overreached ourselves. Within two years we had an inaugural meeting in Seattle. We now have this meeting in Indonesia which lays out a blueprint for free trade, free flows of investment and economic growth for our region into the next century. What was seen only a couple of years ago as a remote vision which was fraught with difficulty, if not impossible, now become an economic reality-and that reflects well upon the actions of this government. The essential ingredient in putting the theory of free trade into practice has been an Australian Prime Minister, backed by an Australian Labor foreign minister. We have managed to forge this agreement, along with President Suharto and President Clinton, in a way in which nobody could have thought possible a couple of years ago. In essence, APEC's Bogor declaration is the jewel in the crown of Australian Labor foreign policy achievements and probably the most significant achievement of our present Prime Minister. The history of the Labor Party has always been one of pursuing an activist foreign policy. In 1942 John Curtin and his colleagues simply did not sit in their rooms and mope when it became clear that Britain could not provide Australia with a security guarantee. Instead, they looked creatively at the world around them and engaged the United States. They took the lead in forging alliances with the United States. What did the conservatives have to say then? They still looked to Britain, as they do today. Again it was an Australian Labor government in Â·1972 which finally took the lead in recognising the political existence of a quarter of humanity when we finally recognised the government in Beijing. For a quarter of a century the conservatives in this country simply pretended that of China did not exist. We changed this, as a Labor government, in 1972. Since the election of this Labor government in 1983, this activist tradition in foreign policy has continued unabated. The agreement this week in Indonesia is simply the crowning achievement of activist foreign policy from Labor governments. It will mean bigger and better economic growth. It will .mean more and better paid jobs. It secures, in effect, a future for our children. It will radically expand the trading sectors of the economy and pave the way not only for more jobs but more highly paid jobs, more secure jobs, more highly trained jobs and a better standard of living for all of this comhas munity. This agreement gives this country great optimism for the future-the sort of optimism that we require if we are going to make it in the world of international trade. This agreement puts us at the centre of world economic activity and, as the Prime Minister has said, it puts us at the biggest table of them all. It is appropriate that in this debate today we recognise the role that the Prime Minister has played. I know President Clinton and President Suharto have said that this agreement would not have been possible if it had not been for the activist role of Australian Prime Ministers, particularly the activist role of Prime Minister Keating. It is not only foreign leaders who have been paying tribute to the role played by the Prime Minister in putting this deal together; it is also many commentators in this country-people who are acknowledged as influential commentators. Today I would like to quote from one of those influential commentators. He said that the Prime Minister is 'taking the country in the right direction on ""big picture"" issues'. He stated: Paul Keating is painting a vision for Australia which is inspiring and achievable. What is significant about the PM's .recent detailed pronouncements is the extent to which they synthesise a range of doml?Stic and foreign policy issues by demonstrating their beneficial integration. He also described Prime Minister Keating's address to the Asia-Australia Institute last month as 'one of the most important statements ever uttered by an Australian Prime Minister and probably the most significant in peacetime'. He went on to say that he enthusiastically supports Mr Keating's analysis of Australia's role in the Asia-Pacific region. He stated: The PM expressed it admirably--'We do not, and cannot, aim to be Asian or European or anything else but Australians'. He is correct because we are united by shared values based essentially on tolerance, a sense of fair play, love of family, desire for financial independence, overall self-reliance and a willingness to learn new things. Who was the very influential Australian commentator who made that comment? Who could it have been? It was Mr Ian Macphee, who until recently was an opposition frontbencher in this House. There is no person in the Australian community who would be more qualified to judge the achievements of the Prime Minister in this matter than Mr Macphee-someone who was unceremoniously removed from this House by the current member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). There is ample evidence of the achievements of this government, its foreign minister, its trade minister and, particularly, the Prime Minister. It is not just a question of economic benefit. It is not just a question of our economic future. APEC also' affords this country the prospect of peace in. our region, of integration of those countries on the eastern side of the Pacific into the affairs of the western side of the Pacific and Asia. APEC will become an anchor which will keep the United States engaged in our part of the world. That is good for America, good for Australia and good for the region's long-term stability and security as well. Without APEC, none of that would be possible. APEC is not just an economic agreement; it is an agreement which secures the long term security needs of this community. In the United States there are always isolationist trends and forces at work. The pressure to retreat to a fortressed America is always evident in the United States. APEC provides a major force for keeping the United States engaged' in the world and the region rather than simply looking inward. . ' Apart from the economic and long-term security benefits, APEC also provides a mechanism for the development of long-term dialogue and relationships between all of the diverse political traditions in our region. Prior to APEC there was no such mechanism to pull 18 totally different political cultures into a single decision making body, but that has occurred in the forum in Jakarta. We should not pretend that APEC will solve all our regional problems and tensions-it cannot but it can certainly help in minimising them. The great thing about APEC is that it surprised and stunned all of the diplomatic professionals. Those who spend their time watching and observing diplomatic events, usually cynically, those who are used to diplomatic achievements occurring atasnail's pace, have simply been stunned by the course over the last couple of years-first of all, by the events in Seattle and then by the crowning glory of the decisions that were taken in Indonesia. All of these cynics were proved wrong. The movement towards free trade, as the Prime Minister said in 'question time, is now a reality. If it had not been for the pushing, the cajoling and the constant support and activitiesÂ· of the Prime Minister and his foreign minister, it is doubtful that the achievements of recent times would have been possible. So what have we had in the House today from the opposition? Has that bipartisan spirit that I called for before been demonstrated? Is there any evidence that those opposite really do support APEC and the free trade deal? What have they had to say about trade policy? We heard the usual cynicism again today-a grudging welcome from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), tinged by the usual cynicism and lack of policy alternatives. The fact of the matter is that most of those opposite would probably think APEC is an insurance company. Those opposite are to trade issues what Frankenstein's monster would be to ballroom dancing.Â· It is a very ugly combination, a very uncomfortable combination. Those opposite do not have a full policy alternative. Let us see what they had to say about policy at their recent conference. An article by Tom Burton in the Australian Financial Review of 31 October stated: Nowhere was this more evident than in the economic debate, where the sole motion dealing with the economy was whisked through in a couple of minutes with only one speech from Shadow Treasurer Peter Costello. There was one motion, with one speaker, on economic policy at their national conference. It was left to outsiders to offer ideas. The article further stated: Downer's speech about the resurgence of Liberalism was met by quiet applause, as the reality of his record low opinion-poll ratings overwhelmed his rhetoric. Toasts to the Queen and Lady Menzies tickled the traditionalists, but made the whole strangely like a time warp-more like a country town debutantes' ball than a modem political conference. I think that accurately sums up the trade approach and the lack of policy of those opposite. It sums up the fact that it still looks to Britain and has not come to grips with trading in our region. The Leader ofÂ· the Opposition has spent almost a third of his life living in Great Britain and has a policy approach which is borne from that era. The opposition is indeed living in a time warp. That is why it has its leadership paralysiswhich is accompanied, as I said earlier, by a policy paralysis. Nowhere is this policy and leadership paralysis more evident than in the events in this House. Whether we are talking about APEC, interest rates or unemployment, there is no policy alternative from the opposition. If we review the tactics the opposition has implemented in this House in recent times, we see that the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has effectively been on strike. It has not been attacking or highlighting any of these issues because it is more concerned with bringing the Leader of the Opposition down. This is demonstrated very perceptively in the Bulletin this week, where Laurie Oakes says that he was talking to a Liberal MP and the Liberal MP said: I saw you talking to Howard . . . I would have joined you, but he'd already spoken to me five times today. The member for Bennelong is out there gathering the numbers. He is deliberately going on strike in this House and he is deliberately sabotaging any political attack upon the government with the leadership struggle. The leadership struggle is simply a systemA quorum having been called and the bells being rungMrs Sullivan- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the fact that I asked for a quorum and a .member left the House.",94

He will get a large measure of bipartisanship on this, but he certainly will not get bipartisanship in terms of what he said because he did not even address the matter he ha..<; brought before the House. I thought we were supposed to be talking about achievements at APEC but, instead, what did we hear? We heard a sermon on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is not all about Keating. It is not all about Evans. It is about a lot of countries getting together and trying to do things. You will get bipartisanship, but only if you really approach the substantive issues. I wonder about the Prime Minister. I notice that in today's Australian Financial Review there is the headline 'Our Paul, the best dam frog puncher at Bogor'. I suppose that that is meant to be an analogy about a frog jumping if you give it a good kick up the backside. I wonder whether a better analogy in relation to the Prime Minister would be that President Clinton would have seen him as somebody who is very small, very noisy, very thinskinned and very susceptible to beirig trodden undeifoot. Before I move to the Bogor declaration, I will say a little about APEC in the broader sense and APEC and the Australian connection. Finally, I will address the motion about the Bogor experience that is before us and then discuss the situation beyond Bogor into next year and Osaka. APEC was established to develop approaches towards the promotion of economic and trade cooperation that will enhance associations amongst its members in ways which do not discriminate against non-APEC members. Its regional cooperation is then to be opened to all other states interested in trade and growth. One major avenue for APEC to achieve these goals is the pursuit of trade facilitation. We heard a lot about that during question time today. These measures are directly relevant to the interests of business in the region. They can help deepen the basis for communication and understanding amongst members and are consistent with the concept of open regionalism by developing policies which facilitate trade without discriminating against nonAPEC members. Furthermore, the APEC forum gives the opportunity for bilateral and multilateral discussions at both the ministerial and heads of government levels. Australia's emphasis on APEC therefore reflects directly the growing significance of the Asia-Pacific in Australia's economic relations. Today during question time the Prime Minister referred to this as the start of a pacific century. Once he answered a question by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), he was exposed as being somebody who really does not genuinely believe that it is the start of a pacific century. ",97
227,Mr TAYLOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Ask former Senator Richardson. Why our emphasis on APEC? The Asia-Pacific region is growing at a substantially faster rate than the OECD average. The Asia-Pacific region has a burgeoning middle class. Of a total population of over two billion people, it is estimated that the number of people with household incomes over $10,000 will double from 40 million to 80 million from 1988 to the tum of the century. Mrs Moylan-Much faster than Australia.",98
228,Mr TAYLOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is much faster, yes. East Asia now takes 60 per cent of Australia's exports, which is up from 50 per cent five years ago. Australia's trade with Asia has increased at a trend rate of over 10 per cent annually in the past decade. Therefore, it is important to Australia for a number of reasons. While trade and economic relations in the Asia-Pacific have been growing rapidly, a high level of protection is still afforded to trade in the region. This has impeded the progress of regional economic integration and prevented the region from reaching its full economic potential. Furthermore, by encouraging trade liberalisation on a regional basis, APEC can also encourage liberalisation at the global level. The success of the APEC leaders meeting in Seattle last year is considered to have had a positive influence on the outcome of the Uruguay Round at the end of the year. The Director-General of GATT, Peter Sullivan, has stated that efforts by APEC to liberalise trade on a regional basis are quite compatible with the aims of GATT and its successor, the World Trade Organisation. Australia has also seen as highly valuable APEC's role in associating the United States in regional economic cooperation. Australia has supported active US involvement in APEC as a way of broadening the context of the relationships between the US and Asia, which continue to be vital for the economic and security interests of both parties. What about Bogor and beyond?Â· The honourable member for Lilley did not mention anything about what the Bogor declaration contained. I will read into the Hansard record what the Bogor declaration indicates. In brief, there will be free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region by 2020, industrial countries are to implement the agreement by 2010, a discriminatory free trade area has been rejected, a non-binding investment code has been agreed, priority industries for standards harmonisation has been decided, regular leaders and ministerial meetings have been reaffIrmed, a dispute mediation process has been planned, there will be regional support for human resource development programs and, finally, there will be cooperation on small business and infrastructure. In looking at the success or otherwise of Bogor, one does not have to go any further than the last three days in the national newspapers. I refer the House to Monday's Australian, which contained an article by Denis Gastin. He wrote: But amid the backslapping at Bogor it is not churlish to ask: ""Are we getting the most we can out of APEC?"" One very important question too often ducked by boosters is whether our motivation in putting so many of our cards on this particular table is genuinely strategic or just opportunistic. Is APEC being pursued as an element in a well thought-out global trade strategy, as a surrogate for a trade strategy, as a consolation prize for a quite ordinary Uruguay Round outcome, or merely as a series of events? It is definitely not the former. A stop-start three year process to produce a national trade and investment strategy has failed to provide the overall strategic context in which Australia's approach to APEC could be positioned in a balanced way. He went on to say: The much-lauded Uruguay Round agreement, for example, has been substantially devalued ex post by the backsliding of parties to the settlement who were only ever marginally committed to the result. Even if this were not the case, Australia's own ability to benefit is severely curtailed by its failure to complete the micro reforms necessary to ensure we are sufficiently competitive to take up the ""potential"". Trade policy and domestic policy are inextricable, the industry bodies argue, but this point has been skated over in the still incomplete national trade and investment strategy process and f has been given scant recognition in the run-up to Bogor. Despite this, we are calling for free tradeat the earliest possible date. On Tuesday, Louise Williams wrote an article for the Sydney Morning Herald which said: On the face of it, the APEC summit is all about a new, pragmatic world order of nations united by trade, not divided by ideology. But when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, takes his seat in Bogor today, the high levels talks will be as much about negotiating the myriad domestic agendas brought to the table by nations as culturally, politically and historically diverse as China and the United States or Brunei and Chile. The article continued: But what the diplomatic row between Australia and Thailand in the days leading up to the APEC summit demonstrates is that no amount of backslapping and camaraderie over free trade can paper over the vast range of domestic sensitivities which Australia has taken on in pursuing a regional trade agenda. On Wednesday, Geoffrey Barker from the Financial Review wrote: Paul Keating's place in Australia's political history has been sealed with yesterday's Asia-Pacific free trade agreement. Whether it will be an honoured or an accursed place will depend on the economic, political and security consequences that flow now from the Bogor pact. He continued: But it is far from risk-free for Mr Keating or for Australia for three reasons. First it remains to be seen how the disparate and far-flung APEC grouping will be able to work out the detail of yesterday'S framework agreement. For Mr Keating the political costs will depend partly on who wins and loses in Australia, and how smoothly the structural adjustments are made within Australia and elsewhere. Second, it remains to be seen what moral price Australia will have to pay to maintain cordial relations with partners who do not share Australia's attitudes towards human rights and political and economic probity. Finally, Paul Keating has justified the agreement on the ground that it will keep the US engaged in Asia as a force for strategic stability and democracy. Unhappily the recent history of US relations with China and Japan hardly inspires confidence in US policy approaches in Asia, and President Clinton has been seriously weakened by the recent US midterm election results. Paul Keating will be praying that Mr Clinton does not lose his nerve or his battle to get the GAlT agreement through the US Senate. Earlier today; my colleague the Leader of the National Party .(Mr Tim Fischer) issued a media release on the matter. If the honourable member for Lilley is looking for some bipartisanship, here it is""""-but with a strong qualifier. The Leader of the National Party said: The outcome of the Bogor meeting is to take APEC another step forward, but if Australia is to bind with Asia in trade terms then we need to be as competitive as Asia, and our infrastructure needs to match best Asian practice. The statement went on to say: . . . we have b-n slow to introduce national trade and investment strategies that will assist our regional competitiveness; there is an increasing trend towards intra Asia APEC trade which potentially can render Australia redundant as' a regional trading partner; AFfA .'.. whiCh embraces the six ASEAN states tha- are also .in APEC, is disadvantageous to Australia because of its discriminatory nature; there' is' no dear c-risensus on trade, some APEC members are talking 'trade llberalisalion', others are talking about 'aims', and so on; and ' . thai the outcomes arrived at at Bogor were ... hardly founded on widespread unanimity. . . . while the Coalition was behind free tradethere was still much to be done to flesh out the concept, and' what the region did not want was a free trade block of the type embodied in a PAFfA arrangement. Mr Fischer added that an Australian definition of free trade was one based on open nondiscriminatory multilateral trade. Clearly, a lot has to be done between now and Osaka in 1995. Again, you need look no further than today's Courier-Mail, which highlights some of the differences of opinion amongst those who were there. We see reports about President Clinton and human rights in Indonesia. We see the Japanese Prime Minister arriving back in Tokyo and saying: . 'Japan will take a positive approach in, the creation of an action agenda. He continued: . . . the Osaka meetings would discuss liberalisation measures ""in terms of the actual sectors, the time frame for these sectors and the compensatory measures to achieve these goals"". The other goal was to combat an unwieldy, disorganised APEC framework after six years of ambitious projects. In Kuala Lumpur, we see Prime Minister Mahathir getting back in his usual way. He is reported as saying that he 'feared the proposed biggest free-trade area in the world would not be a level 'playing field. He told a news conference that: . .. in all likelihood a big gap would remain between the rich and poor countries of the Pacific Rim . A'lot of work has been done in the lead-up to Bogor, but a lot of work has to be done between now and Osaka. I only hope that American Professor Chalmers Johnson's comments in the media a few days ago do not come to fruition. He said: By far the most likely scenario is a formalistic grand kabuki, an Asian game where everyone a, definition of free pretends they win.",98
229,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I take great pleasure in speaking in today's discussion of a matter of public importance- 'the need to recognise the achievements at the APEC meeting in Jakarta' - because these are great achievements. These are great personal achievements for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and for the government. They are also of great historical importance for our country's future.,100
230,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thought it was Bob Hawke's idea.,100
231,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Do not worry, I will come to that. It is a great shame that those opposite have shown no support whatsoever for this, cravingly wishing-as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) did in the past-that the times would suit them. Well, they are not going to. I will quote from the Prime Minister's statement on the declaration, because it is a seminal summary. He said: The Bogor declaration charts an extraordinary new path for the region towards extraordinary new goals. He went on to say: What does Bogor mean for Australians? It means a more prosperous economy. It means a better lifestyle. It means not only more employment opportunities but also more interesting ones. It means wider horizons for our young people and more scope for them to exercise their skills as they learn the languages of a wider family and become part of it. Not only business and industry will be challenged, but also education and culture. This is a great achievement. The benefits for our economy, the benefits for employment and the benefits for trade are massively significant. The area will encompass ,mote than two billion people by the turn of the century. It is estimated that it will represent 57 per cent of world trade. By 2020 seven 'of the 10 top economies in the world will belong to it and in Australian terms it is estimated that that means about $7 billion in extra income each year in extra trade. It is estimated to equate to about 70,000 new jobs. This is a region which comprises three-quarters of our exports and the estimates are that we will see a real income rise of 1.2 per cent and real output rise of 3.8 per cent. So this is a great achievement. It is telling that the Prime Minister's efforts Fraser in this regard have been well recognised even before the achievement. I refer to the Ian of Thursday, 27 October. The foreign editor of the Australian, Greg Sheridan, referring to a speech that the Prime Minister made in the run-up to the summit, wrote: Prime Minister Keating last night tore down boundaries between domestic and foreign policy and staked out his vision for Australia and region for 2000. He refers to a 'most thoughtful speech' and goes on to describe 'a deeply thoughtful strategic contribution by the Prime Minister' that included 'a vigorous and self-confident defence of Australia's approach'. sort of praise we have seen on the speech. We have also had-as the member for Lilley (Mr addition Swan) said-the highly complimentary comfacilitation. ment from former Liberal frontbencher Mr Ian Macphee. This is reported in the Telegraph opportunity Mirror of Tuesday, 15 November. Mr Macphee's contribution is referred to as 'a glowing assessment. of Paul Keating's Prime Ministership' and 'an extraordinary assessment from a Liberal'. And that is just on the speech! Now that we have the achievement imagine the raps that we will get from the former Liberal shadow spokesman. But what have we seen from those opposite when faced with the MPI today which seeks to recognise the achievement? A deafening silence or at best a churlish welcome. We . search in vain to see where $e opposition has set out its framework for APEC. I searched in vain for such comments. I was drawn to the book The Heart of Liberalism,with contributions by many shadowsp-kespeople. This. is said to be part of the fight back, part of the intellectual way back for the Liberal Party. So I searched through it for APEC. I found two references-two references! The first reference was by Senator Hill, the Opposition Leader in the Senate. He is the bloke you tried to get down here but it did not quite work out. The secti""Qn where he refers to APEC comes after the section entitled 'the war against communism'. You can see that those opposite are still firmly rooted in the past. Senator Hill's contribution on APEC was to say: planted the seeds for today's APEC when, in conjunction with Japan's Prime Minister Ohira, he established the Pacific Economic Co-operation AustralCouncil which continues today. So Senator Hill's contribution, after the section 'the war against communism', was to credit all this to Malcolm Fraser. Normally, opposition members credit it to Mr Menzies. the (Quorum formed) At least in that section of the book entitled 'Australia's defence in the the 1990s' by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), he was honest enough not to try to credit this progress on APEC to either and Fraser or Menzies. He said: Australia initiated the APEC group in 1989. That is the He went on to say: The group ... is recognised as playing a major role in our economic future as a trading nation. In to the practical benefits which its trade policies. are designed to produce, it provides a framework which offersÂ· Australia the to fully participate in the development of regional cooperation and economic integration strategies which are important factors in maintainyou ing regional security. At least he was honest enough to where it is due. This book, the Heart of Liberalism-and I am sorry to say to those opposite that there is no ticker in this contribution-is firmly placed in the context of defence and security. They are still wedded in the past. The heart of liberalism lives in the past. It has no ticker. The old arteries have hardened. You could not get oxygen through your policy if you were in an iron lung. Normally, as I said, those opposite these things to Menzies. Let me refer to contribution by the Prime Minister in the Sydney Morning Herald of Friday, 28 ber. The article is headed 'How Menzies failed Australia' and it goes to the heart the issue. It reads: These days. you will hear the Liberals say with Jack MCEwen, Menzies pioneered our way Asia. It is true they deserve credit for the treaty with Japan, and the Colombo Plan was useful contribution. But unless we count creative act the war in Vietnam into which Menzies tipped us, that's where the credit stops. The truth is Menzies could never fully appreciate what at least one newspaper of the time appreciatdisgrace ed, namely, that ""we are quite obviously a whose destiny is linked irrevocably with Asia ... In this article, the Prime Minister makes point that we on this side have dragged the tariff walls down; that we on this side have ensured that there is economic deregulation and that we are internationally competitive. All the big historic changes have been made by this side of the House. Those on the other side of the House have no capacity, and no policy framework. They cannot even indicate to the Australian community the great benefits which will come from this historic achievement. . Having referred to Menzies, I conclude drawing the attention of honourable members to the book by Gerard Henderson entitled Menzies' Child. The same Gerard Henderson, your historian, also wrote a recent newspaper article headed 'Outdated Liberals out of tune with the voters'. You are out of tune with modern Australian society. You do not underlive stand that Asia is the future. You are still your time warp. Until you understand that, will never have the opportunity or the capacity to be elected as a government of this give credit country. (Time expired)",100
232,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I can understand members opposite crowing over the trip of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) because this is the first time the Prime Minister has managed an overseas trip without its becoming a major international embarrassment. During his trip to Seattle last year to attend the APEC conference, he had a huge international row with Dr Mahathir credit which went on for months and seriously a damaged Australia's trade prospects. During his trip to France not so long ago, he was Octosuddenly overcome with emotion in Napoleon's bedroom and started attacking of Australia's constitution. During his trip to Indonesia in 1992, he started saying that that, Australia was some kind of last outpost of in the British Empire. Then in PNG a few days trade later he said to a local child waving an a Australian flag in tribute to Australia, 'Mate, as a I'll give you a new one soon.' This is the first trip on which the Prime Minister has managed not to be an absolute to himself and to our country. You power can dress the Prime Minister up, but you cannot clean up his act. In question time the today the Prime Minister-he cannot help himself-was blackguarding Portugal as some kind of despicable, hopeless colonial power. The embassies of some of our APEC friends are going to be delighted, having listened to the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) say that their leaders were just puppets dancing to the no vision Prime Minister's tune. Not so long ago, in various remote parts of Papua New Guinea, the locals used to gather for a miraculous event: a machine would emerge from the heavens and disgorge an by abundance of economic consumer goods, and the people would live happily ever after. The cargo mentality has not died; it is only that this time its devotees went to Bogor dressed in batik shirts rather than grass skirts. The Prime Minister went to Bogor, made his mark on a bit of paper and, behold, Australia would happily ever after. We even had the in member for Lilley saying a few moments ago that this agreement secures Australia's economic future. No-one will do us any favours but ourselves; and the only way we can be helped is if we help ourselves. It was interesting that the member for Lilley mentioned the 1942 declaration of John Curtin'; in which he said that Australia looks to America free of any inhibitions because of our traditional kinship with the United Kingdom. Ever since that day honourable people on both sides of this House have thought that, regardless of our great and powerful friends, we should be looking to ourselves. It is almost as if Paul Keating went to Bogor and said, 'Australia looks to Asia, free of any inhibitions because of our traditional links with Europe and America.'The difference is that what John Curtin said was said at the height of a great crisis, at a moment when our very survival was at stake; Paul Keating",102
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Rocher)Order!,103
234,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Prime Minister abased himself to Asia at a time of peace, at a time when we are not in a great national crisis, and surely all of us-the Prime Minister included-should be looking to no country for help other than ours. The coalition supports the principles of trade-we are a little bit worried that APEC could develop into a discriminatory trading zone along the lines of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but we applaud this move towards closer ties with Asia. It was great to see at APEC the leaders of many countries that are divided by distance, religion, culture, language and ideology but united by trade. It was excellent. What we do not need in this country is to replace the old cringe to America and to Britain, to the extent that it existed, with a new cringe. What we need to do is put Australia first, and that is what the coalition will do. Australia's interests exist wherever there is a dollar to be made by an Australian, wherever there is an Australian value to be upheld, and wherever there is an Australian citizen to be protected. The coalition has a proud record in its relations with Asia. It was Bob Menzies who first called Asia 'our near north' and who shunned the terminology 'the far east'. j Mr Bilney-He flew over it on his way to the cricket.",103
235,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will tell you who flew over Asia-the Prime Minister on his way to the antique fairs and the economic conferences of London and Paris. It was John MCEwen who signed the Australia-Japan trade treaty back in 1957; it was Harold Holt who ended the White Australia policy at a time, when Labor was led by Arthur Calwell, the man who said two Wongs do not make a white; and it was Malcolm Fraser who began large scale Asian immigration at a time when Labor was led by Gough Whitlam, who had described the boat people as 'effing yellow baits'. The Prime Minister thinks that no-one in Australia had ever heard of Asia before December 1991-the time when he became Prime Minister. The truth is that he had not heard of Asia until he became Prime Minister. Even Darwin, Australia's gateway to Asia, was notoriously said by the Prime Minister to be best viewed from 40,000 feet up in the air on your way to London and Paris. Not only does the coalition have a proud record in terms of our relations with Asiaour relations with Asia have been flourishing free for years-but it is important to remember that, as early as 1968, at the close of the Menzies period, no less than 65 per cent of Australia's total trade was with countries of the Asia-Pacific basin. If you look at the current situation, even though the volume of our trade with Asia has increased, our market share of trade with many Asian countries has dropped. In many ways, Australia counts for less in Asia today than it did 25 years ago. In many instances, our defence links are weaker. Our trade position is diminished and, in many instances- our diplomatic status is reduced. It was inteH::sting to hear members opposite-the Bib and Bub of the Labor backbench-crawling in a sycophantic and servile way to the Prime Minister, forgetting that the person who was really responsible for getting APEC off the ground was actually Bob Hawke. Their hypocrisy is matched by that of their leader. It is interesting that the day the Prime Minister left to go to Bogor he said that he was not going to raise the subject of human rights in Indonesia but that he was going to raise the subject of an Australian republic. In other words, the purpose of his trip to Indonesia was not to criticise other countries for their real failings; it was to criticise Australia for our real strengths. He was prepared to talk about free trade, but he was not prepared to talk about a free East Timor. Quite frankly, our Prime Minister owed it to the memories of not only the hundreds of people who have been killed in Dili but also the five Australian journalists massacred in that city some years ago to have at least raised that subject on the most recent trip. This idea that, thanks to the Bogor declaramending tion, we should have free trade by the year 2010 is entirely welcome. But the interesting thing is that, when the Labor Party says it, it is entirely right; and, when the Liberal Party says it, at least according to the Prime Minister, it is entirely wrong. When we talked about reducing trade barriers just a year back, what happened to our leader? The member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) was denounced as Captain Zero. Now we know that the real Captain Zero is none other than the Prime Minister himself. It is entirely appropriate that the Prime Minister should go to the workers in the car industry, the textile industry, the sugar industry-all the industries that he said he would protect-and say, 'I am sorry, I lied.' If I am not allowed to say that Mr SPEAKER...,...No, you are not.",103
236,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,At least the Prime Minister should admit that he told a Richardson.,104
237,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, you are not supposed to say that, either.",104
238,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. We need to put ourselves in a position where we can take advantage of the agreement in the Bogor declaration. We need to learn how we can take advantage of free trade so that we can benefit from it rather than be crushed by it. What the Prime Minister and the government ought to be doing is putting in place the modernisations that our country needs so that we will indeed reap the benefits of free trade and not be crushed by it. We need to take a long, hard look at some of our industries-industries where the friends of members opposite are ruling-and sort those industries out. Take, for instance, the coal industry. It is only a few years ago that pit ponies had to be kept in that industry because members opposite said that they were members of the union. It is high time that the Prime Minister stopped roaming around pretending he is Napoleon IV and did something to modernise our country.

239,Mr LINDSAY,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science or so and Technology) (5.24 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.6 (1994) The tariff proposal which I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The changes will operate on and from 18 November 1994. In February of this year, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal determined that blankets containing viscose rayon in quantities varying from 81 per cent to 91 per cent were wholly of viscose. This decision reduced the government's intended industry assistance rate from 27 per cent to free. The alterations contained in this proposal redefine the description of goods for the subject tariff items by replacing the word 'wholly' with the phrase 'of 100%'. This action will reinstate the level of assistance for goods of mixed fibre content by excluding them from tariff items which require 100 per cent content. A summary of alterations contained in this proposal has been prepared and is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposal to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Kemp) adjourned. NA BILL (No.3) 1994 Consideration of Senate Message",104
240,Mr SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that the Senate does not insist upon its amendments Nos 4, 31, 32 and 33 disagreed to by the House of Representatives and has agreed to the amendment made by the House in place of Senate amendment No.4 with a further amendment and has made further amendments to the bill as indicated by the annexed schedule. The Senate desires the concurrence of the House in the amendment made by the Senate to the amendment made by the House in place of Senate amendment No.4 and in the further amendments made by the Senate. It is again my duty to make a short statement to the House concerning proposals of the Senate in respect of a bill. The Senate's additional amendment No. 2 deals with the definition of qualifying reductions in the Income Tax Assessment Act, and additional amendment No; 3 is concerned with provisional tax onÂ·estimated income. I understand that there is doubt as to whether it isÂ· open to the Senate to propose such alterations as amendments. This is because of the provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution, which provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed to law so as increase any proposed charge or bl:""'den on the people. I am informed that additional amendment No. 2 will increase the burden on some taxpayers and that additional amendment No. 3 will have such an effect in respect of a greater number of taxpayers. I also understand that each of these proposals was originally drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in consultation with an officer of the Attorney-General's Department as a request. Additional amendment No.7 would have the effect of amending .the income tax regulations in respect of PAYE arrangements. I am informed that this amendment may also be considered to increase a charge or burden on the people. I acknowledge that in the circumstances it will be difficult for the House to reach a conclusive understanding as to the effect of the proposals in question. It will also be difficult for any satisfactory dialogue to take place between the houses on this matter. I nevertheless felt it my duty to draw these matters to the attention of members before any further consideration is given to the Senate's proposals. Motion (by Mr Gear) agreed to: That: (1) the House endorses the statement of the Speaker in relation to the constitutional questions raised by message No. 355 transmitted by the Senate in relation to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994; (2) the House, having regard to the fact that the public interest demands the early enactment of the legislation, refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights in respect of Senate message No. 355; (3) should the House concur in the amendments transmitted in Senate message No. 355, the Speaker's statement and parts (1) and (2) of this resolution be incorporated in the message returning the Bill to the Senate; and (4) the amendments be considered forthwith.

241,Mr RUDDOCK,INCOME TAX REGULATIONS,"Berowra) (5.30 p.m.)First, I thank the government for accepting the Senate's amendments in relation to this matter. It involves an element of compromise and that, iri the circumstances, is a good outcome. But the most important aspect is that the amendments in the main relate to the eligibility for the with-child dependent spouse rebate and its maintenanceDebate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",107
242,Mr RUDDOCK,INCOME TAX REGULATIONS,"The amendment ensures that the dependent spouse rebate on the withchild basis is maintained for those people who would have been ineligible for the government's new home child-care allowance. We identified a number of groups in this situation: families in which the child or the parent is overseas for longer than 13 weeks, families with dependent full-time students aged -8 to 25 when the child's income is under $1,785 a year, families disqualified from the home, child-care allowance as a result of more onerous social security definitions and families with children who are receiving prescribed student payments. The import of the amendments, which the government said would not be possible, is that the government will continue the dependent spouse rebate on a with-child basis for those families who would have been excluded from eligibility for the home child-care allowance and who previously had been eligible for the full rebate. It will also ensure that those who, because of Social Security's requirements, do not receive the full benefit that they were entitled to, will be able to obtain the dependent spouse rebate. I understand that, under the compromise, they will not be able to get the rebate until the end of the financial year so that the full eligibility against the home child-care allowance can be assessed. This seems to be a reasonable outcome. As part of the compromise in relation to this matter, the amount of the with-child dependent spouse rebate will no longer be indexed. I think it is a good outcome, an appropriate outcome. It demonstrates that what the government said could not be achieved was achievable. I conclude by saying that we are still in a situation where the government is telling us that it is through social security transfer payments that it is addressing the, very signifiHMAS cant problem of the poorest in the Australian community getting poorer and the rich getting richer. I do not think the unemployed, particularly unemployed couples, will be offering any thanks to the government that the rules in relation to the home child-care allowance were specifically developed 't6 ensure that those families where both partners were unemployed and they had children 'would not be eligible for-the home child-care aUowance. Considering that they are the most needy and that the government maintains a regime from which they are excluded, I do not think there is any clearer indication that this government is not serious about addressing the problem of this tremendous difference between the poorest and the wealthiest in Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Works Committee Report",107
243,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"'-On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 13th report of the committee for 1994 relating to the upgrading of accommodation at HMAS Wiltson, New South Wales. Ordered that the report be printed.",108
244,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's 13th report of 1994 deals with the proposed upgrading of accommodation at HMAS Watson, New South Wales. HMAS Watson, located on Sydney Harbour, is a major naval training establishment which carries out specialist warfare and navigation training for naval personnel. Most of the buildings were built in the 1950s. The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of new or upgraded living-in accommodation for 346 service personnel, additional office space and classrooms, improved recreation facilities and additional parking space. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed at an estimated out-turn cost of $18.81 million. After having inspected existing facilities at the base the committee was convinced that, if Watson is to remain as a major training establishment for the Navy, the standard of accommodation available for personnel must be improved, and shortfalls in the amount of accommodation available must be rectified. This applies to recreation and dining facilities as well, especially for junior and senior sailors. The committee noted that some investment in training facilities has' been made at HMAS Watson in recent years and saw two excellent new training facilities during the inspection of I, the base. Nevertheless, a number of other essential training facilities are spread out, lack adequate space and should be upgraded or replaced to enable HMAS Watson to continue its role as a major naval training establishment. During the inspection of the base the committee saw that the boundary of the Sydney Harbour National Park, which surrounds the base on three sides, has considerable exotic vegetation which Defence has offered to restore to more natural bushland. The committee has recommended that Defence should press the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service to accept the Defence offer to assist with the restoration of bushland in areas near the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary, which is currently in a poor state, adjacent to HMAS Watson. At the public hearing a number of community groups expressed concern about the master planning of the base and the apparent visual intrusiveness of a number of new buildings which will be constructed. The committee has taken these concerns on board and has recommended that: first, a consultative committee should be established to provide a forum for the exchange of views on planning and management matters affecting HMAS Watson and the local community; and, secondly, a number adjustments to various layouts and designs should be made, including the distance of the proposed junior officers' accommodation from the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary. Thirdly, the committee has suggested that, for future projects, baseline planning documents such as master plans should be prepared well in advance of proposals being referred to the committee-this will enable local planning authorities and community groups to provide comment and to be advised of general planning objectives well before specific work takes place. In conclusion, the overall scope of the upgrading of HMAS Watson will be adequate to cater for known future requirements as Defence does not believe it will be necessary to undertake further development work at HMAS Watson for some time. I commend the report to the House. I Public Accounts Committee Report",108
245,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,I present a report by the former Comptroller-General of Customs in relation to recommendation 91 of report No. 325 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts-the Midford Paramount case and related matters-and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,109
246,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"This report was prepared for the committee by the former Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Frank Kelly. In tabling Mr Kelly's report I should make it clear that the committee stands by the principal finding in report 325 that there were serious deficiencies in the management and operation of the Australian Customs Service at the time of the Midford Paramount case. These deficiencies were also noted in the report of the Conroy review of the Customs Service. Mr Kelly's report has been prepared in response to recommendation 91 in the committee's report No. 325, which was entitled The Midford Paramount case and related matters. This recommendation called on the Comptroller-General to review the levels, functions and suitability of the Australian Customs Service officers involved in the Midford case, together with the lines of responsibility and supervision, that were clearly inadequate according to the evidence before the committee. Mr Kelly's report was provided to the committee on 14 June 1994, under the cover of a letter from Mr Kelly's successor as Comptroller-General, Mr Lionel Woodward. The overall finding in Mr Kelly's report is that although the performance of a number of customs officers involved in the Midford case was flawed, 'there is no evidence to support a case of fraud, dishonesty or illegal behaviour by any officer, and no basis has been found for the laying of any criminal charges'. I refer here to paragraph 153 of Mr Kelly's report. Furthermore, Mr Kelly concludes that 'in no case have I considered it to be appropriate that disciplinary action should be taken against any officer still in the service'. I refer here to paragraph 155 of Mr Kelly's report. The committee has thought long and hard abOut whether or not to table Mr Kelly's report. In considering the matter we have met with Mr Woodward and sought and considered the views of all of the 15 people named in Mr Kelly's report. Although there are arguments to the contrary, the committee has decided to table the report in its entirety. The committee has come to this decision for two reasons: first, because the inquiry which began this matter, the committee's inquiry into the Midford Paramount case, was a public inquiry; secondly, because of the strong representations made to us by most of the individuals named in the report, who believe that the tabling of the report provides them with an opportunity to clear their names. Another relevant consideration was advice the committee received from Mr Woodward that, on the basis of the information he has considered about the Midford case and the roles of the respective officers, he will not be taking any prosecution or disciplinary action against any officer named in Mr Kelly's report. I know that the Midford case and the subsequent reviews have been a difficult and unpleasant experience for some staff within the Customs Service. To these people I say, on behalf of the committee, that I note both Mr Kelly's conclusions and Mr Woodward's advice. I have been pleased to see that since the tabling of the committee's report and the release of the Conroy review, significant steps have been taken to improve management, accountability and reporting systems within Customs. There are clear signs that lessons are being learned from the mistakes of the past. It is the committee's hope that the tabling of Mr Kelly's report will represent the final chapter in the Midford saga. NA Motion (by Mr Walker) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Billboards",109
247,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT,":Last night in the Senate there was a persona1 attack on me by Senator Murphy, who called into question my integrity in this House in relation to a matter of billboardS at O'Halloran Hill in the electorate of Kingston. It was suggested that I had interfered with the construction of those billboards, which I happily admit I tried to. But he imputed motives to me which I certainly deny. I was approached about these billboards because of my well-known connection with the environment. I was asked whether I thought it was appropriate that billboards be erected on two miles of green space at O'Halloran Hill and whether I could do something to prevent that sort of thing happening and prevent the further despoliation of our environment. I contacted the staff at the local council who informed me that they did not want any billboards. They had not been approached and were they to be approached the billboards would not be allowed to be put up. I then contacted the CSIRO, which owned the land. It said that it had been approached by an individual who wished to put up billboards and it had agreed to a lease of those billboards. CSIRO informed me that it was allowed to do this and did not have to seek council approval because this was on Commonwealth land. I said to the CSIRO that I did not think it was appropriate that Commonwealth regulation should allow the CSIRO to put up billboards in what is a green space and that these were environmentally polluting. When the CSIRO said that it had not talked to any other company about it, but with an individual, I suggested that in these sorts of cases it should be made public and should go to tender. In his attack on me, Senator Murphy said: Mr Battersby rang Chris Gallusto ask her what the problem was. By all accounts, Chris Gallus said to Mr Battersby that the project was dead; that he should get a good lawyer; and that, whilst she did not like to see anyone go bankrupt, from where she sat, he was going to go under, and he was playing in the big league now. I reject that. When Mr Battersby rang and told me that he had small children and that he would lose money on the deal, I said to him that I felt greatÂ· sympathy for him but that under no conditions did I support putting up billboards on open green space and that I would always be opposed to that. He said that he would be losing money and that he would be sued by those people he agreed to advertise for. At that stage I suggested that I could do nothing for him and that he should see a lawyer. I totally reject the imputation that I have some power over the CSIRO to change its commercial decisions. I totally reject any suggestions that I have acted improperly or otherwise than inÂ·the best interests of the environment in this matter. Water Usage: Canberra",110
248,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise having had a delegation of students from Shoalhaven High School come to me after a school visit today. They were visiting Parliament House for legal studies and law in society. The Shoalhaven area, which is in my seat of Gilmore, is supplied with water from the Shoalhaven River. The Shoalhaven River has been used to augment Sydney water supplies of recent times. Large quantities of water have been sent to Sydney from our catchment area. The lower levels of water supplies available to the river and the industries along the river are causing some problems. My students were somewhat concerned when they drove around Canberra during their visit and found that water sprinklers were on all day. They were concerned that not only were the sprinklers on all day but also many sprinklers were in fact watering roadways and pathways, et cetera. We hear a lot of things in this House about the drought and about the need to conserve water. These students have been absolutely upset by what they believed to be a flagrant disregard for the conservation of water in this city. In line with what is happening in my electorate, water authorities have requested ordinary folk to be conservation minded in their use of water and for these students to come to the national capital and see a flagrant misuse of water was someI what disturbing. I promised them that I would bring this to the attention of the House. It has been suggested that vast sums of money be spent in the Shoalhaven area on a dam called the Welcome Reef Dam, locally known as the unwelcome reef dam, which will significantly effect the supplies of water to the Shoalhaven catchment area and which will significantly affect the ability of the river to function in an ecological fashion to sustain the biodiversity which it currently sustains. I have two major industries in my electorate that take large quantities of water from that river: Australian Paper Mills, now known as Australia Paper, and Manildra Starches. The students who visited Canberra are concerned that if there is no concern about water conservation amongst the people in Canberra, the centre of where so much is said about the drought, then what example is this place setting for the rest of Australia? In my electorate the people, and particularly the school children, have rallied around to support all forms of assistance to the drought affected farmers. They find it somewhat disturbing that similar sorts of actions cannot take place here. Just recently there was talk in the ACT Legislative Assembly of culling kangaroos because a lack of water was driving them towards the roadsides. The ACT community should get its act together when other people throughout this country are in the grips of a drought and asking for people to be conservation minded. But it should not happen just because we are in a drought. Conserving water is ecologically sustainable. If people do the right thing and c.onserve water they will ensure that we do not have to expend large amounts of infrastructure money on dams that we do not need. I ask the people of Canberra to take note of what is happening in the rest of the country and set a good example. My students should not have to come up here and see such flagrant waste. Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories",111
249,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk about the disgraceful and cynical misuse of taxpayers' funds on the part of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. In order to enhance his own credibility, he has funded a number of highly questionable green organisations to produce unobjective and biased reports to back up his point of view in the cabinet room. With several woodchip licences up for renewal, Senator Faulkner is keen to make his presence felt and have his way in the cabinet room brawls with the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). So the minister provided $100,000 to' conservationists to produce a report on forest areas of high conservation value. These groups came back with a wish list of virtually every forest currently used logging purposes to be closed down. The peak industry body, NAFI, was given three days to respond, but Senator Faulkner and others are now using the predictable and unscientific findings of the report to support an end to the logging in these areas and cabinet intervention in the woodchip licence approval process. Taxpayers' money went to the environment minister to enable him to commission oneeyed reports that would provide him with greater credibility. An amount of $166,000 was paid to Environment Victoria to report on timber plantations in Australia. This duplicates the work already done by the National Plantations Advisory Committee, the Resource Assessment Commission and the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group on Forest Use. All reports have concluded that an end of logging operations in native forests is neither possible nor even desirable. These inquiries have been very broad and received input from unions, industry and conservation groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation. But Minister Faulkner did not like the results, so he commissioned his own report. Instead of calling for submissions or tendering out the job so that all consultants might apply, he hand-picked a group called Environment Victoria to do the job. But this time he knows that Environment Victoria will reach his conclusions because it is already on the record as saying, 'We can get all the wood we need from plantations. There is more than enough timber in Australia's plantations'. It is pretty clear that this group will produce a report which overestimates the size of plantations and recommends an overnight cessation of logging in native forests. The unions were less than impressed with the latest grant. Bob Richardson, of the ACTU, said: Senator Faulkner is wasting public money in a shameless exercise to capture the green vote. Chris Northover, of the CFMEU, had this to add: The Federal Government must cease this nonsensical waste of public funds and face up to its commitment to address forestry issues. The member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) and the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland)for ALP members from Victoria-have expressed similar sentiments. Robert Bain, the executive director of the National Association of Forest Industries, wrote to the minister expressing concern and inviting a reply. That was six weeks ago, and no reply has arrived. So what is Environment Victoria? Officially, it does not exist. It is not a company that reports to the ASC or an incorporated association in the state of Victoria. It is not even a registered business name. So Senator Faulkner has given $200,000 to a phantom organisation. There is no official record of its existence. A close - look at its propaganda leaflets reveals that it shares the same address as the Conservation Council of Victoria. The CCV has received around $900,000 in federal government funding in the last six years. But, as at August this year, it had not submitted an annual return for three years. It used to be a company reporting to - the ASC, but it then decided to wind up as a company and become an association. Reporting requirements for associations are not quite so strict. But it could not even comply with them. It has received $900,000 worth of funding over six years, but it could not complete any annual returns for a three year period. These are the standards of accountability for which the environment portfolio is becoming famous. What hope do taxpayers have of monitoring governm:ent expenditure when the government gives grants to bodies that go under assumed and unregistered names and refuse to submit their annual returns? What do they spend their government grants on? Earlier this year, Environment Victoria spent a $33,000 federal grant on producing and distributing a leaflet which made out the timber industry to be nothing short of an environmental rapist. Some incredible propaganda is contained within it. Some pictures of cuddly animals are accompanied by text which says: When the woodchippers come, the animals ... haven't got a chance. When the trees are c1earfelled, many of them are crushed . . . The leaflet was placed in letterboxes around marginal electorates in Melbourne. It was paid for by the taxpayer. It is a complete sham and a clear abuse and misuse of taxpayers' funds to provide money to a group that is going by an assumed name, thumbing its nose at accountability requirements and spending taxpayers' dollars for blatant political propaganda. This is really a sports rorts type of business. The minister is funding shady interest groups for blatant political purposes to produce predictable and biased reports that back up his own point of view. Moratorium of Coastland: Merewether to Munmorah  p.m.)-I draw the House's attention to the need for a stop to be put on the piecemeal development of the coastal zone from Merewether to the Munmorah state recreation reserve in my electorate. I believe that a moratorium should be introduced. I support the move by our colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) that a moratorium be placed on coastal zone development until a comprehensive national policy is determined. I am talking about the fragile and beautiful area between Lake Macquarie and the sea that must be protected and improved for future young Australians. I would like to see it made a conservation area. I suggest that it could be called Macquarie Wetlands, part of which would be dual wetlands that cover the natural watercourses which flow down into that area, into the sandhills and out to the sea. I For the last 60 years, the area has been ravaged and raped by miners below ground. It was acquired for underground mining, not surface land development. The mines have been closed down, and BHP owns most of the land. In latter years, it has been beach mined on top, so dunes as high as 200,000 feet that abut the back of the beach have gone. Some of that sand is over in Hawaii. If you go to Waikiki, you will lay on sand from my electorate. The sand has gone. The area is debauched. Car bodies have been dumped there. The only way to improve this area is to let BHP develop it under a Belmont Sands project to provide 1,200 homes, tourism and shopping facilities on the land, much of which is almost below sea level. It is very low and delicate, with a few dunes and hillocks. If that land were in its natural state, no-one would dare ever suggest that a house or commercial enterprise be placed upon it. It is a vital and delicate area between Lake Macquarie and the sea. We as a community have enjoyed this area for the last 60 years. In hundreds of years, Australia's future generations should have the chance to enjoy it. Further to the south there is another big strip of land. Similarly, the land from Catherine Hill Bay north to Wallarah Peninsula has been acquired by CRA for underground mining of the glorious headlands. It is part of the natural features of the coast. Obviously, CRA is lining up to try to develop that land. Adjacent to that to the north is a development called the Pinny Beach Resort. It started off in 1988 and ran through an independently controlled council. There was a proposal for 1,200 homes-which has now become 4,000 homes-golf courses and hotels. It was a massive residential project by a developer from Surfers Paradise that masqueraded as a tourist project. It was going to bring thousands of jobs. It has done none of those things, and now it is simply being converted into a residential development on headlands and rainforests that should never have been touched. That whole coastal strip-I am sure it is a similar situation in your electorate, Mr Speaker-all the way north, right through to Merewether is being debauched or gnawed away at by development projects. Much of it is now being attacked on the basis of, 'It's only this little bit. It's only 60 homes. It very much. It doesn't really affect it.' It does, but there is no proper control and the council does not really have the power to protect the greater entity of that coastal 7;one. Like the member for Paterson, I want to see a moratorium on all of that land-right down the coast, right down to your area, Mr Speaker-until some comprehensive policy is set down that is not dollar driven. All that is happening at the moment is that, if you are lucky enough to find somebody who has some land, whatever its existing use, and you get hold of that land and then put up little projects-60 homes, not too many-you will get away with it. That has to stop. I believe that young Australians of the future have to have the same opportunity as previous generations have had to enjoy the beauty, the quality :nd the surf that is Australia. In conclusion, several miles of the beach are owned by BHP. Some people are saying, 'Don't make too many waves about this because BHP mightn't give us the beach back.' I cannot see a situation where major corporations like CRA or BHP would be putting a barbed wire fence, up and saying, 'You can't go on the beach because we own it.' I would like to see BHP leave, hand the whole area back and have it restored. There is range of programs such as the one billion trees program, the proposed coast care program, the land environmen- action program and employment programs. All those would help to provide the funds to do for some restoration. I commend it to the House.",111
250,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Wannon) (5.58 p.m.)Last week I raised concerns about inordinate delays in commercialising some excellent research that was done by the CSIRO to modify wool into a finer fibre, a process known as ultrafine. I pointed out these delays that cost wool growers hundreds of millions of dollars, a figure that has since been confirmed by others. With lightning speed, the International Wool Secretariat put out a statement to say I was incorrect. Actually it said that in the first isn't paragraph and then it spent the next seven paragraphs confirming virtually everything I have said. As well, on Country Hour last week, the International Wool Secretariat tried to defend delays with the usual lines of, 'We can't tell you because it's all too secret.' I do not think it is too secret. In fact, I fear that the secrecy is just an excuse for these inexcusable delays. What I do know is that, yet again, wool growers have missed out, maybe much more than they realise. From the words of the International Wool Secretariat, the new process is now going to Northern Hemisphere partners. But there was an Australian interest, which got knocked back about two years ago. The IWS has admitted as much and has now said that it is dealing with overseas companies. This is for a process for which a prototype was built before 1990. But the story gets worse. The IWS admits that not all patents are finalised yet. If the process was worked out so long ago the alarm bells go off! It raises very serious concerns. There are three points: the delays have cost wool growers a small fortune; there are serious concerns as to what really is going on, particularly as to why the delays; and it seems that the patents are still to be finalised. Does this explain why the product development is occurring in the Northern Hemisphere? This is a very serious matter, not only on the specific issue but also because it highlights the wider problem of excellent research that is done in Australia which is not being converted and is all too often lost overseas.",114

It is also very important to too heavily against the police, we will find and, if we do not have adequate procedures investigated, the public will lose confidence, services, but in the administration of justice In Queensland there is a problem. We complaints, in many cases they are frightened a person who is suspected of being an offender, with the Criminal Justice Commission. We have simply trying to do their job, trying to protect criminals. They have been dragged down before shoved in front of a video camera. Quite often, a very serious complaint, it is simply not worth main streets of some towns or cities, if there too much noise is being made, it is now very to go out and investigate those complaints, their reputations and careers destroyed, or placed to the CJC. That is one matter that the Queensland government legislation we are trying to bring forward a sure that, on the one hand, complaints against but, on the other hand, police are still able for the people of Australia. i 3775 member is not suggesting that I have verballed the bill before the Committee at the moment, as is usual.

Under this fair, reasonable and balanced procedure to make the federal police are investigated appropriately, to carry out the very important duty that they do NA 3776 The amendments arise out of the report established in mid-1991. This group was General's Department, the Department of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Australian Federal Police Association, the working parties, as well as the report of the Royal the review of the ombudsman's office by Public Administration.

The other point of view would be very balanced approach, who are able to make when sentencing are able to take into account offence. I suppose the other way to approach courts are required to consider and leave it common sense, as the case may be. . The parliament has chosen to go the other into account when sentencing offenders.

The title of 'law attached to these sorts of omnibus bills. This consequential ways. The points that were raised dilemmas facing us in this modem era of legislation is that there are often technical or drafting to be tidied up; otherwise the legislation is makes it very difficult for an interpretation who is interpreting it for the benefit of a court. In debates in the chamber yesterday in relation very important comments from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in relation particular, that there is an over-reliance by it off the hook in relation to badly drafted legislation. I referred yesterday to a particular instance of the training guarantee levy, the enabling wages and costs, holiday and long service calculation, but the explanatory memoranda included used or was governed by that legislation, it was answer when there were two conflicting points memoranda. Clearly, the explanatory memorandum has trying to interpret the legislation using the extraordinarily difficult, particularly if it first place. That has occurred on a number here today debating what is basically an omnibus introduce reforms in other legislation. The shadow Attorney-General in the Senate use some sort of technological advance which put in electronic form and to be distributed fashioned paper with 17 amendments and 17 will be.

One of the great on just about every activity under the sun errors or unclear elements in legislation that have unworkable or its intention is so unclear that it to be made, particularly in the case of someone to the Racial Hatred Bill, we heard some member for Tangney and the honourable to the question of explanatory memoranda, in the government on explanatory memoranda to get and I will mention it again today. In the case legislation provided that, in the calculation of leave was not included as part of the overall it. The difficulty was that, when anyone extraordinarily difficult to arrive at the right of view in the legislation and the explanatory no authority in that case but, if someone were explanatory memorandum as a basis, it would be was legislation which was not terribly clear in the of occasions and it is one of the reasons we are bill to clear up some legislation and to talked about being bright enough one day to will allow amendments to separate bills to be easily so people do not have to buy the old bills. The sooner that day comes, the happier I I used to spend the best part of my waking hours, the amendments and pasting them in the acts. In NA Thursday, 17 November 1994 those days, some of my colleagues were a bit sergeant. I can well understand the shadow complexity of modern day legislation. As a an amendment allows the Director-General standing authorisation to issue warrants The shadow Attorney-General pointed out General. In the end, it was quite a sensible acknowledged that there would be occasions to approve persons who are to exercise authority difficulty, and there is obviously no valid reason to grind to a halt, purely and simply because unable to be present to exercise that authority. But the difficulty was that, all of sudden, be given to any ASIO officer. For years, there exercised only by the Director-General and the at a level. But, as a result of a drafting oversight have been given to any officer of ASIO. I conclusion that the government did not intend spotting of that particular problem by the Standing the matter was addressed and tidied up. It reinforces the importance of that scrutiny and reinforces the very important role that of representative government. Often, in the as we like to refer to it, there are occasions an extraordinary rush that technical problems poor unfortunate citizen is hit by some consequence is doing a great service for the rest of the occasions, the government is quite unable sufficiently targeted in the first instance, which people try to interpret the debates explanatory memorandum.

Mt Mack asked whether or not a $300,000 of Mr Verducci. The House, by way of questions for Justice (Mt Kerr) was unable to answer that is not here at the moment, but I would like that is the case. It is my understanding MAIN COMMITTEE 3795 slack at this; it was inspected and signed by the Attorney-General's worry about the increasing consequence of the scrutinyÂ· of bills committee, of Security to give approved officers of ASIO a on behalf of the Attorney-General. that they had consultations with the Directoramendment to the bill, as it would clearly be when the Director-General would not be available of warrants. If he is not available, it causes not to fix that. We would not want the thing the one delegated officer with the authority was we had the situation where the authority could had been the view that the authority could be intention was that he would give it to a person in the initial legislation, that authority could agree with the shadow Attorney-General in her this consequence.

(2) What are the (a) brand names and (b) ages of the cash registers. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) What is the total number of cash registers held by the Minister's Department: Department of Industry, Science and Technology-O Australian Industrial Property arganisation-8 Australian Manufacturing Council Secretariat-O Total-8 (2) What are the (a) brand names and (b) ages of the cash registers: Brand Name-ECR 107 Computer Cash Drawer Age of Cash Register-6.5 years old Number of Cash Registers-8 Overseas Development Research (Question No. 1248) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1994: (1) What is the proportion of overseas development assistance to GDP for each country in the aECD. (2) What is the unweighted average of the aid contributions referred to in part (1). (3) How does Australia's contribution compare with the unweighted average. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In 1993, the last year for which comparative data are available, aDA/GNP ratios for members NA of the aECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) were as set out below. (Greece, Iceland, Turkey and Mexico, while members of the aECD, are not members of the DAC and do not provide significant development assistance.) DAC Member Countries: Net aDA as a Percentage of GNP, 1993 Denmark-1.04 Norway-1.01 Sweden-0.98 Netherlands-0.82 France-0.63 Finland-0.46 Canada-0.45 Belgium-0.39 Germany-0.37 Australia-0.35 Switzerland-0.33 Luxembourg-0.32 Italy-0.31 United Kingdom-0.31 Austria-0.30 Portugal-0.29 Japan-0.26 New Zealand-0.25 Spain-0.25 Ireland-0.20 United States-0.15 (2) The unweighted average DDA/GNP ratio (i.e. the average of donors' individual ratios) was 0.45 per cent in 1993. The weighted average (i.e. the ratio of total DAC aDA to total DAC GNP) was 0.30 per cent. (3) As the answer provided to Question (1) indicates, Australia's aDA/GNP ratio, at 0.35 per cent in 1993, is below the unweighted average, but above the weighted average. The latter figure is the accepted international benchmark for performance on aid volume.

' (2) Will the Government ensure full, adequate and continuous funding of the centre if the CSIRO reduces, withdraws or fails to renew funding when existing arrangements cease; if so, through what arrangements. Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) CSIRO has exceeded its external earnings funding target of 30 per cent in 1992-93 and 199394 (reaching 33 per cent in 1993-94). There is no connection between external funds received by CSIRO and funds made available annually to the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre. These are made availabl- through the CSIRO Division of Water Resources and the amount provided each year was originally allocated on the basis of the costs of five staff seconded to the Centre. Since aggregation of the Centre within the Cooperative Research Centre for Freshwater Ecology, CSIRO's contribution has continued at the same level but with less specificity in application. As indicated in my response to Question No. 1293 earlier this year, CSIRO intends to maintain its current level of funding ($326,000 in 1993-94) throughout the current triennium.

(Question No. 1541) Mr Gibson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 October 1994: (1) Did the Department of Defence engage companies to construct (a) six buildings at Bandiana Barracks, Vic., and (b) battalion headquarters and senior non-commissioned ranks accommodation wings at Puckapunyal Barracks, Vic.; if so, in each case, (i) what company was engaged, (ii) what were the Department's requirements for sunlight screening and insulation of external windows, (iii) what product was used for sunlight screening and insulation on the windows, skylights, doors and glazed atriums, (iv) which company was responsible for the installation and supply of the insulation materials, (v) what were the exact specifications of (A) Australian Construction Services or (B) the Department for the solar reflective and insulation requirements of the doors, windows and other glass areas and (vi) were the specifications altered (A) before, (B) during or (C) after the tendering and installation process; if so how. (2) Did the Department claim that $100 000 was saved by using a material other than Solar-Mesh for the insulation on the external glass of the buildings; if so, on what basis.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The following companies were engaged to construct buildings at Baridiana and Puckapunyal and were responsible to the Department of Defence for the installation and supply of insulation materials: Bandiana RAEME Training Centre (RTC) Electronics Wing-AB & MA Chick Pty Ltd; RTC Headquarters and Corps Training Wing-JP Cordukes Pty Ltd; Central Instructional Facility-JP Cordukes Pty Ltd; Area Physical Fitness Centre-Colin Joss & Coy Pty Ltd; RAAOC Centre Q Store-Tendered but not proceeded with; Training Warehouse-Zauner Constructions Pty Ltd. Puckapunyal Puckapunyal Logistic Battalion Headquarters-JP Cordukes Pty Ltd; Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Accommodation-JP Cordukes Pty Ltd. The functional design brief for each building stated the general requirement for sunlight screened with. ing , insulation and energy conservation as: 'A cool and comfortable work environment is required throughout. Passive environmental control measures with adequate cross ventilation should be used to achieve these standards wherever feasible. Consideration is to be given to conserving fuel and/or power used for heating, cooling and lighting by: a. siting buildings to make maximum useÂ· of prevailing winds and the sun for temperature control and lighting; b. using insulating materials and weather proof seals; c. using solar energy where considered cost effective; and d. using under the floor heating systems.' Australian Construction Services undertook the design and documentation of the facilities and developed the functional design briefs into design specifications. With the exception of one building, 'Solar Mesh' was specified as either a shading mesh screen or insect screen as a proprietary item to be fitted to each facility. Extracts from the specifications are detailed in the The product was intended for use on north and west facing windows to reduce solar gain. Changes to the specified use of 'Solar Mesh' were as follows: a. RTC Electronics Wing. 'Solar Mesh' installed to windows as specified; however, installation to skylights deleted because of doubts regarding effectiveness in that particular application. b. RTC HQ and Corps Training Wing. An alternative product, 'Kool Shade', was selected and installed post-construction tender award. c. Central Instruction Facility. 'Solar Mesh' installed as specified. d. Area Physical Fitness Centre. Requirement deleted after tender. e. RAAOC Centre Q Store. Contract not proceedf. Training Warehouse. 'Solar-Mesh' installed as specified. g. Puckapunyal Logistic Battalion HQ. 'SolarMesh' was not specified. Sun shades included on construction drawings. h. SNCO Accommodation. 'Solar-Mesh' was specified as an insect screen to openable windows. Sun shades were detailed on drawings. Insect screens were supplied as part of the window set. Requirement for 'Solar-Mesh' was deleted during construction period. Defence purchasing policy is based on open and effective competition and inclusion of 'Solar-Mesh' in the specifications did not constitute an obligation on Defence's part to use the product. (2) No, savings of some $100,000 were achieved due to a reduction in the scope of works for the installation of Solar-Mesh to the RTC Electronics Wing which produced savings of $72,099 and the deletion of the requirement from the Physical Fitness Centre which generated savings of $33,309. An alternative product was used on one building although the cost was essentially the same as the following table. Solar-Mesh product. For Defence facilities projects, tenderers are required to submit conforming bids but can also nominate changes that may achieve better value for money for the Commonwealth. The process of design review and material evaluation continues throughout the contract period.
