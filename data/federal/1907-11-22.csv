Mr KING O'MALLEY - I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether, in view of the supreme importance of the thriving mining town of Linda, on the west coast of Tasmania, and the great inconvenience caused by the want of proper .postal facilities, he will establish, without delay, a post, telegraph, and money-order office instead of the existing telephone service?",14
1,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Without delay the merits of the case will be inquired into. SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE. ORDER OF BUSINESS-TARIFF-NE W PROTECTION.,14
2,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,I ask the Prime Minister to state what are the Government's proposals with reference to the sittings of .the House other than the ordinary sittings?,14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ministers , of course, desire to meet the convenience bf the House subject to the condition being generally recognised that whatever is to be done before the Christmas adjournment must be done within two or three weeks. If the consideration of the Tariff is concluded within-that time, so that it becomes ready for transmission to the Senate, that body has arranged to meet in January and enter upon its consideration at once. If we have so finished, it will not be necessary for this House to meet before the end of February, perhaps on the first day in March or thereabouts.",14
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The 1st April would be a good day.,15
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If , on the other hand, we are not able to complete the consideration of the Tariff before rising for the Christmas holidays, it will be necessary for us to meet early in January in order to complete its consideration in time for a later meeting of the Senate.",15
6,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That is a. lever.  it is finished ?. Do not fool with the thing, but finish it .",15
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Thos e are the two choices which are open to us.,15
8,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Le t us Tariff before we leave.,15
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Minister s trust that the House will not feel any undue strain placed upon its members, having regard to the circumstances, if they are asked to sit On unusual days and for unusual hours in in order that we may finish before Christmas and rise until the end of February.",15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should like the Prime Minister to supplement his statement by informing the House whether the object in taking this unusual course with regard to public business is for the sole purpose of dealing with the Tariff?,15
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"So far as I know, there remains no other new question of importance that we can attempt to deal with before the rising of the House. We shall have to devote our whole time to the consideration of the Tariff - the whole time for which the House at present sit.'*and if that is not sufficient even more time. But I think that, in urging the utmost expedition, we are acting in the public interest, as well as in that of the House.",15
12,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman state on which days he proposes to ask the House to sit?,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That depends upon the progress made.,15
14,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Why not sit every day?,15
15,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,At present we cannot make any arrangements.,15
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is it proposed sit tomorrow?,15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ministers prefer to commence at once - to sit to-night and tomorrow, and to meet again on Monday morning with a view to terminating this part of the session as soon as possible. We shall do'that if a sufficient number of honourable members can remain; but if not, we must begin next week, and then continue to sit until we finish the Tariff..",15
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The Prime Minister has stated that no new business except the Tariff will be brought on.,15
19,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,No new business of importance.,15
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask the honourable gentleman whether it will not be advisable, before the Christmas adjournment, to bring in the measure dealing with the new protection. It is important that that matter should be settled at the earliest possible moment. The manufacturers have been allowed fourteen days in which to send in finish the their claims, and the Government will have ample time in which to make certain recommendations to Parliament, because, in my opinion, the law should be amended at the earliest possible moment.",15
21,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We certainly will be prepared to make a clear statement on the subject before the House rises whether we lay the Bill on the table or not. It cannot settle some of the chief questions at issue. The body of tihe Bill is not the great difficulty, but the schedule, which it is difficult to adjust until the Tariff has been dealt with.",15
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Wit h regard to the sittings of the House, the position is by no means clear even now. I ask the Prime Minister to say whether the Government intend to sit to-night and tomorrow ?",15
23,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I thought that was plain when I said that if a sufficient number of honourable members agreed to enable the business of the House to be carried on, we proposed to sit to-night, tomorrow, and on Monday. If that be impossible, we propose to ask the House to consent to meet on Monday next and then to sit continuously.",15
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But when are we to know ?,15
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is merely with a view to consulting the convenience of honourable members that I am stating this optional course. We desire to sit continutinuously from this moment. to At a later stage,",15
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"At an earlier hour a promise was made that the House would be advised as to what the Goveniment proposed to do in regard to the Saturday and Monday sittings. I desire now to explain that it is our intention that the House shall sit this afternoon and evening, but that it is doubtful whether we shall be able to secure a quorum tomorrow. If we can, we shall certainly go on with business, and the House, on rising, will adjourn until Monday next at 10.30 a.m.",15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Are we here tomorrow on the mere off chance of the House meeting ?,16
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; definite information on the point will be given tonight. We find that some honourable members object to our meeting tomorrow; but we shall certainly do so if we can secure a quorum. NEW HEBRIDES .,16
29,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I desire to know whether the Prime Minister can give the House any idea as to when the differential treatment of the French and the English merchants of New Caledonia can be put an end to? I have alreadypointed out to the honourable gentleman that whilst the French merchants are sending their merchandise by the French steamers to New Caledonia without any restriction, the English merchants are* being required at the Customs House to make declarations and go through other formalities, so as to give the French merchants an important advantage over them. I understand that what I suggest may be done without any contravention of the agreement which exists between the two countries.",16
30,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I am happy to say that since the honourable member first mentioned this question, or, at any rate, since it was last alluded to, I have seen a copy of the despatch forwarded by the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey, to the French Government, and am glad to have the opportunity of expressing publicly our sense of the ability and persistency with which our case has been put before the Ministers of France by him. A manof-war is about to leave for F i j i in order to convey the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific . to the New Hebrides, where, in about a month, the Convention will be proclaimed. It is anticipated that by that time the French authorities will be able to give effect to the recommendation which has been so often pressed upon them to remove the differentiation to which the honourable and learned member has alluded.",16
31,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime. Minister a further question with regard to the serious obstruction which is put in the way of Australian merchants in dealing with New Caledonia as compared with the facilities offered to French merchants. Pending the conclusion of the Anglo-French diplomatic arrangements, will the Prime Minister consult with the Minister of Trade and Customs and reto come move the necessity which is thrown upon the Australian merchants, but not uponi French merchants, of giving assurances as to the ultimate destination of all goods which they send to New Caledonia ? The completion of the diplomatic arrangements may take several months, but in the meantime the Australian merchants are handicapped in every shipment which they make to New 'Caledonia, while the French merchants, simply send their goods by the French mail, their manifests being never looked at.",16
32,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have already admitted the obstruction, and have on at number of occasions protested most strongly against the unfair burdens of the merchants of Sydney. The assurances we have received lead us to expect, not that it will be a matter for three or four months waiting, but that probablv by this time the French authorities are imposing similar restrictions.",16
33,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister in the meantime put the Sydney merchanfs on a level with the French merchants, and allow them to ship goods without these restrictions?",16
34,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That cannot be done, because the lever which we are using in this matter in order to urge the French to expedition is the very fact that we are suffering this injustice. Remove the injustice, and we shall have the old bad state of affairs, in which arms and liquors were landed by both sets of traders without any restriction in the New Hebrides.",16
35,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,And meanwhile the French merchants are getting a mercantile advantage.,16
36,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,At present they are. TARIFF COMMISSION'S REPORTS,16
37,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I desire to direct the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs fo the following recommendationof the Tariff CommissionWe recommend that the Government Printer be authorized to make arrangements for the sale, at reasonable rates, of copies of theMinutes of Evidence throughout the Commonwealth, and to inform him that during my recent visit to Western Australia* I received num. erous inquiries as to where the reports; and minutes of evidence could be obtained1 have received from various parts of Australia, numerous letters asking for copies of reports, and information as to where minutes of evidence could be obtained. I ask the Minister, if he can see his way, to give effect to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission and cause copies of the minutes of evidence and also the reports to be placed in each Customs House, at the same time giving public notice that such documents can be obtained there by any person.",16
38,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I shall a be very glad to comply with the request of the honourable member, and to see that the documents are made available to the public. i understood that they were already available.",17
39,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,They were not even made available to honourable members until I took action.,17
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I might inform the House that anticipating a considerable demand for these documents at the time when they were first ordered to be printed, I gave instructions for the printing of an unusually large number of copies. I believe that a very large supply is in hand. The oflicers of the House have just informed me that no considerable number of applications has, so far, been made by honourable members for the papers, and further that there has been no very considerable number of applications for them from persons outside. If honourable members wish to obtain copies of the papers, I hope they will communicate with the officers of the House. If persons outside desire to tain copies they can follow the usual course, and send in their applications to the Government Printing Office, where a supplv is available.",17
41,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs if , in view of his promise already given to send copies of the Tariff Commission's reports and evidence to the various Customs Houses, he will also send copies to public institutions, such as the mechanics' institutes or post-offices, in various towns which have no Customs House?",17
42,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Any mechanics' institute or post-office, or other public institution that applies for copies, I shall be very glad to supply, but we cannot send the reports broadcast over the country. Copies will not be sent out unless they are asked for.  and Customs allow any rebates on the bundles of Tariff Commission's reports and evidence, or will he have a bargain sale to get rid of the surplus stock of them?",17
43,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I promise to take the matter into consideration.. SITE FOR SMALL-ARMS FACTORY.  Defence is in a bit of a quandary in connection with the selection of a site for a small-arms factory, and cannot discover suitable site either in New South Wales or Victoria, I am in a position to recommend him a site in Queensland.",17
44,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"On the Darling Downs.  Darling Downs, is a centrally situated place, at a distance of 100 miles from the coast, and I have no doubt a very good site for a small-arms factory could be obtained there. In my opinion, however, a better site might be selected in the town and district of Ipswich, nearer Brisbane than is Toowoomba. It is within 20 miles of the coast, and connected with it by rail.",17
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the honourable member asking a question?  ther the Minister will consider the advisability of making inquiries as to the suitableness of Ipswich or Toowoomba as a site for the proposed small-arms factory?,17
46,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable member is not quite correct in crediting me with the statement that a. good site cannot be found in Victoria or in New South Wales. obAny little difficulty that may arise will be due to the fact that there are many very suitable sites and many good advocates of them. It is likely that, in the immediate future a statement will be made with regard to the site selected for the small-arms factory, but the honourable member for Maranoa will understand, as will other honourable members, that, for reasons which business men will fully appreciate, even if I knew exactly where the site of the proposed factory is to be I should not be asked to disclose the information..  Government are doing anything in the matter?",17
47,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I can inform the honourable member' that we shall reach finality in the matter in the immediate future, and I am sure that honourable members will then admit that we have acted wisely in not saying too much on the subject at the present time. I should like to acknowledge my indebtedness in the matter to the honourable member for Maranoa, whose enthusiasm on the subject has been of much help to me - Sir WILLIAM LYNE REVENUEPAYMENTS TO STATES.",17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Treasurer a question without notice. I see by one of the morning newspapers that the honourable gentleman has it in contemplation to consult the constitutional advisers of the Crown as to whether he should adopt a suggestion made by the honourable meinber for Flinders the other day. wish to ask whether, if he finds that the authorities are favourable to the course suggested, since it involves so complete an alteration in the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, he will give honourable members an assurance that he will take no action in the matter before consulting the House.",18
49,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I think that Parliament could make the proposed change only by passing a law on the subject.,18
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable member for Parramatta, I wish to say that the matter to which he refers was under the consideration of the Government two months ago. referred to by the honourable member for Flinders the other night in connection with section 94 of the Constitution. It is the interpretation of the section that I wish to have decided as far as that can be clone. The honourable member must not think that the question involved has not been engaging the attention of the Government. That has been the position almost since the termination of the five years period.",18
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am not cerned with that phase of the question.,18
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have condeduct sulted the 'Crown Law officers object of obtaining the best advice I could get before any action is taken. thing depends upon the legal aspect of question, but unless the Constitution rea certain day. quires it to be done, it is not necessary to deplete the Treasury at the end of every month. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Onl y liament can appropriate the .monev.",18
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Quite'so . The system in the past has been to pay over at the end of everv month every penny in the hands of the Treasurer, and to leave the Treasury practically without funds, no matter what the demands upon it- even for the current week-ma y be.",18
54,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is debating the question. - I have no wish to do so at this stage. I think we should not pay over every penny, but under section 94 of the Constitution Parliament must deal with the matter. If it be shown that it can be done, what is suggested is that money should be paid into a trust fund to meet any engagements entered into at certain periods. The particular payment to which reference was I made when the matter was dealt with before was a payment in connection with bounties.",18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My question had no reference to the final appropriation of the money, but to the deduction of a certain amount from the revenue paid to the States Governments month by month. That is a matter of so much consequence to the States that I should like the Treasurer to assure - honourable members that he will not, in any case, begin the system suggested without consulting the House.",18
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I thought I had made it quite clear that we cannot It was do anything under the 94th section without consulting the House. Parliament must direct what is to be done.,18
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is as to the appropriation, but I did not specially refer to the appropriation.",18
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"But what I say applies also to the placing of money in a trust fund. I cannot allow the Treasury to be depleted in the way in which it now . is, because that entails very great inconvenience ; but I cannot appropriate in any conwav without the permission of the House.",18
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will the Treasurer the money without first coming to with the the House for permission ?,18
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not proEverypose to make any deduction. The only the question involved is one of adjustment on TARIFF. TIMBE RDUTIES : REBATE ON EXPORTED the Par- FRUIT AND BUTTER CASES.,18
61,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether any complaints or representations have been made to him that the timber duties have increased the price of frui t cases? If so, will he make inquiries into such complaints or representations, with a view to granting a drawback upon the export of f r u it cases ?",18
62,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The matter is receiving consideration. Representations have been made, and it is said that a clear line can be drawn between frui t cases and butter boxes, because, while it is dimcult at times to get in Australia suitable timber for butter boxes, it is contended that there is very little difficulty in obtaining it for f r u it cases. Tha't is the question which is engaging our attention. Both matters will be dealt with together.",19
63,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I hope that nothing will be done with regard to rebates on exported frui t cases until the timber duties have been dealt with. three-fourths of the timber used for f r u it cases is locally grown, and is superior to the imported timber.",19
64,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The matter has already been partly dealt with in relation to the question of rebates. honourable member knows, many of these matters are dealt with by regulation. shall be very glad to hear and give every consideration to any representations which the honourable member desires to make. We are looking very closely now into the question of timber from Tasmania.",19
65,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether, if he is prepared to allow rebate on exported frui t cases, he will take into consideration the question of allowing a rebate on lead, seeing that the lead exported from the Broken Hill mines may be increased in price, by reason of the timber used in the mines being now more expensive through the operation of the timber duties ?",19
66,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,I shall tion be very glad to give every consideration to the honourable member's views if he will put them in writing.,19
67,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question in connection with a matter which is of considerable importance to butter producers. The honourable gentleman will remember that when the House decided to impose a duty on timber a promise was given that there would be a rebate on the timber used in. butter boxes. Representations have been made to me by those controlling a number of butter factories that it is found impracticable to obtain the rebate, inasmuch as fhey cannot get the certincate of the importers of timber used in the manufacture of butter boxes that duty has been paid on it, and they have to pay the increased price for the timber whether duty has been paid on it or not. I direct the attention of the Minister to the matter. I do not expect him to make any statement as to the policy of the Department in dealing with it, but I ask whether the matter has been brought under his notice?",19
68,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The whole matter to which the honourable member has referred is now engaging our attention. A difficulty arose in connection with the method at first adopted, because a quantity of timber that has not paid duty is used in the manufacture of butter boxes. The whole question of rebates on butter boxes At least and frui t cases was brought under the notice of the Department some time back, and we are endeavouring to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. I hope shortly to be able to do so, and I shall then inform honourable members as to the As the course proposed to be adopted.",19
69,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I remind the MinisI ter that an increased price is charged for' the boxes by reason of the duty, whether duty has been paid on the timber used in their manufacture or not.",19
70,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I am afraid we cannot help the duty being passed on in that way, but we shall do what is possible to see that the rebates get into the right hands. STANDING ORDERS.",19
71,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether, in arranging the business of the House after the Christmas adjournment, he will consider the advisability of including the question of the adopof a proper set of Standing Orders ?",19
72,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,If before the session closes we have time to fill up the consideration of the subject suggested by the honourable member would be a very excellent means of employing it. TELEPHONE COMMUNICATION. HOG BAY AND KINGSTON.,19
73,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"H as the Postmaster-General received the reports which he promised to obtain regarding telephone communication for Hog Bay, Kangaroo Island, and Kingston, in the South-East of South Australia?",19
74,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I shall find out all about the matter. TELEGRAPHISTS : SYDNEY . Mr THOMAS BROW N asked the Postmaster-General, ufon notice I. Is he aware that telegraphists employed in the Sydney Head Office on the afternoon staff are frequently called upon to work extra long hours at night? 2. Is it a fact that a large proportion of the extra work thus entailed upon the staff originates after their regular working hours? 3. Is it a fact that officers commencing duties at 10.30 a.m. are frequently detained until 8 p.m. ? 4. Have representations been made by representatives of the staff as to the disabilities thus entailed, and what steps, if any, is it proposed to take to redress these overtime grievances?",19
75,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"When I was in Sydney I heard the complaints of these men, and took steps to remove a number of the evils that have undoubtedly grown up in connection with their employment: quiries are being made and relief will be afforded as quickly as possible. PROHIBITED CORRESPONDENCE : NEW ZEALAND.",20
76,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, tt-bon noticeWith reference to questions relating to prohibitions recently issued by the New Zealand postal authorities against the transmission of postal matter to and from persons or firms trading in the Commonwealth, and the reply that a firm named in this prohibited list had been similarly prohibited in the Commonwealth, but that such prohibition had been removed upon the principal of the firm in question giving a written undertaking that the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901 would not again be infringed-is he satisfied that this undertaking is being faithfully observed, and can he say what is the difference between the oostal matter of this firm now being passed through the Commonwealth and its postal matter recently prohibited by the New Zealand authorities in the public interests? Mr MAUGEjR - The answer to the honourable member's question is as followsI am not in possession of any information that would indicate that the firm in question is 1 not carrying out its undertaking, nor am I in a position to say what is the difference between the postal matter of such firm now being passed through the Commonwealth, and that recently prohibited by the Postmaster-General of New Zealand. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE. Debate resumed from 21st November (vide page 6401) on motion by Mr MAUGERThat the House of Representatives approves the agreement made and entered into the 15th day of November, 1907, between His Majesty's Postmaster-General in and for the Commonwealth of Australia of the first part, Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited of the second part, and the Law Guarantee and Trust Society Limited of the third part for the carriage of mails and services to be performed as therein provided, a copy of which agreement has been laid upon the table of the House. Upon which Mr THOMAS had moved by way of amendment That all the words after the word ""Kepresentatives "" be omitted from the motion with a view to the insertion in place thereof of the words ""is of opinion that, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, the Government should purchase and control a fleet of mail steamers capable of maintaining a fortnightly mail service between Australia and' Great Britain.""",20
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [ - S9]-- I do not intend to take many IO minutes this morning in dealing with this question, although some proposals of imIn- portance in connection with the contract are contained in the amendments which have already been foreshadowed by honourable members, and .deserve serious consideration. We have heard on this occasion no presentment of the case for the Government by the Postmaster-General. He relied upon the statement of important particulars furnished a week ago by the Prime Minister, but he might, with advantage' to this discussion, have presented to the House some of the salient features of the contract, and made some kind of comparison between the proposed and the present condition of affairs. In the absence of a statement of that kind, which I hope that we may yet obtain from the Minister during the debate, I have to address myself to the matter, although such an. explanation would have saved the time of the House by materially shortening the discussion. ""However, the Postmaster-General abdicated his functions for the nonce, but there stepped into the breach last night the Australian Henniker Heaton, who furnished us with an admirable discourse on the advantages of nationalizing the mail-boats. I do not intend to deal with his criticism at any length. I shall expect to hear reference made to it in detail by the honourable member for North Sydney, to whom the honourable member for Barrier especially addressed his criticism. There are, however, one or two references which I must make to the honourable member's speech. In the first place, I should like to congratulate the members of the Corner Party upon their increasing frankness and candour with regard to their objects and their general aims. ' It is 'something to be thankful for that we have left behind the old days of Watsonian dialectics, and have emerged into 'the region of candour and frankness, such as found expression in the speech of the honourable < member for Wide Bay. Some honourable members in the Corner now make no secret of their intentions and objects. They say straight out that they believe in Socialism - complet e Socialism. They believe in the nationalization of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange. They make no secret of that.",20
78,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Has the honourable member for Wide Bay said that? suppose that he requires words to be put into his mouth by the honourable member.,21
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member for Wide Bay was much more explicit on Tuesday than we have ever been able to get the honourable member who interjects to be in this House.,21
80,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I think that that is hardly a fair reply to the question.,21
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What question?,21
82,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The question whether the honourable member for Wide Bay said what the honourable member attributed to him.,21
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He said that he was glad to hear the serious objection of the honourable member for Flinders, but that he was not afraid of the question - that of nationalization.",21
84,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,""" And so say all of us"" !",21
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"He saidWhether it be popular or not, it would be cowardly for the man who believes that nationalization is a proper principle not to express his views in this House. We have too long shrunk from maintaining propositions which we clearly believe in-fa r too long.",21
86,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",21
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member says "" Hear, hear "" to that.",21
88,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , but that is not what the honourable member attributed to the honourable member for Wide Bay.",21
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It struck me that the statement which I quoted was rather a serious criticism upon the honourable member's tactics.,21
90,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That does not justify the statement made by the honourable member a few moments ago.,21
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not wish to go into particulars. If I did, I should simply quote the honourable member's manifesto issued before the last election, which I have by me, and which puts the matter very clearly.",21
92,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Oh yes, but that does not justify the honourable member's remark to which I have just called attention.",21
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is, at all events, not the slightest difficulty in proving what I have said with regard to the honourable member for Barrier. He will not deny it . I therefore say again that this frankness on the part of the honourable members in the Corner is to be welcomed. I presume that it is to be regarded as the precursor I do not of what they call an onwaird movement- a new departure in the direction of the nationalization of industries. We were treated last night to a proposal which apparently 1 stood by itself. But it cannot be considered by itself, I venture to submit. The honourable member for Barrier told us of some criticism to which he had been subjected in a railway carriage on the pairt of a gentleman of large commercial experience, who said that the nationalas to ization of certain functions might be a very proper thing, but that that was only a piecemeal way of getting to the complete nationalization of all commerce, trade, and industry. I submit that that was a fair criticism to make upon any of these proposals, and I will show why. Honourable members in the comer profess to be Fabian Socialists. They profess to desire to proceed one step at a time towards the completion of their aims. I venture to say, however, that they misrepresent the Fabian idea altogether in the various proposals which they make regarding their aims and objects. They do not seek to accomplish one step at a time. They seek to accomplish many steps at the same time. While they attack this question of nationalization in detail they commence their attack in a very complete and effective way. In this House on two consecutive nights we have been discussing the question of the nationalization of the iron mines and the iron production of the Commonwealth ; and the nationalization of steam-ships. A night or two before, the honourable member for Cook suggested that we might very well nationalize the coal supplies of the Commonwealth. Again my honourable friend, the member for Kal goorlie, suggested that we might very well nationalize the tobacco production of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Herbert suggests that we might very well do the same with the production of sugar. And so on all round.",21
94,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"He did not say "" the production of sugar,"" but "" the refining of sugar.""",21
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think so.,22
96,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That is very different. There is a monopoly in existence in referthe ocean. ence to refining.,22
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable member for Herbert would make that distinction, if he were here. So that we get honourable members attacking industries that are being carried on under our present system from every point of the compass. They do not, therefore, propose to deal with one subject at a time, but with every aspect of our indusvenient trial life, attacking it from every quarter in a piecemeal way. It reminds me of question which was once put to a little in school. He was asked how many two ancl two made. Instead of replying "" Four"" in the orthodox way, he said two ancl two made "" Twenty-two."" He meant that if you put the figures two two side by side they represent twentyinefficient two, not four.",22
98,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"He was quite right, wasn'the?",22
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Precisely ; and it is equally correct to say that when put these socialistic propositions side they do not amount to the Fabian and two-step s at a time-bu t they mean the whole twenty-two of Socialism.,22
100,Mr HALL,Unknown,They mean the nationalizalivered tion of monopolies. That is the policy upon which we went to the country.,22
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Monopolies ? I want the honourable member to tell us how it is possible to have monopolization on the sea.,22
102,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member forgetting his latter-day economics if he does not see that that is possible. There can easily be a monopoly there.,22
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I say that no ring under heaven can monopolize the ocean waves.,22
104,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They have done it in Australia for ten years past.,22
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think for so.,22
106,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,In connection with the Inter-State coastal trade.,22
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It would be purpose possibly only to a very limited extent. ocean is always open, and it is at any time possible to break down such a ring by the investment of capital in opposition to it. Therefore there is no possibility shutting up any of our water-ways beyond the pale of possible commercial competition. There cannot be a monopoly on",22
108,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,"It is not commercial competition to which we object, but combination for exploitation purposes.",22
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does not the honourable member believe in combination ?,22
110,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,I am against combination for exploitation purposes.,22
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A very conphrase, Mr Speaker; I have no objection to it ; I am just as strongly opposed a tr> combines for exploitation purposes as boy the honourable member is. I am not, however, in favour of escaping from a private exploitation into a Government exploitathat tion, from a private monopoly into a Government monopoly, which, I - believe, and would be more binding and give us a more and unproductive service, than that which we now receive. We are not to consider by itself the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Barrier; it must be considered as part and parcel of the very complete proposals we whichi the Labour Party make-i h many side by quarters and at many times, it is two true, but none the less effectively. I listened last night, with the greatest possible interest, to the speech deby the honourable member for Barrier, who"" is always interesting, even when he is not convincing. Last night he was far from convincing, except in those parts of his speech in which he sailed away into the sentimental atmosphere, and nearly induced me to say "" Almost thou persuadest is me to be a Socialist."" When we proceed to consider the details of his proposal, and apply to them the process of cool reason, we have to hark back from the sentimental arena to the region of facts, and come face to face once more with that ugly thing called human nature, which obtrudes itself into all our schemes and makes for us the complexities and problems with which we have to deal. I am not going into details, I think it is too late in the session to treat this amendment with great seriousness. I very much doubt whether the honourable member submitted it with any serious in view, but he could not permit The the occasion to pass without making the speech that he did. I make no complaint. It would have been strange, indeed, had he allowed the opportunity to pass without of making one more stroke in pursuit of the objective which he has so long had in view, and has pursued so persistently and consistently. I could not help being struck by one or two of his illustrations, and also by the illustrations furnished on the previous day by the leader of the party to which he belongs. The honourable member, for instance, has told us that the hard-headed commercial men of England besought the Government of Great Britain to nationalize the telegraphs. What analogy is there between telegraphs and steam-ships? We do not periodically call for tenders for telegraph services; we do not ask people to compete for the telegraphic services of the Commonwealth. No country thinks of taking such a step, and one has only to view the - suggestion from that stand-point to recognise, that there is no analogy.",22
112,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"If we owned a line of mail steamers, we should not - call for tenders for this service.",23
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; but whereas the ocean is wide, and we could obtain forty or a hundred lines of steamers to ply between Australia and England, we could not get one hundred railways compering over a similar stretch of country.",23
114,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,That is a mere theory; the facts are against the honourable member.,23
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think the facts are against the honourable member's interjection. I cannot conceive of any one building three or four trunk lines of railway where there is now only one main trunk piercing the country. Besides, no railway could be built unless a concession had first been made for the purpose by the Government. Clearly, therefore, a telegraph service, in its very nature, is monopolistic, and should be controlled by the Government. But that is not the positionin regard to a steam-ship service. We have an abundance of steam-ship communications with various parts of the world. Government proposal now before us is the result of inviting tenders from competing firms and Companies' for the 1 cheapest, best and most efficient line of communication that it is possible for the competition of the world to provide. The honourable member for Barrier went on to inquire why the former contract had not been fulfilled. Surely he knew.",23
116,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But we ought to have had an official statement on the subject from the Postmaster-General.,23
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member would not expect the Ministry make a very pronounced and official statement with regard to the matter.,23
118,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What would have been gained by my making a useless statement?,23
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then , ' according to the honourable member, a Ministerial explanation of an important contract involving an annual expenditure of £170,000 would be a useless statement? I congratulatehim upon his view of public affairs. If these matters are in their very nature useless, then what is the position of the Minister who has to deal with them? I should think that the Minister holds office for the very purpose of making these matters clear to the public of Australia. I propose to tell the honourable member for Barrier why the Laing contract came to nothing. The honourable member asked why it did not succeed. In. the first place, there was no capital-n o genuine company ->behin d it. All the evidence shows that an option was given by a responsible Government to a private syndicate in order that it might be exploited in the money markets of the world.",23
120,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"All that was behind it was a "" Croker.""",23
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There was too much ""Croker"" and broker, and too little genuine capital associated with the contract. It did not succeed because if was never a genuine proposal for the carriage of our mails.",23
122,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows all this, and yet he wished me to tell him about it !",23
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know 'that I desire the honourable member to tell me anything unless he chooses to do so. I was very much interested last evening in the proposals of the honourable member The for making a socialistic line of mail steamers pay. It was interesting to hear hkn describe how he would make the undertaking remunerative if he were manager of a Commonwealth line of steamers.,23
124,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Would he make honourable members pav ?,23
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; but he would make the Government pay, irrespective of whether they liked it or not. In the first place he - proposed to commandeer all the freights of the States Governments.",23
126,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,".' [ did not use the to word ""commandeer."" I said that we should have first call upon freights.",23
127,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is a little distinction between the two things, but the idea at the back of both same. The honourable member said that the States would make their servants travel by this line of steamers.",24
128,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Jus t as they them travel upon our railways.,24
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable have member also declared that, behind this enterprise, there would be a sentiment, which would operate commercially towards the profitable working of the line. I suggest that he had better leave questions of sentiment out of the consideration his project, if he is to succeed.",24
130,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What about rential trade?,24
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is little vice, place for sentiment in, the running of line of steam-ships. As I understood the honourable member's reference to the sentioutside evidence. mental aspect of this question, he meant to convey the idea that sentiment in this connection would lead to favourable econdoes not matter. omic results. May I point out to him that in connection with the question of preferenam tial trade, sentiment is only to be found in justice. the desire of various parts of the Empire to make sacrifices for the purpose of building up that Empire. Thus they would pay for their sentiment in hard cash if need certainly in self-sacrifice in relation whole of our life. But the honourable memprevented ber says that sentiment would lead to mercially profitable business in connection with a socialistic line of steam-ships. take leave to doubt his statement in every way. He also spoke of the compulsion which was put upon private individuals, and which prevented them from giving him the evidence that he sought during the vestigations of the Shipping Service Combecause mission, of which he was Chairman. I wonder if the great outside world is only place where this fear exists, where this dread of publicity obtains, and where persons are afraid to give evidence upon matters of which they have an intimate knowledge, because of the consequences which may ensue? Is not that a difficulty with which we are constantly faced in conthey nexion with our own Public Service? Why nobody complains of it more than my honourable friends in the Labour corner. They are constantly waging a war State favour of more and more privileges of a civil character being extended to State employees.",24
132,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Not privileges, but a is the recognition of rights.",24
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They mean the same thing.,24
134,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Not always.,24
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Honourable make members of the Labour Party are constantly urging that civil servants should the right to make their complaints and wishes known in a public way if they so desire. But that is the very thing of which the honourable member for Barrier complains May in connection with the outside world.,24
136,Mr HALL,Unknown,But the customers-of a comof bine are not its servants. The customers of our railways are at liberty to criticise.,24
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is not the prefeanalogy. The omcers of our own Public Service may not publicly criticise that serwhich is the point that has been raised a by the honourable member for Barrier in connection with the difficulty of securing,24
138,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not think that the honourable member is quite fair. Still, it",24
139,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope that I not doing the honourable member an in,24
140,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Not wittinglv.,24
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member put the case as to the dreadful be, results of capitalism in. his own way. to the He stated that the present system persons from being free agents com- - that they were not allowed to tender evidence which they would have I tendered but for the fear of the consequences. Precisely a similar condition of affairs prevails today in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. The complaint is constantly being made that sweatining continues in our public Departments our public servants are not permitted to make their wishes known in the the public way they would like. What is the reason that my honourable friends of the Labour corner voice their complaints ? The public servants of the Commonwealth are absolutely forbidden by Statute to make their complaints known to anybody except through an official channel. Tn that respect are worse off than are outside persons.",24
142,Mr HALL,Unknown,They are not worse off than do are the servants of a combine.,24
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In that partiin cular respect they are no better off.,24
144,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They have an Appeal Board, and public recognition of their rights.",25
145,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"They have all these things within their own service. They the war. are forbidden to go outside the service and to come to this Parliament for their grievances. Therefore, this fear of consequences is not peculiar to outside talists, but relates equally to our Public Service. Last night the honourable member for Barrier impliedly told the House that to make his scheme a success we should have to apply the same compulsion in rein gard to a man's freedom, and in regard the freighting of ships in general, that applied by outside companies. In other words, he rested his whole case system of compulsion which, in my judgment, would grow into an intolerable should follow. tyranny. That is one of my strongest objections to the theory which honourable members opposite are constantly enunciatGovernment ing. I can see no escape from a grinding tyranny when this project had worked itganizations self out through all the ramifications our commercial life. Then the honourable ment. member gave one more instance of .the failure of private enterprise. He alluded to the rotten jam which was sent to South Africa during the Boer Wa.r, to the t e d "" cronk"" horses upon which men rode to their deaths, and to the generally defective condition of the supplies to the army. May I remind him that everything in the shape of supplies is supposed to pass rigid inspection of Government officials?",25
146,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If private sent out such defective supplies, notwithstanding Government inspection, what with the honourable member as to that. would it have done in the absence of inspection ?",25
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does not the honourable member see that the same incase adequate Government inspection which perGovernment control. mitted private capitalists to do that sort of thing would not prevent them from doing it within their own particular sphere?,25
148,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,That is a reflection on Government officials.,25
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is no reflection; it is ai general admission of limitation of the capabilities beings, in relation to the ordinary work of life in any sphere.",25
150,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,It is a general statement of incompetence on the part of Governtralia. ment officials.,25
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as the war is concerned, it is a reflection on cost on the other side. Government inspection. If further proof be required, let honourable members read of the scandals which arose in the Old Country in regard to the general conduct of",25
152,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That was because of redress of private enterprise.,25
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable capimember cannot say that, because we are face to face with Government Departments, which completely broke down in the exercise of their very first function. The whole history of the war shows what is possible the way of inefficiency, incapacity, and to muddle by a Government Department. I is am not urging that, because of these facts, we should surrender the control of them upon a to the private capitalist.",25
154,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,To be logical that,25
155,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not at all. At present I am endeavouring to show that Departments can match in incompetency and ineffectiveness the orof private enterprise; to that of extent only, do I wish to push the arguI n a word, I contend that in nationalization projects, we have the same human nature and the same liability to incompetency and error as are found associawith private enterprise.

I understand that an nary mail boat, such as those in use tp-day, costs, roughly speaking, about £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 to build.",25
160,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"More than that, surely !",26
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am speaking of the boats which are now doing service; and I am assured that, for the most part, their average cost is £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 .",26
162,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is that all?,26
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I except, of course, one or two of the newest boats. '",26
164,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If the honourable member is correct, then our little scheme for a line of Commonwealth boats will pay handsomely !",26
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Not at all. I understand that the boats which are to be built under the new contract, will cost about £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 each.",26
166,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We estimated the cost of a mail boat at £ 3 7 5 , 0 0 0 , and we were told that the estimate was too low. , Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is neither here nor there; I am taking the cost at £350,000.",26
167,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We accept vour figure.,26
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I - desire to show, by a rough illustration, what the contract will mean to the contractors; because it is only fair to look at both sides when a proposal of this kind, involving so large an expenditure, is before us. place the average cost of the boats at £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 , it means that the contractors will be involved in an extra expenditure of over £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and, that the contract will mean an annual expenditure of at least -£150,000 for interest and sinking fund alone.",26
169,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is ignoring the fact that anv shipping company, in order to retain its ordinary trade, must build new boats. boats in use are out of date, some of them being over twentv vears old.",26
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That may be, but I venture to say that if there were no Government contract in view, nothing like the expenditure that will be necessary now would be contemplated.",26
171,Mr WATSON,Unknown,A shipping company plication. must either build new boats or drop out the trade.,26
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"At any rate, standard of speed. our mails are at present carried by boats built at the cost I have indicated, whereas, in future, they will be carried in vessels involving a much larger expenditure. We shall obtain a much quicker service, some ordi- fifty-eight hours shorter, than the present one.",26
173,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The time saved under the new service will be forty-six hours one wav, and fifty-eight hours the other.",26
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It will be seen, therefore, that we are to receive a great concession in the matter of speed. I understand that the new service is intended to exactly alternate with the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, so that, in the future, we may relv on regularity, without any of those great gaps which now cause so much business inconvenience. There are one or two other matters in connection with the contract which require some comment. Paragraph 6 of the Articles of Agreement statesI f before or during the sixth year of the fixed period of ten years mentioned in clause 30 hereof any competing line of mail ships shall then provide an improved and accelerated service vid the Suez Canal from Europe to Australia the contractors shall if so required by the Postmaster-General at any time after the fifth year provide a service equal to such improved and accelerated service. What is meant by a competing line of mail ships? There is no competing line.",26
175,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Any line doing the journey more quickly.,26
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Are the White Star, Blue Anchor, and Federal-Houlder If we Shire lines competing lines of mail ships?",26
177,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,No ; but the Peninsular and Oriental Company is.,26
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is no being sr>, competing line of mail ships.",26
179,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Peninsular and Oriental Company is an alternative, not a competing, line.",26
180,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It is competing as to time.,26

182,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We might say ""any other line of mail ships between Australia and Europe.""

"" It should be as wide as possible in its apI f any line of steam-ships of makes the journey more quickly, the subsidized steamers s'hould be brought up to its One of the advantages of mail services - though it is not generally recognised- is the fact that the mail boats set the pace for all other steamers trading here. If there were not subsidized mail boats, compelled to run to time, all the shipping services of Australia would gradually become a little slower than they are today. jln our isolation and remoteness from the commercial centres of the world, .it is of the utmost importance that our communications should be as speedy as possible. I regard no money as being ill-spent which causes the journey between Australia and England to be quicker, better, and safer. Therefore, I congratulate the Government upon the great advantages which the contract will secure in these respects. There is great difference of opinion as to the meaning of the provision relating to the calling of the steamers at Hobart.",26
183,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,This is the first contract in which there has been such a provision.,27
184,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That doss not matter. The provision in this contract means only that steamers may call at Hobart if they choose.,27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Since we are making a new departure, it is all the more important that the matter should be carefully considered. I understand that it has hitherto been the practice for the steamers of this line to call at Hobart five times a year.",27
186,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They can go now times a year, if it pays them; they can do that apart from the contract.",27
187,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The contract provides that they must go six times a year to Hobart, unless they can show that there is no cargo there for them.",27
188,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Unles s they say that it would be unprofitable to do so.,27
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They must go six times a year unless they convince the Postmaster-General that to call at Hobart would be unprofitable. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Postmaster General may be easily convinced.,27
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not so concerned about that. One of the best features of the paragraph is that it gives the Government some discretion in the matter, and the power of veto. take exception to the vagueness of the language used. I wish'to know what the meaning of the word ""unprofitable"" is. Does it mean unprofitable absolutely, or less profitable.",27
191,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It means the failure of the fruit crop, and the impossibility of getting cargo.",27
192,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That meaning cannot be read into the provision.,27
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That may be an explanation of the intention, but it is not a binding interpretation. The company might be able to nearly fill its vessels at the mainland ports, so as to have such a' small amount of available space left that it would cost more to go to Hobart than the freights to be got there would be worth. Or they might be able to fill up wholly at the mainland ports, in which case the sending of a full ship to Hobart, where no freight could be taken, would be distinctly unprofitable. How would the Postmaster-General act in either of those cases? The provision seems to be as vague as possible. The contract takes away an advantage which the people of Tasmania now possess, in being able to bargain with this steamship company. Since we deprive them of that privilege, we should make it clear that we are not subjecting them to any disability. Tasmania, like every other State, should be a little better off by the acceptance of this contract.",27
194,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,It is all a question of pavment.,27
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The matter becomes serious when, by .the use of vague terms, there is a possibility of Hobart being left in the lurch. We might eliminate the six provision.",27
196,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If that is done the contract will be destroyed, because they will not give us anything more.",27
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I cannot believe that the company would surrender the contract because of this one provision. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Le t them go, and we will do the work ourselves.",27
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not wish to do that; but I desire to bring about what is fair. To my mind a difficulty would be got over by inserting after the word "" un-. profitable"" the words "" by reason of insufficient cargo,"" or some similar definition. The contract also provides that there should be no differentiation of any kind with respect to freights in various parts of Australia. There is a differentiation toBut I day which I think is reasonable. Why should not a port which provides special facilities get lower rates than a less convenient port? It may be that the steamers would make more profit from a low freight from one port than from a high freight from another. So long as each port gets fair rates, in view of all the local circumstances, the broad claims of justice will be met. I do not see why we should begin by socialising the geographical advantages of the ports of Australia, as the contract undoubtedly does. I should to know from the Postmaster-General why .this clause has been inserted. There are other matters about which I desired to speak, but I do not wish to weary the House. These defects in verbiage notwithstanding, the contract is, in my judgment, an advantageous one for the Commonwealth as a whole, and I hope that there may be no mishap to prevent its f u l filment. I believe the result to our trade and commerce and to the whole business community of the Commonwealth will be well worth the expenditure.",27
199,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.52] - I do not propose to discuss at length either the motion, or the amendment which was submitted last night in a very able speech by the honourable member for Barrier. The deputy leader of the Opposition has said more than once this morning that he begrudges no reasonable payment of public money to a steam-ship company to provide for an accelerated mail service between Australia and the great centres of the world. I agree with that as a general proposition, but would point out that there is a limit beyond which we ought not to be asked to go in subsidizing private companies. That limit, to my mind, has been reached in this case. I was somewhat surprised by the interjection of the Postmaster-General that the slightest amendment of the terms of the contract would put an end to it.",28
200,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"3 did not mean to suggest that a minor amendment would have that effect. What I desired to impress upon honourable members was that, as far as we can see, we have secured all the privileges and advantages that could be obtained for the expenditure that we propose.",28
201,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The party which is in the hands of the other to an agreement is al'ways assured that a limit has been reached to the concessions that can be given under it. But if no amendment can be made in this contract why has it been submitted to Parliament?,28
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Government compliment to any State. take a stand upon it.,28
203,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does the right honorlation able member urge that the Government should not be prepared to accept from Parliament even a suggestion as to a d i - State. rection in which the proposed contract might be improved? Such a proposition would be ridiculous. If the Government bring before the House a contract for its like consideration, they should not take a stand upon it .",28
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Thei r position in regard to a contract of this kind is very much the same as is their position in regard to the Estimates. They know that they have a majority, and can carry it.",28
205,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Of course; but an agreement of this kind, if signed by the Executive, would at once become a binding contract, irrespective of whether or not it had been brought before Parliament.",28
206,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The contract contains a special proviso that it shall be submitted to the Parliament.,28
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And therefore a proviso for its review by Parliament.,28
208,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think that proviso was inserted in order that both the parties to the agreement should have an opportunity to learn exactly where they stood. When the Prime Minister was explaining the provisions of the contract I inquired whether it was possible to amend it , and he replied that it was undesirable that it should be amended, although, as the representatives of the company were in Australia, he did not think that, if an improvement could be suggested, an amendment would be impossible. To my mind the weakest feature of the - contract is to be found in the provision regarding the calling of the mail steamers at Hobart. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that the clause in question is very loosely worded. It may mean anything or nothing.",28
209,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,It makes the position of Tasmania worse than it was.,28
210,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,But Tasmania has never been recognised in previous contracts.,28
211,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is not a sufficient defence to the charge that the Government have failed to make proper arrangement for Hobart being a port of call for these steamers.,28
212,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I did not urge that it was..,28
213,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I desire nothing to be passed by this Parliament merely as a We are not here ' to do anything of the kind. Anv legisthat we pass must be in accordance with a general policv, and intended not as a compliment, but to do justice to a If it be true, as the Postmaster General has said, that sub-clause 8 of clause 9 was inserted to safeguard the comratified pany in the event of the failure of the fruit crop in Tasmania, then I can only .say that it has been very loosely drafted. It is altogether too vague. It provides thatIn each and every year during the continuance of this agreement the contractors shall cause at least six of the mail ships to proceed to and call at Hobart, in Tasmania, during the months of February to May inclusive. Provided always that if in any year the contractors shall grove la the satisfaction of the Postmaster-General that calls at Hobart during that year are or would be unprofitable the Postmaster-General may direct that the whole or any of such calls for that year may be omitted. The strength of the company's position under that provision is that if it were able to prove that, by reason of insufficient cargoes being available, calls at Hobart would be unprofitable, the Postmaster General, as a straightforward, honest man, would feel constrained to direct that such calls need not be made. I do not think that it is advisable for the sake of a few hundred pounds to make such a concession. Another objection to the clause is that it leaves too much to administration. I think in a closely-drawn contract such as this it would be better to prescribe the number of calls to be made than to leave the position so uncertain as it is. I am prepared, and always have been, to vote that Tasmania should enjoy the same service as is granted tD the remaining States of Australia. I know of no other just way of dealing with the matter. It will be said, no doubt, that this contract does something for Queensland which' was not done before. contention always has been that it is wror\g to omit any of the States from the provisions of such a contract as this. I know that a number of members of the Opposition resisted the provision in the last mail contract that Brisbane should be made a port of call.",28
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,No .,29
215,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member at all events spoke strongly against it.,29
216,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,And I intend today to say something about the matter.,29
217,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I hold that we cannot logically refuse to allow Queensland or Tasmania to participate in the advantages - of a contract under which the service is to consist of something more than the carriage of mails. I have no desire to reflect on the representatives of any State, but I am satisfied that no mail contract would be by this House if under it the mail steamers could make Adelaide the terminal point. Obviously, the vessels of this service would call at Melbourne and Sydney, since those are the two greatest shipping centres in the Commonwealth.",29
218,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,We could not prevent their calling at any other port.,29
219,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member will admit that this is something more than a mail contract.,29
220,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I admit that there is a difference between this and the old one. - Mr FISHER - But even the previous contract provided for something more than a mail service. I do not wish to labour that phase of the question, but may. say, in passing, that I am pleased that the contract provides for Brisbane and Hobart being ports of c all ; Queensland naturally felt hurt when she learned that, under the last contract, Brisbane was ignored. The Government is now taking up an untenable position in asking Queensland to continue to pay to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, until the new agreement comes into operation, two years hence, the subsidy required for making Brisbane a port of call. I hold that, having decided that the old position was an anomaly, Queensland should not be called upon to make such a payment. We should proceed at once to carry out the new policy. As regards the amendment, I admit at once that, having regard to the present state of the House, My we have no hope of carrying it . Air. WILKS - The Labour Party, had they really meant business, could have carried it in the Senate.",29
221,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the honourable member thinks that we do not mean business, he misunderstands our position.",29
222,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If the Labour Party meant business, it could have carried such an amendment in another .place. * Mr FISHER - It would be useless to carry such an amendment in the Senate unless we knew that we could also carry it in this House. Unless we could convince the dominant financial House of the wisdom of the amendment we could not hope to have effect given to it ; but it would be entirely wrong to say that we were afraid to raise the question in another place. In more than one excellent speech, the honourable member for Barrier has put the question before honourable members far more effectively than I could hope to do. As he has said, his scheme may not be realized for some years,_but I am satisfied that it will ultimately be adopted by the Federal Parliament.",29
223,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If we accept this tender, it will be useless for the Labour Party to endeavour, for another twelve years, deavour to carry such a proposal.",30
224,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"We have no option. I hope that the honourable member for Dalley will support the amendment. On the last occasion on which such a proposition was submitted, the Labour Party practically stood alone, the honourable 'member for Riverina alone joining with them in support spectacular effect. of it. In that way we have been the political ""pioneers in this movement. It be a bad thing for a democratic country to be without political pioneers. It would be a bad thing for any country to be withgood out men who will argue in Parliament in favour of an unpopular project, with view ultimately to educating public opinion up to a proper standard. I am inclined to think that the .Orient. Steam Navigation Company have made an excellent bargain in the present instance. I think that subsidy which is to be paid to them is a very high one indeed. Whenever the triotic cry has been raised, I have almost invariably found that there was attached to it a subsidy of some kind. It is a tion of subsidy, subsidy, subsidy. Whilst I admit all that has been said regarding the advantage which Australia will by reason of the ships flying the Australian flag, of their observance of Australian conditions by the employment of white seamen, and by the payment of Australian rates of wages, I think that a compliment has been paid by the Government to the company in the shape of hard cash. I think that the company have obtained a quid pro quo for everything which they have given. I do not wish my remarks in this connection to be misunderstood. I ' entertain no feeling against the Orient Steam Navigation Company. I think that they have rendered good service to Australia as a carrying company, and I wish them every success. I would rather see that company successful iin this undertaking ""than any other company that I know of. But I do not think for a moment that the speed of the new vessels stipulated for in the contract is an exceptionally high one, when we take into consideration the duration of the contract. If there be a fault in the agreement, it is that it will extend over twelve years, because although the new contract itself covers only ten years, there is an interval of two years before its commencement, which has to be bridged.",30
225,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Does not the contract to encontain a proviso which permits of improvements being introduced during its tenure?,30
226,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But that provision is very vague. When the honourable member has had some experience of these matters he will learn that such vague provisions are simply inserted in the contract for If the Orient Steam Navigation Company find that it is to their would advantage to increase the speed of the vessels, and the Postmaster-General desires it, they will increase it But if they find reason to 'dawdle along there will be no difficulty in the way of them doing so. a That is my opinion of the drafting of the contract in that respect. Need I remind honourable members that only twenty-seven years have elapsed since the late Sir William Pearce, who was one of the foremost the naval architects of his time, predicted that early in this century ships 800 feet in palength would be traversing the Atlantic from port to port in less than five days. His statement was received with ridicule. quesBut, nevertheless, we know that to-dayj ships are plying the Atlantic from port to port in well under five days, although they receive' are not 800 feet in length.",30
227,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,They are. . Mr KING OMALLEY - The Lusitania is 796 feet long.,30
228,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But some steamers belonging to the White Star Line are well over 800 feet in length.,30
229,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Les s than thirty years ago the statement made by the eminent naval architect to whom I have alluded was a source of merriment. Whilst I admit that it will probably be found impossible to double the rate of speed of vessels during the next thirty years, I should not like to say that an invention will not be introduced which will enable ships to attain a considerably accelerated speed.",30
230,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,We shall have air-ships by then.,30
231,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"At the present time there are many eminent scientists endeavouring to obtain the fullest power out of the combustion of coal. Under existing conditions we secure only a modicum of that power. Should they succeed in getconnexion ting from coal four or five times the ing power at present' obtained from it, they might easily double the speed of sels without seriously adding to the cost of running them. .What an enormous vantage that would be to a country like any man. Australia, isolated as it is from the 'great bodies of people who wish to have interby course with us, and to exchange goods with us. If such a state of things were brought about, we should occupy happy position, and the Government would undoubtedly appeal to the companv to which we were paying a subsidy their ships up to date - Of course, we all hope that the same rate of progress which has characterized mechanical science in the member. past will continue.

Concerning the practicapay. bility of the Commonwealth successfully conducting a line of steamers for the purpose of carrying produce passengers between Australia and other parts of the world, I have no doubt whatever. _ I wish to set aside at once taken idea which is entertained outsidean idea which has been propagated by orable members opposite-that the Labour Party seek to introduce a white ocean policy. All that we have ever claimed is that if we pay a subsidy to any line of ships, we have a right to prescribe the. catch up tb. class of labour which should be employed upon them. If these vessels want our money, they, may have it subject to that condition; but if they do not want they may carry out their own conditions. That is a very different matter a white ocean policy.",30

It is not sufficient that the steamers should at the principal ports. One might imagine that the larger centres of population would be well able to look after in this connection, and that our attention and assistance would be devoted to smaller centres which are more difficult of access. That assistance is withheld, not because the claims are not just, but because the political influence exercised by such places is not equal to moving Parliament.

253,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [12.31] - I intend to be as brief as possible, because at this stage of the session we cannot discuss any question so lengthily as we would at another time. My principal reason for rising is to reply to some remarks made by the honourable member for Barrier last night when he submitted his amendment. I cannot complain of the honourable member's criticism of myself; in fact, I think he gave me undue credit. I can only say that if there was any merit in the speech in which I replied to the honourable member on a previous occasion, it was due to the strength of his own address, on the good tone of which I can also congratulate him.. I shall not press the line of compliment further, or we may deteriorate into a mutual admiration society. If I understood the honourable member aright- I may perhaps have been mistaken, because my attention was distracted a little at the time - hi s later speech, while it had all the ability of his previous speech to which I have referred, was certainly not so desirable in its tone. I understood the honourable member to say that capitalism has been guilty of every crime in the Decaloguethat it is heartless, treacherous, deceitful, and so forth. Perhaps the honourable member was quoting somebody else; but I understood him to say that Chambers of Commerce would sell Jesus Christ for thirty pieces of silver.",33
254,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I said that Chambers of Commerce would crucify Christ for thirty pieces of silver,",33
255,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wide Bay objects to the criticism that has been directed to the members of his party, whom he described a% misrepresented pioneers. He objects to the criticism directed against them as Socialists-to the charge that they are in favour of laxity of the marriage tie, against religion, and in favour of depriving parents of the custody [228]- 2 - of their own children. To that criticism the honourable member objects, and he rightly objects so long as these ideas are nor advocated by his party. But is it right for them, although objecting to the criticism of opponents as dishonourable and unfair who refer to the views of some Socialists as the opinions of all, to overlook all that is good that is associated with capitalism, and picking out instances of evil, to declare that these exceptional cases apply to all Chambers of Commerce and to capitalism. Those associated with Chambers of Commerce and capitalists have as much right to object to criticism such as we have heard as have the Socialists in this House to object to being criticised because of views held by other Socialists which they do not themselves accept. The criticism of which I am complaining is cheap and easy, but it. is unworthy of any honourable member. There are evils connected with capitalism, and there are undesirable persons connected with Chambers of Commerce; but if those persons are no tetter, they are no worse than the people with whom the honourable member associates, and whom he represents.",33
256,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is fair.,33
257,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is not right to use particular instances as if they were of general application. Coming to the amendment, I shall not occupy much time in dealing with the financial question which it raises, because the honourable member for Barrier did not deal with it at length. He was right in saying that when I criticised his proposals on a former occasion there was a great difference between my results and those at which he had arrived. He has acknowledged, however, that I did not take the extreme figures put forward by steamship owners. The Orient Company claimed that on each round trip the extra expense of running the larger boats is £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . I took only half of that amount, but I showed a considerable loss where the honourable member for Barrier showed a profit. The Commission of which he was chairman obtained from Mr Coghlan a. price for steamers of the class which they recommended£ 3 7 5 J ° OO each. But I pointed out that that is what one of those vessels would cost delivered from the builder's hands, and that there would still be the furnishings to pay for. The providing of linen, cutlery, plate, bedding, and other furnishings for a big steamer costs probably £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . Therefore, I put the cost of each vessel at £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and the rate at which the Commonwealth could borrow at per cent., instead of at 3 per cent., which was the estimate of the honourable member. I also argued that nine boats would be required to provide a regular service. I do not mean that it would be absolutely necessary for the Government to own nine vessels; but provision would have to be made for the occasional chartering of a ninth to prevent interruption to the service from break-downs, or docking for large repairs. As a matter Of fact, there are nine vessels now in the Australian sailing lists of the Orient ancl Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companies. However, in one of my calculations I allowed for eight boats only, and, accepting the ""estimate furnished by Mr Coghlan-£375,00 0 - showe d that there would be a loss of £336,000 . Of course, there must be differences of opinion as to the correctness of that result. I cannot claim infallibility, any more than the honourable member can. But as he has not pone into the matter again to substantiate his estimates, I shall not do so. He asks"" how is it, If such a loss would be incurred, that a private company, which must make profits, is willing to enter into the proposed contract, and to provide vessels similar to those suggested for the Commonwealth fleet. My first answer to the honourable member is that I am not concerned whether the Orient Steam Navigation Company loses money or not, but that it is my duty to see that the Commonwealth does not lose money. In the second place, the circumstances now are different from what they were when the calculation was made. The cost of metal has declined considerably, so that the cost of building steamers is probably lower than it was. Then freights have been increased. Under this contract the butter freight will be £ 1 : 3s. 6d. per ton higher than it was, and other freights have risen because the extreme cutting of freights to and from the East has practically ceased. passage rates have increased by 10 per cent.",33
258,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,And the subsidy mere used.,34
259,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The proposed subsidy is £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 more than was calculated for by the honourable member for Barrier. He put it at £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 , making Brisbane a port of c all ; but it is to be pay. £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 . Therefore, my estimate may have been substantially correct, and yet under present conditions the company may be able to make a profit.",34
260,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Migh t not a Commonwealth service also be able to make a profit now? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - A Commonwealth service would have a better chance of making ends meet now than existed previously; but a Government line of steamers which had to compete with other lines would not be likely to do nearly as well as a line privately owned and managed by experienced directors. I could give my reason for that statement, but, as time is pressing, I shall not do so. I admit that when a franchise or a practical monopoly is concerned, the question must of cost always arise, is it better to give it to private persons or to allow the Government to exercise it? But in this case there is no monopoly. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, the sea is not like the earth, on which you put down two lines of rails or under which you place a line of pipes. It provides facilities for any amount of competition.",34
261,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is there not something in the argument that ai subsidized mail company is removed from ordinary competition ?,34
262,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It must, in the first instance, compete with other companies to obtain the subsidy, and after it is subsidized, it must compete with other lines for passengers and freight.",34
263,Mr CARR,Unknown,How many companies were in a position to tender for this contract?,34
264,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Beside s the mail companies, some of the biggest shipping companies in the world run steamers to Australia, and they were in a position to tender. So, too, were other British companies.",34
265,Mr CARR,Unknown,The fact that they did not tender shows that they were not in a position to do so.,34
266,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"^The fact Then that other tenders were above that of the Orient Company, and that some lines did not tender at all , only shows that those concerned did not think it worthwhile to has make a greater effort to obtain the contract. Mr HUGHES*-Competitio n can never lae keener than it is now. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company says that its Australian traffic is not profitable, and the Orient Company does not : Mr DUGALD THOMSON - There is entering upon such an experiment. good evidence that the Orient Company has not paid in the past. It has paid who have handled the business, but it not returned interest on capital. case there is no monopoly. anything may by combination be made a monopoly; but we can deal with shipping combinations more easily than with any others, and from time to time, when we this side have spoken of monopolies, members of the Labour Party have replied, ""We can deal with monopolies.""",34

268,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"H a d the honourable member been here more fregramme. quently, he would have heard that statement from members of his party. If tliere were such a strong combination, working against Australia so that its were likely to be injured, I should not stand in the way of a Commonclaimed wealth mail service. But no such exists. We are being asked to enter upon a new and untried experiment, which is likely to prove successful.

I do not think that that failure has been sufficiently explained. It was not without warning that the Government took the coursethat they did. They were told that they ought to insist upon a more substantial security. As it was they allowed certain persons to obtain a concession to be ""hawked"" through the money markets of Great Britain. To the evident astonishment of the Frime Minister, who had alluded to the strength of the contracting parties, I said when the contract was before us that the firm he mentioned was really not behind it. . I pointed out that it was merely a proposal to deposit £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 in order to obtain a certain option, and that there was even no certainty does the of our securing that £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 in the event of the contract not being fulfilled. We have had from the Government no explanation of the cause of the failure, or of the reasons why the Government have not enforced the bond. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I think Croker ""cooked"" them.",36
296,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The 'Government were told that the contract merelv represented an attempt on the part of certain persons to secure a concession in the hope of floating a company; that if it could be floated the contract would be fulfilled, but that otherwise it would not. I ventured to say then that while I thought that the contract would be a good one if it were fulfilled, I did not think that it would be. The Government should have taken greater precautions than they di d to prevent the Commonwealth being placed in the unfortunate position of having the option which it gave ""hawked"" through the money markets of Great Britain. - Sitting suspended from 1.3 to 2.15 p.m.",36

312,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [2.33] - It is rather dangerous to give any honourable melmber such an interval as has been provided on this occasion, because so many new ideas come into his head, that he may be tempted to waste the valuable time of Parliament. However, there is only one point to which I desire to call attention, to which I would not otherwise have referred. An interjection, which was made before the adjournment for luncheon, seemed to show that possibly I had not made clear enough one position I am maintaining; and I shall refer to that in a few words before dealing with the contract itself . I stated that when the industries of the community became one vast Commonwealth industry, the Government of the industry will be from within. When I previously asked honourable members in the Labour corner, whether the railways could be managed by a vote of those employed on the railways, I was told by those honourable members that they would .not dream of anything of the sort. I then went on to show that, if the .policy of universal nationalization were carried out, AYES. or even if the majority of the industries of the cornmunitv were nationalized, then the management would be by the votes of those within the vast' State industry, and the position would be reached which honourable members in the Labour corner admitted is impossible.",38
313,Mr FISHER,Unknown,We did not admit that at all.,38
314,Mr CARR,Unknown,The State industries are controlled by the votes of the people now.,38
315,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is the interjection to which I refer. But the majority of the people of today are not Socialists-the y are not for nationalization of all the industries, or any large portion of them. They have declared themselves, NOES. at every election so far, by large majorities, in favour of private enterprise and individual effort and reward.",38
316,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Migh t I say that we have never contended that the State's industries could be controlled by the votes of the people; we propose to delegate to a properly constituted! tribunal, the duty of dealing with the wages and conditions of the workmen.",38
317,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but I point out that the people of the Commonwealth, so far as their decision has been made known, have declared against nationalization.",38
318,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They have never been asked to declare for it. Mr DUGALD! THOMSON - They have jiot declared for it, whether they have been asked to do so or not.",38
319,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The people have not declared against extensions of nationalization.,38
320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,They have been askedto declare for approaching universal nationalization step by step.,38
321,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Nothin g of the sort.,38
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"At any rate, so far as they have indicated,-whether they have been asked or not-so far as they have made their-wishes and desires known - the people are against any large nationalization of the industries of Australia. . The present national industries or departments are managed not from within, but from without-the y are managed by the bulkof the people of .Australia, who are not employed in them, and who appoint, not political managers, but commercial managers-managers for the commercial and trading concerns, such as the railways or the Post Office. It will be a different matter altogether when all industries become one vast Commonwealth department, and when the management must be entirely from within. Under such circumstances, the position taken up by the honourable member for South Sydney, that, however many industries are nationalized, we shall still continue to pay according to the work done, absolutely breaks down. When all industries are one vast Commonwealth department, men will not be elected to Parliament unless they agree to remove, gradually at any rate, the differences between high salaries and low salaries, and in the end, in my opinion nationalization must be communism.",38
323,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The honourable member takes rather a low view of human nature.,39
324,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I am of those taking a very natural view of human national institution. nature.,39
325,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Surely a public conber science will have arisen in the meantime to prevent a result like that suggested by the honourable member.,39
326,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There is places, no occasion for any conscience. It is very hard to convince men that they are not worth as .much as other men to whom superior appointments and superior pay are given.  honourable member to mean that a messentions ger in the telegraph office will be paid the themselves. same salary as is the head of the Department?",39
327,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am not saying that at all- I am not individualhonorable izing cases ; but I ' do say the tendency be to bring the remuneration as nearly possible to one level, and eventually one level.",39
328,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member is right, surely that tendency should be shown now?",39
329,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I have some already explained that the nationalization of industries to any large degree is supported by the people of Australia, are in favour of individualism, and of dividual effort being rewarded according to merit. At present the management of the nationalized industries is from the side.",39
330,Mr CARR,Unknown,And always will be.,39
331,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"How can portance, if always be so if everybody is brought within and employed in one vast State partment ?",39
332,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The people will not be all in one Department.,39
333,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The people will all be in one great Department, though not in one branch; and the condition of affairs will be very different from what it is today.",39
334,Mr CARR,Unknown,The State Departments might be managed by deputy.,39
335,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Quite so; but who would be appointed as managers if they did not promise to do what was desired by those within the Department? If it is impossible to properly manage our railways by the votes of those within the Department, so it will be impossible to effectively manage the industries of the Commonwealth by the votes within if they are made one great",39
336,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The honourable memassumes that the people ""is an as.""",39
337,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not assume anything of the sort. I only assume that what has taken place in other amongst intelligent peoples, will take place in our own case-that the drift - will be from nationalization of industries on the basis of reward according to assumed merit to nationalization on the basis of communism.",39
338,Mr CARR,Unknown,The honourable member questhe ability of the people to govern,39
339,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Unde r such circumstances as I sketched the people would govern themselves; and that would be the result. However, I cannot expect members in the Labour corner will to agree with me, and I think I shall now as turn my attention to the contract itself. to I merely desired to explain what I do not seem to have made clear previously. I do not. propose to deal at any length \vith the contract; the honourable member for Parramatta and others have already devoted time to it. As to the amount of the subsidy, I admit that it is a considerable not increase on any we have recently paid. who The only justification for the payment of in this amount is that we have asked for certain services and demanded certain conditions, and that, after presenting an opoutportunity to the world to tender, no lower or as low a tender has been received. Consequently, if theconditions are of imas' most honourable members seem to think they are, we have adopted the Deonly method to test at what rate the shipping companies are prepared to provide the service. This being the lowest tender, I am willing to accept it , though, as I say, it represents a very considerable increase on what we previously paid to the same company, and what the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company are supposed to be receiving, though not for exactly the same service, or under the same conditions. There are one or two matters in connection with the contract which deserve some consideration. First, there is the looseness of the provision regarding the calling of the boats at Hobart. There is the other peculiarity, that, during the negotiations for this contract, the Minister of Agriculture for one of the States was in consultation. Perhaps the ter of Trade and Customs can inform me whether there was any consultation with the representatives of any of the other States.",39
340,Mr MATJGER,Unknown,"I think not; but the in terests for which the Minister referred was working, were interests pertaining cl 11 ttl6 S tltCS",40
341,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I think that it is desirable, when there is consultation with one State, that there should be concause sultation with all.",40
342,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"There was no consultavoured tion ; there were certain representations urged, by the State Minister in the inAustralian terests of producers and exporters.",40
343,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,He was not called in.,40
344,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Bu the in was admitted to consultation.,40
345,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"He was allowed to make certain representations. It depends what the honourable member means by sultation.""",40
346,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"He was The in consultation; and he may have assisted very materially in the framing of the tract. In dealing with a subject like the conveyance of produce, and especially the conveyance of perishable produce, is consultation with one Stare representative there should be consultation with the representatives of the others. There are one or two. things in the proposed contract which might, perhaps, have been tiation in freights. different had there been such consultacharges tion;-for instance, the vagueness of the provision relating to the calling of the steamers, at Hobart, and the provision A against .differentiation of .freights, which I ports. think, will operate unjustly to one or more ports. I am opposed to unreasonable improper differentiation;. but the shippers port. from a port which vessels can enter and leave cheaply, and at the wharfs of which they can discharge and load cheaply, or which has other natural advantages, ought not to be made to pay for the higher charges incurred or for the fewer advantages in other ports. Rates of freight, if there is to be equality, should be in; proportion to the cost to which vessels are put in connection with the ports to which they trade.",40
347,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,At the present time the freight to Fremantle is higher than that to Svdnev.,40
348,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not say that that is right. But where a shipMinisping company has to make a larger outlay or has less advantage in respect to one port than in respect to another, it is not just to insist that there shall be no differentiation of freights.",40
349,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Does not the honourable to member think that the freight to Fremantle to should be less instead of more ?,40
350,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I agree in this contract it should not be more. I do not allude to this matter merely bei t concerns Sydney-honorabl e members will admit that I have always endeato be fair to all the States. I have at copy of the freight rates of the Germanline, which I propose to quote, because this is the only list that I have beenable to get in print, though similar differences to those I am about to disclose exist the freights of other lines. The freight from Europe to Fremantle is 47s. 6d., to Port Adelaide 42s. 6d., to the Semaphore on 40s., to Melbourne 42s. 6d., and to Sydney ""con40s. There is no apparent reason why Fremantle should pay so high a freight. Sydney freight is low because of the Iowness of the port dues there, and beconcause of certain freight facilities.",40
351,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,There is no local disability at Fremantle to justify the charging if there of high freights to that port.,40
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Where there are no local charges or advantages making one port less costly to a company than. another, there should not be differenBut where local or circumstances make some port particularly costly, it is not fair that that mail port should get an advantage by being treated on the same terms as all other",40
353,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If an advantage is to be : and given, it should be given to. the nearest",40
354,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I admit that Fremantle has that advantage over other Australian ports, that it is nearer to Europe, and that that fact is not considered in the fixing of the freights; but possibly the fact that shipments to other ports are larger may enable the companies to charge less to those ports. There is the proviso that lighterage shall not be taken into account in connection with the provision that there shall be no differentiation ih freights, and I think that port charges, too, should be excepted. Where port and other charges are very heavy, shippers from other ports should not, under a system of non-differentiation, be made to pay for them. I think that an amendment should be moved dealing with this matter. Explanations will also be needed as to the effect of the provisions relating to passage freights from port to port in Australian waters, and as to the period for which vessels may remain in the various ports. Brisbane is to be considered the port from which the voyage to England will commence. I have no objection to the steamers visiting Brisbane, though, had this been merely a mail contract, I should have objected to any stipulation requiring them to visit other ports than Adelaide and Brindisi. But as this is not a mail contract, I have no objection to urge against the provision which makes Brisbane a port of call. Seeing, however, that Brisbane is taken as the starting point of each voyage, and that it is provided that after a voyage has commenced there shall be no delay, steamers may be prevented from remaining in Sydney as tliey have done hitherto, which, in my opinion, is not a desirable provision, unless it can be shown that it is necessary to enforce it in the interests of the other ports.",41
355,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member says that this is more than a mail contract.,41
356,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Yes .,41
357,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Then we are entering dangerous ground.,41
358,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We are entering into all sorts of difficulties in providing for more than the carriage of mails, though I am not going to object to course which is now being taken. when other mail contracts come under conCanal route. sideration, the point will probably be made that terms similar to those insisted this must be inserted, and that the vessels performing the service must call at every port in Australia right round to",41
359,Mr WILKS,Unknown,This is more than the halfway house to nationalization.,41
360,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not say that. There are dangers in regard to the fixing of freights.,41
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Merel y a maximum is fixed.,41
362,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,Unknown,"Yes; but there will be an attempt to make the maximum a minimum. At the present time we have the extraordinary spectacle of negotiations with a view to getting steamship companies tp raise the butter freights by 2d. per box, with the object of throwing"" all the business into the hands of one great combination. Yet we hear complaints about, combination. In some directions too much has been attempted by the contract. It may be well enough to arrange for the shipment of goods by vessels of a certain size, and affording certain cool storage accommodation, and to requiile that the journey shall be performed at certain rates of speed, and that preference shall not be given to any State. But when it is attempted to fix maximum freights, and to get other companies to come in so that, those freights may be observed generally, and other conditions are introduced, you get on dangerous ground, and may find it troublesome to insist on the complete observance of the terms of the contract. Although the subsidy provided for is higher than has previously been paid, conditions have been insisted on which make a higher subsidy necessary. I prefer' the contract to a State service, which would force us to experiment on lines in regard to which we have had no experience, and to undertake an enterprise which I think we could not manage as effectively as a private concern could be managed. One of the great reasons given for establishing a Commonwealth service is that it would give greater opportunities for encouraging immigration; but while we have been talking, the Orient Steam Navigation Company on has done a great deal more for immigration than has been done by all the Governments of Australia.",41
363,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Would it not be better to the have immigrants brought round by the. Still, Cape? That is a cheaper route than the",41
364,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Seeing on in that certain steamers must come through the Canal in any case, I do not know that it is any more expensive to bring immigrants Fremantle. that way than round the Cape.",41
365,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The inference to be drawn from the honourable member's remarks is that the motive of the Orient Steam Navigation Company in promoting immigration has been the welfare of Australia.,42
366,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Of course, what they have done has been done for their own advantage, and one reason why I favour individualistic enterprise is that the motive of personal interest induces greater effort. The Orient Steam Navigation Company has not madea great deal of profit from its Australian trade; but, of course, the ob.ject of its existence is to make profits. I would not give a great deal for the chances of profit in the present undertaking. That is the look-out of those engaged in it. Difficulties will arise because the contract has been made too minute in its particulars; but I am willing to accept it as the best the Government can do, reserving anything else I have to say until we come to discuss the clauses in detail.",42
367,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [2.58] This seems a very good contract for the Orient Steam Navigation Company. I think it rather unwise for us to bind ourselves for practically twelve years - becaus e although this contract is for ten years only, it and an interim contract engage Fhe Commonwealth until the beginning of 1920. It contains^ provisions fixing'maximum rates of freight for the carriage of butter and other commodities. But no one knows what the scientific achievements of the next five or six or ten years will be. New methods may be invented for the conveyance of perishable produce which will make quite unreasonable rates which today seem reasonable.",42
368,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The rates for' the carriage of fruit have been reduced by one-half during the last fifteen years.,42
369,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes . Therefore I am disinclined to bind the people of Australia to pay certain rates of freight for si period of twelve years. I see no reason why, in making a postal contract, we should not arrange for the carriage of produce at reasonable rates; but it should be empha-. sized that many of those who cry out against Socialism, and pose as anti-Socialists of the purest tvpe, are desirous of securing assistance from the Government to get cheap freights for butter, fruit, meat, and other products of Australia.",42
370,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,At the cost of whole community !,42
371,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Quite so. This contract appeals to me in a large measure as a bonus on the export of butter. From a postal stand-point there is no need whatever to subsidize the Orient Steam Navigation Company^ to do more than to deliver the mails from England at Adelaide, and to take delivery, at the same port, of the Australian mails for England. . Mr BATCHELOR - They do not carry the mails beyond Adelaide.",42
372,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They carry postal parcels beyond that port. It would conduce to a better understanding if the Postal Department made a contract providing only for the conveyance of mails, whilst the Department charged with the overlooking of exports simultaneously entered into a contract for the carriage of exportable products. We should then know exactly where we stood. The people would be able to appreciate what proportion of this very large expenditure was to be debited to a purely mail service and what proportion of it represented the encouragement of exports.",42
373,Mr WILKS,Unknown,We should have separate accounts.,42
374,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I think so. I have absolutely no objection to the encouragement of exports under favourable conditions, but I think that we ought to be able to point to the exact cost of, or the degree of encouragement that is given to, the export of any particular commodity. The Postal Department should not be asked to bear the loss represented by the proportion of subsidy paid for the carriage of perishable produce. I trust that, even at this stage, an attempt will be made by the Postmaster-General in the interests of his own Department to discover what payment ought to be made in respect of the postal services rendered by the company, and what proportion of the subsidy should be debited to the Department charged with the work of overseeing the export of butter and other perishable products.",42
375,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Department ought not to have to pay more than £60,ooo' per annum for the postal services.",42
376,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That is one aspect of the matter to which attention should be devoted. The honourable member for Parramatta, in discussing the terms of this contract, said that, although it involved an increased expenditure-and as a the matter of fact, after making all allowances, it involves nearly double what we had to pay a little while ago for a similar service-w e should remember that the. contract entailed a large increase of expenditure on the part of the Orient Steam Navigation Company. He should recollect that the company was faced with two alternatives; it had either to go out of the Australian trade or to build new steamers to keep in line with the other companies running high-class vessels in the trade.",42
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I meant that to apply in both ways. This contract takes from the company certain privileges which it has enjoyed. The stipulations as to freight and other matters will diminish its earnings.,43
378,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It is evident that it would be mast unfair to debit the Commonwealth, as I understood the honourable member to suggest, with the whole of the expenditure, which the Orient Steam Navigation Company proposes to incur in connection with the construction of new steamers. In any case such an expenditure would have been necessitated by the requirements of the trade and by the keenness of competition, so far as equipment and accommodation are concerned. seems to me, therefore, that this expenditure on the part of the company would have been inevitable, even if a new contract had not been entered into. The representatives of the company have practically admitted that the majority of their vessels are behind the times.",43
379,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They have admitted that if all their vessels were up to the standard of the Orontes, they would be able to make the line pay.",43
380,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They have a number of steamers that are reasonably good, but most of the vessels of their fleet are as the lives of mail steam-ships go, comparatively old, and their accommodation is not nearly equal to that provided by other lines. On these grounds, I do not think that the contract represents the best that could be done for the Commonwealth, even assuming that we must rely on private enterprise to provide the service. Coming to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier, I may say at once that I was one of those who a little time ago voted against a similar amendment. I did so upon grounds which at the time seemed to me to-be absolutely adequate. We had then been offered a contract that was much cheaper than is the present one, and promised at least all the facilities provided for in this agreement.",43
381,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"On paper, it was a far better contract.",43
382,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Ver y much better. As to the suggestion of the Opposition that the Laing contract never had any substantial backing, we ought to remember that as soon as the names of the firms concerned in that contract were announced, honourable members of that party absolutely withdrew their opposition to the contract.",43
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is absolutely incorrect.,43
384,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is absolutely correct.,43
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is not; the honourable member has no right to make such,43
386,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I should like the honourable member to point to one statement in Hansard showing that the Opposition protested against the contract after the announcement that Vickars, Son, and Maxim, Sir James Laing and Company, and others were parties to it.",43
387,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I said that those firms were not behind it. In reply to the Prime Minister, I stated that all lt that was behind the contract was the bond °f £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 .",43
388,Mr KNOX,Unknown,We had an assurance that those firms would carry the proposalthrough.,43
389,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"And on that assurance, the contract appeared to be a very favourable one. Whether the Government took adequate steps to insure that they would be penalized for failure to carry out the contract, is another matter; but, on the face of it, the agreement was a very fair one. We have also to remember that a combination of shipping companies engaged in the carriage of perishable products had not at that time been brought about. Those shipping companies had not combined in order to force the producers of Australia to come to their terms, so that the circumstances were very different from those that have since arisen. To-day, we find that the Orient Steam Navigation Company, notwithstanding the philanthropy that has been so freely attributed to it, has shown itself willing to join in a combination to fleece the exporters of Australia- a combination to exact from them unfair freights for the carriage of perishable products.",43
390,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,Is not that the privilege of private enterprise?,43
391,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That is a point ^yith which I intend to deal later on. The Orient Steam Navigation Company, which has so many friends in this Chamber, and has had passed upon it so many encomiums in respect of the good services that it has rendered to Australia, has shown itself willing to cast aside any consideration for the producers, the farmers and others concerned in theexport of perishable products from this continent. It has demonstrated, during the last few months, its willingness to join in a combine to fleece exporters of another £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 per year in respect of freights.",43
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,But was it unfair for such an arrangement to be made?,44
393,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If we are looking for excuses for such a proceeding, it is easy to find them.",44
394,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The representatives of the company said that before that arrangement was made the business was unprofitable.,44
395,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"It is very difficult for us to estimate what would pay them; but a significant fact is that another set of shipping people were willing to carrv our butter at a very much reduced freight. The Five Lines Combine, to which the Orient Steam Navigation Company belonged, decided to penalize the butter producers of Australia to the extent of is. 8d. per box, unless they were given the carriage of the whole of their exportable produce. All these considerations demonstrate that the Australian producers are at the mercy of a ring, or combination, or monopoly, so far as perishable products are concerned. One cannot help being amused at the attitude assumed by the honourable member for Parramatta in this regard. He told us this morning that his strongest objection to the extension of State enterprise was that it would subject our people to compulsion and tyranny. I do not know whether it is' because he has been, overwhelmed by the talk upon the Tariff, and is consequently unable to judge things with his accustomed clearness, but he seems to be absolutely blind to the compulsion and tyranny that has been exercised by private syndicates and companies.",44
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I can assure the strong. honourable member that I am not blind to it.,44
397,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Then why was the honourable member, when he alluded td the compulsion and tyranny which follow the extension of State' enterprise in this direction, absolutely silent upon the compulsion and tyranny under which our producers suffer today by reason of the exactions of the shipping ring' both around the Australian coast and oversea?",44
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What I did say was that I feared we should escape from the troubles that we had, only to experience greater troubles.",44
399,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member may have intended to say that, but I certainly did not hear him say it. I heard no denunciation from him of the compulsion and tyranny with which our producers are confronted today. Under private enterprise, which the honourable member is pledged to uphold, they are subjected to compulsion and tyranny, and yet we hear no protest from the honourable member's side of the House.",44
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The argument of the honourable member for Barrier was that outside persons were under duress and compulsion, and I merely attempted to show that similar conditions operated in our State Departments as well.",44
401,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The imposition of a penalty of is. 8d. per box upon butter exporters who did not ship all their butter by the five-line combination wais an attempt to exercise compulsion and tyranny. Further, the honourable member should know that it is impossible for a shipper who desires to send goods around the coast of Australia to escape from the compulsion and tyranny of the local shipping ring even if lower freights are offered to him. He is bound hand alnd foot to the shipping combination. If another exponent of private enterprise were to say to him, "" I will give you a reduction of 50 per cent, in the freight which obtains today,"" he could not take advantage of the offer,simply because of the system of rebates, which places every merchant in the hands of the shipping ring. The honourable member for Parramatta has said that there are a multitude of steam-ships, and that consequently there can be no monopoly of the ocean. How childlike the honourable member must be if he really believes that.",44
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Childlik e and bland. The honourable member is very,44
403,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member must be childlike if he believes that no monopoly of the ocean is possible. Theoretically, the ocean is open to all who care to sail upon it , but, in reality, if a new line of steamers start operations, and is prepared to charge less freights than those charged by the shipping ring, all the resources of the ring are invoked for the .purpose of freezing it out. Such tactics have been successful, notably in the case the Aberdeen line. For a considerable time that line admitted that they dared not take cargo to Brisbane from the Old Country, although their ships were under contract with the Queensland vernment to load butter at that port. Notwithstanding this, however, they had to involved. discharge any cargo intended for Brisbane - at Sydney, and take their vessels on to for Brisbane empty., It will thus be seen the honourable member is entirely mistaken the nationalization of industries. when he affirms that there can be poly of the ocean:",44

The ring of shipping people who deal with Australian freights is to-dav at once both the wonder and the envy of persons engaged in shipping in other parts of the world. In the Ship-ping Journal persons who deal in freights elsewhere have marvelled that the oversea Australian ring has been able for so many years to 'maintain such a close corporation, and keep freights at such a very high level. own merits. This is a matter of common knowledge amongst those who are engaged in shipthe circumstances. ping. In view of the evidence given ""Walker Brothers, of Maryborough, rethe garding the treatment meted out to them when they attempted to send freights around the Australian coast, I say that to pretend that there is no monopoly of the 'ocean possible is to flv in cepted facts-^facts which should be recognised by - legislators, as well as by people generally.",45

But the honourable member seems to assume that, when once a monopoly, has been set up, it continue for all time, whereas the ence of the world proves the contrary.",45

The question, which faces 'us is wliether we are going to relieve ourfrom another. selves, or whether we are to depend upon of posterity to extricate itself from the difficult position in which it will be placed.

408,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But the honourable meinber for Parramatta gave a list shipping of nationalization proposals.,45
409,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Just so, and each parto ticular proposal would have to rest on its It would have to be determined whether it was justified or not by But I do not remember by that the honourable member for Wide Bay, leader of the Labour Party, expressed any sentiments such as those attributed to him by the honourable member for Parramatta. 1 Mr. JOSEPH COOK.:- I read from Hanthe face of acsard what he said.",45

415,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Oh„ - quite. The party is pledged to the nationalization of monopolies, but any individual member of the party may propose to go further than the nationalization of monopolies if he so desires, and if he believes that it is a proper thing to do; just as the honourable member for Parramatta, though he is pledged to the programme of lids leader, is not precluded from going beyond that programme in any direction he thinks fit. He is entitled to have his own opinion as to the desirableness of taking action in any given direction, so long as he agrees with his leader and with the rest of his party upon theprogramme which they have formulated.",46
416,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,We have absolute freedom outside our programme. .,46
417,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Quite so, but I never heard the honourable member for Wide Bay express any opinion involving nationalization beyond that embodied in the party's programme. Being in a responsible position, he would not be entitled to do so except he prefaced his remarks by saying that he was merely expressing his own view. But to the nationalization of monopolies there is no doubt that the Labour Party are bound in the most emphatic fashion - We believe, Mr Speaker, that the existence of these industrial monopolies is inimical to the interests of the general community, and that it is only by their nationalization-by their being governed ancl controlled and worked on behalf of the community generally-that you can relieve the people from the incubus that at present sits upon them. That is the view which I hold. But beyond that",46
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is no of monopolies in the passage which I read from the speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay.,46
419,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member, so far as my memory goes, did not indicate that he meant anything beyond monodays. polies. He said that the party was not a fraid of nationalization; but to pretend believe that that meant the nationalization of everything is a deliberate twisting words-nothin g more nor less. The mark was made in reply to an inquiry from the other side- "" If we nationalize in this particular instance, where are we going to stop?"" and other silly questions ments. . of that sort. It might as well be said that we should starve ourselves the danger of one or two over-eating.",46

422,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,So we are.,46
423,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"And to set rid of the Government tramways. I am glad to hear the honourable member for Moreton say that they want to sell the Government railways. I did not know that the honourable member for Parkes had a supporter on the Opposition side. As the only logical and consistent anti-Socialist in Parliament, I have always entertained a certain degree ot admiration for him; and to find at this late hour that he has support from the honourable member for Moreton-wh o the other day was invoking afl the forces of Socialism on behalf of the hutter producersis rather amusing. The honourable member has evinced in another direction-the Tariff - that his views on protection are of a geographical character. Similarly we find in regard to his anti-Socialism that he is apparently bounded by the limits of his .own electorate. Whatever his electors desire should be done even if it means Socialism.",46

427,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does the honourable of member agree with his leader's statement rethat he has ""too long shrunk"" from expressing certain opinions? ",46
428,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do not know that that justifies the honourable member's state,46

430,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am quite prepared to inaccept any criticism that ""the honourable member for Parramatta, or the honourable member for Wide Bay may pass upon me. I do not profess to be perfect any more than is any other member of the community. But I should l i k e to see any quotation which bears out the statement that the honourable member for Wide Bav a couple of nights ago expressed approval of the general nationalization of the means of production^ distribution, and exchange. Those words were used by the honourable member for Parramatta, but I have no recollection of any such thing being said.",46

The honourable ought to remember^, as it is less than twelve months since it occurred, that the whole reason for the existence of his party, as expressed by its leader, was that they were going to combat Socialism, to prevent insidious extensions of governmental functions, and that, after a pathetic appeal .to the electors, they were defeated by an overwhelming majority. We are in this position: that the people have declared against anti-Socialism, and have not been asked to declare for complete Socialism. Therefore we have had no answer from them on the latter head, either one way or the other. I hold that by their defeat of the party led by the honourable member for East Sydney, the people have indicated that they have no objection to reasonable extensions of governmental functions.",47
442,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member forgets that they sent in more holders of the opposite view.,47
443,Mr WATSON,Unknown,On that question the electors returned a minority of anti-Socialists to this House and to the Senate.,47
444,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,No . The Government declared against nationalization.,47
445,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If I remember aright the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat, the Government declared that they would hold themselves free to take anv steps towards a reasonable extension of governmental functions, and would nationalize wherever it was necessary, and that after all is a common-sense view. But the members of the Opposition Party, through their leader, declared that they were going to strike Socialism out of the political arena. So far as they are concerned, Socialism seems to have escaped scotching, and on that subject they are in a minority here, as well as in another place. If I interpret aright the attitude of the people it is that we should continue on the lines hitherto adopted in Australia so far as principles are concerned, that if the nationalization of a particular industry or function is justified by the circumstances, it I re- should be done at once.",47
446,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It depends upon people what is called nationalization.,47

At the same time, he has proved himself to be quite as good a Socialist in some respects as has any ber of the Labour Party.

466,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I do not think that any other term can be appliedto the exactions of some of the rings that now exist.

468,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am aware of that; but the price of coal in Western Australia.

"" Personally; I have no objection to 'the mine-owners getting a fair price for their"" coal at Newcastle ; ""but when they insure, that only threeor four companies shall be able to get coal there at any price they are combining to rob the consumers.",48
470,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The honourable member does not think that I have any sympathy with that sort of thing, surely?",49
471,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman is typical of a great number of other honourable members. He disclaims sympathy with tactics of that sort, and one must at once give him credit for being honest in his statement.",49

473,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Jus t so. But surely there is a happy mean in these cases.,49
474,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We must try to control them first.,49
475,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"For the right honourable gentleman merely to state that he has no sympathy with that practice does not advance matters one iota. The evil effect upon the consumer still continues. If the right honourable gentleman can prove that successful efforts can be made in the in terests of the consumers to control these monopolies, he will have achieved a very great deal. But I contend that nothing short of nationalization of the shipping allow the people of certain States to get their coal at reasonable prices.",49
476,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Would the honorNor able member have every ship trading the coast to belong to the State?,49

I am afraid that this debate has gone considerably beyond the mere question of a oiail contract; but I think that the Commonwealth will run no mabusiness terial risk in establishing a line of steamers between Australia and the C*ld Country. That line would not be. able by any means to convey all the perishHouse, able produce sent abroad, but by means of it the Government would be able which to exercise a restraining influence upon freights charged upon produce genethat rally. That is the most that such now, a. line could expect to do. While the Go the vernment line charged a reasonable freight, there would be much less likelihood o private companies being able successfully to combine in order to exact unfair freights from the exporters. Even if some direct loss were shown, the indirect benefits accruing from reductions of freights ought to be more than sufficient to compensate the people of Australia for the venture upon which we ask them to enter. Mr. JOSEPH COOK . ^ I wish to explain that, when I referred in my speech to the statement of the honourable member for Bay, I quoted his own words-and I said then that that was the extent of my allegations concerning him-as followWhether it be popular or not, it would be cowardly for the man who believes that nationalization is a proper principle not to express his views in this House.

There .vill could be no doubt as to that honourable member's position, I said, in view of his platform utterances at the recent elections. can there be any such doubt, for the on honourable member himself will not deny that upon the platform he did say that he an out-and-out Socialist in every way.",49
480,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That does not bind the,49
481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I never said that it,49
482,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [3.46I - Instea d of being confined to the consideration of contract, the debate, in view of the amendment proposed by the honourable shipmember for Barrier, has been allowed to d r if t into a general consideration of outside questions. That, on the whole, is regrettable, because we have before us a specific proposal, which deserves practical mail consideration from honourable members on its own merits. When the Prime Minister announced the terms of the contract to the I tendered to him my congratulations for having made an arrangement will put an end to much of the hesitation, doubt, and derangement of business has existed for so long. I can say on behalf of many mercantile men in community, that there is great satisfaction that the Government have ' concluded f this contract. I share the view expressed by a. previous speaker that it 'would be an advantage to ascertain what proportion of the total sum of £170,000 is applicable purely to the services of the Postal Department, and what to the extra freight conditions introduced. The Minister might promise to obtain the information for the benefit of honourable members. In view of the desire to have the contract settled, it would be wise at this stage to avoid any amendments on the floor of the House, seeing that the whole of the details have been the subject of serious consideration by all the parties to the contract, in consultation with their solicitors, and that it would be imprudent to dislocate any one portion of it. But for that consideration I should have asked the House to accept an amendment to provide that, consequential upon the agreement being adopted, an accelerated service for the interim period should be required. On public grounds, I do not think that it would have been asking very much from the contractors or from the Government to consent to that provision, inasmuch as it is admitted that two of the steamers are quite competent to shorten the time at present occupied in the transit of the mails. I do not see any substantial reason why there should not be some improvement in the service every fortnight during the interim period. I know that many honourable members share that view, but it is not desirable to delay the conclusion of this contract. I am disposed to believe that a proposal to the end I have indicated would receive a large support. There ought, at least, to be an undertaking that the steamers will arrive at Largs Bay in sufficient time every Monday to allow the mails to be conveyed by the overland express on that day. These are practical suggestions which I do not think ask too much, even jf the contract has been substantially approved. I hope it is part of the understanding that we shall have the advantage of the rapid service via Brindisi, in view of the fact that the mail service has been' practically arranged for the next twelve years. The two points I have raised I commend to the earnest consideration of the Minister, because they represent practical necessities, for which some provision should be made in the contract. Snecial significance has been given to the. fact that the mail steamers will fly the Australian flag. I hope that the Australian flag will always receive due recognition ; but I point out. that when the vessels, in coming through the - Suez Sir. Knox. Ganal, mix with the vessels of all nations of the world, an impression may be conveyed that Australia is a separated entity in the Empire. The British Union Jack is quite sufficient for me, and I think it ought to be sufficient on the mail steamers. If those steamers were conveying exclusively our own people or our own produce, or if they were owned by Australia, then there might be something in the claim that the Australian flag should appear at the masthead. But these conditions do not prevail, and at Colombo, where fresh passengers and new mails are taken on board, the flying of the Australian flag may convey an erroneous impression. While I have no desire to say anything that might be construed into disrespect for the Australian flag, I think that this is one of the clauses which might have been left out of the contract. We are informed, it is true, that the flying of the Australian flag is at the instance of the contractors; but, nevertheless, I regard this condition in the agreement as somewhat unnecessary.",49
483,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The Australian flag has the Union Jack in the Conner.,50
484,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"That is so; but, at the. same time, I do not think that it is worthwhile making the flying of the Australian flag a stipulation in the contract. I very much regret that the whole question of Socialism should have been introduced into this debate, though, perhaps, the discussion of the contract from that point of view was inevitable. I find from the SJiipfing World Year-Book for last year that the number of vessels entered from British possessions and foreign countries to the United Kingdom was 66,840, carrying 55,623,974 tons, and that the number of vessels cleared to British possessions and foreign countries from the United Kingdom was 65,880, carrying 56,416,700 tons. The imports into Great Britain from British possessions and foreign countries were valued at £565,019,917, and the exports at £407,596,527. In the case of Australia there are 703 vessels which go to and from Great Britain, carrying 1,830,000 tons. This mail contract, large as it may bulk in our eyes, is unimportant when we consider the great volume of trade of the Motherland. On the question of Socialism, the honourable member for Bar-, rier last night made use of an expression which I regard as absolutely unworthy of him, or the party he represents. The honourable member made the statement that the Chambers of Commerce would sell Jesus Christ for thirty pieces of When challenged this morning, the honourable member was given an opportunity to explain that statement away, and as he did not do so, I am justified in believing that it was not made inadvertently in the heat of debate, but as the result of deliberate thought and consideration. characterize the statement as an outrageous slander. Regarded as the outcome of the honourable member's personal ignorance, the statement will perhaps have a degree of importance attached to it which it would not deserve, but the honourable member was speaking as an exponent of the views of the party to which he belongs. We are told that we should not generalize from isolated instances as to the attitude of the Labour Party on any question, but the particular utterance to which I refer, if it does not disclose ignorance of the facts on the part of the honourable member who was guilty of it, discloses the most venemous spirit which it would be possible for any man to attribute to a great party like the Labour Party. The particular class of persons to whom the honourable member referred represent the large interests of those to whom the members of the Labour Party are opposed as faithfully as Labour members can claim to represent the interests of any other class in the community. The utterance to which I take exception comes with the. worse possible grace from an honourable member who not infrequently ascends the pulpit to urge the precept of his Redeemer that there should be peace and good will in this world.",50
485,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,This is too thin altogether.,51
486,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"It is more like the kind of utterance we should expect to come from the crowd who cried, ""Give us Barabbas,"" At that historic referendumwhich by the way is a principle which the honourable member for Barrier strongly supports-the popular voice did not find expression as the result of experience and thoughtful consideration on the part of those who said ""Give us Barabbas."" We have to consider the spirit which lies behind the honourable member's statement that the 'Chambers of Commerce would sell Jesus Christ for thirty pieces of silver.",51
487,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I said "" a Christ.""",51
488,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The only possible excuse would be that it was out of - his ignorance that the honourable member had spoken. I our platform. silver. ask whether honourable members in the Labour corner imagine for a moment that, they are the only exemplars of all that is good and righteous. It has been my fortune to come in contact with members of the party to which the honourable member belongs who have been men of depraved I habits and tastes, and actuated by extreme selfishness. I have known workers who, when they became possessed of means, proved themselves to be the hardest of taskmasters. Should we be justified because of the character and conduct of such men in condemning the whole of the aspirations of the Labour Party? There are members of that party in this House whose honesty of purpose I have not hesitated to acknowledge.",51
489,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. I ask whether the honourable member is discussing the mail contract?,51
490,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is quite in order. He is replying to a statement made by the honourable member for Barrier.,51
491,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"If I am out of order, much of the previous debate on the motion has not been in order. I recognise the ability of the honourable member for Barrier. The great industry he has displayed in familiarizing himself with the details of this matter, and in obtaining a grasp of the subject, has earned the respect of honourable members generally. The honourable member will probably regard it as a distinction when I say that he was the first who, on the floor of this House, claimed that the members of the Labour Party were Socialists. In answer to myself, the honourable member made the admission in the first Parliament during the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He can claim to have made the first public admission in this House that honourable members in the Labour corner are Socialists. Mr - THOMAS - If that is so, I am very proud of it.",51
492,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,What is the honourable member's definition of Socialism?,51
493,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"My feeling is that honourable members in the Labour corner who are advocating Socialism are floundering along from one session to another, groping their way in a vain effort to discover what Socialism really means, and fearful of giving public expression to their real views, on the subject.",51
494,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We have put them in,51
495,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Honourable members have modified their platform when they have found public opinion against them. Do they accept the programme of the Social Democratic Federation?,52
496,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No , we follow own programme.",52
497,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I believe' there is no extreme of Socialism to which the honourable member for Barrier is not prepared to go, except that which might lead to the depletion of the contents of his own pockets. One of the planks of the socialistic platform is the abolition of monarchy.",52
498,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Terrible !,52
499,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I say it would be terrible, though we may attach no greater importance to the monarch as a monarch than that arising from the fact that he represents the apex of our constitutional system.",52

502,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"If I were to permit the honourable member to follow his present line of argument, I should have to allow other honourable members also to discuss the general question of Socialism instead of the mail contract which is immediately before us. „",52
503,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"On a point of order, sir, I should like to know whether the honourable member will not be in order in discussing the question of Socialism as affecting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier?",52
504,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The amendment simply provides that the Government should acquire and control a line of mail steamers.,52
505,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does not that involve the question of Socialism?,52
506,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I am not here to define what is and what is not cialism.,52
507,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"If the debate had not been allowed to drift towards the question of Socialism, there would Tiave been no occasion for me to refer to the matter, since I think that the amendment is a counter business proposition. I should not have touched upon the question of Socialism but for the remarks made by the honourable member for Barrier, remarks which I am sure he will, upon reflection, regret. I should have been wanting in my duty had I not, on behalf of the Federated Chamour bers of Commerce, of which I have been President for three years, resented the suggestion that he made. No body of men is . perfect, but it is wrong to suggest that the Chambers of Commerce have any disrespect for religion and are devoid of honourable and charitable instincts. Many of their members have thrown themselves into the work of endeavouring to improve the industrial conditions of Australia. It is a misfortune that the words to which I have referred should have fallen from the lips of an honourable member of this House, speaking either on behalf of his party or as an individual member of it. The incident is all the more regrettable since I arn certain the honourable member himself desires' to lead an exemplary life, and I conclude that his remarks were due either to absolute unblushing ignorance, or to venom and a feeling of antagonism .towards these bodies, the display of which' on the part of any honourable member is most regrettable. Honourable members of the Labour Party arrogate to themselves the right to act as sole custodians of the interests of the workers. In that respect, they do an injustice to honourable members sitting, not only on this side of the House, but_ behind the Government, whose desire is that the interests of all classes shall be considered. My own life has been spent in an effort to assist my fellow man, and in a direction altogether different from that which the honourable member for Barrier, in words that should not appear on the records of the House, has indicated. I deeply regret that the honourable member should have been guilty of such an exhibition of venom and irreverence.",52
508,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [4.18] I cannot join with the honourable member for Kooyong in congratulating the Government on what he described as "" the highly sucSo- cessful arrangement"" made by them for the carriage of our oversea mails. On the contrary, I think that we ought to condole with the Government in that they have been unable to conclude a more satisfactory contract. How can it be said that we should congratulate the Government on having entered into a contract for the car-, riage of our mails at an. increase of£92,000 per annum on .the subsidy.granted change my mind. under a former agreement? So far as the carriage of mails is concerned, the only additional advantage that we shall secure by this increased payment will be a saving of two days in the time occupied on the voyage. In no other respect is the contract superior, from a mail point of view, to the old one. I admit that it has some possible advantages in respect of the carriage perishable products; but viewed solely a mail contract it offers no advantages compared with that which will shortly pire. I have risen chiefly for the of explaining why I intend to vote for amendment, although on a previous occawas sion I voted against a similar proposition. The contract which was then before us apduty, peared to be very much more advantageous to the Commonwealth than does the prothe posed contract.",52
509,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,In what way was it more advantageous to the Commonwealth?,53
510,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It involved the payment of a subsidy of £50,000 less than does the new contract. It provided for an accelerated speed, and for the ment of larger ships than those which will be used under the new contract.",53
511,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"-""Unde r the old contract vessels of 12,000 tons were to be employed, whereas under the new one they are to be of 11,000 tons.",53
512,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"There is not a great deal of difference so far as the nage' is concerned. But the honourable member will recollect that five of the steamers to be employed under the prodown posed contract are named in the agreement, and that they fall very far short of 11,000 tons. The principal advantage that would have been conferred by the old contract was that it involved the payment of sidy of £50,000 less than does the new agreement. Surely that is an item which is worthy of our consideration. Upon last occasion I hesitated a great deal fore I decided to vote against the amendinto ment submitted by the honourable member for Barrier. But it did seem to me that - if the mail steamers were under Commonrived wealth control we should not have reaped any more advantages for a considerable time that we should have .enioyed i old contract had been carried out. ther, I thought that it would be soon enough to consider the .question .of tionalizing the steamers when that contract had nearly expired.. Since then events have transpired which have induced me One of the factors which have influenced me is the enormous expansion which has taken place in the formation of trusts all over the world, and particularly in so far as the ring which controls the oversea trade of Australia is concerned. To-day we know that there is a world-wide shipping combination in existence, and that the only means of preventof ing the producer from being victimized as is competition by a Government which canas not be drawn into the combination. exTo-day practically all commercial conpurpose cerns are being run by trusts and the combines. The period when anybody free to embark upon any enterprise if he chose to do so has gone by. It is our as representatives of the people, to see that the producers are not victimized as result of any arrangements into which we may enter. I am awire that there is a provision in the new contract under which we have power to cancel the agreement if the Orient Steam Navigation Company bring themselves within the scope of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. employThey are not likely to do that.",53
513,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,They have only to dodge it within the 3 miles' limit.,53
514,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"That is not a very difficult matter. The whole contract is hedged round with such an enormous number of conditions that it would be far tonbetter for us to undertake the responsibility of running a Commonwealth line of mail steamers. The Government have laid so many conditions-condition s relating to the time occupied by the vessels on the voyage, the freight rates to be charged, the temperature at which produce shall be carried, the amount of insulated space that a subshall be provided, and the labour which shall be employed-that they practically control the service, except that the agreethe ment is powerless to prevent the Orient beSteam Navigation Company from entering a combination to increase freights. Seeing that all these conditions are imposed, it seems to me that the time has arwhen we should undertake the carriage of our own mails, especiallv in view of the fact that we are being called upon f the to pay such an enormous subsidy as comFurpared with the old subsidy. I wish also to voice my objection to this new contract, naon the ground that it is something more than a mail contract. We have no right to deplete the' Commonwealth revenue to to the extent of scores of thousands of pounds in order to assist the revenues of the States - If any expenditure is incurred concluding arrangements for the carriage .of perishable products, that expenditure should be borne by the States. Certainly it should not come out of the Commonvernment, . wealth revenue. We are constantly piling up Commonwealth expenditure by performing work for the States for which we get no credit whatever. As a matter of fact, we get nothing but attacks from them, withstanding that we are constantly perconnexion forming at the expense of the postal revenue some service which the States themselves previously performed. I do not probe pose to enter into a debate upon the question of Socialism which has been raised. The discussion on that subject has been exceedingly interesting one from some points of view.",53
515,Mr WILKS,Unknown,We ought to set a session apart for its discussion.,54

518,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I saw it stated in a newspaper that the time for arrival Adelaide would be Saturday morning. The time is not mentioned in the contract, far as I know. But if any such arrangetime ment is made, it will be most unfair South Australia.",54
519,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honourable member tliink there is any necessity for the vessels to call at Adelaide at all?,54
520,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I have seen the Treasurer in a number of moods, role of joker does not suit him. The reason for calling at Adelaide is to enable the ber is mistaken. mails from Sydney and Melbourne to be despatched as early as possible. _",54

524,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I think it is a pity in that we have not a service from Vancouver for the carriage of English mails.,54
525,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I am addressing my remarks to a serious member of the Go the Postmaster-General, who is not in the habit of treating questions frivo- lously. I put it to him that he should avoid making the time of arrival Saturday morning or mid-day, because that would notmean additional cost to the Department in with an extra delivery in South Australia. I assume that if the mails arrive on Saturday morning they will not kept lying at the post-office until Mongeneral day. That would be ridiculous.",54

528,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [4.37] - Most of the criticism has turned upon the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier.

I may, - however, point out that, although the honourable so member occupied a considerable amount of in discussing the amendment, it is to quite evident, from speeches made by members of his party, that they recognise that there is no prospect of carrying it.",54

It is part of a general scheme of Socialism, in which the honourable for member for Barrier believes. In support of that statement, I will quote a few sentences from a leaflet which he distributed in amongst his electors only recently. I am quoting this to show that the honourable member's nationalization proposal in this particular is only a step in the direction of nationalizing all the means of production, distribution, and exchange.",54
531,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Quite right.,55

This of the first steps which they propose to in that direction. We have a direct con- £ nexion between this amendment in regard to the mail contract and the general socialnow ising scheme of the Labour Party as emextra bodied in their platform and as expounded by the honourable member for Barrier in an service, not for a mail service. electioneering pamphlet. I do not propose to take up more ' time in discussing the matter, nor do I intend to follow the orable member into all the highways byways of the more or less intricate and chimerical question of Socialism. perfectly satisfied that the time has not arrived' when the good sense of this country will consent to any disruption of the funare asked ' to pav nearly damental bases of society in that direction, so that we should not take the amendment too seriously.",55
535,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"If the amendhours' less time. ment were not Socialistic, would the' orable member support it?",55
536,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Of course I would not,' because it does not commend itself me on the ground of common sense. I am sure that if it were adopted we should not be able to carry it out to a satisfactory clusion.' The speech delivered by honourable member for Barrier last night has been addressed to the House on three occasions. The whole of last evening was him with the mere further repetition of an old speech. I venture to say that had I , or any a one else on this side of the House,, attempted to do anything of the kind, or to occupy a tenth of the time in that way, there would have been a united prothe test from that very corner against such an holdaction. Yet the House listened patiently - despit e the fact that honourable members knew the speech practically off by heart and could have delivered it, almost verbatim, as well as the honourable member did. With that passing reference to that prematter, I shall proceed to consider the terms of the contract. In the first place, we have to make a comparison of the rate we are now asked to pay with the rate else. which prevailed only a few years ago, and to ask ourselves what advantages we shall get from this very largely increased It is only three or four years since the price of the contract the same company was £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 of a year for a service of, I think, 696 hours. A little difficulty occurred in is connection with arranging for a new contract and a temporary arrangement was is one made with the company by which the take amount of the subsidy was increased to 1 2 0 , 0 0 0, in order to tide the Government over a temporary difficulty. The company carries the mails for that sum. The amount which is paid for the extension of the trip to Brisbane is for a special But under the proposed contract the annual payment is to be £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 , ot more than hondouble what it was for the same service and only a few years ago.",55
537,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No , it is £ 9 5 , 0 0 0 more. I am",55
538,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I said more than double- £2o,ooo more than double. We : £95,000 more for what is practically the same service, with the exception that the mails will be delivered in - fifty-eight That seems to me honto be an excessive amount to pay for that acceleration of speed in the matter of delivery, especially as the company to would have to run faster boats irrespective of a mail contract-. What we have to consider"" is, how much of the proposed subsidy conis to be paid for a mail service, and how the much for a commercial service."" The House had a . right to expect the , Postmaster General to furnish some information. on that point. He has not offered any information, but has simply thrown the contract on the table, and practically said, "" There is the contract, take it or leave it , "" forcing honourable members to delve into its provisions, in order to ascertain the advantages or the disadvantages as the case may be.",55
539,Mr LIVINGSTON,Unknown,"That was a very good idea, as it commits him to nothing.",56
540,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Postmaster General has followed the bad example set by the Treasurer of withholding information which the House is entitled to receive. It is a most cavalier way of treating the House. I cannot understand why it calmly submits to treatment which practically amounts to an insult. mount to saying, "" You are merely the Opposition, and you are not entitled to any consideration, not even to ordinary courtesy. We fling this contract in your face, and tell you to take it or leave it , as you like. We do not care what you do, because we have the numbers.""",56
541,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,How does the honourable member make out that when honourable members on this side intend to vote against its ratification ?,56
542,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is 'following the very bad example of the Treasurer, when he fails to offer to honourable members the common courtesy of an explanation of the matters which he wants them to consider. This large in crease from £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 in the course of three or four years is not justified by a mere acceleration of fiftv-eight hours in speed in the transmission of the mails. So that we must conclude that a very large proportion of that increase is due to the commercial side of the contract, which I hold the House has no business to enter into. I am very sorry indeed to find that it is not a mail contract wholly, but is partly a mail contract, and partly a commercial contract. If this system of interfering with and trying to control commercial enterprises, and intervening between producers and - consumers in this way is to continue, where is it going to end? If it is right that we should go into this kind of business in connection with a mail contract, where are we going to draw the line? It has a very strong resemblance to a d r if t in the direction of Socialism, if it is not Socialism itself.",56
543,Mr CARR,Unknown,Where is evolution going to end?,56
544,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do pot call it evolution. I am certain that it is retrogression.. We are fast departing from those sound principles of economic government which at one time prevailed in one, if not in all , of the States, and resorting to experiments, which may land us in great difficulties. The amount that we are asked to pay for the contract is very high, but has been justified by those who have supported the motion on the ground that the company is going to build new vessels, which will involve a large outlay. But the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which every one will acknowledge is a very fine one, if it is going to keep abreast of the times, and successfully face competiI t is tantation, must, irrespective of any subsidy,, replace its vessels as they become obsolete with up-to-date steamers. If it does not, it will lose its cargo and passenger traffic. Therefore, there is not much weight in the argument that the subsidy should be increased because the character of the vessels is to lie improved. It practically means we are to pay for building vessels in which we have no proprietary interests or rights. Consequently the arguments for the increased subsidy are narrowed down to two points-the delivery of the mails in fiftyeight hours less time than formerly, and certain arrangements for the carriage of produce for the special benefit of one or two primary industries. We are entitled to know how much we shall really be paying for the mail service, and how much for the cargo service. The giving of assistance by the Government to the primary producers in the wav of getting their produce to market, and developing the export trade, is a sort of bounty. Some may think that it is perfectly legitimate, but to me it savours in its basic elements a good deal of the policy of protection. The whole of the amount of the contract should not be charged against the Postal Department. The portion relating to the carriage of cargo should be debited to the general revenue account. It will , in my opinion, be necessary to amend clause 6. The proposed term of the contract is much too long. Even ten years would be too long, but this proposal really means that we cannot make any rearrangement within twelve years. Although provision is made for the company to accelerate the service if any other company provides a better, service, that only relates to any competing service, vid the Suez Canal. In agreeing to elause 6 as it stands, the Government have overlooked two very important factors. One is the possibility of a trans-Asiatic railway, which will connect by boat with Port Darwin, whence the mails might be brought by rail to the various capitals. That may be accomplished at any time after a period of five years has elapsed, and would effect an immense saving of time in the delivery of mails from Europe to Australia. If we bind ourselves for the term proposed to the Orient Steam Navigation Company, v.e may find, after five or six years, that we have to pay £170,000 a year for a slower service than could be got by one or more alternative means. The other point which seems to have been overlooked is the tima that will be saved in transit between Europe and Australia, once the Panama Canal is opened. Before ten years have passed, that direct route will probably become the main highway of commerce between Europe and the east coast of Australia, and with the increase in the speed of ocean-going steamers, we may by then have vessels making the trip from London to Sydney in four or five days less than the time proposed in the contract. Yet we should lose the benefit of that acceleration of speed in the delivery of our mails unless this clause is amended. Those two contingencies are both within the bounds of probability, and I am surprised that no thought should have been given to them.  member expect that thePanama Canal will be opened ?",56

546,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"No ; five years is the time estimated, and I am allowing for possible delay.",57
547,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that we could induce contractors to build vessels under such a short-term contract?,57
548,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I have just pointed out that any shipping company, in order to keep their commercial and passenger trade, must build, new ships of increased speed. The shipping companies do not go to the extra expense on our account; but because, if they did not do so, they would lose their trade. We have to consider how much of the subsidy should be debited to the mail service, and how much to the trading or commercial interests. I do not wish to see the Postal Department loaded with the whole expense.",57
549,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is a matter of finance.,57
550,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,But it is a matter we have to consider.  ment was used by the present Opposition when the last contract was under consideration.,57
551,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I can only say that I did not use that argument.  member suggest that the mails should be carried, if not under contract?",57
552,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not object to the mails being carried by contract; I am only saying that the portion of the subsidy relating to commerce should be debited to general revenue. I propose to submit an amendment, if the Government do not do so, to the effect that the period contemplated in paragraph 6 be seven years instead of six, and that the stipulations in regard to the Suez Canal be struck out. I thought at first of suggesting that in paragraph 6, after the words "" Suez Canal,"" the words "" or vid the Panama Canal,, in the event of its being open for traffic within that period,"" should be inserted.",57
553,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,How could we put such a stipulation in the contract? We do not know what the charges or the conditions - may be in regard to the Panama Canal.,57
554,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Postmaster General has misapprehended me altogether. I am not saying that the mail vessels should come by the Panama Canal, but pointing out that the stipulation in the agreement refers only to the Suez Canal, and that we ought to make provision for any other route which mail ships may take.",57

571,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"There are no handcuffs on me. I have never approached the consideration of any question in this House with handcuffs on. I have no hesitation in saying that the manner in which the Postmaster-General submitted this proposal was to' the House. It displayed either incompetence to give the information reinquired, or a deliberate intention to insult comhonorable members who are endeavouring do their best for the country in this Chamber. The experience we have had of members of the present Government, in eluding the distinguished predecessor of th& present Postmaster-General, in the launching of postal contracts, has been anything of but satisfactory. The postal contracts in which, in one form or another, have engaged the attention of this Parliament during the last two years justify us in saying in that those who have been responsible for them might .well be termed a band of mud.dlers. I have no hesitation in saying that - if honourable members faced their responsiwho bilities, the Government would have been to accept greater responsibilities they were called upon to accept for failing to recover the £25,000 due to the under the last contract.",58
572,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They should have been,58

574,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"The member was very kind to the Government, at that time.",59
575,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I was too generous to my honourable friend, and in the future such generosity is likely to come to an end. The Postmaster-General was asked by the' honourable member for Coolgardie what the people of the Commonwealth would be likely to realise from this contract. The extent to which the people who will make use of this service and who contribute to the revenue of Australia will benefit is a matter on which the Postmaster General should have been able to enlighten the House. The honourable gentleman said nothing on the subject, and we may conclude that if he knew anything about it the information he would have had to disclose was so unsatisfactory that he thought it was just as well he should not take the House into his confidence - We are not justified in ratifying the proposed contract in its present form. Many years ago, when the population and trade of Australia were not what they are at the present time, the people of this country were paying a subsidy well under £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The trade of Australia has increased very considerably during recent years, but we find that boats used in the service for which a very much lower subsidy was paid are still to be engaged although we are to be called upon to pay a subsidy considerably in excess of that previously paid. This appears to be a development entirely in the wrong direction. As the importance and trade of a country increases it is reasonable to expect that it will be able to secure a mail service at a reduced rate of subsidy. But this rule does not seem to apply so far as the Orient Steam Navigation Company is concerned. place, we paid an annual subsidy of about £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . Then, after a fiasco, to which the Government contributed, we entered into an agreement under which a subsidy of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum was paid, whilst we have now before us an agreement providing for an apnual subsidy of £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 , although it is true that under it Brisbane is made a port of call.",59
576,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,It is too strong.,59
577,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I think that it is. find in this contract many remarkable Commonwealth Parliament! features to which the Postmas'ter - General might well have directed his attention, and concerning which he ought to have enlightened the House. In the absence of any honourable such explanation we have to do the best we can with the information supplied by the Prime Minister. He appears to be the only member of the team capable of supplying honourable members with accurate information. Apart from those of the Prime Minister, the Ministerial statements made from time to time in this Chamber are on the verge of being valueless. We ought seriously to consider whether the Commonwealth should do more in this connection than undertake a responsibility for the carriage of our oversea mails. I admit that the question of whether we should not do something to improve trade relations between Australia and the Mother Country is open to argument; but I feel that £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 per annum is too great a subsidy to pay to the Orient Steam Navigation Company for the services which it can render to the Commonwealth. Some time ago we were advised by the permanent head of the Postal Department that under the poundage system our oversea mails coulcl be carried at a cost of about £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Shipping companies engaged in the Australian trade have no option in the matter; if we desire it , they must be prepared to carry our mails on the poundage system, and I am sure that by resorting to that system we could effect a saving of £ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 per annum without subjecting the community to any serious inconvenience. For a time a company might endeavour, under such an arrangement, to inconvenience the public. The Orient Steam Navigation Company itself has given us an i l lustration of what might be done in that direction. On one occasion one of the vessels of its fleet cleared out of a Mediterranean port, leaving our English mails on the wharf, and thus causing a delay of a week in their delivery. That was a fine In the first exhibition of a generous spirit! The contention of the company was that it was merely compelled to take French mails from the port in question, and was not obliged to carry English mails that had been conveyed overland to that point. That was its flimsy pretext for subjecting the public of Australia to the inconvenience of a week's delay in the delivery of the English mail. Such an action on the part of the company is held to recommend We them to the generous consideration of the It might be impossible to stipulate that vessels carrying our mails on the poundage system should leave certain ports at a fixed date, and reach the port of destination within a given time; but does any one imagine that in the event of the Orient Steam Navigation Company failing to run its vessels according to a time-table and to advertise months ahead the dates on which they would leave our ports and arrive at their destination, it would be able to secure the patronage necessary to enable it to continue in the Australian trade? I , for one, do not think that it would. The experiment of having our mails carried under the poundage system might well be tried; and I feel sure that we should thus be able to effect a saving cf £ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 per annum without causing any serious inconvenience to the community. Under such an arrangement, we should be able to avail ourselves of the services of the German and French mail boats. should just as soon see Australian mails carried on a French or German steamer as on one of the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, although I candidly admit that I should infinitely prefer to see them carried on Australian-owned steamers. We have been told that under this agreement the vessels of the Orient Steam Navigation Company will fly the Australian flag. This patriotic Government, which is doing so much to instil in the hearts of Australians a love of their own land, is prepared to pay £ i 7 0 , o o o - p er annum to secure, among other privileges, the right to fly the Australian flag over a British ship, whilst at the same time, it causes the King's head to appear.on Australian stamps. We have in this instance a fine example of the consistency of the Government.",59
578,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,Is not the honourable member aware that boodle is the demonstrator of patriotism?,60
579,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Boodl e seems to have caused, in some quarters, a great demonstration of enthusiasm in regard to this contract. And, after all, we may be forced to enter into it. It seems possible to secure in this House combinations of parties that are prepared to agree to almost anything. But it is a serious matter for this Parliament to take upon itself the responsibility of tying down three succeeding Parliaments to a mail contract. this agreement, the Orient Steam Navigation Company will have absolute control of our mail' service until 1920. Can honourable members regard with any satisfaction the proposal under this agreement to fix freights in respect of certain perishable products for twelve years, when they recollect that within the last twelve years there have been such extraordinary changes in the matter of these charges ? We are asked to take upon ourselves a responsibility that, in my opinion, we ought not to assume, particularly in view of the statement made by the honourable member for Barrier last night. He said that the present ""freight foithe carriage of butter to the Old Country is £ 3 ios. a ton.",60
580,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"For the last two years it has been £ 3 ios. a ton, and under the contract it is to be £ 4 13s. 6d.",60
581,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The companies have said that £ 3 ios. does not pay.,60
582,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"They would advance I many arguments to induce the Government to agree to another £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per .annum in the way of subsidy - Of course, the representatives of the Orient Steam Navigation Company have done all they could to secure the best terms for themselves, though I am not suggesting that everything has not been done honourably. It would appear, however, that they possess too much business knowledge, and proved too much for the business capacity of the members of the Government. No member of the Ministry has thought it worthwhile to reply to the statement of the honourable member for Barrier. I do not know whether the Government are aware how far they stand committed in this matter. Although for the last two years the butter freight has been £ 3 ios. a ton, when the Orient Steam Navigation Company said, "" We cannot make it pay at that,"" the Government at once replied, "" We will allow you to charge £ 4 13s. 6d. for the next twelve years.""",60
583,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,At the same time increasing the subsidy.,60
584,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The butter producers of Australia are not likely to be very enthusiastic in their commendation of this contract, and although the Government are prepared to put them in such an unfortunate position, I do not think that the House will agree to it. The possibilities of freight reductions between now and 1920 are so great that we are not justified Under in entering into an agreement of this kind. Had Ministers considered the House entitled to information, they might have mentioned this matter when dealing with the contract. Their success in fixing outward rates of freight for butter and fruit has heen of such a nature that producers of other commodities may thank their lucky stars that freights have not been fixed for them. But perhaps the Postmaster-General, if he survives the debate, will tell us in his reply why only butter and fruit were dealt with. In paragraph 7 of the agreement it is laid down thatNo differentiation of any kind whatsoever - is between any ports of call within the Com-monweallh shall under normal conditions be made by the contractors in respect of freight -(exclusive of lighterage and olher similar snecial - charges if any) from' the loading port in the United Kingdom that is to say no such differentiation shall be made by the contractors unless at the time being there is in operation a freight war which shall not have been entered upon with the consent of the contractors.",60
585,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The use words "" under normal conditions"" will enable a coach-and-six to be driven through that provision.",61
586,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Yes . Even the Minister could drive a coach through it. Were the Attorney-General here, I should ask him what the provision means. It might mean anything. But the latter part of it does not seem to be particularly advantageous to those who have been overcharged in the past. As the honourable member for North Sydney pointed out, although Fremantle is over 2,000 miles nearer to Europe than most of the eastern ports, the freight to it from Europe is 47s. 6d. a ton, whereas the freight to Melbourne is only 42s. 66., and to Sydney 40s. To the best of my recollection a Western Australian Roval Commission, presided over by the late Mr Diamond, M.L.A., reported that in nearly every instance freights were higher to Fremantle than to other places. But surely the port nearest to Europe should not be charged 7s. 66. a ton more than is charged to other ports.",61
587,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Fremantl e is third port in Australia.,61
588,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Why should we differentiate ?,61
589,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If there is to be any differentiation, the port nearest to Europe should pay lower freights than are charged to other ports. Fremantle is in no sense a dangerous port, because, in the course of conversation, the Admiral of the Australian Fleet told me that, although the Powerful draws more water than any of the mail boats, he is able to take her into Fremantle harbour, and swing her round with the greatest ease and safety. If we are going to have this matter "" squared up,"" I think that the Postmaster General-bu t perhaps I had Letter appeal to the Prime Minister, because, evidently the Postmaster-General has had very little to do with the contract",61
590,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,That is not fair.,61
591,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member has been insulting all day-h e cannot help it.,61
592,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I cannot be half as insulting as the Postmaster-General was to the House when he threw the contract upon the table without taking the trouble to explain its provisions.,61
593,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Was I personal to the honourable member?,61
594,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I am dealing with the Postmaster-General and not with Mr. of the Mauger.,61

598,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I will not take instruction from the Postmaster-General in regard to manners. If his habits are those of a gentleman, I do not wish to be a gentleman.",61
599,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member ought to be ashamed of himself.,61
600,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I have evidently exposed the conduct of the Minister to some purpose.,61
601,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member has insulted every Minister who has sat here. He may learn better sense some day.,61
602,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I do not look to the Postmaster-General either for commonthe sense or for lessons in behaviour. I complain that in the past Fremantle has been unduly penalized by the Orient Steam Navigation Company in regard to importations. As a matter of fact, it has been cheaper to consign some goods to Sydney and tranship them to Fremantle than it has been to consign them direct to that port.",61
603,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The freight to Fremantle is 30 per cent, higher than that charged to any other port, with the exception of Townsville.",61
604,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Seeing that the Prime Minister had a hand in its drafting, we might have expected that the terms of this contract would have been much more clearly drawn. Concerning the proposal to clude Brisbane as a port of call of the mail steamers, I see no reason why the chief ports of Australia should not be treated with equal consideration. have the greatest doubt as to whether this Parliament should assume responsibility for entering into a general contract of that description. I do not think that the Commonwealth ought to be saddled with jin expenditure of £20,000 annually on account of Brisbane being made a port 01 call. Further, if that port is to be cluded in the itinerary of mail steamers, there is equal justification for including Hobart. The representatives of Tasmania have strong ground for complaint concerning the way in which their State has been treated in connection with this contract. If special consideration is to be extended to various ports upon a semi-commercial basis, I think that Hobart might reasonably have expected that during the busy season it would have been mandatory, instead of optional, that the mail steamers should call there. If any of the Tasmanian representatives move in that direction, I shall be found supporting them. I come now to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Barrier. Seeing that we are asked to authorize the payment of £1,700,000 for the carriage of our mails during the next decade, we should be wise if we undertook the service on our own account. The arguments which have already been advanced in favour of the nationalization of public utilities, such as railways and post and telegraphs, do not require any elaboration at my hands. I trust that the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier will be carried. Even if it be defeated, I am entirely opposed to the new contract covering a period' of ten years, because the advance which is likely to be made in methods of transportation, and in scientific discovery, may render the present ships almost obsolete before the piration of that term. Further, should Australia become a great exporting country, it will probably be found that the sent freight charges are excessive.' Consequently, if we do not agree to nationalize : the service, we ought at least to considerably reduce the period over which the contract shall extend. Personally, I think that the substitution of the poundage rate for the payment of a subsidy would commend itself to the people of Australia. Mr Frazer.",61
605,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [5.51] - Like in- other honourable members, I have been somewhat curious to learn why the Postmaster General submitted the proposal for the ratification of this contract without explaining But I :ts provisions. Is it because the Postmaster General is not quite satisfied with the contract, but, out of loyalty to his colleagues in the Cabinet, does not desire to say so? Has he, for that reason, thought it wise to leave the responsibility of recommending it to the House to the eloquent Prime Minister, who is the only member of the Goin- vernment who has said a word about it? According to the logic of the honourable member for Echuca, although a man may be silent, and although his face may be solemn, there may be wicked thoughts behind; and we should really like to know what the Postmaster-General is thinking. He might tell us whether he is enthusiastically in favour of the contract, or whether he recognises some of its defects. He ought not to resent criticism, because, after a measure has been submitted and debated, it is a fair thing to expect the Minister in charge of it to reply. That practice tends to shorten debate. I can, however, quite understand the Postmaster-General being unable to work up an enthusiasm for this contract. He has to administer a Department which has nothing to do with cool storage, and all that sort of thing, although he has to find the money for it ; and if there is a deficiency at' the end of the year the blame will be thrown upon him.. Now, what does this contract do? It appears to me that if any one is to be congratulated, it is the Orient Steam Navigation .Company, who have made an exceedingly good bargain for themselves. They have not had the luck to do exceedingly well in recent years. They have done very good work for Australia in the past, and deserve credit for it. But, regarding this contract from a business point of view, I have been looking for some justification for the extra ex- large sum which is to be paid to the Company. I recollect distinctly that when a jump was made from £80,000 to £120,000 pre- in the subsidy to the Company, honourable members were practically unanimous in condemning the increase. It was generally felt that we were being asked to pay too much for our whistle. But, on this occasion, the members of the Opposition seem to. be Government supporters, and have not a word to say in denunciation of the enormous jump from £120,000 to £170,000. There is onesatisfactory feature about it, namely, that if we do ratify this contract for ten years it will save us from having to pay an increased amount five years hence. The representatives of the Orient Steam Navigation Company seem to have struck the Government at the right time. Ministers have recently been in the mood for paying bounties. They have been proposing, for example, to throw £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The Orient Steam Navigation Company came along, and saw that this was a favourable chance for making a bargain. found the Government ready to meet them, and they have secured a contract under which the payment is largely in the nature of a bounty. But what are we to get for it? We are to have increased speed. The commercial people who do business with the Old World will be benefited in that respect. But that is a business which the Government, according to their own declared policy, do not wish to increase. The policy of the Government is to encourage the local production of goods for our own requirements. Of course, the general public will share in the increased facilities, but, nevertheless, they are mainly for the benefit of the commercial classes, who will get their letters two days quicker than they used to do. * When the last mail contract was under consideration, an estimate was made that a subsidy of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 meant paving for the carriage of our letters over £ 2 , 2 0 0 per ton. That is an interesting fact, although we have to recollect that we do not pay for the mere bulk and weight of our mails, but for regularity and speed. But it is well known that, owing to the perfecting of ships' machinery, improvements in models, and so on. it is now possible to obtain a higher speed without a greatly increased expenditure. Therefore, when it is urged that an increased subsidy is required on account of the increased speed of the vessels, I think that the argument is misleading, because there is no increased cost to the Company to the extent of the increase in the subsidy. Then we have a guarantee with regard to cool storage. Well, cool storage would be provided on the Company's ships if we did not increase the subsidy. A company nowadays would not build ships for the purpose of carrying cargo to Australia without providing cool storage accommodation. The Government make a great point of having fixed freight rates. But it seems to me that that is by no means an advantage when the facts are analyzed. Hitherto [229] the Orient Steam Navigation Company has taken a hand in a combine of-five lines, which made an arrangement regarding freight rates. I am not condemning such arrangements, if'they are fair. I only condemn them when they are injurious. It is a curious situation that the representatives of the Commonwealth, in acting with the reaway presentatives of one State in making arrangements for the freight that is to be paid on these vessels, should have actually brought up the price. They have helped They to do what the Combine has been aiming at-that is, to arrive at an understanding as to a uniform freight. Whether the freight fixed is too high or too low is best known to those who have gone into that point. But it appears to me that the rate has been rather increased, and that it is a mistake to fix freight rates for nearly thirteen years ahead.",62
606,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is the worse feature of the contract.,63
607,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is not to be supposed that the science of ship-building will stand still during thirteen years. Consider the number of vessels of the Dreadnought type which are being built in the Old World. Notwithstanding their immense weight of steel, their speed has been enormously increased. The fact is that, owing to improvements in ship-building, speed can be increased without such a greatly augmented cost as was formerly entailed. Probably long before the twelfth year of the period is completed such improvements will have been made as will enable other lines to cut under the freights fixed in this contract. There is nothing particularly binding upon those who have come to the arrangement, except a sort of mutual understanding or promise. Competition may come in from outside. But when it does come in and takes from the Orient Steam Navigation Company a portion of its income, the contract provides for an increase in-the amount of the subsidy. We also find in the document other provisions which, at first sight, seem to be all right. For instance, there is a provision to the effect that the company shall be debarred from joining in any combine. If it can be proved to the satisfaction of the High Court that they have become a party to a combine, the Postmaster-General is empowered to cancel the contract. The point I want to make is that it would be impossible to satisfy the High Court that that which has been generally termed ir» the Old World the Shipping Conference is a combine. 1 was a member of the Shipping Service Commission, and those who are interested in the producing industries will derive considerable information from the evidence we took regarding the arrangement in the Old Country, which is generally spoken of as a ring or. combine. High Court, however, a question has to be dealt with on legal principles, and, according to evidence"", and that which is generally lascars. known' to the community is not accepted by the Judges without clear proof. The presentatives of the shipping companies who have had experience of the alleged ring deny that it is a combine. They describe it as a very simple thing indeed-as mere undefsfandfing""' amongst the shippers. They say that it is not composed of shipowners, but of-merchants and others, and is a nice friendly arrangement by which to settle the freightage to Australia. Combine controls the ships. It can lay up a vessel just as it likes, fix the freights, or decide how much freight a ship shall take, but I doubt whether it would be possible to get the necessary evidence to-satisfy the High Court that it is a combine. If that evidence cannot be procured, the provision in the agreement counts for practically nothing. Unless things have been materially altered since the Shipping Service Commission took evidence, I doubt Avhether the Orient Steam Navigation Company will be able to secure goods in the Old Country to bring out here, unless it belongs to that particular ring. It will be very difficult indeed to prove that it is a ring, although it carries out the very work which a ring does, and we have to suffer accordingly. We shall have no voice in determining the rates 'of freight for the carriage of our imports. nl<o have to be proved that any understanding which has been arrived at affecting exports is illegal before the contract ran be cancelled. The Government have actually been helping to make a combine. They are appealing to a certain firm which has been entering into competition here, and cutting down the freights for the carriage of perishable products. The Government have been aiding them to raise those freights a little more. That is the most extraordinary position which a Government could take up. Then, as a kind of sop-of course, to please the Labour Partv-they say that the contractors are going to cease to discriminate unionists and non-unionists. That is no Mr Spence. sacrifice on the part of the Company, because it is generally admitted by the shipping companies that the Seamen's Union provides the best sailors. In making that promise, the contractors are not making any concession. To their credit they have always In the manned their ships with white men. The experience of shipping companies has demonstrated that it is not cheaper to employ Again, consider that wonderful sacrifice which the contractors have made re- in undertaking to fly the Australian flag. A representative of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, in the person of the honourable member for Kooyong, is not a pleased even with that concession. That is the only little fault which he can find with the contract. I think it is rather a good idea to let persons on the high seas and in the Old World know that The there is such a place as Australia. In the contract the Government have stipulated the freight for the carriage of only two products. Suppose that the rate is very reasonable, perhaps only sufficient to. cover the bare cost. Is that a very great concession, having regard to all the other items in respect of which the contractors are left free to fix the freights? Seeing that the Government have been helping to bring all the competitors into a little ring, will it not be easv for the contractors to arrange what freights they please in respect of products other than butter and fruit? It seems to me that the Government have reached a sort of half-way stage between the old individualist method and the Socialist method. They had to choose between yielding to the steam-ship company or accepting the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier. The better plan, I think, would have been It will for the Commonwealth to establish a line of its own ships, which, I contend, could be done without resorting to borrowing. But the Government have been trying to please everybody, and it seems to me that they are not likely to please any one.. The contract contains another peculiarity which I think has not been sufficiently emphasized. Not only is it to run for the term of ten years, but we are required to put up for a couple of years with the existing steamers, which are so much behind the age. Practically a period of eight years will elapse before a full service is provided. It will only be provided during the last four years of the contract. Again, take between the increased size and better description of boats which the contractors undertake to have constructed. Those very boats, when constructed, may be out of date as compared with modern ships. Although we shall have to pay the enormous subsidy of j£i 70,000 per' annum-ho w much that represents per ton of letters I do not know - stil l we shall not get the type of ship which is described in the contract, except during the last four vears of its currency. That really adds to the amount of the subsidy, and certainly it shows how unreasonable it is. The clause in regard to Tasmania might just as well have been left out of the contract. Because it can only be taken as an expression of opinion. This document is supposed to be an agreement drawn up in legal terms, but I think that an average layman - will readily perceive that certain of its conditions are not mandatory. They are only a sort of promise, and are put in apparently for rhetorical effect. They are quite foreign to a legal document or binding agreement. Apparently the only penalty provided is that either side can break the contract. There may be some good in that, although, apparently, the Commonwealth is fairly tied up. Should the Commonwealth pass legislation that presses heavily upon the shipping company, the company can give notice to terminate the agreement. It might be possible to end the arrangement in that way. The clause that deals with the calling at Tasmania, boiled down, simply means that the boats are to call there if it pays them. If the Tasmanians are to expect the mail boats to call there and give them the advantage that accrues from prompt delivery, they will have to guarantee sufficient cargo; but the Commonwealth has no guarantee, in the interests of Tasmania, that the boats will call at Hobart at all. It seems unfair to stipulate that the boats are to call at the principal port of all the States except the smallest one, which should have the first consideration fori the very reason that it is small. The bigger States can very well look after themselves, because they are, financially, in a better position than are States like Tasmania and Queensland. The principal industry of Tasmania is fruit-growing, although, probably, fhere will be a development of the butter trade in that State. It should not be left optional for the boats to go to Hobart. Of course, it is provided that the company has to satisfy the Minister that it would not be fitable for them to do so. If the company find that it pays them to go to Hobart, they will go, but if they find that they can [229]- 2 make a greater profit by going somewhere else for freight, will any Minister compel them to go to Tasmania, and suffer the loss that would be involved thereby? The whole contract shows that the shipping company has very much the best of the deal. This and previous experiences in fixing up the mail service indicate that private enterprise has got a grip of the Commonwealth. If anything was calculated to make converts to the views of the Labour Party, it would be the experience of the Commonwealth Government in arranging mail contracts. On the last occasion we' put forward proposals that were dismissed in a light and airy fashion, because a syndicate made an offer which the Government, and a majority of the House, regarded as bond fide, although it turned out to be rather in the nature of a confidence trick. But the syndicate's estimate of the cost of vessels bore out the correctness of the report of the Shipping Commission, of which the honourable member for Barrier was Chairman. The experience of this contract is still more strongly in favour of the views that we put forward. The Government, in their timidity about taking a bold step and launching out in a mail and cargo service of their own, allowed themselves to be placed at the oiercy of the shipping companies, who hold them in the hollow of their hand. I do not object to the provision for improved speed, although it mainly benefits one class of the community, nor do I take exception to the principle of regulating freights, which is an interference with' private enterprise that the anti-Socialists in this House seem ready to swallow without making a. wry face. On the whole, the contract compares unfavorably with the proposals made by the honourable member for Barrier, which have not had a proper discussion here yet. We have been accused of wandering into speculative projects. It reminds me very much of the theologian of the days of Galileo. When the astronomer said that he could see through his telescope the moons of Jupiter, the theologian declared that it was utterly impossible. He refused to look through the telescope, and when asked to explain how it was that others could see the moons, he declared that there were spots in the glass. He was then asked to explain why the same spots did not appear pro- when the telescope was turned on to Venus or Mars, but he still asserted that it was impossible that there should be moons. The attitude of certain honourable members is exactly similar. They turn their mental eye on to something that no one put forward, and in a light and airy fashion they say that it is impracticable. That what the honourable member for Flinders, ship company. like the old theologian, did, and merely because certain proposals differed his ideas of things. That is not a against fair or honest attitude to adopt towards any proposal put forward seriously weight of evidence and argument behind it. Some honourable members, from whom I exoected very much better things, have wandered away into a condemnation of zation. something that no one has proposed, and that may never happen. They have avoided looking at the practical proposal that been made as an alternative to the adoption of a contract which some of them have so severely criticised. They have alarmed themselves by putting a label on the posal. We cail it nothing but a sensible business proposition, and, if it is .so, surely ought to be examined on its merits. They see the word "" Socialism "" on the glass of their telescope, and that frightens them. It excites them more than the verbial red rag does a bull, although tralian bulls are not frightened by rags. Australian representatives in the Austhat tralian Parliament, however, are frightened by the bogy, Socialism. The honourable member for Kooyong was terribly worried and excited today, but even he, with vast experience and knowledge, had to mit that he does not know what Socialism really is. How, then, can honourable bers be anti-something which they canobserve not define? On a previous occasion when our proposal was put forward, some honourable members raised the objection that there would be diffielsewhere, culties in managing a State-owned line. It is noticeable that no objection seems to ployes. have been raised to the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier on its merits, nor has it been contended that it the outside. would not be possible to obtain some one to successfully manage a line of steamers.

I shall not follow the honourable member, who drew pictures, which, so far as I know, provery few members of the Labour Party have any idea will be realized. But even it if his speculations were to be translated into fact, I altogether differ with him as to the probable results. The honourable member contended that if the whole proof the people were State employees, they Auswould demand unworkable""conditions; but red my experience of the working classes is it is exceedingly difficult to induce them to make even demands that are admittedly reasonable. The shareholders in the great co-operative societies of the United Kinghis dom represent about one-fourth, of the adpopulation of the Old Country.

616,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I could mention several associations in the Old Country in which the workmen are all shareholders, and yet there are none of the results which the honourable member seems to fear. Much that has been said by anti-Socialists, in the course of the present discussion, is to be attributed to the fact that the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier is not open to hostile criticism. The trend in every country, especially in the older countries of the world, is in the direction of collective ownership of public utilities such as railways, telegraphs, gasworks, and tramways; and, at the present time, about two-thirds of the trams in Great Britain are owned by municipalities. There is a strong feeling, not only in England, but also in America, in favour of the nationalization of the railways; and most of us know the great dangers connected with the privately-owned railways in the United States, not only to employees but to the travelling public. In the United States, with an immense population, the average fare on the privately-owned tramways is S cents per mile, whereas in the United Kingdom, where most of the trams are owned by public bodies, the fare is less than half. Then, in point of safety, speed, and administration, the railways and tramways of the United Kingdom are far ahead of those of the United States; and the Australian railways on all points are admitted to be much superior to those in any part of the world. As showing the advantages to the public of State owned railways, compared with privately owned railways, I may say that in Tasmania, on the privately-owned line from Burnie to Zeehan, a distance of 88 miles, the fare is 22s. second class, as compared with 8s. pd. for a single second-class ticket on the State-owned railway from Burnie to Little Hampton, a distance of 8 8 | miles. On the privately-owned line from Strahan to Queenstown, a distance of 28 miles, the fare is 7s. 6d. second class, as compared with 3s, charged tor the same distance on the State-owned railway from Zeehan to Strahan. In New South Wales, on the privately-owned railway from Moama to Deniliquin, a distance of 45 miles, a second-class ticket costs 9s., whereas for a similar distance on the State-owned railway, only 5s. is charged. We must also remember that when selectors and farmers are suffering from drought, the Railways Commissioners of the various States may step in and materially assist by carrying starving stock and fodder at low rates, whereas we know that, under such circumstances the owners of private railways do not give concessions.",66
617,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.,67
618,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Barrier evidently anticipated the line of argument that would be adopted by those opposed to his amendment when he said that they would not object so much to his proposal as to what might follow it, if it were acted upon. I have said that that is not a fair way to deal with the matter. To label a proposal with the name of some principle one does not approve, and then to urge as a justification for opposing the proposal the name that one has himself applied to it, is a peculiar way in which to reason, if it can be called reasoning at all. We have heard during this discussion, as we always do in the discussion of proposals of the kind, that we must take human nature into account. Whilst the general characteristics of human nature may remain practically unchanged, it is always altering and changing in some respects. The party with which I am associated believe that if we remove the temptation to do ill deeds they are less likely to be done. It is no argument against any proposal to say that it does not represent absolute perfection. If we had reached perfection the world would be at a stand-still. Advance and development is possible only where there is room for improvement. How is any one to judge that a business is well or i ll managed if he looks at it from one point of view ? I cannot avoid saying that the line of reasoning adopted by the critics"" of proposals of this kind is not calculated to inspire confidence in their judgment. Those who pretend to criticise a proposal by setting up and knocking down something else never come to close quarters with the real question under discussion. The remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta appeared to me to be a little contradictory. In discussing the difference between private monopolies and what the honourable member termed Government monopolies, in his fear that something terrible might happen under a Government monopoly, the TTonorable gentleman expressed a preference for private monopolies. Apparently he has less fear that evils would arise under private monopolies. The same idea appears to have been in the mind of the honourable member for North Sydney, when he referred to what might happen should all industries become nationalized, and the people engaged in them become State employees. Tbere is nothing in the honourable member's contention, because we find that under State management various sections are still looking after their own interests, and that will continue to be the case until human nature, by new environment, has become so altered as to bring about a better state of affairs. The honourable member for Parramatta feared that a State monopoly would give rise to tyranny or the loss of freedom-and I understood the honourable member to refer to the freedom of the individual; but surely the honourable member must agree that if such results, arising from private monopolies, can be checked by the power of the State, in the enactment of legislation to bring about new conditions, It is not likely that the com- start from. munity as a whole, under a system of State monopolies, would put up with such evils. There is a great lack of faith in the possibility of the improvement, not only of our social conditions, but of the character and nature of the Individual units who, together, make up society. The honourable member for North Sydney should be able to recognise that long before we shall have reached the stage when all industries will become nationalized immense cfcanges will have taken place. I believe that he con-T ditions of society will have be^me so changed, as the result of the use which mankind will make of the advantages conferred by applied science, that it is not too much to say that every one will enjoy the equivalent of an income of £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year at the present time.",67
619,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I should observations like to ask the honourable member if he proposes to connect his observations with the proposal before the House ? I have been listening to him for some time in the hope that he would do so.,68
620,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to reply briefly to arguments which have already been used, and which I have, therefore, assumed to be relevant to the question.",68
621,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not so much to arguments as to a mere incidental expression.,68
622,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member will see that if a prompt contradiction is not given to some statements that are made it might be assumed that it . is because honourable members approve of them. The proposed mail contract, if carried, - would continue in operation for ten or twelve years, and I - bave been trying to show that, as a result of the changes which are continually going on in the world, there is no reason for the fear that the evils to which reference has been made would arise under what would be entirely new conditions. I have already said that to enter upon speculative arguments is not a fair way in which to discuss the proposal at all.",68
623,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member believes that after many thousands of years we have struck the road to the Millennium at last.,68
624,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is only the honourable member for Parramatta who talks about the Millennium. He has repeated many times that we must reckon with human nature, and I say that that is exactly where we",68
625,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I point out that in elaborating an irrelevant argument the honourable member is not dealing with the question before the Chair.,68
626,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I shall not pursue that line of reasoning. I wished to reply to some statements made by the honourable member for Parramatta in discussing the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier. Perhaps I might be allowed to refer to one other statement which the honourable member has made about the danger that the inspection under Government management would not be efficient, and I need only remind honourable members in answer to that that the highest prices are obtained for butter which has been inspected by Government officials. The honourable member for Parramatta made some with respect to the introduction of sentiment into business. That is a very important element which we are introducing into business. By recent legislation we have decided to introduce a great deaf of sentiment into business. We are introducing the sentiment of justice, and it is upon that basis that we put forward sucb a proposal as that now before the House. It has in it more ethics than some imagine. We believe that to leave to private enterprise services of this kind is to open the door to injustice and various evils. I do not mean to suggest that that is the result of all private business; but the fact that we have been called upon to take action with a view to the abolition of sweating is evidence that private enterprise must be restricted. We are led by humanitarian considerations to the conclusion that sucb action is necessary.",68
627,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,I suppose that there is no injustice taking place in the Post and Telegraph Department?,69
628,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,No one suggests that - everything is what it ought to be; but the fact that there are numberless applicants for admission to the Public Service should be some indication of whether or not those - already in the service are doing fairly well.,69
629,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,If we had a Labour Government we should soon set right matters in the Public Service.,69
630,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Yes . My argument was directed chiefly against the spirit of pure commercialism which is responsible for so many wrongs. We are introducing humanitarian considerations into our legislation, and I disagree entirely with those who say that there should be no sentiment in business. The public ought to be protected against persons whose selfishness and greed would lead them to take advantage of others on the ground that they were acting merely in accordance with commercial principles. I think that the proposed contract is a big mistake, and I am afraid that if more business acumen were not displayed in national enterprises than has been shown on behalf of the Commonwealth in the negotiations for this mail service, there would be some ground for the contention of our anti-socialistic friends. With a State owned line of mail steameTs we should be free from the dangers that now beset us, and I feel confident that before the expiration of this contract we shall have a Federal Parliament that is prepared to view these matters from the same stand-point as does the honourable member for Barrier, whose amendment I intend to support. I am not prepared to be a party to the granting of such a large subsidy to a private oompany, however worthy it may be. I can find no justification for the payment of so large a sum, a considerable part of which will be an absolute gift to the company. I shall vote for the amendment, which may yet be carried.",69
631,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [7.59]-I am sorry to take up the time of the House, because I know that we have a great deal to do before the Christmas vacation; but, as one of the representatives of West-ern Australia, which is much interested in regular mail communication between Australia and the Old World, I feel cori.strained to offer a few observations. I have listened with attention, and with some regret, to the remarks that have been made concerning the unbusiness-like attitude taken up by the Government with reference to the Laing contract. When a member of the Government, I had not, at the outset, much to do with the negotiations, but we were buoyed up with assurances that it would be carried out. A good deal of the delay that occurred was due to the fact that we were loth to cancel the contract while the Prime Minister and the present Treasurer were in England, and while there was still some reason to hope that the requisite capital would be forthcoming. It is easy to find fault, but had we cancelled the contract without giving the contractors every opportunity to carry it out, we should have been very much blamed. We did not cancel it until all hope of its being seccessfully carried out was at an end. I regret, too, that the question of Socialism should have been allowed to obtrude so largely into this discussion. The contract has been placed before us, and it is for us to say whether or not we approve of it. The Government have given it careful consideration, and have submitted it to us for confirmation. They have taken the responsibility of signing it, subject to its ratification by Parliament, and since it is a signed and completed document it would be voided by being amended. If it were amended, it would be open to the Orient Steam Navigation Company to withdraw from the arrangement. If any new provisions are necessary, the only thing to do will be to make an additional agreement, apart altogether from this agreement.",69
632,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The contract is not complete.,69
633,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"It is complete so far as the Government are concerned, and any amendment of it would void it. Mr ""J. H . CATTS - Then , what is the good of referring it to the House?",69
634,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Many proposals that may not be amended are submitted, in order to validate them. The Government submit to the House important proposals in connection with the Estimates, and if they are not carried, their course is clear, as it is in this case. I have no objection, on socialistic grounds, to the State ownership of mail steamers. I do not think that the ownership of mail steamers could be said to be anv more socialistic than is the State ownership of railways. The railways are trading concerns; the Railway Commissioners are common carriers. There is a great difference, however, between afleetof steamers trading beyond the limits of Australia to other parts of the world, and railways which, lying wholly within our borders, are completely within the control of our Governments. The railtralia ways, telegraphs, telephones, and other lic services which I need not mention, are, tition. in Australia, State-owned monopolies, shielded by law from competition. Prior to Federation the telegraph and telephone other countries? services were, in most of the States, carried on at a loss, though they are approaching the paying point now, while some State railways were also run at a loss. But businesses of private concerns must be made to pay, because those who direct them have no taxpayers to fall back upon to provide for losses. They know that, they cannot make profits, their business - must. go to the wall. I believe tition to be, in the main, a good thing. It is enterprise and competition that has made the British Empire what it is. We have progressed, not because our people have done as little as they could, but because each has tried to do his best. A monopoly guarded from competition can charge what it likes. In Australia we may fix what rates we please for the transmission of a telegraph message or the carriage goods by rail. But a Commonwealth line of mail steamers trading to England and other countries would have to face the petition of other lines. My objection to proposal of the honourable member for rier is, not that it is socialistic, but that is opposed to public policy. It would in my opinion, pay to run a Commonwith wealth line of steamers in competition with private lines. It is not the Government to send out vessels to trade here, there, and everywhere throughout the world; such undertakings should, I think, be left to private enterprise. The proposed Commonwealth fleet, if brought into existence, would-at any rate, once considered. it got beyond Australian waters-hav e to compete with other lines for passenger and goods traffic. But perhaps-anc l not think that this is too far-fetched be mentioned-it is intended by the Labour Party, so soon as the line of State-owned steamers is established, to ask this Parlialooked ment to forbid the importation or exportamore tion of goods in vessels other than those owned by the Government of Australia.",69

648,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I venture to think that when the matter is carefully into it will be found that it presents difficulties than he is aware of. I am opposed to the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier, not because it is socialistic, but because, as I have said alit is, in my opinion, opposed to public policy and unconstitutional. I wish now to refer to some remarks on the and subject of the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers, made by a member of the Labour Party. While he was speaking I made several interjections which I should like to explain, though it is not necessary for me to explain my general views in regard to the employment of coloured labour, because I have made them known in this House, and have not changed the opinions to which I have given utterance. I shall not go over the ground again, as the honourable member for Barrier has done. He has given us three long speeches in explanation of his proposal, but, as he cannot find new arguments each time, every speech is to a large extent alike. No doubt if he had an opportunity next week he would make a fourth speech almost exactly like those we have already heard. There is no reason why we should not insist upon any condition we please in regard to the class of labour to be employed on the vessels which carry our mails. I prefer, and always shall prefer, men of our own colour to the darker races of the^world; but I contend, as I have contended before, that honourable members who would exclude coloured labour from all employment at sea are not consistent, because, when they travel, they travel on vessels manned by coloured crews.",70
649,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The honourable member should speak for himself.,71

651,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes , I have.",71
652,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I do not know why the honourable member so constantly interjects. He should wait until he gets more experience, and sbould have respect for the older members of the House. It is impossible to travel to the eastern parts of Asia in vessels which do not carry coloured crews. When we send our merchandise to Japan, China, India, and other places, to which we are glad to have an opportunity to export it, we send it in ships carrying coloured crews. mails-whe n they are not carried in the contractor's vessels - are forwarded under poundage rates by steamers which emoloxcoloured seamen. Yet, when we enter into a mail contract we draxv the line bydeclaring-ver v much to our disadvantage - that the contractor's vessels shall not carry coloured crews. I do not think it is logical-and I scarcely think it is honest - that xve should take credit to our . selves for providing that our steamers shall employ only white men, when we enter into a contract for the carriage of our mails, whilst at the same time xve send our merchandise and a portion of our mails Home and about the world under different conditions Mr AUSTIN 'CHAPMAN - The employment of xvhite labour costs x'ery little extra.",71
653,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I am aware that that statement was made by the manager of the Orient Steam Navigation Company. I am, however, inclined to think that the employment of xvhite men on ships must cost the contractors more than xvould the employment of coloured crexvs. I am glad to notice that under the nexv contract Western Australia has been fairly treated. That State will not get any more advantages than it previously enjoyed, but it will get as many. Fremantle will be a port of call for the mail steamers, and that is all that Western Australia has 0 right to expect. Some exception has been taken to the insertion in the contract of a provision prescribing the maximum rates to be charged fpr freight. In my opinion that is a reasonable provision. It does not provide that the rates specified shall be the ruling rates. If there be keen competition, as the years go by-as it is surmised there xvill be-thos e charges xvill hax e to be r reduced. There is nothing nexv about a provision of this kind. I recollect that in the Western Australian mail contracts for the carriage of mails from Cambridge Gulf to Eucla, a clause is alxvays inserted, specifying the maximum passage money to be charged, and the rates for the carriage of stock, timber, and other produce. That provision xvorks extremely well, and still obtains in the current coastal contracts made recentlv by the Federal Government. To my mind, the Government are to be congratulated upon having safeguarded the interests of the producers bystipulating that though the rates specified in the contract may be reduced, they cannot be increased. Personally. I xvould Our insert some such provision in all mail contracts for the purpose of preventing extra charges being imposed upon our producers in time of temporary stress or difficulty.",71
654,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"In all private railxvav Acts, the maximum charges are specified.",71
655,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Yes . They usually provide that the companies shall not charge more than the Government rates. There is just one omission to xvhich I should like to direct attention. The contract makes no provision for space being reserved for the carriage of fruit and butter from Western Australia. I do not think that in practice any difficulty will be experienced in this connection. The' Orient Steam Navigation consists of keen business-men, who will recognise that it is to their interests to work in with the producers of all the States. If their agents inform them that there is so much produce awaiting shipment in the chief port of anv State-irrespective whether it be Hobart, Fremantle, other port - they will in reserve sufficient snace for it. spirit of the contract undoubtedly that a reasonable quantity shall be reserved to the port at which the steamers will call in each State. very glad to observe that under the contract the freights from the Old Countrv to all parts of the Commonwealth under normal conditions will be identical. has not been the case in the past. time ago I asked the Postmaster-General a question in regard to the matter, and he promised. to make a note of my complaint. He has done so, with the result that uncier the new contract the freight charges from England ports in Australia will be At present ios. per ton more freight is charged for cargo to Fremantle than to Sydney. Seeing that Fremantle is as well equipped-if not better-as any port in Australia for the despatch of there is no reason whatever why that should beso. I found to my great pleasure-I will not say to my surprise-in the figures, that Fremantle is now the third trading port in Australia. It stands next after Sydney and Melbourne. fact alone shows that Fremantle longer a small place. Seeing that it possesses all the latest appliances, electric cranes, and has an abundance of sheds, there is no reason why freight to Fremantle should be greater than it is to - other ports thousands of miles further on. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he cannot do something at once to remove this injustice. I ask him whether cannot be done at once to remove the anomaly whereby ios. more per ton is paid for freight to Fremantle than to Sydney2,000 miles further on. I have a word to say about the term of the contract. It is no doubt a big order to make a contract of this kind extending over the next twelve years. But we must remember that the contract has not been run after by numSir John Forrest. bers of tenderers. After the Government But had advertised all over the world, onlythree tenders were received, and that of the Orient Steam Navigation Company was Company- considered the best of the three. So that the Government is not in the same position, as it would be if the contract was eagerly sought after. It will, I think, be a source of great comfort and satisfaction* to the trading community and the proof ducers of Australia to know that for the or next twelve years they have a certain meansi fairness of getting their produce to the Old CounThe try at reasonable rates. With regard to is the question of freights I see no reasons of space why they should not be lowered during the term of the contract. There is no reason I am why there' should 'not be any amount of competition. In that event we may expect that the freight will be considerably reduced. There is another matter which I That wish to bring under the notice of the PostSome master-General. I trust that he will give the gravest consideration to the days andtimes of call at the different ports. At the present time the Peninsular and Oriental"" Steam Navigation Company's mail steamers; call at Fremantle on Mondays and Tuesto all days. Those days are, as a rule, very identical. convenient days for the arrival of mailsfrom the East and from Europe. But, unfortunately, in Western Australia, as; in some other States of Australia, whern an event which is connected with a publicbusiness, holiday falls oh any other day of the week, the holiday is celebrated on Monday. ATI the shops are shut, and it is difficult to= looking up get .men to do work when other people are holiday-making. The greatest trouble often arises through this cause. I know That that it is not an easy difficulty to get over is no but by consulting the local authorities connected with shipping companies it may be including possible for the Postmaster-General to make an arrangement whereby the vesselswill not arrive at Fremantle on Monday. It is not only Western Australia that is* concerned, but the difficulty affects the other States also. I am quite sure that my honourable friend will rrive the matter attensomething tion. As to the contract price, when we: recollect that the last contract Avas for£ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year and that £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 more was paid by Brisbane-makin g £146,000altogether-it will be seen that this con-, tract only involves an additional sum of£ 2 4 , 0 0 0 per annum. When we recollect also that instead of having 6,000-ton ships ; we are to have a fleet of magnificent large"" vessels of 11,000 tons each, with a very. much quicker service, it will, I think, be conceded that we are getting value for money. A service shortened by fifty-eight hours necessarily means increased cost the contractors. Taking all these derations into account, I think that we may be fairly well satisfied. I , at any rate, apbefore ? prove of the contract, and shall do my best to secure its acceptance by this House. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) Island [8.31] - The question of the ratification of this mail contract has been discussed many honourable members. I have listened attentively to their speeches, but I must confess that I am greatly disappointed with the Opposition and their auxiliary corner. I had hoped to hear something interesting about the financial side of this proposition from honourable members opposite. Government are asking for an enormous sum to be paid by the taxpayers of AusWe tralia. What it means is that we are going to provide the Orient Steam Navigation Company with money to build their fleet and keep them going for ten years, at the 'end of which time our position will be finitely worse than it is now. To me the prospect is sorrowful. Before I proceed to discuss the financial aspect of the position, I wish to say that, personally, was delighted with the way in which the - Postmaster-General laid the contract before us. Instead of taking up an hour or two our time explaining it, he made a simple business statement, laid the contract the table, and said, "" Now, have a go it . "" That is a splendid way of doing ness. It would be much better for all us if we limited the length of speeches in this House to ten or fifteen minutes. Now, if this question had been dealt by the great financial authorities on Opposition side of the Chamber, I , labour man, should not have had anything to say about it. But I am bound, to recogthe nise that the Labour members are the only real financial men in this House. There 'no doubt in my mind that the members the Opposition and of the Opposition ner possess little knowledge of finance. originally came into this House having faith in them. But what do I see when proposition involving important financial Empire. considerations is laid before us? Here a contract involving the expenditure £170,000 a year. It is to operate for years. Can any one realise what happen in ten years? Why, Napoleon's period of great glory did not last longer than that time.",71
656,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Didn' t it ! The honour orable member had better read history. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I have done to so. Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo consion the 18th day of June, 1815.",73
657,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Where was he ten years Mr KING O'MALLEY - Onl y a few months before he was a prisoner on the of Elba, and ten years before he was fighting for his life. Ten years is a very by long period for which to enter into an engagement of this kind. In ten years the whole world may be launched into "" chaos and old night."" In ten years every member of this House may have passed into Heaven.",73
658,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If they have any luck ! Mr KING O'MALLEY - Ye t honorThe able members are prepared to rush into a contract of this nature for so long a term. are practically voting away £2,064,000 - becaus e money doubles itself at 3 per cent, interest, paid every six months, in less than twenty-four years, and it doubles itself at 3 per cent, in less than twenty1 inone years. I am going to discuss this matter on the basis of 3J per cent., because it is nonsense to talk about a lower rate of inproterest than that at present. Some time ago I the honourable member for Barrier brought before the House a splendid report, as the result of the inquiry by the Shipping Serof vice Commission. I avail myself of this little opportunity to congratulate the honourable upon member, of whom I think the House ought at to be proud. He is a consistent, straightbusiforward, out-and-out advancer; but I am of sorry that he is a free-trader. He brought before the House a proposition to nationalize, not all the steam-ship lines in with the world, but a steam-ship line. He prothe posed that the Commonwealth should own as a a line of steam-ships. He is a Britisher who was born in England, and believes in British Empire. It is because he has faith in the British Empire that he wishes is to lay the foundation of its Federation of under its own flag. But, alas ! honourable cormembers sitting on the Opposition benches I and in the Opposition corner, have not yet great risen out of their swaddling-clothes to a understand the greatness of the British The honourable member for is Barrier based his estimates on a loan obof tained at 3 per cent., and involving an inten terest charge of ^90.000 a vear. But I may go one better than that. .With a sum Of £3,000,000 we could provide a fleet of much eight steamers, and the annual interest: charge at 3J per cent, would come to £105,000. The Government propose to pay the Orient Steam Navigation Company an annual subsidy of £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 for a mail service. It will be seen that if we had our own fleet, and were paying an interest charge of £ 1 0 5 , 0 0 0 , there would be, as compared with the cost of this contract, a sum of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 a year for us to play with. If we established a sinking fund on a 2 per cent, basis, the annual contribution would be £ 6 o , o o o , and in ten years, at 3J per cent., it would amount to £ 7 3 5 , 0 0 0 , and we would be running our own steam-ships. I am here to-night to show the Government that they are making a bad bargainone which, if made by a boy of ten qr fifteen years of age, would result in his being sent to an asylum to be treated for softening of the brain. I have not a word to say about the Government, because they cannot help what they are doing. I want it to be distinctly understood that I am an out-and-out supporter of theirs. good thing for a Government to be criticised, because it is only by criticism that we can effect any reforms. If we do not call the attention of a man to his mistakes, he never can reform. Reformation of the Ministry is what we want. I wish them to get out of their fossilized ideas of going to the combines. At the end of ten vears, 1 repeat, we would have £ 7 3 5 , 0 0 0 in our sinking fund. Although we would be paying £ 1 0 5 , 0 0 0 a year as interest on the loan, still, we would be saving £ 5 , 0 0 0 a year out of the balance of £ 6 5 , 0 0 0. Money invested at 2 per cent, to-dav, if payable half-yearly, will double itself in thirty-four and a-half years. At the end of that period, with a sinking fund on a 2 per cent, basis, we would have extinguished our debt to the money lender. Out of the revenue from the steam-ships, we would be able to provide a repair fund, a renewal fund, a re-insurance fund, and a replacement fund. The line would be improved just as our other property is improved. At the end of thirty-five years the fleet would have been paid for, ancl paid for with, money which otherwise we would have been contributing to a steam-ship company to be used in building a line for itself. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia owe £243,000,000 when that kind of financing has been going on ? Is it any wonder that we are running into debt year after year, and do not know where we Mr King O'Malley. stand ? Uncier such a financial system we never will know where we stand. Of course, my honourable friends on the other side have heard supporters of the Government apologizing, and stating that the Orient Steam Navigation Companv say, "" Take it or leave it . """,73
659,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They should not approach this House like that.,74
660,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"My honourable friend is a thinking man, and so he is looking into this question very carefully. I only wish I could get this bogy of Socialism out of the minds of my honourable friends opposite. Well, sir, do I remember how they used to frighten me when I was a child. My grandmotherwho, by the way, was a Scotch womanused to say, "" Send him out to Botany Bay."" I was afraid of Botany Bay, and as soon as I landed in Sydney I went to see what sort of a place it was that had scared me for years. I found It is a that it was all right. The word Socialism frightens a number of honourable members. I ask them to get the bogy of Socialism out of their minds, and to look at this proposal just as a number of cold business men sitting round a table would do. When the great Beef Trusts of America were not in combination, a man could put his fat cattle on the trucks in the Western States, weigh them, and wire to Chicago, ""' Sell for me thirty thousand pounds of beef,"" and the next day he would receive a wire, "" Sold on the hoof; five cents."" He could take his wire to his banker and get an advance with which to carry on his business, because he knew exactly what he would receive for his cattle, less the leakage going to Chicago, 1,000 or 1,500 miles awav. As soon as ever the Fowlers and those men entered into a great combination that was all stopped, and a man had to send his cattle to Chicago. The buyer for one trust or other would go round, and say, "" They will not suit me."" My object in using this illustration is to show how the Government have been hoodwinked. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when the farmer saw that night was coming on, he realized that the trust owned the stockyards, the feed, and the water, and doublebanked him for pay. Then he would say to them: "" For goodness sake, what will you give me?"" They would not deal, and next day he would have to accept any price. Wherever a combination or trust exists, the country is cursed, and the producers are at its mercy. The same thing happened in the State of California. When the farmers went down to meet the railway people, the representative of the combination, with a cigar in his mouth, said: "" You are meeting combination. This is what we will carry your wheat for ; take it or leave it . "" And the farmers had to take it. The same thing happened in the case of the Canadian Pacific a few years ago in Manitoba. That line was transporting all the wheat from Manitoba to the seaboard. The farmers joined together and built a road from Manitoba to the United States line, and then there was a riot there, because they met another combination. Surely these things ought to weigh with honourable members. They are not representing the people conscientiously and justly if they fail in this House to exercise their intelligence for the benefit of the electors. What do the vast multitude of the people know about this matter? They selected honourable members because they believed that they were the best men to represent them, and that they would fight for their rights. I ask honourable members: Are you fighting for the rights of the producers of Australia when you allow this company to say, "" Our price is £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 ; take 'it or leave it ? "" The company say that they have never been able to pay a dividend, and that they cannot float a loan.",74
661,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"We sell the stamps for the letters which they carry. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The total revenue we get from that source is £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 a year, and in return we propose to give the company £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year. Is this business in Australia? I am afraid I have come to the wrong country.",75
662,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It is easy for the honourable member to go back.,75
663,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"N a y ; the scriptures enjoin us to go forth into the world, and preach the gospel to the heathen, and this state of things is heathenism. I am going to stay here and convert the honourable member, if possible. In the United States, we had a number of lines of steamships running to Louisiana, Texas, and oither States. There were fifty or sixty different lines, but they are all in one ring now, under Morse, and President Roosevelt has ordered the United States Attorney-General to enter an action against the trust. M i l lions of pounds of the people's money are going to the lawyers to try to burst up these rings. When we have such an opportunity, and it is proposed to lend .the financial power and credit of the Commonwealth to a private corporation tb float a loan, I ask, "" Why don't we do it ourselves?"" Let the Labour Party withdraw the name of Socialism, call it something else, but do it. I ' will surrender the name "" Socialism "" if another name will suit honourable members opposite. We might call it ""The Water Lily Rockbound,"" after my church. Let us enter into this contract, say for two years, for the carriage of the mails, and in the meantime start to build our own line. If that is regarded as socialistic, will honourable members help me if I move that we should buy a controlling interest in the Orient Steam Navigation Company ? Honourable members are fond of that company, and seem to feel that they are under a deep obligation to them, yet I found I had to pay just as much to them as to any other company when I wanted to travel.",75
664,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"We might buy a controlling interest in the company, as Disraeli did in the case of the Suez Canal. Mr KING O'MALLEY - About thirty years ago, Disraeli ""bought a controlling interest in the Suez Canal, and those shares are now paying dividends of 28 per cent, to Great Britain. If it was good, enough for Disraeli to take that action, honourable members should not be afraid to buy a controlling interest in this company with which they are all so much in love. I want to see Australia have a fleet. As soon as we have our own steam-ships, Canada, South Africa, India, and England will probably follow suit. The Union Jack will float over all those ships, and we shall have a practical Imperial Federation. Do honourable members opposite believe in the British Empire? Have they no faith in it? I was sorry to hear the right honourable member for Swan talk about wanting coloured men to man our ships.",75
665,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,The right honourable member for Swan did not say that.,75
666,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,He regretted that we could not employ coloured labour if we desired to.,75
667,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I wish to be fair. The name of the right honourable member for Swan will live in Australian history. He was a great explorer, and is a great man. He is a Britisher, who believes in the Empire. That is the kind of man I like. I .am going to say what I like here about the Empire, but when any outsider attacks it I shall be on the ining. side to fight the rooster outside. We reforms from within, and not from withas out. I do not believe in panic scares, a certain great nation in Europe has just voted j£i7,500,000 for additions to its tial trade. navy. I do not know what that is for, unless it is to look after one specific tion. If that is so; does any honourable member believe that blackfellows manning British ships will lick the white Europeans that - will man the ships of that great nation when the crash comes?",75
668,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The nation that the honourable member refers to does not allow dividualism. coloured aliens on its ships. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is quite true. I mention no names, because it is best for us not to name nations, or talk war with them. If there is a war, we can never fight the white men of Europe with the coloured men of India.",76
669,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Admira l ""Field, in House of Commons, said that it was imbe possible. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is what I say. Recently, when there was talk tice and righteousness. about the United States not being alcontrol lowed to do certain things, a fleet of teen battle-ships was ordered to Manila. Our trouble, if any, will come from the East, and, at the present time, the United lutely ruined. States is shouldering our burden for within us. But we cannot expect the help of the United States, or of any other nation, less we are prepared to help ourselves; and to do this there must be means of trainor ing white sailors in our merchant service. The northern States of America were full of sailors when the war broke out, because their flag was flying on merchant ships the world over; but in the south, there were no sailors, because there, dependence was placed on slavery. I am sorry think that in many countries patriotism is Tasmania. based on "" boodle,"" and public sentiment and opinion can be created and guided means of money. Boodle is the demonber strator of aristocratic patriotism. I admit that if we create a Commonwealth fleet mail ships, a great battle will have to fought for trade; but there is no need to depend on politicians to conduct business of this kind. We are at liberty to engage the best business talent in the country, in the same way as, if we were to establish the postal banking system that I adshe represented vocate, we should engage the services of those who are experienced in banknever Australia ought to be the leader of want the Mother Country and of Canada, but, a matter of. fact, we are behind the latbut ter place, as honourable members may gather from the facts in connection with preferenI f we adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, we nashall, at the end of ten years, have in our sinking fund £73S»ooo; and we shall be the owners of better ships than are now engaged in the service. If honourable members will not go that far, let us buy half of the interest in the new mail steamers, and thus have half socialism and half inI have to thank the honourable member for Franklin for calling my attention to an injustice which is inflicted upon Tasmania under this contract. The fruit-growers of Franklin and elsewhere in Tasmania have had to fight hard enough to keep their homes together, and it would be a serious matter for them if the mail ships should have it in their power to the decline to call at Hobart. There might a pliant Postmaster-General at the head of affairs, though I know that the present Minister is imbued with the spirit of jusI f there were in of the Department a PostmastersixGeneral inclined to meet the views of the shipping company in this connection, the fruit-growers of Tasmania would be absoMy contention is that, the four corners of this contract, it should be stipulated that the mail steamers unshall call at Tasmania six times a year, whether they may be specially wanted there not. There is the finest harbour in the world at Hobart, and the second finest is at Burnie. It will not do to leave this matter in the"" discretion of these gigantic all corporations, who have no souls to be damned or bodies to be punished. The trouble is that the Government do not seem to to have yet recognised the importance of That State entered Federation without making any special condition, by although, as we know, the honourable memfor Swan insisted on special terms for Western Australia. The fact is that at of the Federal Convention the antiquated rebe presentatives of Tasmania were asleep, and, as the other delegates had been taught to respect old age, they were allowed to sleep on. I can remember well as a boy, just when the Great Eastern came to America from England, and people declared that a piece of folly, and that vessels of her class would be able to reach New York without lightening their cargo. But the Great Eastern was only an infant compared with the Lusitania. What I am afraid of is that within the ten years during which this contract is to run",76
670,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Twelv e years. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Surely not? I was afraid to read the contract carefully, lest my conscience should turn against the Ministry. My feeling just now is that I should keep the members of the present Government in power until they die by effluxion of time. I do not wish to believe that they have been guilty of making such a bad bargain that I should be obliged to turn against them. I ask the Minister to say now whether he will have what I have suggested inserted in the contract?",77
671,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We should strike the proviso out.,77
672,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"If we strike out the proviso, this soulless corporation will say, "" O u r boats will not go to Tasmania unless you give us £ 4 , 0 0 0 or £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 , "" and we shall never see them unless we make some special arrangement of that kind.",77
673,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,We could leave the clause in and strike out the proviso.,77
674,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"If the honourable member means that we should insist upon these boats going to Hobart, I am with him ; but I want to have everything in black and white when I deal with a corporation, and I want to sleep on the contract for a week before I sign it , lest there should be some means by which the corporation could escape their obligations. I seriously object to the differential rates that are known as "" rebates."" bourne merchant is in a position to make more advantageous terms with the steamship companies than are granted to his competitors, he will destroy his rivals in trade as Rockefeller has done in the United States. One merchant might say, "" I shall ship my goods by your steamers, but if I do I shall expect a 30 per cent, rebate."" and the company might say, "" Very well ; we agree, and at the end of the year we will give you a rebate of 30 per cent, on the freight charged on your goods.""",77
675,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That kind of thing is done now. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is so; and it means that every small shipper must go to the wall. This practice of granting rebates has destroyed hundreds of business ' men in the United States, and by this means, within the last sixteen years, one huge corporation in that country has succeeded in plundering the people of £200,000,000, which has been paid out in dividends to the shareholders. There should be inserted in this contract provision for a heavy penalty against the granting of rebates. If honourable members say that those who feel injured might appeal to the Courts, that would involve the briefing and refreshing of barristers, the fight would be continued for years, and the citizens of Australia would lose whichever way the case went. I say that the responsibility to fight the steam-ship companies should not rest with the merchants, but with the Government.",77
676,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Everythin g we require should be contained within the four corners of the contract. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is what I say. I should insist upon this shipping corporation keeping out of rings so far as the trade of Australia is concerned. A good point was raised by an honourable member here today. Ships are leaving Australia now every week for England, and f ° £ 4 ; 0 0 ° a year we could get our mails r 0 carried under the poundage system. Forty thousand pounds a year for ten years, with interest at 3! per cent., would be about £ 4 8 5 , 0 0 0 . If we take £ 4 8 5 , 0 0 0 from £ 2 , 0 6 4 , 0 0 0, we have £1,579,000, which this Commonwealth could save by adopting the poundage system, and with which we could start to build our own steamships, and so to push on the federation of the British Empire. I want to do something for the Empire. If one Mel- I desire that years after we are dead and buried people shall be able to say, "" The Federal Parliament of Australia, at such and such a time, established the British Empire Steam-ship Company. They established a. line of steamers owned by the Commonwealth, and now State-owned vessels are to be found in every part of the Empire, carrying marines and training men."" Every man on board of these vessels would be both a soldier and sailor, and would be trained to shoot, to Jove the flag and the nation, and to fight for the nation. The talk we hear about individual liberty and personal liberty is ridiculous. When I lived among the Yaki Indians, in Mexico, I found they had individual liberty. They did as they liked. They stood on their heads naked if they pleased, and they danced the war dance on Sunday; but in civilized countries there is no such thing as individual liberty."" Let three or four honourable members stand at the corner of a street here, and the constable will tell them to move on. The liberty of the individual must be silenced as the liberty of the community advances.",77
677,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Eve n the Postmaster-General is not at liberty to make this contract. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is so; and we ought to bear with the Postmaster General. It is bad policy for men to come in here and denounce individuals. The policy and arguments of honourable members opposite may be bad, but they are not themselves bad. Let me ask honourable members to put the question of Socialism aside, and work for the nation. We should remember that we are not legislating for ourselves. I will be out of this in a few years, and most other honourable members will follow me, and I desire that the rising generation should be able to say, "" You put down the land-marks, and we are proud to follow on the lines you laid down. . Joe Cook, Wilks, and MCWilliams did this. It was good enough for them, and it is good enough for us to go on and improve upon them.""",78
678,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.14] - We have listened to practically the same debate for three nights running. We are dealing tonight with a. motion for the ratification of a mail contract. I mention the fact lest there should be some misunderstanding on the subiect. Last night we dealt with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , in connection with which the question of nationalization was raised, and the same arguments were used in discussing that question then. We are told that we have either to accept or reject the contract; that we cannot amend it.",78
679,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Then what is the object of discussing it?,78
680,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Honourable members may paid take the responsibility of rejecting it . . Mr Wilks - Apparentl y if we disshow approve of any part of the contract, that is the only course open to us. No honoris. able member has yet expressed entire aption proval of the agreement. Some honourable members are dissatisfied with the terms, others with the extent of the subsidy, and others again with the direction of the tract.",78
681,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"It contains forty-nine clauses, and objection has been taken only two short ones.",78
682,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Many of the clauses are comparatively unimportant. In his own grotesque style the honourable member for Darwin has presented a good many sound arguments to the House. I have always been opposed to subsidies and subventions. Under this contract the people of Australia are called upon to pay a large sum of money in order to provide-so far as the carriage of mails is concerned-for an accelerated service for the sole benefit of the mercantile community. To the average man a delay of two days in the delivery of a letter from the .dear Old Mother Land is a matter of no importance ; but those who call themselves anti-Socialists are asking the people to pay a subsidy to provide an accelerated mail service for one distinct class. We find, also, that this contract provides, not merely for the carriage of mails, but for the cheap and speedy transit of the products of cer-tain classes to the old world. It is both a mail and a commercial contract.",78
683,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,But does the contract provide for the cheap carriage of perishable products?,78
684,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If it does not the honourable member will be able to vote against it. If anti-Socialists are prepared to vote a large subsidy to a company to secure special freights for the carriage of perishable produce-for the benefit of primary producers-the n they are not far removed from the. Labour Party, who ask us to go a step further and nationalize this shipping service. I am absolutely opposed to its. nationalization. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Would not the honourable member meet us half wav ?",78
685,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No . ' If 1 had my way I should abolish the subsidy altogether, because I think that it is an improper impost upon thousands of the people of Australia who have no interest in this contract. At the end of ten years we shall have £ 1 , 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 by way of subsidy under this agreement, and shall have nothing to for it. And yet we are told that this is a good bargain. I do not think that it When the Reid-MCLean Administrasigned a contract for a mail service at a subsidy of £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum they were severely criticised, ancl yet some honourable members declare that a contract which conprovides for an increased subsidy of £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 per annum is an excellent one. I admit that the Orient Steam Navigation to Company has had a hard struggle in the Australian trade. This has been due to the fact that, unlike the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, it has not had an auxiliary trade. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company has an Eastern trade, its Australian trade being merely an auxiliary service, whilst the German line of mail steamers, which receive a national subsidy, has not only an Australian, but also a Western trade. Whether we give them a subsidy or not, they must, if they are to remain in . the Australian trade, have new boats. like the Orontes pay well; but a steamer like the O-phir, which came into prominence some years ago on being chartered to bring the Duke of York to Australia, pays only when it is being used for yachting cruises on the 'Mediterranean and elsewhere. It burns too much coal, and has too little cargo space to be able to compete successfully with vessels of large carrying capacity. It must be admitted that the Orient Steam Navigation Company have always laid themselves out more than the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company to cater for the Australian passenger and goods traffic, though the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company are not quite so conservative nor so swagger as they were some years ago. I give credit to the Orient Steam Navigation Company for what they have done for the Australian trade, and would rather they than any other got this contract. They have paid only four or five dividends; but, on the other hand, it must be remembered that their managerial and office expenses are very heavy. They have also had great losses, and suffer for lack of an auxiliary and feeding service. This is, however, an excellent bargain for them. / They are to get £1.70,000 a year for ten years, to do what they would have been compelled by competition to do in any case-to shorten the journey from England by fifty-eight hours. B.ut the public is being asked to pay too much for this gain. That would be admitted by any body of persons outside the mercantile community. The people at large will not be in favour of paying £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year merelv to get their letters from England fiftv-eight hours earlier. The days of subsidies have nearly gone. . A few years ago in England a strong effort was made to abolish subsidies; but - they were revived because Germany was - subsidizing German vessels, not to obtain mail services, but to assist in building up a navy, to encourage colonization, and to force her trade upon the outer world. The last mail contract has, after months of haggling, fallen through. The sum of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for which security was given has not yet been recovered.",78
686,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,We shall get it.,79
687,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I should like to know that it was safe in the Treasury. The honourable gentleman thought that he had made his position safe, but, although no Vessels one would call him a fool, or say that he could not see through a sharp deal, apparently those with whom he negotiated were too shrewd for him. Another objection I have to the proposed contract is that it is for too long a period. The right honourable member for Swan said that things would hardly get into working order before we should be thinking of renewii.g the contract, though afterwards he admitted that the term was a little too long. I do not know why we should not seek to amend this clause of the contract. Surely the Orient Steam Navigation Company are not in such a strong position that they can say that they will not consent to alter a mere draft agreement.",79
688,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,This is a signed contract.,79
689,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It has been signed merely subject to the approval of Parliament, and I do not see why Ministers should not accept amendments in it . I i Parliament amended it , they could draw up a fresh agreement, and say, Are you ; t prepared to accept the will of Parliament, or will vou forego the contract altogether""? No one can foretell the changes which the next twelve years may bring. The increased use of turbines, the substitution of oil for coal as a fuel, and other improvements are all tending to increase speed and to reduce cost, while the inventive genius of the world is directed towards discovering still further improvements. Another reason why I say that the term of the proposed contract is too long, is that we have no right to bind the public for twelve years. We do not know that before the end of that time there will not be a strong desire for the nationalization of.this service.",79
690,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The people would vote for it now, if there were a referendum.",79
691,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If my electors gave me any mandate, it was against nationalization, not only of the iron, but also of the shipping industry. All who stood as anti-Socialists must oppose nationalization in any form. I admit that the proposed experiment offers more probability of success than pthers that could be undertaken, because the possibilities of profit and loss are clearly ascertainable. If we mence an enterprise of this kind, we shall have to continue it . But, apart altogether from my objection to nationalization, I am opposed to the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier on the ground that we have already too many public servants in Australia. I can remember when the foremost radicals of the Labour Party in New South Wales used to speak of the civil servants as parasites, as men in easy billets, who do little for the money they draw. do not wish to add another Department to the Commonwealth Public Service. I do not want to make Australia a gigantic civil service. It is believed that five-sixths of the public service now vote for labour candidates, which mav be the reason why the Labour Party defends the service so stoutlv.",79
692,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,We want to raise the standard of wages.,80
693,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I admit that our public servants, generally speaking, do their work well ; but I do not think that we should create more. Those who are in favour of spending £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year to get a quicker mail service for the mercantile community, and to obtain lower freights and better conditions for the shippers of primary produce, are sailing perilously near to nationalization. By supporting a proposal of this kind, they are supporting a proposal for extending the sphere of governmental activity. While they are desirous of spending the people's money in the interest of the mercantile and commercial classes, the Labour Party have a right to ask that the interests of the masses shall also be considered. Coming now to the labour question, I have always been an advocate for the employment of white labour. I have differed from my leader upon that subject. I am absolutely in accord with that portion of the agreement which renders the employment of white labour upon our mail steamers compulsory. My reason is that Australia has vet to build uo her mercantile marine and her naval forces, and she cannot accomplish these things unless she provides employment for her own seamen. To-day Great Britain experiences considerable difficulty in manning her vessels with people of our own race. I have heard it said that the coloured alien makes a better fireman than does the white man. Speaking with some knowledge of the subject, I say that he does not. But the truth is that the lascar is more amenable to discipline. If one were to ask an engineer once comon board our mail steamers what class of firemen he preferred, his answer would always be in favour of the white man twenty-four hours after the vessel had left port. For the first twenty-four hours the white man is disposed to be rather restive, but after that he settles down to his work and is in reality equal to three coloured men. Take the case of Britain's warships by way of illustration.. Are they manned by coloured firemen? The stokehold of IH . M . S . Powerful is, I venture to say, from seven to eight degrees hotter than are the stoke-holds in our mail steamers. Yet none save white men are employed there. It is merely a question of the payment of a standard wage. One of the redeeming features of the Orient Steam Navigation Company has been that up t ill very recently they voluntarily manned their vessels with white labour. When the Labour Party in this House submitted their proposal in favour of the nationalization of our mail 1 service they knew very well that it would not be carried. Had they desired to carry it, why did they not submit it in the Senate, where they have a majority? The Government would then have had either to accept or reject it. To those who talk so much about Socialism and Christianity, I would commend the statement of a German writer",80
694,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,German y again !,80
695,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Nearl y all authoritative authors upon Socialism are Germans. The writer whom I have in mind declared that the great distinction between Christianity and Socialism wns that the former means "" Mine is thine,"" whilst the latter means "" Thine is mine.""",80
696,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,He knew a great deal about Socialism.,80
697,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Undoubtedl y he did. There are honourable members of this House who were as well versed in the subject of Socialism twenty years ago as is the honourable member today. I shall move That the following words be added to the motion, "" Subject to the inclusion in the Agreement of a clause providing that whenever practicable the mail steamers shall be docked in Australia."" Now the words "" whenever practicable ' r do not imply that we have first to inquire whether we have the necessary docking accommodation. There is no doubt that we have. There are two docks to my knowledge which can accommodate the largest ships trading with Australia. They will accom? modate H . M . S. Powerful, which draws more water going over the sill than do the mail steamers. The Postmaster-General is nominally responsible, though the contract was laicl before the House by the Prime Minister. The honourable gentleman himself said nothing on its behalf. But if we insert conditions for the benefit of the commercial community, it is only fair that Australia should have the benefit of some of the docking. I do not ask that the vessels shall be docked here during their periodical overhauling. What I mean is simply that whenever practicable they shall be docked in Australia.",80
698,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The company could not do it as a regular thing. There would not be time.,81
699,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The vessels spend the same period in port at this end as they do in London. The ex-Postmaster-General would not insert a provision as to docking in the last contract, but he secured a verbal undertaking from the contractors. Cannot the present Postmaster-General do that?",81
700,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The company will do their best, but they will not include a provision in the contract. Mr Wilks , - I simply mean that the ships should be docked here whenever practicable. My desire is that Australia shall have its share of the docking. Those who are protectionists and believe in the employment of our own labour should support me in this respect, because I can assure them that there are thousands of people who would every year make something out of the docking of the vessels here. The honourable member for Lang has moved a very useful amendment, which I shall support. He asks that the term of the contract shall be reduced to seven vears. That should be quite enough. Surelv the companv do not require a guarantee of ten years before they will undertake the contract.",81
701,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They do.,81
702,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is not to be supposed that the Orient Steam Navigation Company intend to go out of the Australian trade. They intend to fight for business as hard as they can. The mere fact of reducing the term from ten to seven years will not vitiate the agreement. But we shall be able to .make fresh arrangements both as to freights and fares if we provide for the shorter term. I do not think that the Australian public will receive an adequate recompense for the £1,700,00 0 which they will pay to this company in the ten years. At the end of the period we shall have nothing to show for our money. I quite agree with the honourable member for Barrier in that respect, though I am not Prepared to vote for nationalization, which would mean creating another branch of the Public Service. But if the Labour Party increase in power, they may desire to submit a scheme for a national steam-ship service before the end of ten years. Why should they be clewed for so long a period ?",81
703,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We can buy the ships at any time.,81
704,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Yes ; at a price.,81
705,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Of course; we could not get them without a price.,81
706,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I mean that we can buy them at the company's own price.,81
707,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The price will be fixed by arbitration.,81
708,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I was not aware of that, which is a fair condition. I again ask honourable members to support me in regard to the docking conditions, which might be made the subject of a supplementary agreement.",81
709,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We will try to get all we can for the honourable member.,81
710,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Why not embody the condition in an agreement?,81
711,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We cannot do that; the honourable member must know that this contract has only been arrived at after enormous struggle and toil.,81
712,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We l l , there is not a Bill which Parliament considers that is not the result of enormous struggle and toil. But do we trouble about that? We simrjly slash Bills to pieces if we do not like them.",81
713,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The company will not drop it ; they have too good a thing on.,81
714,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The House has either to accept this agreement or reject it .,81
715,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"V e r y well, then, if the Minister talks like that, let us reject it.",81
716,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that he would vote for rejecting this contract?,81
717,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Yes , if we cannot get it in the form that we desire; and then throw out the Government for agreeing to it.",81
718,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable .member and his party are not strong enough to do that.,81
719,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I begin to think that the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs are the champion bluffers of Australia. I used to think that our Christian friend, the Postmaster General, was too sincere to be a bluffer, but I have changed my opinion after his attempt to make us believe that the Orient Steam Navigation Company would throw up a good thing for the small detail which I am asking for. NOAV, the Labour Party either mean business or they do not. Are they serious in regard to their amendment?",82
720,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Nationalizatio n means, of course, throwing out the whole contract.",82
721,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Does the Minister say that we cannot alter a word of it?,82
722,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I say that the House has either to accept it or reject it. If the House votes for nationalization it means rejection.,82
723,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Surely the Minister does not mean to say that a little amendment providing for the docking of ships would cause the Orient Steam Navigation Company to surrender their contract? It is absurd.,82
724,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Such , an amendment would vitiate the contract, because we should have to go all over the ground again. Then we should have to wait until the Senate met, send home to London, and make an entirely fresh arrangement.",82
725,Mr WILKS,Unknown,We are not children. The Postmaster-General is not talking to a Sunday School now.,82
726,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Unfortunately , I know that perfectly well.",82
727,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I wish he would recognise it, and not talk so childishly about this matter. The representatives of the Orient Steam Navigation Company signed this agreement on the distinct understanding that it was subject to the approval of Parliament. It is not a live document until it has been approved by Parliament. How can \ve vitiate something which is not alive? I think I now understand why the Postmaster-General has neither attempted to explain this agreement nor to defend it. Had he done so, he would have made a. ten times more miserable job of it than he has done by his interjections. I now understand why the Honourable Samuel Mauger merely lent his name to this document, whilst the Prime Minister did all the work, and he is well advised by the Cabinet.",82
728,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,It is a fair division of labour.,82
729,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is so far as the Postmaster-General is concerned. I am not at all surprised at the Cabinet saying to him, "" Drop the contract on the table; do not attempt to say a word about it . "" I ask honourable members are they so childish as - to believe that the mere carrying of any amendment, except that of the honourable member for Barrier, is going to vitiate the contract? I hope that my amendment will be carried.",82
730,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [9-55]'-I "" a deliberative and statutebuilding assembly like this we can hardly expect arguments to have any effect. If they had any effect our proposal to establish a national mail service would have been carried by this time. I feel very disappointed, because I had hopes that the age of reason would come in my time. In putting off the acceptance of our proposal for twelve years the Commonwealth will lose a golden opportunity of building ancl owning a mail fleet. Like all Heavenbom politicians, I had an idea as well as other honourable members. I believedalthough I may be called Utopian for holding the opinion-that Ave had a splendid opportunity of not only oAvning a mail fleet, but also combining in that fleet part of our defence from the sea stand-point.",82
731,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Le t us run the steamers as torpedo boats.,82
732,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member may run a wheelbarrow for a torpedo boat for all I care. I am endeaA'ouring to express Avhat I consider common-sense. In vieiv of the fact that the nations of Europe have been subsidizing their mail boats to act as auxiliary fleets, is it out of the Avay to imagine that Australia could build and OAvn a fleet of mail steamers which coulcl when required act as cruisers? What could be better for us, so far distant as Ave are from the Old World, than to own mail steam-ships able to act as cruisers or menof-war, and to defend themselves when carrying the commerce of Australia ? There is nothing far-fetched in that idea. It can be grasped, I suppose, by ex'en the most dense member either here or elsewhere. We are asked to sanction an annual expenditure of £170,000, and I believe that £120,000 of that sum Would be lost. For what purpose? To carry the mails a little more quickly, and to gix'e a little Socialism to those who say that they do not want it, namely, the commercial men. That is what it really means. The commercial men who are represented in the Opposition corner, on the Opposition benches, and also, I believe, on the Government benches, and who have always decried any proposal with, a socialistic tendency, will under this very contract get as large a slice of Socialism as they can hope to get in one bite.",82
733,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It does not make them sick, either.",83
734,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"It would take a lot of that kind of Socialism to make the commercial men of Australia sick. We have heard a great deal here concerning our sea-going defence, and the building of cruisers. We are told that we are wasting time in that regard, and that if we attempt to do anything different from what is done by the Mother Country, we shall be doing something wrong. Perhaps if we built a fleet of ships for both mail and commercial purposes, the commercial men might say, "" We will not give you any assistance."" 1 suppose that those who had butter, meat, and wool to send Home would not employ Governmentowned ships, because they do not believe in Socialism when it operates against their class.",83
735,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,But they would have to pay just the same.,83
736,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Yes. Seeing the State is engaged in the carriage of goods throughout Australia by land, what great stretch of imagination is it to suppose that it could operate in that direction on water, in spite of all the opposition which might be offered to its boats? There is one point on which the honourable member for Barrier and I will always differ. During his address, he expressed the opinion that the mail ships of the Commonwealth must be built in the Old Country', as there was no possible chance of getting them built in Australia. Some honourable members remarked that the boats could be built here at a price, and the price seemed to bar their local construction. Suppose that it did cost Australia £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 more per boat to have the fleet built here? We shall have to start building our boats at some time or other. Could a start in that direction be made at a better time than when the Commonwealth Government, in making this contract, and bringing into existence a fleet in respect of which the people of Australia will pay an annual subsidy of £ 1 7 0 . 0 0 0 for ten years? I could have no objection to honourable members on the other side, like the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Parramatta, ooposing the local construction of mail boats. But when T see protectionists who at other times say that we can do this and that in Australia joining sides with those who ""say that we cannot at any time build ships, I am deeply disappointed. If we do not make a start we never will build any ships. It was on that point that I differed from the honourable member for Barrier.",83
737,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,1 hold that at present it is impossible.,83
738,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,To the mechanics of Australia nothing is impossible. They can do anything which can be done in any other part of the world.,83
739,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Mov e an amendment.,83
740,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member is again at his wheel-barrow torpedo boat. I suppose that if there were some fishing boats to be constructed here he might be more interested. I believe that I am striking a note. We could despatch our mails on the poundage system by various steamers trading to our ports, and if we are not ready now to enter upon the construction of a Federal fleet, perhaps in two or three years we might be prepared to take that step. Is there an honourable that member who. does not believe that during the next ten years the commercial world, and the sea-going boats may be revolutionized? Here we are asked to commit the Commonwealth' to a contract service for a period of ten years, and to forego an opportunity, which may not recur for a period of fifty years, of bringing into existence a fleet which would be beneficial not only to the commercial classes, but also to the men who are looking for work whereby they may earn a living. I do not wish to discuss this matter at all exhaustively, but I had hoped that before the ' expiration of twelve years Australia would cease to be dependent upon a private corporation for the carriage of its mails. We have been told by the Government that we must either accept the contract or leave it alone. I shall vote against their motion. Those who wish to see any amendments made in the contract will, of course, do just as they like. I believe that in voting for its ratification honourable members will be foregoing an opportunity which Australia will not have until the expiration of twelve years. I shall not be one of those who will vote to throw away a glorious opportunity to benefit the people of Australia, especially the workers.",83

If there has been anything which was likely to convert honourable members to the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier it has been the blundering and muddling in connection with those three contracts. The first contract submitted to the House in my time was made by Mr Sydney Smith, as Postmaster-General, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. I was one of the few members supporting the then Government who opposed its ratification, believing that it was not a satisfactory one. ,ever, it was approved. what is known as the "" Croker contract,"" which, in my opinion, should not have been submitted to the House, because it was a bit of syndicate-mongering from start to finish. We all remember the eulogistic - terms in which it was recommended for .our approval. How is the present contract submitted? Honourable members are told by the Government, "" Here is the .contract. You can discuss its provisions, but if you alter a word in them it will be withdrawn.""",83
742,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,Let draw it ! Who cares ?,84
743,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I agree with the honourable member. That is not the way - in which a contract of this kind should have been presented to the representatives of the States for their approval.,84
744,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,On e would think that the syndicate was greater than Parliament.,84
745,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Accordin g to the Government, this Parliament, representing the whole of the people of Australia, is to go down on its knees to a company because the company may say, "" If you do not take the contract which we now offer we will withdra.w it, and you cannot get a contract anywhere else."" That is mere empty bluff. Let any one analyze the figures, and see whether or not the contract is one that the company will withdraw fromWe are to pay the company £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 a year for ten years. They are to build five new boats, at an estimated cost of £ 3 0 0 , each.

The five new boats will £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , interest upon which, at cent., is £ 7 5 , 0 0 0 per annum. quently we are giving the company the other States? £ 9 5 , 0 0 0 per year after making them a present of their boats. That is the contract in which we are told that the Commonwealth is making such a splendid deal that if a word of it is altered it will be rejected, and we'shall have to go down on our knees to the company. If the contract is not altered, I "" shall be one to assist to the utmost of my ability to give the company , an opportunity of saying what they will do if we refuse to accept it .",84
746,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,It is a triumph for Mr. Mauger! How- Mr Mauger - That is what the Senate Then we had said.,84
747,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We are not here to discuss what the Senate said or did. It is hardly necessary to deal with that aspect of the case any longer, because the figures speak for themselves. We are asked to tie the hands of the Commonwealth, by the interim contract and the new contract, for twelve years, although it has been pointed out very forcibly that, within that period, the whole of the commercial relations of Australia with the rest of the world may be entirely revolutionized. Even if that happens, there will be no them withpossibility of our getting out of the payment of this large sum, and the rates which we fix now are to be quite unalterable. The contract is not a good one; it is altogether in favour of the company; it is an exceedingly bad one, from a financial stand-point, for the people of Australia, and I protest once more against such a proposal being thrown on the table without a word of explanation, while this House, representing; the people of Australia, - is told that it must not alter a comma lest the company drop the contract. One very important point, which it was the bounden duty of the Postmaster-General to explain to the House, has not been touched upon yet. We are fixing in this contract for the first time maximum rates for the mail company to charge for the carriage of produce, and we are also preventing any differential charges being made as between the different States.",84
748,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Does the honourable 0 0 0 member think that there should be differ,84
749,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I do not say so. I am referring to the conditions in the conrun tract. Who is to allot the space among, the cost States? Who is to prevent any man or 5 per company in one State from contracting for Consethe whole of the space, to the detriment of",84
750,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Who prevents that now,85
751,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Do I understand the Postmaster-General to say that there to be no regulation in this regard, and that we are to fix the maximum charges and leave it to any speculator to contract the whole space, thus putting the profruit is concerned. ducers of Australia at his mercy? Is provision made for a. fair distribution the space, so that the producer, in whose interest these conditions are inserted, not the middleman, may get the benefit? If there is no such provision, the House should be doubly careful before ratifying the agreement. A very serious responsitage bility will rest upon the Postmaster-General in this regard. There is only way in which the contract can be carried out. For instance, provision is made for the carriage of butter. If New South Wales exports half the butter from Austrasays. lia, half the space, and no more, should be allotted to her. If Victoria exports one-third, she should have one-third of space, and no more. Other States should have their fair share reserved for them, and speculators in the larger centres should be prevented from mopping up the space and blackmailing the producers elsewhere before they can touch it.",85
752,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Does the honorwhich, able member contend that we should rent the fruit-grower. all the space and take the risk of filling it?",85
753,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If we compel company to provide a certain amount of space and fix the charges in the interests of the producers, the Postmaster-General should see that each contributing State ceives fair play. The Government have that now interfered in ""these matters. I do say that they should rent the space and distribute it. But unless they see that each contributinrr State gets fair plav, the State which has the first port of call will .have the others at its mercy.",85
754,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Has that ever happened,85
755,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We have never omitted. had conditions such as these before. Hitherto, there has been fair open competition between the States, who have bargained privately for their own space, and secured it.",85
756,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,They can do part that now.,85
757,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That interjection shows that the Government have not given the subject the slightest consideration. The States cannot do it now, because ? vernment have fixed in the agreement the maximum charges which can be made, and is there will be no possibility of competition. I give the Government credit for the maximum charges which they have fixed, and for which are distinctly favourable so far as no Mr Mauger - Are they not favourable ii» of the case of butter?",85
758,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The advantage is and not nearly so great in the case of butter. There are companies now carrying butter from Australia at a lower rate than is fixed in the agreement, so that the advanas regards butter is not appreciable.",85
759,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,All ' the butter one fair experts say the contrary.,85

762,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That is at the option of the Government. This is the first time that the mail boats have been bound to call at Hobart; and, apparently, the honourable member is trying to prevent that of the contract from being carried out.",85
763,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The Minister of Trade and Customs is trying to draw me off the track. The proviso is an absolute sham, because it will really place the fruitthe Gogrowers at a disadvantage.  member think that the six 'Tasmanian senators are as much interested in Tasmania as he is?",85
764,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Maranoa were acquainted with the facts, he would know that one of the - Tasmanian senators proposed that this proviso should be omitted, but, unfortunately, the other Tasmanian senators had already spoken and could not second the amendment.",86
765,Mr QROUCH,Unknown,"Whateve r the senators did, the honourable member has his duty to perform.",86
766,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Precisely ; I am trying to do what is right; and what the Senate may or may not have done does not influence me. In this matter Ministers have acted in absolute ignorance of a trade which they are attempting to regulate. For the last seventeen years the mail steamers have been chartered by the fruit growers themselves.,86
767,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"And the fruit growers in Tasmania have taken all the space, and left none for other producers.",86
768,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,That is not so. What I desire is that the Postmaster-General shall so act that the producers of no one State shall receive more than their fair share.,86
769,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That cannot be done unless we take the whole of the space.,86
770,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Ye s it can. The contract, in this connection, is vague in the States. extreme, and shows a lack of knowledge of the business.",86
771,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister invited the States to co-operate, and they all declined.",86
772,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Of course they did, because this is a matter which can be better managed by the States than by the Federal Government; and the terms of the contract proves that to be the case. For the last seventeen years the calls by mail boats at Hobart have averaged eleven per annum.",86
773,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"That means eleven calls between the two lines of steamers, whereas now there will be twelve C&llSi",86
774,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Of course, if the fruit-growers choose, they could charter the boats to call all the year round. Surely Ministers are not going to take credit for the fact that calls have been made at Hobart by mail boats chartered by the fruit growers at their own expense? I desire to show the danger of this proviso. Occasions might arise when it would be easy for the shipping company to show that it would be unprofitable to call at Hobart. There is one maximum scale of charges for all ports; and the boats which are compelled to call at Adelaide and Melbourne may dispose of all their available space at those ports, and then, of course, there would be no inducement to go to Hobart-in other words, it would be unprofitable to go.",86
775,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Would that not be the case if there was no contract at all?,86
776,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If there was no contract, the fruit-growers could charter the steamers as they have done in the past, without any Government interference; and they are quite prepared to do so. The terms of the contract show, I am sorry to say, that the Treasurer has failed to grasp the situation. The contract makes it impossible for the Tasmanian producers to charter the boats, because a maximum charge of 60s. has been fixed, and, of course, no vessel can be chartered at over that rate. We cannot suppose that a mail boat, which could fill up at Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney would steam 400 or 500 miles in order to pick up cargo at the same rate. The fruit growers of Tasmania have hitherto been able to obtain the mail boats, because, having the larger quantity to ship, they were able to outbid the producers of other",86
777,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Now the honourable member has let the cat out of the bag!,86
778,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"This contract opens the door to secret commissions, as an inducement for the mail boats to call at Hobart.",86
779,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Is not the honourable member's'argument in favour of a differential rate for Tasmania ?,86
780,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Somebody would have to make it worth the while of the agent to decide that it would be profitable for the boats to visit Hobart. I object to Tasmania being placed in this position when the boats are to call ar the ports of the other States free.,86
781,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Not at Fremantle.,86
782,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Fremantl e is notplaced in the same position as Hobart. It is not necessary under this contract to show that it would be profitable for the boats to go to Fremantle before they are obliged to call at that port. Tasmania, under the contract, will pay £ 6 , 8 0 0 towards the subsidy, and if the boats are to call at Hobart only six times we shall be paying more per trip than any other State in the Commonwealth.",86
783,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,But Tasmania will get her mails all the year round.,87
784,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That applies to the other States also. We are willing to make the contribution for which we are asked under this contract if we have a guarantee that the boats will call at Hobart. The honourable member for Darwin illustrated the difficulty under which our exporters would Suppose one of these boats is due at Hobart on 27th February. ple who have f r u it to export must bring it to the wharf at Hobart, and I remind honourable members that it would be absolutely worthless for anything but export to England. It would be picked at an early stage to ripen on the voyage. It would not be in a marketable condition for sale in Tasmania or in Australia, and if it is not shipped to London it might just as well be thrown into the sea. If the proviso to which I take exception were allowed to remain, there would be no certainty that the f r u it brought to the wharf at Hobart would be shipped for London. Contracts for the carriage of f r u it have to be made twelve months in advance. We make our contracts in Tasmania in November for shipment in the following year. Under these conditions those who have frui t to export would have to bring it to the wharf at Hobart without knowing until, perhaps, the very last moment, whether the mail-ship would call for it or not. I ask honourable members to see that justice is done to Tasmania in this matter. We do not want the boats to call all the year round, because we have not trade for them, but we have been getting them to call at our own expense for the last seventeen years. If the Government were passing a mail contract pure and simple for the carriage of mails between England and Adelaide, the first port at which the advantage of railwav communication could be availed of, we should be content; but the Government are proposing something more than a mail contract. They are proposing that we should give a very large subsidy, not merely for the carriage of mails, but also in order to subsidize the export trade in perishable products-for that is what this contract means-and that being so, I ask that in the name of common justice all the States should be put on the same footing.",87
785,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Tasmani a will be on a better footing than Victoria and South Australia, because the boats will go direct from Sydney to Hobart.",87
786,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Tasmani a will not be on a better footing than the States referred to so long as we are left to the mercy of any one who may ring into this contract something that is not there. No business men wouldsign a contract containing the proviso to which I take exception. In making a contract, the terms of the labour. service for which we are paying should be definitely stated, and we should, in this The peo- contract, provide for a definite service to the principal ports of all the States in Australia. Last year I fought to the best of my ability to prevent the continuance of what I believed to be an injustice to Queensland. That State was at the time called upon to bear her proportion of the subsidy without getting the benefit of the service. I am glad to see that under this contract justice is to be done to Queensland, and I ask that Tasmania should be placed in the same position.  desire that we should assist him to strike out the proviso to which he has referred ?",87
787,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Yes .,87
788,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member does not wish the boats to go to Tasmania at all.,87
789,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I hope the Minister of Trade and Customs will not attempt to mislead the honourable member for Maranoa. In answer to the honourable member's question, I say that I wish to retain the clause, and to strike out the proviso. In the clause it is provided that the boats shall go six times a year to Hobart, whilst the proviso says that if the company can show that it would not be profitable for the boats to call at Hobart, the Postmaster-General shall be at liberty to relieve them of the obligation to call. I say that the proviso would place Tasmania . in a worse position than she is in now, because until the last minute our exporters would not know whether a boat was going to call in at Hobart or not, and whether the perishable produce brought to the wharf could be got away.",87
790,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,If the frui t were on the Hobart wharf that would be a good reason why the boats should call there.,88
791,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The whole of their space might have been applied for by the exporters of f r u it from Victoria and South Australia, and in that case the companv could claim that it would not be profitable for the boat to call at Hobart.",88
792,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,But they would visit Tasmania before they called at Melbourne or Adelaide.,88
793,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman overlooks the fact that it is a question of whether the space on the boats is taken up or not. These boats will not call at a port to find out whether they could get cargo. Under existing conditions we apply for the space we require for the shipment of frui t twelve months in advance of shipment. We have had eleven boats calling at Hobart annually during the last seventeen years at our own expense, but this contract by providing for maximum charges would prevent our shippers from arranging a private charter.",88
794,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Would prevent them from quoting differential rates.,88
795,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,And from securing shall movea monopoly. Sir JOH N EORREST - The member wants all the space.,88
796,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No , the honourable member is telling a deliberate untruth.",88
797,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,88
798,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I withdraw it , but I am very glad I got it in.",88
799,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw the statement unreservedly.,88
800,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I withdraw it unreservedly.,88
801,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Can the honourable member not see that the whole year's trade must be unprofitable, and not one trip only?",88
802,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I answer the honourable member by saying that our f r u it season does not last for more than three months. If the frui t is not handled within that time we can get no market for it in London. It has been said that we want the whole of the space. ""We do not. We are prepared to take our share, but let me tell honourable members that last year, whilst the whole of the rest of Australia shipped 160,000 cases of f r u it , Tasmania alone shipped 540,000 cases.",88
803,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Where the trade is the ships will go.,88
804,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They will if there is fair competition. I wish the Minister to remember that the space provided by these mail boats is not sufficient to carry more than one-fourth or one-fifth of our yearly export of fruit.,88
805,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Then there is not the faintest danger that anything injurious to Tasmania will happen ?,88
806,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,How can the honourable member say that? He has overlooked the fact that competition under this contract will be closed.,88
807,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member wants a differential rate for Tasmania.,88
808,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I want no differential rate.,88
809,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What does the honourable member want?,88
810,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I desire that the contract shall provide that the boats shall call at Hobart six times a year, and that it shall be out of the power of any one to interfere with that arrangement. I That the proviso to clause 8 be omitted from honourable the contract.",88
811,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [10.35] Looking carefully through this contract, I find that Fremantle has been mentioned in it in a casual kind of way, although it has been pointed out to-night that it is the third port in Australia.",88
812,Mr GROOM,Unknown,In what sense?,88
813,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fro m the point of view of the value of its imports and exports. Western Australia has produced gold of the value of nearly £80,000,00 0 in addition to other minerals, and yet the Ministry who are supposed to represent the Commonwealth, in drawing up this contract, have practically forgotten it . Several important clauses contain no reference to it, whilst in others it is only casually, mentioned.",88
814,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"What does the honourable member mean by ""casually"" mentioned?",88
815,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I maintain that Western Australia s'hould receive the same consideration as is extended to other States. For the last five years, Western Australia has sent to the eastern States £ 1 , 0 0 0 per day in money orders, and yet she has been forgotten.",88
816,Mr GROOM,Unknown,What is the honourable member's point?,89
817,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"That Fremantle has scarcely been treated as an Australian port; it is put in the same category as Colombo.  vice must call at Fremantle. - Mr HEDGES - No . Under this agreement, on the completion of the Panama Canal, the route may be altered. I have signed hundreds of contracts and have been a party to big arbitrations, and have no hesitation in saying that this is one of the most loosely-worded agreements that I have ever read. In connection with arbitration proceedings, I have known meanings to be read into clauses that at the time that the contracts in which theiy were embodied were signed, were believed to mean practically nothing. In clause 3 of this contract, we have the provision thatOn each inward and outward voyage respectivelyeach of such mail ships shallproceed to call at and start from the following intermediate ports or places, namely, Colombo and Fremantle. As I have said, Colombo and Fremantle are placed in the same category. The Government seem to have forgotten that Fremantle is the port for the larger half of Australia.",89
818,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,What provision would the honourable member have inserted in the clause from which he has quoted?,89
819,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I should have applied common-sense to the drafting of the agreement. I have never seen a more looselydrawn contract. The provisions of one clause are contradicted by another, and heaven only knows how this agreement will be construed if one of the parties to it has ever to fight to the bitter end. In sub-clause 5 of clause 4 it is provided that the contractorsshall commence each outward voyage (that is to the United Kingdom) of the said mail ship from Brisbane, calling at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. Both Fremantle and Hobart are not mentioned. Then again, sub-clause 7 of clause 4 provides thatEach of the mail ships on each call at laide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, in pursuance of this agreement, shall remain in each of such ports for such periods as may be reasonably necessary to discharge cargo and to receive cargo, including butter and fruit. I think I am fairly entitled to ask why no reference is made in that provision to Hobart or Fremantle. A very large quantity of fruit is annually shipped from Hobart and Fremantle, and within the next twelve years, more fruit will be exported from Fremantle than from any Tasmanian port. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No .",89
820,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Some apple-growers in Western Australia last year produced from 10,000 to 14,000 cases each. During the last month, thousands of frozen lambs have been shipped from Fremantle, and yet the contract does not require space to be set apart for the carriage of frozen meat or fruit from that port. Mr KING O'MALLEY - These mail steamers are generally fully loaded before they reach Fremantle. The honourable 1 member should move an amendment.",89
821,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fiv e years hence, the construction of the Panama Canal will have been completed, and the route may then be changed.",89
822,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; it will not be completed within the next five years.,89
823,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I think that it will be. Coming to the amendment, I may say at once that I am not in favour of nationalizing this service. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Would the honourable member meet us half way and let us have a partly State-owned, and partly individualistic service.",89
824,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I would not. It would be a mistake to try to run a Commonwealth line of mail steamers. * Government railways have no competition to face, and wear and tear and deterioration are not so serious matters with them as with a steamship line. Besides, if a vessel bumps into anything, she is probably lost altogether.",89
825,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"As a business man, would the honourable member let his vessels go uninsured?",89
826,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The honourable member for Darwin did not mention insurance. The honourable member for Wide Bay, in speaks ing on the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, said many nasty things against private enterprise; but I claim that private enterprise has made the British nation. The ships that carry the Ade- commerce of the world and the warships of the world-eve n some of those of Germany - hav e been built by private enterprise in Great Britain.",89
827,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,There are very big Government dock-yards in Great Britain.,89
828,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Yes ; but the British Government gets its warships built by private enterprise, and I am proud to be a Britisher. Britishers know more about shipbuilding and shipping than anv other nation in the world, and if it were wise for the Government to have fleets of merchantmen as well as fleets of war vessels, Government would have such fleets. Honourable members talk a lot of "" highfalutin"" about Socialism; but they forget that if we had an Australian merchant fleet we should require an Australian squadron to protect it from insult. No foreigner dare insult merchantmen flying the Union Jack.  there be than the action of the Russians in firing on a fishing fleet?",89
829,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I had no sympathy with the Russians in what they did then. It is very easy for honourable members who have never been in business mercial enterprises. It is easy for men who have never done anything in the world to say what they would do if they had the handling of other men's business. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I would take on any business proposition in competition with the honourable member, and, for all his cleverness, get the shirt off his back.",90
830,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the honourable member for Darwin not to interrupt. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Are the members of the Labour Partv constantly to be insulted by being told that they know nothing? Honourable members will turn this into a fighting shop if they make such remarks.,90
831,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"When a man finds a gold reef he soon ceases to be a Socialist. Mr KING O'MALLEY -- I have a bigger mine than any that the honourable member ' possesses, and it pays me, too. I own it myself.",90
832,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The honourable member in his speech used so many figures that I could not put them all down. A countryman of his once impressed it upon me that figures could not lie, "" but,"" he added, "" look out when liars take to figuring."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - What figures of mine does the honourable member challenge ?",90
833,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The honourable member told us how many boats he could build for a certain amount of money,, what sinking fund he would establish, and how long it would take him to repay the outlay; but he failed to fell us where he would get the money in the first instance. If £4,000,000 were to be wrung from the people in extra taxation they would be so impoverished that they will have no need for a mail fleet. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I said £3,000,000, and I spoke about borrowing the British the money in England.",90
834,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The honourable member got quite wild at the thought of the British people running an Australian mail service, and yet he proposed to go to Great Britain to borrow money to enable us to run boats of our own. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I could borrow ir, America or France.",90
835,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Americ a wants all her money just now.,90
836,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,It seems to me rather strong to propose to borrow money to enter into competition with the person from to criticise comwhom you borrow. Mr KING O'MALLEY - All that the money lenders would trouble about would be their interest.,90
837,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,We are sending money Home now.,90
838,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,We shall have to send a lot more Home during the next ten years.,90
839,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There is no more solvent country in the world than Australia.,90
840,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"The honourable member's interjection suggests that I am saying that the country is not solvent. But all my speeches, both in this chamber and outside, prove that I hold the opposite view. What we owe is nothing compared with our assets. In conclusion, I wish to impress upon the Government the desirableness of seeing that Fremantle is better treated than it will be under the terms of this contract. Since the agreement was made public, I have received many wires from that centre, expressing dissatisfaction with the treatment which has been accorded it. I cannot support the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, and, therefore, I shall be compelled to vote for the motion.",90
841,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Why not move an amendment?,90
842,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Because I recognise that we must either accept the contract or reject it. I am certain that in the near future large quantities of fruit will be exported from Western Australia, and the mail steamers should be required to provide space for it when asked to do so.",90
843,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Perth) [10.57] - I had intended to offer some remarks bearing principally upon observations made by other honourable members. But at this hour of the night I shall confine myself to asking the Postmaster-General to explain the particular clause to which the honourable member for Fremantle has alluded. I entirely agree with him that in this contract provision is made for the abrogation of whatever advantage it may confer upon Western Australia.',90
844,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,To which clause does the honourable member refer?,91
845,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I am alluding to subclause 7 of clause 4, which readsEach of the mail-ships on each call at Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, in pursuance of this agreement, shall remain in each of such ports for such periods as may be reasonably necessary to discharge cargo ancl to receive cargo, including butter and fruit.",91
846,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"That provision was inserted because the minimum number of hours that the steamers must remain at Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane is not specified in the contract. The other clause is intended as an intimation that the vessels must stay at Fremantle to discharge and take in cargo-that might not occupy more than two hours, but it is specified that the boats shall stay for not less than six hours.",91
847,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"If , in respect of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, it is necessary to stipulate that the mail steamers shall remain in port for such time as may be reasonably necessary to discharge and receive cargo, why is not a similar condition imposed in the case of Fremantle? The truth is that under the proposed contract, if the steamers are full of cargo, and their owners do not wish them to remain in the Western Australian port for a longer time than is stipulated, they will be at liberty to depart, and to leave produce lying on the wharf. That is the danger which I foresee. The stipulation that these vessels shall call at Fremantle for cargo is absolutely useless unless some provision be made for reserving to that State its proportion of space.",91
848,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There will be equal disability in the case of every port unless the space is regulated.,91
849,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,That is why I am anxious to see some provision inserted in regard to the receipt of cargo.,91
850,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"We cannot make provision for what the honourable member desires unless we agree to take the whole of the space provided on the vessels. . Mr FOWLER - In the face of all the minutise which is contained in the agreement, I fail to see why an agreement cannot be drawn up which will insure that no State shall be left out in the cold.",91
851,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"We tried to do that, but found that the proposal was absolutely impossible unless we agreed to take the whole of the space.",91
852,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"If the States would only agree to each take a portion of the space provided, the contractors would be very glad for us to take it off their hands altogether.",91
853,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It seems to me that we require to take only a very short step to nationalize the service. Some honourable members have objected to the statement that Western Australia had been penalized under the old freight rates. I hold in my hand a document issued by a large firm of shipping agents in London,, from which I desire to make one or two quotations. From it I gather that the freight from the Old Country upon 30 lbs., or i cubic feet, fo Adelaide, Brisbane, 1 Melbourne, or Sydney is 6s. 6d., whilst to Fremantle and Townsville-whic h two places are bracketed together-the charge is 9s.",91
854,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That state of things cannot obtain under the new contract.,91
855,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"If it can, I confess that I have not much faith that the Orient Steam Navigation Company will do other than what will pay it best. I may also mention that the charge for 100 lbs., or 5 cubic feet, of cargo from London to Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, or Sydney is 12s., whereas the charge to Fremantle is 16s. It seems to me that Western Australia might fairly claim a little more consideration than will be extended to her by the proposal to charge equal freights to all Australian ports. I need scarcely point out that the distance between Fremantle and Brisbane represents a fifth of the entire journey from London, notwithstanding which the freight to Brisbane is to equal an that charged to Western Australia. In other words, Western Australia is to be penalized for the advantage of those States which are furthest removed from the European market.",91
856,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely the honourable member does not object to all the States being placed upon an equal footing?,91
857,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It seems to me that, whilst the welfare of Brisbane and of other ports has been carefully studied in this contract, that of Western Australia has been overlooked. I shall vote for the amendment 'of the honourable member for Barrier.",91
858,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [11.5] I should like to add my congratulations to those already offered the honourable member for Barrier for the fine speech which he delivered in submitting his amendment. But although I listened with pleasure and admiration to his address, I know that he does not expect me to support his proposal to nationalize our mail service. I do not think that that matter is within the range of practical politics, and therefore, the honourable member will not wonder at my not supporting amendment. Regarding the generally, I think that it is one upon which the Government can fairly be congratulated. Considering the history of mail contracts, I do not see how it could be expected that they could secure better terms for a subsidy of £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0. It is true that a large increase upon what we previously paid, but it must be remembered that we are to have a greatly accelerated speed.",92
859,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Is it worth the extra money ?,92
860,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I do not know, but certainly the shipping companies regard increased speed as an important element in the cost of running their steamers. When a ship is steaming at her top speed, the last two or three knots add considerably to the consumption of coal. Consequently, if we insist upon increasing the speed of the mail ships we must expect to pay a higher price. Another consideration is that the vessels are compelled to run with great regularity, and they are to employ white labour only. All those points must be considered when forming an opinion upon the contract price. Bearing all these factors in mind, I am of opinion that the Government have made a good bargain, and that the amount of the subsidv is not out of the way. The contract is for ten years. That certainly seems a long time in these days of scientific improvement. But really, I do not see how the Government could have done better in that respect. The Orient Sfeam Navigation Company could not be expected to enter into a contract of this nature, involving large expenditure on new vessels, for a shorter period. Their interests need to be safeguarded as well as those of the Commonwealth. There is, however, a proviso whereby the Postmaster-General can, as improvements are made, insist upon their adoption. We could not expect a more elastic provision in a contract such as this In that respect, also, I think the Government have done as well as could be expected. There is one consideration affecting the State which I have the honour to represent and in regard to which the contract has not been framed as I think it ought to have been. I refer to the clause which compels six mail boats to call at Hobart during February to May inclusive. The clause proceedsProvided always that if in any year the contractors shall prove, to the satisfaction of the his Postmaster-General, that calls at Hobart during that year are or would be unprofitable, the contract Postmaster-General may direct that the whole or any such calls for that year may be omitted. In the first place, I suppose that the onus of proving that a call at Hobart would be unprofitable would lie with the company. The Postmaster-General has discretionary that is power as to granting the exemption. But suppose that the ships fill up with cargo at Brisbane or Sydney, and that, nevertheless, the Postmaster-General says "" You must go to Hobart."" If they have no space for a fair amount of produce, I do not see that that would be of any benefit to the fruit growers of southern Tasmania. What we want to insure is that there shall be reasonable space available when the ships get to Hobart j because there isalways a fair quantitv of apples and other produce on the wharfs awaiting shipment at that time of the year. have to Mr SALMON - Would it not save a lot of money to bring the Tasmanian produce over to Melbourne in small boats and then tranship ?",92
861,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The fruit-growers do not look at it in that light. The cost of transhipment would be too great. The rehandling of fruits would necessarily add to the cost materially. I do not for a moment suppose that when the contract was entered into either of the parties contemplated any trouble arising under the clause in question. But the possibility of such a thing happening has to be guarded against, for fear the contract should ever come into a Law Court and be interpreted strictly. Such a clause might put Tasmania in a worse position than she is in today. It appears to me that if the whole clause were left out, and Tasmania - were left to charter boats as she has been doing, it would be better for the State, because then no risks would be run. If the clause were deleted possibly. the Orient Steam Navigation Company, seeing that Tasmanian growers would, have to pay their own charter fees, might be prepared ito reduce the subsidy.  from Tasmania regulated?",92
862,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"As far as I know, circulars are issued to the growers about the quantity of fruit which they are likely to send and the space which' they are likely to require ",93
863,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am not sure by whom it is done, but that is the principle - The maximum price - to be charged by the Orient Steam Navigation Company is 60s. for 40 cubic feet 'of .space. In the pastj the Tasmanian growers have paid 70s. for that amount of space. Therefore, if the clause, were struck out, the contract would require to be revised in order to place Tasmania in the same position as she was in before. The honourable member for Franklin is an* authority on the fruit trade, and he has moved to delete the proviso, thus insuring that the mail-boats shall call at Hobart six times in the year. Seeing that Brisbane is made a port of call, as I think it should be, it would be only fair that Hobart should also be made a port of call .to the limited extentmentioned here. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin.",93
864,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [ii.i6].^-During the debate many remarks have been made which have not been' relevant tb the question of the mail contract,' and reflections have been cast upon the Postmaster General for not-explaining its provisions to the House. In view of the very full and clear explanation which - was made last week by the Prime Minister, I think that the Postmaster-General saved a considerable amount of time in submitting, the motion as he did, and I commend him for his conduct - Reference has been made by the honourable member for Franklin and others to the mail-boats calling at Hobart. That, I think, is one of the wisest provisions in the contract. It is quite clear that if it could be proved to the satisfaction of the Postmaster-General that in any year it would be unprofitable for mail-Steamers to call at Hobart they would not be compelled to do so. I ask any one who is acquainted with the fruit industry ih Tasmania, what would be the good of the steamers going to Hobart when-, there was a failure in the fruit crop ? Of course we all hope that there will not be a failure in the fruit crop, but it has occurred on several occasions and it may occur again. In a case of that kind it should be left to the Postmaster-General - to say whether the steamers shall call at the port or not.",93
865,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,-That is protecting the company against ourselves. I think that we ought to protect ourselves against the company first.,93
866,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"It is protecting both ourselves and the .company, because it would be of no use to the people of Tasmania for the boats to go to Hobart unless they had fruit or something else to export. Remarks have also been made about the filling up of the steamers, at the various ports. Any company which trades with Australia - wishes to please the whole of the .people. At the various ports they have their agents, who know fairly well what cargo is likely to be receivedat certain places. In the event of the States not having agreed to take the space the agents must act as best they can to regulate the trade for the steamers.",93
867,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,There will be other articles of export besides apples.,93
868,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"If the Commonwealth or. the States do not guarantee the space we shall have to trust to the agents and the owners of the steamers to do the best they can for the whole community. I have no doubt that they will always act impartially, and that if it is profitable for the steamers to go to Hobart as it has been in the past, they will continue to go there. I ani very glad to .see that a freight has been determined for their .particular trade, and that in the future it will not be left to a commission agent or any special individual to make arrangements for the sending of fruit or anything else from Tasmania. In tlje past it has been left to private persons to engage space; and for every case of fruit which .they sent away they received a commission of 3d., which, of course, had to come out of the pockets of the growers. If the contract is carried out satisfactorily and the agents arrange for the steamers to call ' at Hobart, and for the space required, the - growers will not only be relieved of that commission but' also effect a considerable saving in freight - In my opinion the Government have done well in securing that benefit to Tasmania. I . would have liked to see .the contract a provision fo the effect .when .our fruit industry on the Tamar sufficiently developed the mail-boats shall which is the earth. call at Tamar Heads and pick up the there, instead of its being sent by to Hobart. Last year we despatched first shipment of fruit from the Tamar, and the whole of the land on its banks has heen turned into orchardsI hope that before the expiration of "" the contract shall have the mail steamers calling at Tamar Heads to pick up our fruit. The thing I regret about the contract is that it is made for such a long term. In period of ten years things may change, but we shall be bound by the contract. Government was in a difficulty when it ceived the tenders, and the tender from the Orient Steam Navigation Company was the lowest one. While we are left at the mercy of a combine or a ring the present unsatisfactory state of things will continue to exist. Apparently the cost of the service is going up, and if that is to tinue we shall regret that we did not make the current contract at £120,000 a year for a period of ten or twelve years. less the motion is carried we shall be the mercy of a combine, and have to pay whatever they may charge. have other notes, but, as the hour is so late, I shall conclude with congratulating - the Government upon the first benefit, they have secured for Tasmania, so far as the calling of the mail steamers is conand cerned.",93
869,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,It may not prove so.,94
870,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"If the fruit is availspeak, able, the Postmaster-General can always insist upon the' steamers going there, if he fails in his duty it will be for Parliatangible ment to deal with him as it may think fit.",94
871,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) {11.23] - In first place, I lay down the principle that all means of communication and transit should belpng to the people. I consider that, representing as the means of communication and transit do the commerconcerns, cial arteries of the nation, when we allow them to get into private hands we cally allow private hands to get on the jugular vein of the nation, and on that account I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier. A monopoly of means of communication or transit on land we deny, and I contend that the avenues - of trade on water are just in as important in the ""development of a that nation. This monopoly is the next worse is to the monopoly of natural opportunity, Of course, we fruit cannot debate the question . of land train monopoly at the present time, but our this being the next greatest evil from which we as a civilised-people suffer, I certainly urge upon honourable members the advisability of placing it under. the we control of the Government, that is the the people. The arguments which have been only adduced against the proposal do not influence me, and I suppose it is hardly nea cessary for me to say why they do not, because my reasonswould not appeal to The the Opposition. Though I think there is resome logic on the opposite side, yet when honourable members say that to make this a Commonwealth concern would be to give absolute control of Government affairs to those within the concern,, and that it would be a dangerous experiment, they are mail absolutely on the wrong track. We have conenacted that all men and. women are mentally equal. I admit that that is a mere assumption, but for the want of something Unbetter we have assumed it, and, as we have at conceded political equality, as soon as the people have their eyes opened a little I more, they will insist-and the power to do so already exists-upo n controlling these things, despite. honourable members on the which Opposition benches. Those members naturally stand up for their vested interests their individual rights, nor do I blame them. It is perfectly natural and logical that they should do so, but it is illogical for tliem to contend that when the people as they do through us, the people are asking for the extension of a dangerous and principle. The Labour Party is one of the results of that principle, and we as a party in this chamber are the outward and visible sign of that political equality the which will enable the people - more and more to control these things for themselves. The people will take out of the hands of private enterprise first, and foremost those that rank amongst the most vital of all including the means of transit and communication. We know the devious practimethods that are . resorted to by private enterprise in order to exploit, the people. That, again, is perfectly natural, and if the people are foolish enough to give opportunities for this to be done, it will be done so long as the people are too blind .tp. see that they have the right and the power to take over these things for themselves and still govern them by deputy. We must always have government by deputy, but as the community grows more enlightened there will be a higher intelligence reflected in the seats of government. Is there any provision in the contract to check the pernicious system of rebates? I can find none.",94
872,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"A rebate, would be a differential rate. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - There is a special law against it. Mr .CARR - The rebate system is one of the most effective means by which private enterprise exploits the people. In America rebates are used to throttle trade, or only to permit it to exist so far as it is necessary to.the manufacture of the dollars of private enterprise.",95
873,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Does - the PoslmasterGeneral mean, that rebates from England can also be prevented?",95
874,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,We cannot control that.,95
875,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I quite realise that we shall not have the full power necessary to prevent those questionable ' practices, so long as over-sea traffic is in private hands, or until'.we bring .it "", under Government control, to - be supervisee?.By duly appointed officers,, subject to public criticism, and guided by the-public sense of right and wrong. That public sense is always keen. Those who question the right or ability of the people to-more-directly rule themselves question the whole system of creation itself. Man is deficient nowadays, not so much because of any innate lack in himself of a higher conception of life, as because of a want of opportunity to achieve his aspirations. Otherwise, there would be no progress; and there has been progress, so far as we have adopted enlightened ' legislation, and given' to the people a more direct control-of affairs than ever existed in bygone days., That policymust be pushed forward,' aiid I am here to push it forward. Assuming that the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier is not agreed to, the contract, so far as it can be made a machine to regulate the traffic, is, in my opinion, effective, but it does not. go so far as I want it to go, because the mail service will be practically under private control. This is as satisfactory an arrangement as we are likely to get under those conditions. There has been a good deal said about the danger we run in shutting ourselves out from the advantages that must accrue from improvements in means of locomotion, but clause 6 appears to provide for that. It gives the Postmaster-General the right at any time after the fifth year to call, upon the company to provide a more, accelerated service, if more accelerated services have become the order of the day. That isa fairly safe provision, and to a great extent answers' many of the objections - that have been raised. We have also the right to alter the route from vid Suez, if that is at any time deemed necessary. I presume that means that we shall be able to take advantage of the Panama Canal, if it is thought advisable to do so, when the canal is opened for traffic. Those are the main objections that have been raised to the contract, with the exception of the question of calls at Hobart. Here, again, we are faced with the consideration that, unless we take the service over entirely, w.e-shall not be able to compel the boats to call at any port when they are already full. We must assume that those interested in a business concern will take freight when they are in a position to do so, but if their holdsare full it will be of no use for the boats to call. The people of Tasmania may find themselves in that position. If that does happen, it will be one. of the inevitable results of handing this business over to - private enterprise. If it was in the hands of the Government, it. .might be possible to hold certain boats in reserve, or to divert boats from certain lines to take up traffic that 'was urgent at the time. Otherwise, I fail to see how Hobart is to get anv more . consideration than is offered under this contract, unless the Government go a step further, as indicated by the Minister of Trade and ' Customs, in the direction of controlling the refrigerated space. The Government would have to undertake to fill the space if the shipping company were compelled to accommodate the Hobart trade.",95
876,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Maribyr'nong^Postmaster-General) [11.35] - Notwithstandin g the remarks of honourable members, I do not propose, even .now, to make anything like, a long speech. I should like, as I could have done, to say a great deal about the many phases - of this most interesting, far-reaching,and important question. I could have said much about the rates, the history of mail contracts, the difference between States. this and other contracts, and what we lost by the concessions we made on the last contract. But at this stage of the session I feel impelled to say but little. I am sure honourable members will acquit me of any Melbourne. intention to slight the House, and will give ine credit for doing the best that is possible in the circumstances. have already said that this contract has been f u l ly explained hy the Prime Minister; fully, fairly, and favourably discussed by almost every in the Commonwealth; and, after debate another place, adopted almost unanimously. Therefore, every honourable member must be .seized of its meaning. said that I was quite prepared to answer any questions to the best ability. Could anything more have been done, in view, of the fact that we are so pressed for time ? I have no fault to find with the manner or matter of the speech the honourable member for Barrier in movferred ing his amendment, which is, of course, the real question we have to test to-night.",95
877,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I have another amendment.,96
878,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I hope the House will not accept any amendments. The Prime Minister, the officers of the Department, colleagues, and myself have done our best in. the interests of Australia. If able members knew as much as we know, best but are not privileged to tell,-they would not attempt to amend ihe contract on lines suggested. It is provided that shall be no differentiation as between and that provision penalizes we say is that, whatever advantages New South Wales, for instance, may secure in consequence of the facilities which she joys, no extra charge shall be made at of. the other ports. New South Wales, in amendments ? this matter,, is not penalized in any way.",96

885,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member object to Melbourne reaping some I advantage from the contract, if New South Wales is thereby in no way injured? The Government haye been, and are, most anxious to secure the very best advantages for newspaper Australia. As to the amendment of the in honourable member' for Franklin, do honourable members imagine for one moment that any Postmaster-General would I further dare to give authority for tbese boats not to call at Hobart unless for marof my vellously strong reasons?.",96
886,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I do not think so.,96
887,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am sure honourable of members do not think so.' The clause reto was inserted in the interests of Hobart, and marks a decided step forward for Tasmania, to. which State there can be no danger, unless through a crop failure - I do not think that'any one would contend for a .moment that the mail ships should call at Hobart merely for the sake of calling. I could say a great deal more, but I am going to trust to the good sense of my the House to accept the assurance that very everything has been done by the Prime honorMinister and his colleagues to secure the possible conditions.. If this contract is varied, our work will have to be done over the again, and we might not be able to get there terms so advantageous as those which are States, now offered, and are submitted to the no one.

891,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I point out that the Postmaster-General has already replied to the debate.

897,Mr DEPUTV SPEAKER,Unknown,But the Minister has replied.,98
898,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I desire to say, sir, that I had a chat today witli Mr Speaker in regard to. this very question, and was informed by him that after my amendment had been disposed oT,- any further amendment would be open to discussion.",98
899,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,After the mover of the original motion had replied?,98
900,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I admit that that point was not raised; but I am sure that those who were desirous of dealing with"" some of the arguments raised during this debate would have objected to the Postmaster^ General replying when he did had they thought that his reply would close the debate. Mr Speaker told me that I could not move a further amendment, but that it would be competent for me to speak to a further amendment moved by any other honourable member. I submit that this amendment may be discussed.",98
901,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On the point of order, I dare say, sir, that technically your ruling is right; but I am under the impression that Mr Speaker has always allowed the fullest latitude in the discussion of such a matter as this. He has treated a contract of this kind as being in the nature of a schedule to a Bill, and therefore alterable in any part. I submit that on an occasion like this that procedure should be followed. I and several others find that Ave are not in a position under your ruling to submit several amendments that have occurred to us during this exhaustive debate, and I knoAv of no honourable member on this side of the House AAh' o could submit them on our behalf. The trouble is that under cover of a motion this contract, has been submitted in the House instead of in Committee. It is not an ordinary motion, but one haA'ing attached to it an exhaustive schedule, and there should be some way of'discussing its details - I therefore ask you, sir, to lb. net for permit honourable members to speak on amendments which may be niOA'ed.",98
902,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I would suggest, sir, that standing order 264, which provides that the reply of the mover to the original question closes the debate, refers to the original question, and to any amendment which is proposed. As you are aware, sir, an amendment must be disposed of before another amendment on the main question can be submitted. If standing order 264 Avere to apply as suggested by you, it would be impossible for any further amendment to be moved. As a matter of fact, the only amendment which has actually been moved, properly stated and put, 'is that proposed by the honourable member for Barrier.",98
903,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Notic e has been gi\'en of other amendments. Air. SALMON - Notic e has been gi\'en of them, but they haA'e not been moved. I would point out, sir, that under your ruling it would be impossible for a second amendment to be moved to any motion if the mover of the original motion had replied prior to the fust amendment being tested.",98
904,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"In this instance the questions raised by the amendments and the main issue have been so intenvoven that it Would be almost impossible to separate in any speech the arguments directed to an amendment from those directed to the main question. Standing order 264, which has been cited by the honourable member' for Laanecoorie, directs that in all cases the reply of the mover of the original question closes the debate. The Postmaster-General has replied to the main question, and the debate is therefore closed. But the practice has groAvn up- I do not say that it is a right or that it is a wrong one-whe n honourable members haA'e intimated that they intend to move certain amendments, of taking those amendments in rotation, after the mover has replied. That is the course I am folloAving. I cannot, however, alloAv the main discussion to be re-opened.  false position, because I purposely refrained from speaking on the main question.",98
905,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Do I understand that, if the honourable member for Grey ha'd moved his amendment first, and it had been discussed, my amendment would have had to be put without debate? Air. SALMON - The amendment of the honourable member for Grey could not have been moved first.",98
906,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It seems to me that the position is an awkward one. The honourable member for Grey purposely refrained from speaking on the main question in order to speak on his amendment"".",99
907,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Grey would have been quite in order in moving and speaking to his amendment before the Postmaster General replied. On the first day that this Parliament met, I , following a practice that is sometimes allowed in the Queensland Assembly, rose to speak after the then leader of the House, now Mr. Justice Barton, had replied; but it was ruled by Mr Speaker that I could not do so, and the ruling has held good ever since.",99
908,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is the honourable member for Grey prevented from speaking because - the Postmaster-General has replied, or because his amendment is so interwoven with the main question?",99

910,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"1 do not the strict legality of your ruling, sir; in view of the exceptional nature of these proceedings, which could not have been posed to do so. contemplated when the Standing Order was framed, I suggest that it would be a gracious thing to consult the wishes honourable members who desire to move amendments, and to state shortly their closed. reasons for doing so.",99
911,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I cannot take it upon myself to do that; but I I shall be meeting the wishes of the House if I put the question that the honourable member for Grey be heard.,99
