2,Mrs BAILEY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I present the response of the Acting Auditor-General to the Committee's report entitled Managing Commonwealth Fisheries: The Last Frontier. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, for Mrs Moylan, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
3,Mr RUDDOCK,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Speaker, this bill facilitates implementation of the significant changes in the delivery of child care payments contained in the Child Care Payments Bill. It introduces a number of transitional arrangements which ensure the smooth introduction of the new payment arrangements for families and child care providers. In particular, it ensures that children currently using the long day care sector to provide outside school hours care for their children are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the new school child rate of child care assistance. It also provides exemptions from the planning framework for child care operators who had taken action to build or extend a child care centre before the planning limits were announced on budget night. The bill provides for the repeal of the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 and provides for amendments to various other acts which are necessary to implement the new payment arrangements. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. NA Motion for Disallowance Paper Motion (by Mr Abbott) agreed to: That so much of the standing orders and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent notice No. 18, private members business, being called on forthwith.",13
4,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"I move: That regulations 11 and 12 of the AUSTUDY Regulations (Amendment) as contained in Statutory Rules 1997, No. 83, made under the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed. This measure, announced in the 1996-97 budget, reduces by a third the maximum rent assistance available to single students without dependants who share accommodation as of I july this year. It is in line with the same measures affecting people who receive rent assistance through the Department of Social Security, which cut rent assistance payments to some 80,000 Australians. This is the final change to Austudy from the range of measures, all negative, which were announced in last year's budget. At the time of this announcement this measure would have saved the government some $700,000 over four years. However, with the recent announcement of the introduction of a youth allowance, which will extend rent assistance to a far broader range of students than is presently the case, the reduction of the maximum amount payable to singles in shared accommodation becomes far more significant in terms of the number of people who will be affected. Currently, to receive Austudy rent assistance you need to be in one of the following categories: you are homeless; your parents are unable to provide a home, care or support for you; you are an orphan; you are a refugee with no parents in Australia; or you are in state care getting the away from home rate and living away from your foster carer's home. In other words, the people we are talking about who are affected by this disallowance motion and in terms of the measure's immediate effect are facing severe disadvantages. It cannot be said that any of these categories represent those who are at all financially advantaged in our society. Austudy is designed to help people complete their education for their own benefit and for the benefit of our society generally. People receiving rent assistance are the perfect example of those for whom Austudy was designed. In many cases, in order to have reasonable access to university or TAFE, students would find it necessary to live in inner-city, high rent areas and to share accommodation to reduce costs. This government has decided to penalise them for that decision, which is related to the advancement of their education. It has reduced the weekly rate of rent assistance for such people from $37.30 to $24.90. In order to access such assistance, a student needs to be paying a certain amount of renta threshold-before that student can receive any assistance. Above that threshold, three-quarters of what is paid by way of rent is then paid to the student in the form of rent assistance, subject to a ceiling. So we are not talking about some sort of windfall gain to people who might not need it; we are talking about people who are desperately in need and who are actually paying out more than the threshold level of rent. This measure, now subject to disallowance, has immediately affected around 2,600 people. It is likely that some of these will find it too difficult to continue their studies. The advancement through the education system of more than 2,500 young Australians affected by this measure is now in jeopardy. With the commencement of the youth allowance on 1 July next year, some 70,000 full-time students, currently Austudy recipients, will be eligible for rent assistance. Of those who are single and living in shared accommodation, probably a significant proportion will suffer because of this change. The government has said that the youth allowance is not a saving measure, although it has not released the full details of costings. Therefore, it is very difficult for the parliament to know the legitimacy of that claim. What we are talking about today, however, is a savings measure in advance: taking away an entitlement to maximum rent assistance before the rent assistance is provided. So there is the direct impact of 2,600 students being adversely affected by this measure and now, with the introduction of the youth allowance, the possible adverse impact on 70,000 full-time students. The government claims that the youth allowance is designed to encourage young people to study. Yet last year's budget cut student assistance expenditure by $514 million over four years, representing a sustained attack on income support for students. This measure can take its place among the unjustified and mean-spirited changes to Austudy introduced by the Howard government. It can stand beside the abolition of case management of secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy. It can stand behind the cessation of the schooling incidentals allowance for those same homeless students and the tightening of the actual means test, which Amanda Vanstone turned into an administrative nightmare. It can also stand behind the raising of the age of independence which, apart from being inequitable in itself, is impacting particularly unfairly on some students who, for technical reasons, are being considered dependent on their parents when they have, in reality, led independent lives for years. The opposition is opposed to this particular measure and seeks its disallowance. We make the broader point that a government that is taking away over $Y2 billion in assistance for income support for young Australians going through their studies is a government that does not value education. It is also a government that does not value security for young Australians. In the public debate we are having a substantial discussion about the need for security-job security, income security, all forms of security-in this world of constant change and uncertainty. It should not be forgotten in that particular debate that there is a need for income support and security for young Australians. If, as a parliament and a nation, we are not providing certainty and security for young Australians, particularly in that important transition from school to post-secondly studies and beyond, then we are much diminished as a society. If we are not providing the sort of certainty that young Australians need to advance themselves and their studies, then the nation as a whole is much diminished. I would urge the government in this great national debate about insecurity to take heed of the need for greater security for young Australians, particularly in student income support. If students do not have that security, if they do not have that adequate level of income support as they engage in their studies, then they take lower risk options in their studies and they take lower risk options in their career ambitions. A nation that is dropping its ambitions, dropping its horizons among its young students, is a nation that will be diminished in the future. This is the saddest thing about the whole raft of Vanstone changes to the education system. The damage might not necessarily be felt in 1997. But there is one certainty out of the debate: the damage will be felt supremely in decades from now. At that time, it will be too late to reverse this government's running down of security and opportunities for young Australians in their studies. The government needs to reverse a whole raft of Austudy changes and reductions in income support and security. It also needs to recognise that, in many other areas of its education funding cuts, reversal of policy needs to be implemented. Travelling around Australia's universities, I have observed that Austudy itself has become a matter of substantial controversy-not only in relation to the disallowance matter now before the parliament but the whole raft of changes, the whole raft of impacts arising from the half a billion dollar funding cut, particularly with the administration of the actual means test. I know that the parliamentary secretary-inadvertently promoted earlier on by the Speaker, in word if not deed, and in recognition of relevant merit on the government front-bench-has had some responsibility for the actual means test. He too knows the difficulty. He knows the nightmare. He knows the horror of students, on average, having to wait 49 minutes on a so-called hotline just to have their queries answered. Ms Macklin-That's right, if they can get through.",13
5,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"It is a pretty cold hot line when they have to wait for 49 minutes-if they get through, as the member for Jagajaga points out. The 49 minutes was an average which was calculated off the number of students who got through. So, for all those who just gave it away in deep frustration, the statistics and the horror of this administrative nightmare would be much worse. The government needs to have a sound review of Austudy policy, not only in this matter but across the board. The Australian Labor Party in embracing new policies, particularly in the education area, is conducting a policy review. We are very determined to produce some changes to the Austudy arrangements by ways of providing greater certainty and security for young Australians. What we have with Austudy, basically, is the disease that so many parts of the welfare state in Australia have been inflicted with-the idea that additional issues and problems can only be addressed by another category, another set of means testing, another cut in and cut out point; running students, in this case, through five or six hoops of means and asset testing before they can become eligible for the Austudy arrangements. These particular arrangements need to be simplified. There needs to be simplicity and flexibility in the sort of income support that is being provided to young Australians-the flexibility, the simplicity, the strength and the certainty of income support that ensures that students are not dropping their horizons, that they are not dropping their level of ambition and risk in the education sector; that they are taking the highest possible option for their own benefit and the benefit of the nation. These are hard issues for the opposition to advance because the government has a totally incorrect set of priorities. This is a government that in its first and second budgets quarantined defence spending but made education, including Austudy, its No. I target for funding cuts. It is almost surreal in Australia at the current time, as people talk about security, as they talk about international engagement, to understand what we are doing in Australia by way of education funding cuts compared to the growth economies and nations of our region. Have a look at Singapore or Malaysia where there is no public debate as to whether or not education is a public or a private good. It is the Vanstone approach, of course, to say, 'Well, look, there's a public benefit and there is a private benefit in education. Off the private benefit, we'll hang a user charge.' In our competitor nations there is no such debate because they recognise that in a postindustrial society, where there are new information based opportunities in the economy and in our society, education needs to be regarded as an essential national investment, as an essential national good, that does not find itself subject to this public versus private debate. If you invested in education as an essential national good, then years from now Australia would be reaping public and private benefit aplenty. That would be the sound set of policies that best serves Australia's national interest. What we have from this government is a very different set of priorities, quarantinthanks ing all those defence golf courses and other parts of the defence establishment in Australia while making education the No. 1 target for funding cuts. The No. 1 targets are students, course work, universities, TAFE; all the opportunities that should be available for young Australians. This parliament and the government should be providing security for that transition from school to post-secondary studies and then on to work. This is but one part of a whole raft of problems that the government has created in the education area. The Labor Party has constantly opposed each of these changes. We are doing it again on this particular matter with the Austudy regulations. I certainly urge the parliament to support the disallowance motion.",15
6,Mr SPEAKER,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,Is the motion seconded? Ms Macklin-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,16
7,Mr ABBOTT,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.50 a.m.)-The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is a very clever politician; there is no doubt about that. That is why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is so scared of him. That is why the Leader of the Opposition kicked him upstairs when he took him away from being assistant shadow Treasurer and made him the shadow minister for education. The fact is that the member for Werriwa has been far too clever by half today. What he is trying to suggest is that the government is taking away large amounts of rent assistance from 78,000 students. You cannot take something away from people which they never had. You cannot take something away from people which the former government never gave them. In all the 13 years of the former government's existence, it never gave students rent assistance. The important thing to remember in this debate is that this government is paying rent assistance to students for the first time. This is a very important innovation; a very important extension of the principles of social justice. Students now get rent assistance to this government. Seventy thousand students will benefit because of this government's decision to extend rent assistance to students on Austudy. We are paying rent assistance on the same basis as rent assistance is paid in the Department of Social Security. As we know and as the former government knows, people who are sharing accommodation receive that accommodation in effect at a lower unit cost. That is what the former government always acknowledged when it paid lower rates of rent assistance to married people under DSS. That is what we are doing with rent assistance now. That is what will happen with rent assistance as paid through Austudy. In 1996, 8,000 Austudy and Abstudy customers received rent assistance. Of these, only 19 per cent of Austudy rent assistance recipients and 18 per cent of Abstudy rent assistance recipients received maximum rent assistance. The average rates of fortnightly rent assistance paid to Austudy and Abstudy clients were $45.20 and $45.10 respectively. That is less than the new lower rate of rent assistance. This measure is estimated to affect only 1,300 Austudy and Abstudy clients receiving the student homeless rate in 1997, with savings of just $240,000 in 1997-98 and the following year. The simple truth is that this is a good move for students. This is a major innovation for students. This is something which has been given by the government to students for the first time. One can understand why the member for Werriwa and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) are so upset about it. We are doing something which, if the former government had had any heart, it would have done. This is something which the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, can be very proud of. This is something which the government is very proud of. If the proposal of the member for Werriwa were accepted, we would be spending something like an extra $40 million. The youth allowance which the government is moving to in the middle of next year is not a savings measure. The total cost of the youth allowance will be $25 million more than the total cost of the measures that it replaces. So it is not a savings measure, it is an innovation; it is social reform. If we were to do what the member for Werriwa suggests we should do, we would spend an additional $40 million on student beneficiaries of youth allowance alone. The member for Werriwa has developed an enormous penchant for spending money over the last couple of months since he has become the shadow minister for education-$40 million extra on rent assistance; if we were to abolish the increases in HECS, I am advised that would cost $257 million up to the year 2001 on a headline basis and $1.449 billion on an underlying basis. The member for Werriwa has become a very expensive addition to the front bench. I wonder whether he has discussed any of these proposals with the shadow Treasurer, that policy genius as he was described in a Glenn Milne column recently before the young and the restless came out and undermined that briefing which had been given by the shadow Treasurer. The fact is that the member for Werriwa is costing the shadow Treasurer an enormous amount of money-$40 million with this measure alone, $257 million in the removal of the HECS increases and almost $1.5 billion in underlying increases. This is the kind of money that the member for Werriwa wants to cost the shadow Treasurer. It is quite unusual to suddenly see the member for Werriwa reborn as Santa Clause, because in his former incarnation he was always Uncle Scrooge. If you look at the record of the member for Werriwa, you see that in the past he has called for capital gains tax to be extended to the family home, and he has called for tax measures to make the cost of homes in western Sydney more expensive. He is a politician; he is perfectly entitled to change his mind. I suppose, as Lord Keynes says, 'When circumstances change, I change my opinions. What do you do, Sir?' I do not blame him for that as such. I simply say that he needs to offer some kind of an explanation as to why it was right to be Uncle Scrooge just a couple of months ago and why it is right to be Santa Clause now. What we see on the part of the member for Werriwa is something that is quite common in the opposition-it is described as a major backflip. That title of Major Backflip has been awarded by my friend and colleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to the Leader of the Opposition, so I suppose the member for Werriwa is simply Lieutenant Backflip.",16
8,Ms MACKLIN,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"We are talking about the extension of rent assistance to Austudy recipients. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), sitting opposite, tried to wriggle his way out of explaining how this is going to be funded. It is very important that young people in Australia focus on how this is going to be funded, because it will have disastrous effects on the incomes of young people in this country and their families. Let us remember how this change is going to be financed, which the parliamentary secretary opposite failed to mention. It is going to be financed by taking all 16and 17year-olds who receive unemployment benefits off those benefits. These benefits are already means tested, so families with incomes as low as $5,000 a year are going to lose this already pretty meagre support for their 16and 17year olds who cannot get a job. As my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has already asked in the parliament earlier this week, is this government putting any extra money into support these young people who are supposedly going to be forced back into schools? It has been identified that the government will need to spend $140 million to help schools cope with these 16and 17-year-olds who are going to be unceremoniously taken off unemployment benefits and forced back into schools. There is no money whatsoever from this heartless government to help the schools cope with these young people. That is the first thing that will happen-families will be forced back into poverty and young people, who will not all go back to school, no matter what you do to them, will be forced to earn their incomes in ways that nobody in this parliament would support. The second way in which this measure is going to be financed is that 18to 20-year olds will have their unemployment benefits means tested according to a parental income means test. The last time. I looked, 18-yearolds were adults and should be treated that way. We expect them to behave as adults and as responsible citizens, but what does this government do? It says, 'Oh, no, we don't think you are adult enough to go out, look for a job and make a contribution to your family. We are going to means test your unemployment benefits.' That will not only cause hardship to those 18to 20-year-olds but also cause significant hardship to their families because, once again, it is families on relativeall ly low incomes-families on $30,000 a year-who are going to lose as a result of this measure. It has to be remembered that this measure is being financed by these very significant cuts to the incomes of families and young people. Going to the point of rent assistance, as the parliamentary secretary said, it is absolutely correct that the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation was cut by one-third in July this year. So this incredibly generous measure that he is talking about-extending rent assistance to recipients of Austudy-is not that generous. What happened in July as a result of this government's changes is that rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation was cut by one-third. If you are dependent on Austudy and sharing accommodation to help defray the costs of living while you get your education, life is pretty tough. I do not know how tough it was for the parliamentary secretary when he did his university training, but there are plenty of students out there totally reliant on Austudy who are already finding that the cuts to all the other programs are very tough. What is going to happen now is not that they are going to get a decent level of rent assistance, but they are going to get a much reduced level of rent assistance. The government's justification for this measure was a completely spurious argument about the economies of scale that we heard the parliamentary secretary talk about in his remarks this morning. People who pay less rent because they are sharing with othersthis is the reason why it is spurious-already receive less rent assistance because the amount of rent assistance you get is directly related to the amount of rent you pay. I do not think the government understands what it is like for people on social security or the social security system. I will just repeatit is a very important point-that the amount of rent assistance you get is related to the amount of rent you pay. It has nothing to do with economies of scale. The reason students band together is so that their food costs and the other things that go to making student life bearable in an income sense are lessmaking sure that they can make ends meet. That is why they band together, not so they can, as you would put it, get more rent assistance than they need. During the Senate estimates hearings we were told that the government still does not know how many people have been affected by this measure, how old they are, where they live or what accommodation they live in or whether people who have had their rent assistance cut are living with others who have also had their rent assistance cut. We do not have any of that information. You have no idea about the impact of these changes. Certainly, people on this side of the House have been inundated with letters and phone calls pointing out the effects of this measure now that it has been implemented. Single people living in run-down private hotels have found themselves with $25 a fortnight less to survive on. Households where three or four single people share are losing over $100 a fortnight from the household income. People have been forced to move into what can only be described as woeful accommodation because it is cheaper. They are the real impacts of what happened as a result of this social security change. So you are not offering this great handout to Austudy recipients. Life is not going to be a whole lot better for them, because the actual benefit that they are getting was much reduced by this government. Mr Abbott interjecting",17
9,Ms MACKLIN,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"It is not bullshit, as you just said. Come on, a bit of honesty would not go astray. Let us just have a look at all the other cuts that this flows on from. We have actually seen a cessation of case management of secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy, a cessation of schooling incidentals allowance for secondary students on the homeless rate of Austudy and Abstudy, a reduction of maximum rent assistance-as we have just describedpayable to singles in shared accommodation, an introduction of a two-year waiting period for Austudy for newly arrived migrants, a tightening of the actual means test and the raising of the age of independence for Austudy. This is what has happened to Austudy recipients over the life of this government. To cap it all off we are going to see dramatic cuts to unemployment benefits for young people who are out there trying to get a job. They are going to be cut off their benefits entirely if they are 16 or 17, and they are going to have their benefits significantly reduced if they fail to meet a parental income test. This is not the way to encourage young people to go into education. This government and the opposition should be able to get together on this, and a major objective for this country should be: what is the best way to encourage young and older people into education? This measure will certainly not assist them. We will certainly not be supporting the government's efforts to penalise young people further.",19
10,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"in reply-In closing the debate, I think it is worthwhile responding to a few of the comments presented by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott). The parliamentary secretary seemed to be promoting a commonplace defence from this government-having ripped $514 million out of the pockets of students in Austudy, he now wants the government to be applauded for putting a small fraction of that back in. This is the standard defence of this government in each of its cost cutting measures. It is somewhat like the burglar who ransacks your house, takes all of your items and then returns the next day to say, 'I'm giving back the video. You're supposed to be grateful for that.' This is the approach the government takes across-the-board. Mr Ruddock-We give you half a dozen videos.",19
11,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"The benevolent Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs claims that he gives back half a dozen videos. Isn'the a nice chap-having knocked off everything in the house he comes back with not only your video but also videos from other homes he has ransacked. That is the sort of approach this government has. He will give you one video plus five from someone else's house. This is the standard response. The minister has confirmed the response they take on budget management. They take $514 million out of the pockets of students and then the parliamentary secretary turns up the next day and says, 'We're giving back a small fraction of that, won't you give me a bit of applause? Won't you give me a few pats on the back?' He was pretty keen to use that Dickens novel for his analogies. He talked about Scrooge and Santa Claus and the like. The parliamentary secretary always reminds me of little Tim-the spot is set at the Christmas table but he never gets to turn up. He is left to do nothing more than the dirty work for Amanda Vanstone. His spot is always set at the cabinet table. Everyone would have thought that John Howard would be Santa Claus for him and give him a spot at the Christmas table after aU that work he did undermining Dr Hewson and trying to knock over Alexander Downer and get Howard back into the leadership. Little Tim stance has been left out and forgotten again. He has nothing more to contribute to the debate than doing the dirty work for Senator Vanstone. It is an unhappy arrangement. I know the parliamentary secretary and member for Warringah must feel uneasy about having to defend the indefensible in these circumstances. He was not at the table when the budget decision was made to take $514 miUion out of Austudy, but he is now left to defend the indefensible here in the national parliament. So it is not an easy task for the parliamentary secretary. These matters of incompetence by Senator Vanstone are widely recognised within the government. For a little light reading recently I was looking through Pamela Williams's The victory: the inside story of the takeover of Australia, page 322. It is a pretty good chronicle of what the Liberal Party did before and after the last federal election. There was a little gathering-I think it might have been at the Grand Prix-after the federal election. The parliamentarians from Victoria had gathered-Peter Costello, Richard Alston, Peter Reith, Michael Wooldridge, Petro Georgiou and the Kemp brothers, David and Rod. They were gathering, of course, to bitch about the new Prime Minister who had again done in the Victorians, as was always his style. But in doing in the Victorians he did not even look after his best mate from New South Wales, little Tim. But as they gathered that was not their primary concern. What they had to say was that they were objecting to the fact that David Kemp had been left behind the new minister Amanda Vanstone, 'who the group openly derided, predicting she wouldMr Ruddock-This is a rather long summing up. Surely he is going well beyond relevance.",19
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The minister, by way of interjectionhe could have used other forms, but it was becoming apparent-brought to my attention that the honourable member should bring his remarks more directly back to his concluding in this circumremarks on the motion.",20
13,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"I am concluding and I am responding to the parliamentary secretary and giving the parliament an insight into what the Liberal Party says about Amanda Vanstone behind her back-'who the group openly derided, predicting she would bring trouble for the government'. The only thing they have ever got right was that prediction that she would bring trouble-trouble for the government but sadly enough even greater trouble for young Australians, particularly in this regulationMr AbboU- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. You have admonished the member for Werriwa once. I do think he has taken your admonishment rather lightly. I think this is really quite beyond the scope of the debate. I would ask you to require him to wind up.",20
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,I am sure the honourable member for Werriwa will now direct his remarks to the motion.,20
15,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"Well, if little Tim is not at the table he is obviously out there flicking through the standing orders to try to work out little points of order that he can take.",20
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,Order! The honourable member is not assisting. Mr Ruddock-It shows how little you've got to say about the substance.,20
17,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"In wrapping up, the substance of the debate is not about handing back six videos. That was your contribution. Mr Ruddock-What about name calling? That is what you are doing.",21
18,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,What do you think he was engaged in in his contribution? Mr Ruddock-It is not relevant.,21
19,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,I am responding to the points that he was making.,21
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,Order! I think we have now had enough discussion across the table between the minister and the honourable member for Werriwa. The honourable member for Werriwa will go to the motion and the minister will listen in silence.,21
21,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,He ought to go back to his videos.,21
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,The honourable member for Werriwa is not assisting. He will get back to the motion.,21
23,Mr LATHAM,AU STUDY REGULATIONS,"I am at the motion. The motion is to disallow this particular regulation. The regulation is bad for the reasons I have set out, joined by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). She has made the valid point also about the government's hypocrisy in these matters, particularly in relation to the common youth allowance and driving 27,000 young Australians back into schools. We are not funding them. This is the whole policy and approach of this government to education: talking up expectations but not delivering on any of them whatsoever. The parliamentary secretary made a point about how the Labor Party funds its measures. That of course is implicit in our whole approach to education, and it is implicit in the difference between the Labor Party and the government. The parliamentary secretary, after explaining how he took $514 million out of the pockets of students and is handing a small portion back, which he now wants to be applauded for, then went on to ask how the Labor Party funds its commitments. The funding commitment comes from the priority that we give to education as opposed to the low priority this government gives it. This is a government that made education its No. 1 target for funding cuts, and that is a complete act of national folly at this stage of Australia's development. Smart nations fund up education as a national investment. It is the best investment to be made in their future. That is what a Labor government would do with the $120 billion funding envelope of the Commonwealth. That would be our set of priorities as opposed to yours. Those particular issues are easily cleared up. The whole point of this debate is to again emphasise how damaging it is for young Australians to have uncertainty about their income support arrangements with the wholesale slashing of Austudy and to have uncertainty created by administrative nightmares and not being able to get accurate information, and how damaging it is to have this whole problem of very disadvantaged Australians under this regulation now subject to disallowance having their financial assistance cut by the government. There are 2,600 involved. More will be indirectly involved with the forthcoming introduction of the common youth allowance. This is a bad measure-one of many bad measures that this government that has introduced in education. For those reasons, it should be disallowed.

24,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (10.21 a.m.)-I indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 be agreed to and that amendment No. 1 be disagreed to. I suggest, therefore, that it may suit the convenience of the House first to consider amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 and when those amendments have been disposed of to consider amendment No. 1.",23
25,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The opposition has no objection to that course of action. My colleague the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), will handle amendments 2, 3 and 4, in particular amendment 2, which is not a controversial matter. Amendment 1 will be handled subsequently.",23
26,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (10.22 a.m.)-I move: That Senate amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 be agreed to. Amendment No. 1 is to do with mining rights. We have had a debate about these things and now the Senate has brought back more amendments. We believe there is no real need for this. We acknowledge that it does change the 1936 act, but it does not change the 1996 act. But we are going to accept the Senate amendment on this, that now there is no need for a bona fide prospector at the time of income derived. We will accept this, even though we still think that there are possible problems in the future with it. Amendments Nos 3 and 4 are the government's amendments. No. 3 removes an apparent discretion relating to capital gains and loss provisions. No.4 corrects a problem with tax law amendment No. 1 regarding Senate amendments relating to employee share schemes. We are supportive of these three amendments.",23
27,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I propose to speak on amendment No. 2, which affects schedule No.2. My colleague the parliamentary secretary to the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), indicated that I would be dealing with schedules 3 and 4. I have to confess I am not briefed to so appear and I will leave schedules 3 and 4 to him. I am sure he will do that very well on his first appearance. In regard to schedule 2, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has indicated that the government will accept that amendment, which, I must say, is in stark contrast to the outrageous comments that he made when the thing was debated by way of second reading and in the consideration in detail stage in this House when it first occurred. If I can pick up the point that he made in respect of the 1997 bill, it is the case that when this returns to the Senate a further technical amendment will be required to amend the 1997 bill as well. My understanding of what Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, had to say in the Senate was that if that was required it would be facilitated by the government. I do not know what other possible problems there might be so far as this amendment is concerned. This amendment needs to be put into its context. There were three amendments which I moved in this place and which Senator Cook, on behalf of the opposition, moved in the Senate. Two others were rejected by the government and the Senate and this minor one was accepted. But this House needs to understand that which was rejected by the government in the Senate. This measure started on budget night 1996 when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced that the income derived from sale of a miner's right would be the subject of taxation and would take effect immediately, as from 20 August 1996 at 7.30 p.m. This removed the incentive for prospectors which had been there generally over a period of about 70 years and which had survived the Gutman report. In his report Mr Gutman, at the same time as recommending that income derived from the production of gold ought to be taxed, which was adopted by the federal Labor government and passed through this parliament, made a recommendation concerning section 23(pa), which applied both to gold and to a range of other minerals. I drew this to the attention of the parliamentary secretary when I took him through the list of all the minerals in Tasmania that had been prospected over the years to which this provision applied. I am sure that edified him well, as he now nods. In his report Mr Gutman said that this provided an important incentive to prospectors, and it does. Section 23(pa) was an incentive to prospectors who operate at the bottom end of the scale. In my state in Western Australia that means one-person or one-family shows operating in the goldfields or the Yilgarn, kicking over rocks and discovering prospective finds which are then taken over by some of the junior mining companies and, on some occasions, by the majors. This is an incentive which the Treasurer and the government removed without any review, without any recommendation, without any consultation with the industry. They removed that incentive overnight. That caused some considerable consternation. In the course of the last quarter of 1996 the Treasurer indicated that there would be a transitional period and that that transitional period would apply until the end of 1996. That proposal was referred by the Senate to a Senate committee, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which dealt with Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996. The committee's report had three separate strands to it: government senators who said that the removal of the exemption as from 31 December 1996 was perfectly agreeable and acceptable; a minority report by Senator Cook and other Labor senators which said that there ought to be a grandfathering so that if you held the prospector's or the miner's right as at budget night August 1996 and if you disposed of that subsequently then the income which derived from that sale was tax exempt, as it had effectively always been; and a minority report from Senator Murray of the Democrats, who suggested a five-year transitional clause be effected. (Extension of time granted) When the matter got to the floor of the Senate, Senator Murray from the Democrats, and the Treasurer with the help of Treasury officials, agreed to a five-year transitional arrangement which was predicated on a valuation of the prospector's right as at 20 August 1996. So the regime that was put in place as a result of the 1996 Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) was that, if you were the owner of a prospector's or a miner's right as at budget night on August 1996 and you disposed of that right any time up to the equivalent date in 2001, 20 August 2001, then what was tax exempt was the value of the miner's right as it was valued at budget night 1996 and you were taxed on the difference if the income derived was greater than that valued. It was also a requirement of that amendment which was moved by Senator Murray and agreed to by the government that you had to be a bona fide prospector at the time of the 1996 budget but also at the time that you derived the income. That amendment was subsequently discovered to be technically deficient and that is why we see the matter now come back before us in the 1997 bill. The 1997 bill seeks to rectify the technical deficiencies that the government made in the course of the 1996 bill. Having been presented with the opportunity, I took it and in the House amendments. The first was an amendment to reflect Senator Cook's minority report to grandfather these matters entirely. That was rejected by the parliamentary secretary and the government, and it was rejected again in the Senate when Senator Cook subsequently moved it. The second amendment I moved was a five year straight transitional arrangement to remove the unworkable and unfair valuation clauses. That was rejected by the parliamentary secretary and the government in this chamber and rejected again by the government and the Democrat senators in the Senate recently. The effect of that amendment was to remove the valuation requirements. The valuation requirements that the government has imposed upon the industry, additional upon the incentive they have taken away from prospectors to be out there prospecting, work in this way. If you are a prospector and you held a miner's or a prospector's right on budget night, 20 August 1996, and if you derive income from the sale of that miner's right any time between that moment in time and the equivalent date in 2001, then you will be tax exempt on the value of the miner's right as at budget night 1996. So you have to go out at least 12 months after the event and get a valuation of your miner's right as at August 1996, knowing when you do that at any point in the cycle the tax commissioner can go behind that valuation and ignore it if he wants to. The burden is now on prospectors to go out and get a valuation of something which in very many respects is highly unlikely or unable to be accurately valued. The whole nature of prospecting is, of course, that as soon as something is discovered the value changes. The value might change remarkably or it might change modestly. That is the whole nature of prospecting. That is the whole nature of the incentive of section 23(pa) which was there. That is the whole rationale of Mr Gutman when he made his recommendation that, while the income derived from gold ought to be taxable, and it has been as a consequence of the report, this incentive should be there, not just for gold prospectors but for other moved three minerals as well. What has the government finally agreed to? The government has agreed to the third amendment that I moved in this place, to remove the requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived. When I made this suggestion in the House the parliamentary secretary was not in a position to put forward any effective arguments as to why it ought not to be adopted, but he would not even countenance it. The argument I used in the chamber on that occasion was that a requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income, which could be at any point in the cycle up to 20 August 2001, was unfair. (Extension of time granted) Returning to the valuation regime, the valuation which occurs on miners' rights is in very many respects an intangible thing. You now place the burden on prospectors to go out and get a valuation of what their miner's right was worth as at budget night 1996. The tax commissioner can at any point in the cycle go behind that if he wants to. The modest amendment which the government now proposes to agree to takes away the unfair aspect that you must be a prospector when you derive the income, but it does not change the unworkable, unfair and effectively retrospective nature of the five-year valuation provisions which the government has inserted. This issue has created some interest in Western Australia, and it was reported in the West Australian on Tuesday of this week. In the course of my conversation with the journalist from the West Australian who wrote that report I made the point to him that the combined forces of the government and the Democrats in the Senate had seen the efforts of the Labor opposition to remove the valuation mechanism overridden. The reporter in his report made a reference to the Democrats and Senator Andrew Murray not supporting a five-year valuation regime. That is not correct and it is only appropriate that I make a correction of the record. Whilst Senator Murray has not agreed to the removal of the valuation requirements from the five year transitional arrangement, it is the case that a five-year transitional arrangement was the basis of his minority report and it is the case that he has moved to that five-year valuation arrangement and helped force the government away from its original position. I correct the record in that respect for the benefit of Senator Murray, who has at least been listening to some of the arguments put forward by the industry on this matter. I also noted that Senator Kemp indicated in the Senate that the five-year transitional mechanism which was inserted in the 1996 bill had been put there as a result of discussions between the Treasurer, Treasury officials and Senator Murray. This stood in stark contrast to the memorandum that Liberal senators distributed to the Liberal State Council meeting in December of last year saying it was all their work. That memorandum was signed by all of them, by Senators Ellison, Campbell, Knowles, Eggleston and Crane. I am sure if he had been there at the time, Senator Lightfoot would have signed it as well. So they claimed credit before the Liberal State Council in December, but who did the work? Senator Kemp, on behalf of the government in the Senate this week, said that was effected between the Democrats and the government. Where were the WA Liberal senators? Nowhere to be seen. When someone was needed to stand up for the Western Australian prospecting industry-whether it be gold or otherwise-where was the Liberal Party? Off the scene. What do we find today in the West Australian on page 6? 'Liberals snub Court over lease profit tax'. Premier Court went to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and said, 'Don't unfairly and retrospectively tax the prospectors. Don't do it.' He was ignored. Liberal senators said that they were the ones who got the five-year transitional arrangement. Senator Kemp said in the Senate that that was not true; it was not them. Where were the Liberal senators? Where was the Liberal Party when the prospecting industry of Western Australia wanted to retain a policy that Mr Gutman had said in his report was a valuable incentive for prospectors, the mining industry and the minerals and resources industry? They disappeared off the face of the earth. And the only thing we have seen from them is a misleading memorandum sent around to the Liberal State Council, presumably to protect their preselections. I hope the Liberal State Council looks very closely at these disappearing Liberal senators. I hope it looks very closely at Senator Campbell, who had some of the conduct of these matters in the Senate when he let down the industry in Western Australia. (Time expired).",23
28,Mr FILING,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I was interested in the comments made by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) on this matter. It is quite clear, as he says and as is reported in today's West Australian newspaper, that basically Western Australia does not have a voice in the Senate as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. This is a grave disappointment, given the fact that those senators who represent the Liberal Party in Western Australia gave an undertaking, a promise, to the State council that they were going to do something to protect the interests of prospectors in that state. We have a situation where, once again, there is the introduction of retrospective legislation affecting the resources sector and the mining sector, an industry that produces an enormous amount of wealth for this country. We have a problem where the representatives, who you would assume would do as they tell the preselection panels of the party in their state, represent the interests of the state in instances where the federal government overreaches itself to introduce legislation such as this, all capitulated. The irony is that Senator Lightfoot, who came to Canberra on the basis that he was going to be the supreme voice for the state of Western Australia, was not even there. He was absent. You might note, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the three Western Australian Independent members are here for this particular debate. Where are the WA Liberals in this place for this particular debate? The answer is: absent again. If I were a member of the State Council of the Liberal Party considering the preselon ections of the senators next time around, I would be looking very closely at this. I would be considering very closely whether or not it is worth returning to the Senate senators who let their own state down after giving a commitment that they would put their interests first. We know that this government from time to time has either reneged on or has changed commitments it has given to the electorate at the 1996 federal election. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who is next to me, has clearly pointed out the case in relation to the provisional tax uplift factor. We were promised a reduction from eight to six per cent. Then a bill was introduced into this place whacking it up to 10 per cent the following financial year. Quite clearly, if you average it out it is eight per cent both yearswell above the actual growth in income that is applicable, as the member pointed out to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) the other day. A range of measures have been introduced where the government has contradicted or reneged upon positions it took during the federal election. Another commitment was to reduce red tape or compliance on small businesses, but most of the legislation that impacts on small business introduced by this government has increased compliance and red tape. We have the ridiculous situation where the government has increased the cost burden on small businesses to comply with government legislation. Today we are debating amendments carried in the Senate to legislation that in effect introduces retrospectivity in the sale of mining leases. All I can say is that under the circumstances of what has taken place in the Senate, under the circumstances of this so called claim for credit by the five Liberal senators last year that they were responsible for the amendments that were moved by Senator Murray, it is clear that the interests of the state of Western Australia have been well and truly let down. I can only concur with Premier Court, following the outburst the other day in the party room against some of his complaints and particularly his complaint about the bailout of the Thai baht, something which I share his views entirely, that he has to represent the interests of WA. Quite clearly the Liberal Party here has forgotten them and the WA Liberal senators ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for once again letting down the state which they pledged to represent.",26
29,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am now armed with a couple of pieces of paper. I referred earlier in my contribution to a report on Tuesday, 26 August in the West Australian. I am reported as saying: Opposition resources spokesman Stephen Smith said the failure of the Democrats and the government to allow a five-year transition period was another blow to the goldmining industry. What I actually said in my release was: the failure of the government and the Democrats to support the amendment That was intended as a reference to the amendment to remove the valuation provision. That is the unfairness that has been done to Senator Murray there, and I correct that on his behalf. I move on to the territory of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I see he has been joined by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in this place but I do not see any of the Liberal members from Western Australia. The other night, during the adjournment debate, I said that Prime Minister Howard ought to say in public what he says privately about the Western Australian members of this place, namely, that they are all hopeless and useless. That is reflected by the fact that when the best of them, Geoff Prosser, the honourable member for Forrest, retired to the back benches all the speculation was that Ministers Moylan and Williams would get the chop. I went through the report card about all the other WA Liberal members who I see are absent. Now let me turn to the senators' memorandum. On Senate letterhead, the memorandum reads: To: All Members of State Council From: WA Liberal Senators Subject: Section 23(pa) of the Income Tax Amendment Act Date: 13 December, 1996 State Councillors will be pleased to know that as a result of urging by the WA Liberal Senators, the Government accepted an amendment to extend the deadline for the tax free sale of mining leases by bona fide prospectors for 5 years. There is nothing about the valuation mechanisms there, which the industry say are unfair and unworkable, but I will leave that to one side for the present. To continue: In previous discussions the Treasurer had only been prepared to extend the deadline by three months until 31 December, 1996. The WA Senators welcomed the 5 year extension to the deadline as it will enable prospectors to rationalise their leases without undue pressure. Signed Senator Ian Campbell Senator Winston Crane Senator Alan Eggleston Senator Chris Ellison (Senator Knowles is unable to sign this Memorandum because she is at sea travelling to the Antarctic.) But I assume her spirit was with them.",27
30,Mr FILING,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Did Ellison sign it?,28
31,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, Senator Ellison did sign it. In the Senate on Monday, 25 August Senator Kemp said, at page 5573 of the Senate Hansard: I have been at a number of meetings with Senator Murray and the Treasurer. My view is that this was an amendment essentially drafted by Senator Murray, but we attempted to get it fixed up at a very late stage and on the run. It did not achieve what was expected. Senator Murray can speak for himself on the nature of any agreement, but I am not sure that I can add anything further to it. Senator Cook then drew their attention to the memorandum, and Senator Murray said, on the same page: I think I am obliged to indicate on the record that I had an amendment and the government said they would like to improve that amendment. I had a meeting with the Treasurer. It was hasty. I am not offended by the fact that neither of us got it at the time. There was a great deal of pressure. fact is, at the meeting in the Treasurer's office, we resolved the final amendment that was passed. Who was at the meeting? Was Senator Knowles there? No, we know she was in the Antarctic. Was Campbell there? Was Crane there? Was Eggleston there? Was Ellison there? No. Where were they: defending the interests of Western Australia? No? Where were they? Doing the only thing they have ever done-trying to make sure that they have got the numbers on the Liberal WA State Council to protect their preselection. I hope the WA Liberal Party preselectors take out their admonition on them. At least we find the honourable member for Curtin and the honourable member for Moore here in the chamber trying to do their bit to protect some of Western Australia's industries. In the West Australian today, 28 August, we find the heading 'Liberals snub Court over lease profit tax'. The article begins: Premier Richard Court has been snubbed by Prime Minister John Howard and Federal Liberal Party MPs over the imposition of a retrospective tax on the sale of prospectors' leases. Mr Court appealed to Mr Howard, Mr Costello and all WA Liberal MPs to reverse the retrospective aspect of the tax soon after it was announced in the Budget last year. It goes on to say: Democrats Senator Andrew Murray said yesterday that WA Liberal Senator Ian Campbell, who is parliamentary secretary to Mr Costello, had lobbied him to vote against an amendment that would give prospectors a five-year breathing space before the tax is introduced. So here we have Senator Murray saying that not only was Senator Campbell not able to sign this memorandum; he was out there actively lobbying the Democrats senator against the imposition of a five-year transitional arrangement. Welcome, Senator Campbell, to your preselectors. Not only did you mislead them when you signed this; you were actively out there doing exactly the opposite. (Time expired)",28
32,Mr CAMPBELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In opposing these amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3), I must pay tribute to the member for Perth (Mr right Stephen Smith), who has grasped his portfolio The very well. But, sadly, if you take out the influence of Julian Grill in the Western Australian parliament and Stephen Smith in the federal parliament, there is precious little else in the Labor Party. The Gutman report brought down a recomfor mendation that 23(pa) be left alone, for a good reason. You could not get a drier econoindustry, mist that Mr Gutman. He understood that prospecting is the basis of the continuation the industry. We need to be finding, identifycreates ing about a million ounces a month to give continuity to this industry. The other point that needs to be made that, while the behaviour of the Western Australian Liberals in this House and in the Senate is reprehensible, this is not just Western Australian problem. We are talking about the second biggest export industry in Australia. This is a problem for the whole of there before. Australia. It is laughable that this government should claim to understand industry when it has acted against the second biggest export earner for this country in so many different ways. With 23(pa) the effects will reverberate through the industry for a lot longer than this House realises. You only have to cast your mind back a few months to when the Treasurer (Mr Costello) condoned the sell-off by the Reserve Bank of our gold, and selling it at the bottom of the market. Here we have these who have never created a thing in their lives, never created a single cent of real wealth their lives, selling off the people's asset. was not their gold, it was our gold. They sold it off at the bottom of the market and punched a hole even further into the market. The only logical interpretation is that the Treasurer his associates or the Reserve Bank had shorttaxation sold gold. However, I suspect that reason is stupidity-clear, unadulterated stupidity. I must also question the judgment of the member for Perth when he says that former Minister Prosser was the best of the Liberals. If that is true, heaven help the Liberal I can assure this House that my party, Ausbeen tralia First, will be running a candidate  to depose him at the next election. I think will certainly be a good judgment of the people if it occurs. I want to state again that this is not a Westem Australian problem; this is a problem the whole of this nation. What the governvery ment has done is damaged our second biggest an industry which is highly diversified, which is much more Australian owned of than the rest of the mining industry and which a lot of employment in rural areas, but also creates employment where it is desperately needed, on the east coast. I suspect there is quite a bit of manufacturing done in both is New South Wales and Victoria which relates directly to the goldmining industry. There has already been a downturn in the industry. You a have already had drilling contractors having their contracts postponed. You have got uncertainty in the industry now which was not How can the nation possibly benefit from this? Where is the advantage? On the very day that the Treasurer condoned the irresponsible behaviour, the treacherous, treasonable behaviour of the Reserve Bank, the goldmining companies lost in capitalisation more than they were purported to have gained in the sale of gold. In today's Financial Review you have seen a write-down of the capitalisation of goldmining companies as a direct result of the actions of this government-both the sell-off people of the gold and 23(pa). There is absolutely no doubt that 23(pa) is in retrospective. In our Prime Minister (Mr It Howard), who leads this rabble of urban centralists, you have one of the great retrospective legislators. I am going to run out of time, but I am going to speak again on this or issue because it is so important. Retrospective is abhorrent, and it is happening far the real too much in this parliament. I thought the member for Perth was much too generous in respect of Senator Murray. The fact about the Democrats is that they are the left wing of the Labor Party in the Senate. Instead of putting forward these penny-ante Party. amendments, Senator Murray should have out there supporting the industry. He should have been out there opposing the attempts by the government to attack this that industry. The Democrats have forgotten that the function of the left wing of the Labor Party used to be to protect the interests of workers. That has obviously been forgotten by both the Labor Party and the Democrats. I will continue. (Time expired)",28
33,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I will pick up some of the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and this will be my last contribution to the debate. I will then leave it in the capable hands of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). Firstly, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's criticism of my spirit of generosity: Prosser was the best of the WA Liberal ministers and in the end he did the right thing. Secondly, my spirit of generosity to Senator Murray was simply to correct the record, to make the point that at least he had a five-year transition phase in mind. What he will not support is removing the valuation mechanism from that five-year transitional arrangement, and it is the case that he supported the amendment that the government is now saying it will support in respect of being a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. But it is the case that the only political outfit in this parliament which supports a straight five-year transitional arrangement and the only political party in this parliament which has moved for a complete grandfathering is the Labor Party. To conclude on Senator Campbell and others, as Senator Campbell relates to the substance of the message before the House, the report in today's West Australian says: Senator Campbell's lobbying in favour of the tax has angered members of the Liberal State Council Senator Campbell was also one of the five WA Liberal senators who wrote to the State council in December, taking credit for a change to the tax so prospectors would not pay in full for five years. Senator Murray said yesterday that the amendment was in fact sponsored by the Democrats. Here we have Senator Murray and Senator Kemp saying that the memorandum that was sent down by Liberal senators worried about their preselection was disingenuous in the extreme. It was misleading. What could you do that would be more misleading to your preselectors than to send this document around? And now we also have Senator Murray on the record saying that in Senator Campbell's case it went further. He was out there actively opposing the 'five-year breathing space', as it is described in the West Australian today. To conclude on the point of policy, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is right. This is about prospectors and the prospecting industry generally. It is not something which simply applies to Western Australia or which simply applies to gold. In the second reading debate in this House I listed, for the benefit of the parliamentary secretary, the minerals in respect of which it applies in Tasmania. This is the removal of an incentive to prospectors, which will do damage to Australia's great minerals and resources industries and which will do damage to Australian economic growth, Australian jobs and Australian exports. And the parliament should be aware of that. So far as the government is concerned, this comes in the face of the appalling conduct of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his handling of the announcement of the RBA gold' bullion sell off. It comes in the face of continual attempts by the government to cap the diesel fuel rebate. So where has the government been in terms of its support for Australia's great minerals and resources industries? Do we see an industry development ethos from this government? No. Do we see an export culture from this government? No. What do we see? We see the Treasurer-in particular-and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) taking Australia's great minerals and resources industry, including the gold industry, for granted. What did we hear from Treasurer Costello on the day of the gold sell off? He said, There will always be an international market for gold because people like wearing gold jewellery.' It took him until about a week later in Cairns to make some supportive comments about the goldmining industry. Have we ever heard the Treasurer say anything about the gold industry in this parliament since he has been a member? Someone should check the record. I conclude by seeking leave to table a memorandum from WA Liberal senators to all members of the WA Liberal State Council as well as an extract from page 5573 of Senate Hansard for Monday, 25 August 1997 and an article from page 6 of the West Australian of Thursday, 28 August, headed 'Liberals snub Court over lease profit tax'. That proves conclusively the completely disingenuous way in which WA Liberal senators have let down the great minerals and resources industry in Western Australia and in which they have deliberately misled their political party in Western Australia. I seek to leave to table those papers. Leave not granted. Mr Stephen Smith-Not granted? That is an absolute disgrace.",30
34,Mr CAMPBELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I must concur with the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). The failure and lack of courage of the Liberal Party in not accepting the tabling of those documents show the extent to which the Liberal Party will go in trying to hide its guilt in this matter. I want to make it clear to this House that Senator Campbell is absolutely no relation of mine. I was a little disconcerted at the number of times his name was raised by the member for Perth, and there does seem to be some confusion from time to time. I want to make it absolutely clear that he is way at all. Mr Ronaldson-If he was, he certainly wouldn't acknowledge it.",31
35,Mr CAMPBELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Even if he were my brother, I certainly would not acknowledge him. What we are dealing with here goes to the heart of one of the things that is wrong with this country. Governments talk about support for industry. The CSIRO said 10 years ago that the mining industry imports $1.2 billion worth of equipment which could be made better or cheaper in Australiaremember, better for the mining industry is the same as cheaper. The reason that has not happened one has to ask. There are three things you need to start a new industry. You need a state-of-the-art customer-our miners are the best in the world. You need a big customer-we have the biggest miners in the world. What we do not have is government will. There never has been any government will. You get members of the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) going around talking about support for new industries. They go off on esoteric things like the information super highway knowing full well that they will never put the money into it that Malaysia is going to put in. They miss these golden opportunities to create real industry in this country. What do we do? We do the worse thing: we attack one of the main industries that could provide these job opportunities for Australia. You have to look at the consistency of this government. Here we have a government that kicks the gold mining industry in its teeth yet hands out great assistance to the Thai government.",31
36,Mr FILING,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,It is $1.35 billion.,31
37,Mr CAMPBELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It is $1.35 billion in assistance, as the member for Moore points out to me. If the government was at all consistent with its stated policy on treaties, which is weak enough anyway, it would have brought that into this House for debate. There is absolutely no doubt that this money is at risk, no matter what the Treasurer (Mr Costello) or the Prime Minister say. If the Thai economy does not respond we are going to be in a situation where we have an unreno relation in any deemable debt. Quite frankly, our assistance there was proportionately far greater than other nations. Japan, which has so much invested in Thailand, in my view should have been leading with a far greater contribution pro rata than it did. But it does demonstrate how this government likes to stamp around on the world stage. I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) gets up every morning and says, 'How do I look in the eyes of the world?' I can tell you that in the eyes of the world he may look okay but in the eyes of Australia he is looking extremely tarnished. Just to illustrate the difference in the attitude, the government rushes to help the Thais but is prepared to kill off and damage Australia's second biggest export earner, an industry has the potential to create, and already does create, an enormous amount of jobs and that has the ability to create far more. Something has been said about Senator Murray's contribution. Putting a valuation on prospectors' leases is very difficult. Gutman realised that this was very much in the nature of a lottery. The attraction is out therestrong wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. These people go out there and expend their time and effort. Mark Creasey was out there for 19 years, with the backside out of his pants, looking for gold. Here was a man who had qualifications. He was a mining engineer. He could have got a good job but he preferred be out there looking for his El Dorado. the Eventually he found it. Good luck to him. Where is this spirit of free enterprise the Liberal Party used to talk about? They should be encouraging these people. Instead, they try to put a value on it. How can you put a value on these leases? No-one really knows. What the Treasurer has done is clearly retroto spective. There is no doubt about that. Gutman was quite right; leave the thing entirely alone because it is that hope, that glimmer of enormous wealth that drives these people. That is what keeps them out there looking. Despite all the protestations large companies, most big deposits in Australia have been found in the first instance prospectors. (Extension of time granted) We see this in assistance to industry. When the government gives assistance to industry, who gets the lion's share of it? Companies like BHP. What did BHP ever achieve? They take the money and they spend it but they inevitably buy up technology developed by small and medium sized businesses. It clear that the whole thing is skewed in the wrong way. The government has to look at this in a logical and rational manner. If it does that it will see the folly of what it has done. Joseph Gutnick from Central Mining, a man for whom I have a high regard, kept explorwhere ing. When everyone else had pulled their dollars out of exploration, Joe was out there still looking for gold. And he was successful. His advice to the Reserve Bank was to go out that and buy the gold back. They could have redeemed their stupidity. There is still time for the government to redeem its stupidity and to reverse the decision it made on 23(pa). There is absolutely no doubt that 23(pa) will affect the industry. No-one can deny that that is going to happen. While I know that the socialist ethic is very in the government, you have to consider the incentive that 23(pa) does provide to this industry. The industry is having enonnous problems. It needs to find $1 million a month to maintain a future production. It has to identify that resource. It is now faced with native title. We have just about exhausted all to of the brownfield sites; we are now going to greenfield sites. Every greenfield site is going to run headlong into native title. This that government sat on its hands. I went to the Prime Minister and urged him to move quickly to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. After all, Paul Keating believed that was the case. Had the Prime Minister had the courage do that the High Court would probably have reacted differently in its stupid Wik decision. But he did not have the nerve. He said to me, 'It would be too provocative.' Government is basically about leadership. Provocative to whom? I will tell you: to that of the constituency they have in Sydney. I have pointed out many times that Sydney by is an enormous aberration to Australian politics. It is not Canberra; it is the members from both parties from Melbourne and Sydney who come here-the single issue people. They have no concept of how wealth is really created in this land. I have said in the past that perhaps Australia's salvation lay in the nuking of Sydney. I said it in jest; my views is quite on that are certainly hardening. It is a real problem. There is no city in Australia that lives on its intrinsic wealth. None of them survive on intrinsic wealth; this wealth is provided to Australia by the hinterland. It is collected in the cities and they get the benefit of it. Even in Western Australia, the state Liberal Party imposed a royalty on gold, Mr Barnett said that he wanted the money to be spent in Perth. He wanted to take the wealth of the goldfields and spend it in Perth to provide pork-barrelTasmania ling to a Perth constituency. We have seen this in their north bridge tunnel. They are building a tunnel that will cost $Y2 billion. That tunnel will not generate one ounce of wealth, not one shekel. be all cost. That money spent in my electorate would bituminise every road, open up new mines, fix up all the crossings on the Gibb River road in the Tanami Desert and there would be enough money left over to fix the railway stations into Perth. But no, they spend it all in Perth where is all cost to the taxpayers. Why? Because people live in Perth, and they think the people in Perth want it. The people in Perth are totally disinterested in it. But what is this government Throw $100 million at an Alice SpringsDarwin railway. This railway is fruit loop stuff. The government know that. They are stop. not interested in building a railway. They interested in pork-barrelling elections in South Australia and the Northern Territory. If that money were to be spent in my electorate, where changes to road funding have swept millions of dollars away from the state government, it would provide real wealth, create real wealth for the whole of Australia. But they are more interested in this stunt to try to influence the elections in Victoria and New South Wales. And what about Tasmania which is dying on its feet? Mr Miles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. We are debating specific amendments. I suggest to you that what we are now hearing is really right off the topic. I ask you to draw the member back to the debate.",31
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I ment, thank the parliamentary secretary. I would remind all members that, when dealing with amendments, the speeches they make should deal solely with the subject of those amenddo. ments. (Extension of time granted)",33
39,Mr CAMPBELL,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy probably Speaker, I will try to direct myself to the I can understand the member's sensitivity. sits on his hands while the government lets die on its feet and pork-barrels the rest of us. But these things are germane. We are talking about attitudes of government here-what governments do in their unthinking way. They just roll on like some out of It will control juggernaut. What this bill actually does is inhibit prospecting. Prospecting is the basis of the industry. If you stop the prospecting, eventually you will stop the whole industry. There up is absolutely no doubt about that. What incentive is there now for people like Mark it Creasey who have contributed an enormous the amount to this country? What incentive is there for them to go out and risk life and limb and health and wealth in remote areas under very trying conditions, particularly in the summer, under the present regime? There is going to do? simply none at all. Prospecting will no longer occur. It will just It will simply decline. It will become the are pastime of a few retirees who are content to go out and try to find the odd nugget. There will no longer be any prospecting with any consistency out there, with people loaming up and finding out where gold is shed from. That is how you find mines. You do not find them by just going around trusting your luck to electronic prospecting. You have taken away this incentive. How can this be in the national interest? The thinking is just so short term. What we are seeing with the Senate is the rejection of the very modest amendments put forward. I say they are very modest; they are totally inadequate, in my view. There is absolutely no doubt that, had those Liberal Party senators-my namesake foremost amongst them-been prepared to put the interests of Western Australia and the nation before the socialist policies of their govern this would not occur. If as senators they were prepared to represent the interests of their state, this would not occur. They are clearly not doing what they were elected to I can only hope that the member for Moore (Mr Filing)-who seems to have an insight, from experience, into the preselecbill. tion process in Western Australia-is right He and that the Liberal Party will take its vengeance on these people. They have clearly sold out the interests of the state-but, in doing so, they have sold out the interests of the entire nation. This has to be said over and over again: this is not a parochial Western Australian issue; this is about the wealth of the nation. There is not a lot more I can say on this. I am sick to the gut with the attitude of the senators and the members of the Liberal Party who should be in this place today. They should have been opposing this. They are just not here. There is no regard at all for the people whom they are supposed to represent. I can only hope that this is remembered at the ballot box.",33
40,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.13 a.m.)-I would just like to make a few comments following the debate which has occurred. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) said that this government has done nothing for business. I can assure you that that is not the view of business out there. This government is respected by business for what it is doing. There is no doubt about that. I will make a light remark to the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell): I suspect Senator Campbell will be relieved that he is not related to you. Comments were made about the gold sell off. My understanding is that the gold sell off was made prior to the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Costello). There had been a major decrease in the price of gold before that sell off. The other interesting thing about that is that, if my memory serves me correctly, when the announcement was made, the price of gold was around $332 an ounce. Even though it had dropped down to $318 or $316, within a few days or a week or two after that announcement was made it was back up at $328. I did not look last night to see what the price of gold was, but I suspect it is back very close to the point at which there was a drop. Some of the statements made in this debate were not correct in any shape or form, and I would like to make a few comments. The government is not attempting to remove the five-year transitional arrangement; it is simply trying to make it work. I do not think that was understood by two or three people who have commented on it. The government did not support either of the three amendments moved by the Labor Party in the Senate. What we sought to do was to ensure that the Senate's amendments of December 1996 worked effectively. The December 1996 amendments contained technical defects. The government will accept the Senate's amendment No.2, although we believe it goes beyond what was intended by the Senate last year. The government does not agree that our mining right proposal is retrospective in any sense. I want to emphasise that: we do not agree with the concept that it is retrospective in any shape or form. The government in the 1996 budget night proposal was consistent with past practice when any tax benefit was removed. The budget announcement proposed that the tax exemption provided by 23(pa) would not be available in respect of income derived under contracts entered into after 7.30 on budget night. However, following concerns expressed about the measure, including very vocal concerns-and I emphasise very vocal-by the Western Australian members and senators of the Liberal Party, the Treasurer announced on 16 October 1996 that, to ensure that the transitional provisions were fair to prospectors who were in the process of selling tenements when the announcement was made, the government has decided that the measure would not apply with respect to sale, transfer or assignments for contracts entered into up to midnight on 31 December 1996. I stress those few points which I have made just so that the record is quite straight after the debate which we have just had. Question resolved in the affirmative.",34
41,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.18 a.m.)-I move: That amendment No. 1 be disagreed to. This amendment refers to the capital gains tax provisions. The capital gains tax exemption on retirement is one of the government's election commitments to small business and is a central element of its package of reforms to the superannuation system to enhance flexibility and choice in superannuation. The measure enables small business owners to claim the capital gains tax exemption for active assets sold on or after 1 July 1997 where the proceeds are used for retirement. As for the capital gains tax rollover relief, the capital gains tax exemption will apply to trading businesses in which the total net business assets, both passive and active, do not exceed $5 million. The exemption will not apply to businesses wholly engaged in passive investment. The new capital gains tax retirement exemption will create greater opportunities for small business people to provide for a secure retirement without having to sacrifice continued investment and development of their businesses during their working lives. In the Senate there has been a debate in which Senator Kemot and Senator Sherry have alleged a range of things. I want to make a few comments about that. The coalition has delivered on its election commitment to provide an exemption of capital gains tax of up to $500,000 where a small business is sold for retirement purposes. The Labor Party and the Democrats are concentrating on the multimillionaires taking advantage of the exemption, on people with expensive personal assets such as antiques or yachts that the majority of small business owners will not have. In other words, they are arguing from individual cases to the general situation to apply to all small business people, which is quite ludicrous. The exemption is available to all small business taxpayers provided they meet the appropriate tests, including that net business assets including passive and active assets and all pre-CGT assets are less than $5 million. Labor's amendments seek to include the personal assets that cost more than $5,000 of small business owners in the $5 million threshold. What they are doing is reducing the number of small business people that will qualify. They really are kicking small business people in the stomach when they are supposed to be giving support to small business. They purportedly support small business and people providing for their retirement. But in this regard their actions are quite contrary. Only on Tuesday this week Rob Bastion summed it up perfectly when he said, 'Neither the ALP nor the Democrats have won any small business friends today.' That is in reference to the debate in the Senate in regard to the capital gains tax. Out there the small business people are very strongly supportive of the government measures in regard to small business. The Senate's amendments will also require small business people to incur costs in having their personal assets valued to determine whether they qualify for rollover relief-their homes, which are capital gains tax exempt, their cars, their computers, no doubt lots of other things like lounge suites and so on. The Labor Party is proposing that all small business people have this burdensome red tape put across them for capital gains tax purposes. It is quite a ludicrous proposal which is being put to us by the Labor Party and the Democrats. in government, Labor were not interested in small business or in reducing compliance costs, and they have continued the same attitude in opposition. The proposal will mean the family home of small business taxpayers will be included in the determination of whether the taxpayer is eligible for the exemption on retirement. That will be an exception to the general treatment in the tax law where the family home is normally excluded as an eligible asset. In effect, the proposal would mean that the family home of small business people would be taxed. Small business taxpayers will need to value each and every of their personal assets if they are not certain whether they are worth more than $5,000 or appreciate in value. We reject this proposal which has been put up by the Democrats and the Labor Party entirely.",34
42,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 is an omnibus taxation bill which covers a number of areas which were announced in last year's budget. The major matters covered include superannuation, capital gains tax and other taxation issues. ought to be understood by the opposition has supported the bill in both chambers. We have not only supported it but we have tried and, in some cases, succeeded, to improve the equity of the bill through amendments. The amendment being debated now into schedule 1 concerns the $500,000 capital gains tax exemption for funds used for retirereasonable ment purposes. This is the big sweetener; this is the big 'sorry' from the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to the big end of town. If you recall, last year the Treasurer imposed a surcharge on superannuation for high income earners and boasted about that aspect of the budget representing the coalition's commitment to fair taxation and getting stuck into the big of town. But, with this proposition, the Treassible urer is back to the big end of town saying, 'We are very sorry.' The coalition have always opposed measures for fairness in our taxation system, including capital gains tax, and in the past have sought to repeal capital gains tax. Their problem is that they do not have community support to do away with capital gains tax, so what the government is seeking to do here, via backdoor means and for certain sections of the community only, is to effectively capital gains tax. It is absolutely outrageous for the Treasurer and this government to claim that someone who has a net wealth in excess of $5 ployees. million-that is your Howard battler-should also be entitled to earn another $500,000 completely tax free, completely exempt, provided it is used for retirement purposes. What a nice little super scheme that is if happen to be able to take advantage of it. In our view, someone with in excess of $5 million in net assets does not require further subsidy from taxpayers for their retirement. They ought to be able to pay capital gains tax. It is ridiculous to argue the people affected by this amendment being hard done by. They are already wealthy; they do not require or deserve further substantial taxation subsidies. Accordingly, Labor will continue to support the amendment to schedule 1 moved in the Senate, which It government is opposing, and will be dividing House that the on this matter. Labor understands that for many people their small business has been the vehicle by which they have saved for their retirement. We understand that for some people business cash flow needs have precluded the capacity save regularly in a superannuation fund. In addition, prior to Labor's reform of the benefit limits, there was a significant bias against small business in superannuation in some circumstances, especially where the businesses were not incorporated. As usual, despite the rhetoric of the coalition, it was Labor that fixed the anomalies as that confronted small business, not the coalition. Indeed, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), end who was the then Treasurer and the responminister, presided over the unfair superannuation and taxation system that prevailed until Labor's reforms. But this is not about small business; this is not what we are talking about here. This is about big business. Despite there having been a problem historically, there is no modem evidence that a further very large concession is justified. Moreover, if we are going to have a large concession, it has to be targeted to ensure that a windfall is not delivered to repeal people who do not need it. Tax, although at concessional rates, is payable on superannuati<?n contributions, fund earnings and final benefits for ordinary emBy contrast, this bill is proposing to completely exempt from tax a substantial capital gain-$500,000-with the only conditions being the age of the recipient and that the funds be used for retirement purposes. you This will provide a massive advantage in tax terms between the multimillionaire recipients of this perk and the great bulk of the Australany Ian community who are employees. The average superannuation fund balance at the moment, and hence the average payout if it that were to occur at the moment, is around are $38,000. (Extension of time granted) This proposal, if enacted, will provide a disproportionate benefit relative to the general community superannuation pay-out standardthat is, an amount around 13 times the size of the the average superannuation account balance is proposed to be exempt from tax whereas the much smaller sum has already faced taxation and may well face further taxation when it is paid out. Why should there not be a generally equivalent taxation regime applying to both employees and to small business? In addition, it needs to be remembered that Labor has already instituted a benefit for small business-namely, the 50 per cent exemption from capital gains tax on goodwill in a business up to the value of $2 1,4 million, which currently applies under the capital gains tax system. The opposition intends to ensure that what the government is presenting as a fair measure is not a big rort which is available to the few and not to the many. That is why we have moved our amendment and why the Senate has accepted our amendment-to ensure that the personal wealth of individuals, as well as their net business assets, are taken into account in the eligibility criteria for this exemption. There is nothing extraordinary or out of the way about personal assets being taken into account. That is precisely what occurs in relation to the assets test for eligibility for the pension. Labor is not opposed to clearing away unfair taxation hurdles or amending provisions which impact negatively on jobs or on growth. But, having said that, we are not going to sit back and see the comprehensiveness of the tax base eroded by what really amounts to a rort. Let me repeat: the only people who are going to benefit from the government's stand are those who have in excess of $5 million of personal wealth. This is, regrettably, a perfect example of the real priorities of this government. The government does not have enough money for decent child care, it does not have enough money for legal aid and it says it has all sorts of problems with the black hole but it has money to narrow the tax base by allowing this particular exemption. We note that the government has affirmed that what it really means by tax reform is less tax for the very wealthy. It has been raised in the Senate as to how many people will benefit from the proposed exemption by the government and what will be the cost to revenue. We have in the explanatory memorandum a sum of $45 million being the cost of the scheme overall. What we need to understand here is: what will be the cost to revenue of the government's refusal to support the Senate amendment? This is a government which always complains about the Senate costing the taxpayer money with its changes. Here we have a situation where the Senate-and Labor concurs-is endeavouring to save the taxpayer money. We want to know the cost of the government persisting with its proposal and refusing to support the Senate amendment. We also want to know how many people will benefit from this scheme. This is claimed to be a scheme which supports small business. The government rhetoric is all about small business. In fact, some 97 per cent of small businesses have less than $1.3 million in net assets. So they are not going to be affected by the limit which we are proposing and by the fact that we propose that personal assets ought to be included in the calculation. Some 97 per cent of small businesses have less than $1.3 million in net assets. Our view is that this is not about small business at all. This is about big business; this is about those who are already well off. I would ask whether the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) can advise the House how many people will benefit from the government's proposition and what will be the cost to revenue of the government's proposition?",35
43,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.32 a.m.)-I want to make a few very brief comments. I was a bit amused by the comment by the Labor Party that we are only interested in the big end of town. Only today in the Australian we see the headline 'Taxpayers' $60m fails to save jobs'. Mr Ronaldson-How much?,37
44,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Sixty million. Given by whom? Given by Simon Crean, by the Labor Party. Who to? DuPont. They are small business people-$60 million! Under their rules, it is disappearing. The member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) is saying that the Labor Party did not look after the big end of townl I want to say to him that this government is going to look after small business, and is doing so. Virtually month by month there are programs and developments which assist the small business people of this country. A lot of them had to live with 22 per cent interest rates under the previous Labor government. Then, of course, in reply, the member for Wills comments conceded that there was not enough money for child care and a few of these other programs. That is true, there was not. Why wasn't there enough money? Because of the Labor Party's big black hole$10.5 billion-which had to be sorted out and which had been put on the bankcard by the previous government. What have we done about it? It was not our responsibility but we are doing something about it. We did not cause it but we have done something about it. Within three years we will have a balanced budget so that we can have programs and services which are paid for by the government during the period in which they raised the taxation revenuenot like the previous government where they just wanted to rack it all up on a bankcard. This government is about doing something to assist small business so that they are not going to be burdened down by the proposal which has been put to us by the Labor Party and by the Democrats. The Labor Party really are an anti-small business party. It is against small business people providing for their retirement. That is what this is about. To come in here and give the impression that they are actually supporting small business is really beyond belief. First they have tried to have the capital gains tax exempt amount-Senator Harradine thwarted that attempt to have the amount to small business people. So it was only because of the Liberal and National Party senators and Senator Harradine that that was thwarted. That is what the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats were on about. This is from a party that was against a superannuation surcharge. I thought the superannuation surcharge would be on those people who had been regarded as well off. Yet the Labor Party opposes those sorts of things and then comes in here and says that we are supporting the big end of town. What we are doing is getting a balanced approach to these types of matters. We oppose this amendment very strongly.",37
45,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I would just like to make a short response to what the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) said. He said the Labor Party was against the surcharge. If you recall, the Labor Party joined with other members of the House of Representatives on that side to vote for the superannuation surcharge. There happened to be only five people over this side-none of them members of the Labor Party and certainly none of them members of the coalition.",38
46,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I find it absolutely extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) would want to, off his own bat, raise the issue of DuPont. What we are talking about here is the closure of a textile factory where 160 jobs at Bayswater are being lost as a result of the uncertainty generated by this government's failure to stand on the Industry Commission's draft recommendations, which are basically an exit strategy in the textiles, clothing and footwear area. They have made it clear that the reasons they have closed down are the Industry Commission recommendations and the fact of uncertainty in the textile, clothing and footwear industries generated by that Industry Commission report and by the failure of this government to respond adequately to it. DuPont joins other factories, Gloweave and Berlei, which have closed since the Industry Commission's recommendations. We just wonder how many it will take before the government wakes up to what is going on there. The parliamentary secretary also said he was concerned about the black hole. But his position on this amendment is that a person with business assets of up to $5 million, with no account to be taken of personal assets-so they can have their yachts and antiques, whatever-can still get the benefit of a $500,000 tax-free exemption into superannuation. We regard this as simply inappropriate. We believe that it will present new tax avoidance opportunities. There is no doubt that it will become a major vehicle for tax planning by high wealth individuals in the future. This measure should be restricted to small business-the opposition supports that; we have no problem with that-and it should not be opened up to big business in the way that the government proposes. I note that the parliamentary secretary cannot provide or has not provided any response to my questions about how many people will benefit from these measures or what they will cost revenue. These are fairly basic questions which this House ought to know the answers to before we vote on these issues. But we do not get any response on these matters. The opposition does not understand why the government wants to narrow the tax base in this area. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) comes in day by day and says we need to widen the tax base-and he wants to slip through the GST-so why is the government narrowing the tax base in relation to this? Also, how the government guarantee that this simply will not become another vehicle for tax planners? We believe that it will indeed be a vehicle tax avoidance and it is coming from a government which is showing no inclination to get stuck into tax avoidance by high income earners. On the contrary, it is creating vehicles for further tax avoidance like the one out in the amendment before the House. I note that the 1996-97 budget established a high wealth individuals task force, the background to which we got back in February 1996. Former Treasurer Ralph Willis noted in a press release that aggressive planning and minimisation arrangements put at risk revenue estimated at $800 million a year. But the subsequent budget papers, in fact the 1996-97 budget paper No.1, provide for additional revenue of the order of only $100 million from high wealth individuals, with no figure being put on the possible intake in 1998-99 and the following year. So it would appear that even the $100 million which the 1996-97 budget papers anticipated would be realised is in doubt, and we are getting no estimates of revenue from the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office. This seems to recognise that the long lead time between that initial announcement in February 1996 and the yet to be enacted measures to discourage these tax avoidance and minimisation practices may be affording high wealth individuals an opportunity to reorganise their affairs to avoid any likely changes in the law. Further, the government's exposure draft legislation on trust loss measures released in February this year cuts back the expected revenue from these measures from $155 million for 1996-97, which Labor was proposing, to a mere $5 million in 1997-98 and $15 million in 1998-99. So in this area too we see the government giving up on tax avoidance and then they want to come back to the electorate and say that it is all too hard(Time expired)",38
47,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.41 a.m.)-I want to make a few more points in regard to government support for can small business. Quite contrary to what the Labor Party would have people believe, the government is making progress in giving for support to small business. I refer to the Yellow Pages Small Business Index and some of the comments which we can be drawn from that. In regard to small business in this country, the sales and profit growth for the set current quarter has firmed. That is a good indicator that things are on the way up, that small business are supportive of the programs which we are putting into place-no doubt partly due to our dealing with the unfair dismissal laws, which left many small businesses with the view that there was no point in employing people. We are doing something about that. Secondly, small businesses are expecting an increase in employment. That is good news. Small businesses do employ many Australians, and in this last quarter they have developed higher expectations for an increase in employment in small business. Thirdly, capital expenditure, even though it has remained relatively stable up until now, in the last quarter rebounded to its highest level for three years. That is promising news. Out there in the small business sector this government's policies are starting to work and to give them confidence. Fourthly, expectations for the economy over the next 12 months have firmed, and this is consistent with other major business surveys. Fifthly, small business people see the debate about taxation reform as a top priority for government. Of course, we see the Labor Party implacably opposed-in fact, it is going backwards-to doing anything progressive in this country in addressing one of the major issues confronting Australians: tax reform. The Labor Party sees it as a priority in regard to company tax, sales tax, payroll tax, provisional tax, capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax yet, in regard to these types of debates, it obviously wants to drag Australia back to a bygone era. Overall, there is much stronger support from small business for the present government's policies, as indicated by the index. We have four times more support in relation to the assistance we are giving small businesses than we had in February 1996. I reiterate that the Labor Party is opposing here a measure, which opposition will be detrimental to small business. The coalition government is strongly opposed to small business people having to value so many personal items in regard to their capital gains tax. We are making changes here to give encouragement to the hundreds of thousands of small business people out there who work hard day in, day out. It is tough going out there. We understand that. Small business people see their assets as their superannuation. That is the way in which small business people operate. Those opposite did not make any provisions for small business people. There was no acknowledgment of their work. We need to acknowledge that 30 per cent of small business people these days are women. This is also a very important measure which is assisting women. The government is very strongly opposed to this amendment, which will just be an added impost on small business people in having to undertake valuations on all their personal assets.",39
48,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Let me repeat: this is not a matter about small business at all; this is a proposal about big business. Ninety-seven per cent of small businesses have assets less than $1.3 million. The last Liberal Treasurer gave us bottom of the harbour. This measure is about houses on the harbour and how you can still this retain your superannuation exemptions. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), who 10 years ago was preoccupied with Dollar Sweets, is now refusing to accept the Senate's amendment. He indicates that he is preoccupied with sweet dollars for the rich mates at the big end of town. The House needs to understand that. The opposition will not be supporting the government's motion.

49,Mr MILES,AYES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (11.54 a.m.)-On behalf of the committee AYES appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendment No. 1 of the Senate, I present the reasons which are being circulated to honourable members. The reasons read as followsTAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1997 NA The House does not agree with Senate amendment 1. The amendment seeks to include in the $5 million small business threshold all those personal assets of the taxpayer that appreciate in value or have a resale value of more than $5000. This amendment significantly compromises the Government's election commitment to provide a capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a small NOES business for retirement. It imposes significant compliance costs on small business owners as they will have to value their personal assets including their family home, car and other assets in order to determine if they fall under the $5 million threshold. The amendment also makes the small business threshold inconsistent with the threshold for capital gains tax rollover relief for small business.

Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration at the next sitting. NA White Paper on Foreign and Trade Policy",41
50,Mr DOWNER,PAIRS MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I table the government's white paper on foreign and trade policy. This is the first white paper on foreign and trade policy produced by an Australian government. Its publication reflects amend the government's commitment to a foreign and trade policy which the Australian community understands and supports. This white paper puts the national interests of Australia squarely at the centre of Australian foreign and trade policy. Its fundamental message is that, in all that it does in foreign and trade policy, the government will apply a basic test of national interest: does it advance the security of the Australian nation, and the jobs and standard of living of the Australian people? The answers to these specific questions must always be yes. A clear sense of the national interest, an understanding of what is important for Australians and confidence in the capacity of Australia to shape its future internationally define this government's approach to foreign and trade policy. The starting point of this white paper is that an active foreign and trade policy is crucial to Australia's future security and prosperity. I is crucial because Australia has global interests. It is part of the global economy. perity is tied to its performance as a trading nation. Its security is closely tied to the security of its neighbourhood. But our horizons must extend well beyond our immediate region. This is the experience of our past and it is the key to our future. For Australia, the alternative to a foreign and trade policy of broad scope is irrelevance and decline. The policies and strategies set out in this white paper represent both change and continuity. The national interest does not change with a change of government. The priority accorded to the Asia-Pacific, the commitment to further trade liberalisation, and the strong support for the World Trade Organisation and APEC are among the important elements of continuity in the government's policy framework. They have been continued precisely because they advance Australia's interests. In other areas, however, this government will continue to rebalance and refocus Australia's foreign and trade policy so that Australia's interests are more effectively advanced. A feature of the government's approach to foreign and trade policy is the importance it places on bilateral relationships as a means of advancing Australian interests. Strong bilateral relationships are not an alternative to regional and global efforts, but they are the basic building block for effective regional and global strategies. In pursuing these strategies the government will continue to accord the Asia-Pacific its highest priority. This document is our declaration of commitment to our neighbourhood as we begin wha- will surely be the Asia-Pacific century. It reflects the weight of Australian interests which are engaged with the Asia Pacific: with the region's three major powers and largest economies-the United States, Japan and China-and with our largest near neighbour, Indonesia. It reflects the significant Australian interests which are engaged in Australia's relationships with the other ASEAN states, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand. It reflects the effort and priority we have attached to Australia's relationships with PNG and the other island states of the South Pacific. And it reflects the initiatives this government has taken to deepen Its pros- Australia's ties with South Asia. Linked to the government's focus on bilateral relations is a more selective approach to the multilateral agenda. Australia must concentrate its involvement in multilateral issues on those areas where its national interests are closely engaged. National interests cannot be pursued without regard to the values of the Australian community, including its support for fundamental human rights. Central to these values is an unqualified commitment to racial equality and to eliminating discrimination. Racial discrimination is despicable whether it is overt or clothed in isolationist nostalgia. The rejection of racial discrimination is a moral issue of the first order and it is fundamental to Australia's engagement with the region where its vital security and economic interests lie. This white paper is also about the confidence Australia should have in its capacity to shape its future. Australians should not underestimate the assets which characterise modern Australia. Our economy is among the most East Asian oriented economies in the world; an economy larger than any in South-East Asia. Our objective is to build a partnership with the rapidly growing nations of the region. To that partnership we bring many economic, strategic and cultural strengths. To that partnership we bring a strong skills base, the vigour of an immigrant society and an unmatched cultural diversity. To that partnership we bring a broadly based alliance with the United States, whose strategic engagement and commitment underwrite regional stability. To that partnership we also bring our long standing commercial and cultural links with Europe. Australia does not have to choose between its history and its geography, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has so often said. And the priority the government accords to the Asia-Pacific does not diminish the important interests Australia must pursue in the Americas, Europe and elsewhere. These are all important assets which the government will ensure are properly marshalled and strategically directed in support of Australia's national interests. None of this suggests that Australia can afford to be complacent about its future. Internationally, Australia will be facing over the next 15 years a much more competitive global trading and investment environment, a changing strategic environment, as well as uncertainties in some key regional countries. As the countries of Asia grow, Australia's relative economic standing in the region will change. We will be operating in a much more complex and competitive regional environment. Australia will have to work hard and creatively to advance its strategic and economic interests and to influence the regional agenda. The white paper is a document of policy and analysis. Its judgment is that the two most profound influences on Australian foreign and trade policy over the next 15 years will be globalisation and the continuing economic rise of Asia. Globalisation offers huge opportunities for internationally competitive economies but also brings challenges for political and economic management. It has profound implications for trade the division between foreign and domestic policy, increases competitive pressures in markets and makes globally based trade rules and disciplines even more important. The white paper's judgment is that, notwithwhere standing some significant constraints, economic growth in industrialising Asia will continue at relatively high levels over the next 15 years. The countries of Asia will become even more important to Australia as trade and investment partners, and in security terms. The government's foreign and trade policy objectives will be geared towards exercising leadership on the issues which advance Australia's economic and strategic interests. This involves ensuring that Australians enjoy the growth in jobs and higher living standards which come from an internationally competitive economy; that Australia's region remains secure and stable; and that Australia maximises the economic and strategic opportunities offered by even closer engagement with the Asia-Pacific region. This is the path to the security, prosperity and jobs which are the driving objectives of the government's foreign and trade policy. This is the jobs foreign and trade policy. Nothing else will do. Our commitment to the Asia-Pacific region and the priority we give it will ensure that thousands of jobs are created for all working age Australians and, of even more concern to them, real jobs for their children. Real security means more than the defence of our borders. It also means the chance of jobs and a decent standard of living for all Australians. The government's strategy for advancing Australia's security interests is based on a hard-headed assessment of the security of the Asia-Pacific region. Its key components are maintaining a strong national defence capability, the alliance relationship with the United States, expanding Australia's bilateral, regional and multilateral security links, including through expanded security dialogues-a task on which the government has recently made great progress-and strengthening Asia Pacific-wide regional security institutions, of which the ASEAN Regional Forum is the policy. It blurs most significant. The government will also be working to ensure that international regimes covering weapons of mass destruction-nuclear, chemical and biological-are implemented and, necessary, strengthened. One of the government's proudest achievements was the key role we played in bringing to life the comprehensive test ban treaty. The government's trade strategies will focus on bilateral efforts, APEC and the World Trade Organisation. Each has a contribution to make to increasing Australia's standard of living through expanded trade and investment. None offers the only way ahead, and all three will be needed if Australia is to continue to improve its trade performance. A major focus over the next five years will be pushing for genuinely closer links between CER, Australia's economic relations agreement with New Zealand, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area, AFTA. Central to the strategies in this paper is a whole of nation approach which emphasises the linkages between domestic policies and foreign and trade policies. An integrated policy framework is crucial to enhancing Australia's international competitiveness. In a global economy the competitiveness of the Australian economy will be the single most important determinant of Australia's future. The government believes that economic strength is crucially linked to measures such as labour market reform, investment in research and development, strengthening education and training systems, developing appropriate infrastructure and implementing effective savings and taxation policies. Foreign and trade policy can especially contribute through improving access to overseas markets for Australian goods, services and capital, and helping Australian business to identify and develop export markets. Advancing Australia's interests is a task all Australians and not just their governments. It requires communication and consultation among governments at all levels, businesses and the community. If Australia's foreign and trade policies are to succeed they must attract the understanding and support of the Australian community. This white paper is an important contribution to that objective. It draws on the views of an advisory panel of eminent Australians with wide experience of foreign and trade policy. Its preparation has also involved consultations with state governments, business representatives, community groups and academics. As Australia faces a new millennium, the currents of international commerce and of power and influence are shifting. In a new century likely to be defined by the economic strength and increased influence of the major Asian economies, Australia cannot rely on the advantages of geographic proximity and economic complementarity to secure its future. We must engage with our region and understand it and the way in which it operates. If Australia is to realise the promise of the 21 st century we must have a strong economy at home and an active voice abroad. This white paper-Australia's first evergives Australia's foreign and trade policies the sharpest, clearest focus they have ever had: it represents the coming of age of Australia's foreign policy.",41
51,Mr BRERETON,PAIRS MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-It has taken a little more than 12 months to produce this documentthe 84 modest pages of text that have just been tabled in the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). The Howard government said in August last year that it would produce this white paper on foreign affairs and trade. At that time the Australian people were promised a 'comprehensive vision statement' - that is what we were told we would get-which would identify Australia's key national interests; which would examine 'the international environment' out to the year 2010 and, indeed, out to 2020; which would examine the manner 'in which Australia will pursue those interests'; and for which would recommend strategies to advance our key interests. That was the mission, and the government undertook that it would assess all of the implications of all these considerations from the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio point of view. Arguably the publication of the paper today can only do some good for our foreign relations. After all, I suppose it is very difficult to recall a time when they were ever at such a low ebb, and the recent controversy during the parliamentary recess over the leaked Australian-eyes-only briefing on our South Pacific neighbours was, of course, only the latest in a series of absolute foreign policy debacles. That was the document that described our neighbours and our friends in such derogatory terms. It described one minister for finance of a neighbouring nation as a 'compromised lame duck', described an island state-one of our near neighbours-as 'having ingrained bad habits', described the Deputy Prime Minister of another as 'an old radical on the make', and described the Prime Minister of another as 'boastful and vain' and 'drinking heavily'. It described the Deputy Prime Minister of a principal neighbour as 'ever an opportunist' and as 'a Methodist by upbringing who does not practise and enjoys late hours in nightclubs', and the Deputy Prime Minister of another was dismissed as a 'lickspittle'. That was a document left around to fall like confetti and, in the process, to do immeasurable harm to our regional relationships. Last August I undertook on behalf of the opposition to consider the white paper on its merits. Let me repeat that we will do that. We will do it in respect of the objectives set by the government and our own assessment of the profound challenges and opportunities that will face Australia as we move into the first decade of the 21st century. Much of the white paper-its discussion on our changing external environment, of the challenges of globalisation in internationalisation, of economic growth and strategic change in East Asia-is unexceptional. No-one should get too excited about this exercise. Clearly, we in the opposition have significant differences with the government in respect of how we should approach some issues, particularly the advancement of universal human rights. I think those differences are well known, and I am sure that they are going to continue to be the subject of vigorous debate here and elsewhere. More broadly, I think it must be said that much of the white paper reinforces the widespread perception that the Howard government has little ambition in international affairs, that this is a Australia government, that this is one with a timid and inward looking approach. The minister has spoken of an active and global foreign affairs and trade policy as being crucial to our nation's future prosperity and security. That is what he said, and no-one could possibly argue with that, but the paper's heavy emphasis on bilateral relationships and, indeed, its very narrow approach to multilateral diplomacy is nothing but a framework for diplomatic retrenchment-a framework for doing less with less in international affairs. Sure, the government speaks of diplomatic engagement, but its practice is frequently the opposite: it is that of withdrawing, of downgrading and of retreat, all of which are covered by spin and nuance-words such as 'realistic', 'selective', 'tightly focused' and 'targeted'. But have no doubt what it really means. I suppose it is no surprise that the white paper has nothing to say about resource and operational issues-nothing whatsoever. These have been quietly left out, while DFAT implements its latest round of personnel and budget cuts-the very cuts that are undermining the morale of our diplomatic service and its ability to energetically and comprehensively advance our national interest. Having received a copy of the white paper barely two hours ago and having been advised by the minister's office of 10 minutes only to reply to it, it is not my intention to try to embark on a detailed discussion of all these issues now. That can wait for another occasion, but let me take the opportunity to remark on what has been hailed in this morning's press as a central plank of the white paper: its declaration that racial discrimination is 'morally repugnant' and contrary to our nation's interests, especially our vital engagement with Asia. There is no doubting that this declaration on the part of the government is most welcome. But what an extraordinary state of affairs it is that such a declaration should have such prominence in such a document, in a white paper; that the key message the government feels it must send to our friends, to our neighbours, is that Australia is not a racist little state. Read the papers this morning and that is the message. That was the briefing yesterday. That is what the press were being given. What a shameful state of affairs we have reached. Seventeen months since the change of government, and of course 12 months since the white paper has been in preparation, we have seen Australia's reputation as a tolerant, open and outward looking society take an absolute hammering. It has done so at home and it has done so abroad. Let no-one be in any doubt about that. It is worth recalling how that came about. We recall those infamous words in this House when the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) made her first speech. She said: I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians ... They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate. Do we want or need any of these people here? I well recall that day. Obviously the member for Oxley and her racist One Nation Party have been the primary source of the cancer that has so damaged our international standing and fuelled the poisonous flowering of racial bigotry. Let there be no doubt about it: every member of this parliament who has recently visited our neighbours or travelled further afield knows we are being quietly crucified as a consequence of the Hanson phenomenon. But the fundamental problem is not the member for Oxley, it is not Hanson. The fundamental problem is Prime Minister John Howard and his profound failure of leadership, which has allowed the old images and perceptions of Australia to be revived: those images of the old White Australia, the insular country, one that was essentially racist, alienating our region and alternatively fearful of or patronising towards our neighbours. That, for better or for worse, is Australia's past form, and it is something that successive governments, and Prime Ministers of all persuasions, be they Holt or Gorton or Whitlam or Fraser or Hawke or Keating, have worked so hard, so tirelessly, to bury. It is Prime Minister Howard's singular achievement in 17 short months that, with his silence and with his coded speak, we have seen our international standing absolutely wrecked. We have seen the shadow of White Australia allow it to darken our relationships with the rest of the world. Look each day at the Asian headlines; look at the Japanese cartoons-you see it everywhere you look. No more clearly could it be stated than in the opinion page of the Los Angeles Times, which only on Tuesday of this week condemned John Howard's moral failure over the rantings of one backwoods politician, saying that it greatly endangered Australia's position as a leading nation in Asia and as America's ally. They are words that we should all be mindful of. This is what the article said: For now, Australia is an ethically hobbled US ally whose long campaign to make friends and influence people in Asia has hit the wall, leaving it in danger of winding up as nothing more than the dead-end capital of the South Pacific. It went on to say: Politicians, alas, cannot always be counted upon for moral leadership. Howard for too long held his breath, hoping that the One Nation phenomenon would somehow go away. It didn't. Now Howard finds himself in the hot seat because of his failure to go after Hanson from the very start. That article also referred to the AUSTEO documents that were leaked and spoke about the maligning of various regional leaders. It finished off by saying: The effect of the blunder, in combination with Hansonism, was to reinforce long-held suspicions of a patronising and sometimes racist Australia. What an absolutely damning indictment. What do we have here today? Indeed, what have we had all this week? We have had, again, the profound failure of leadership of the Prime Minister-a Prime Minister who was challenged by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) to do the right thing in respect of preferences at the next election and who failed that challenge; a Prime Minister who was challenged by former Prime Minister Fraser to do the same and who has gone out of his way to avoid doing so; a Prime Minister who was called upon by the Premier of Victoria to do exactly the same thing, to do the right and the proper thing, to make sure that Hanson was put last on coalition preferences. Put her last; that is what he has got to do. But clearly he is going to have to be dragged kicking and screaming to do that, in the final analysis. At the end of the day, he is a very stubborn little man who will do anything possible to avoid his responsibilities in ridding Australia of the scourge of racism, of this dreadful cancer that has afflicted us. Let there be no doubt: until the Prime Minister does so, he remains exposed to the charge that his carefully nuanced ambiguity reflects base political expediency-or, worse still, as many people at home and abroad suspect, an instinctive sympathy for much of the member for Oxley's agenda. No doubt the government hopes that the words of the white paper will start to undo some of the damage that has been inflicted on our international standing, but I think one would be foolish in the extreme to imagine that it will have any more impact than the foreign minister's earlier efforts in this regard, including, may I say, the formation of that much heralded, front page announced, images of Asia unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-the body which was subsequently revealed, under questioning in the Senate, as comprising a single desk officer. I think this has about the same significance. The fact is that no white paper can be any substitute for national leadership. Nothing can substitute for a clear and unequivocal commitment from John Howard that both the coalition parties-the Liberals and the Nationalsofficially and unofficially, on their official how-to-vote cards and on those that are circulated at the same time, will put Ms Hanson and her fellow travellers, those racists of the One Nation Party, collectively last on every single ballot paper. Only then will words such as those in this document have any real meaning or credibility. Motion (by Mr Downer) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrew Thomson) adjourned. NA (COLLECTION) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",44
52,Mr MILES,FRANCHISE FEES WINDFALL TAX,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (12.24 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. On 5 August 1997 the High Court held that business franchise fees on tobacco in New South Wales were invalid under section 90 of the constitution. The franchise fees were held to be duties of excise which only the Commonwealth can impose. The decision also cast doubt on the constitutional validity of other franchise fees imposed by the states and territories. These fees are collected on tobacco, petroleum and liquor. The High Court decision has a major impact on the budgets of the states and territories. In 1997-98 the business franchise fees on tobacco, petroleum and liquor are estimated to raise $5 billion in revenue. As a result of the High Court decision, the states and territories made a unanimous request to the government to introduce federal measures to protect the state and territory revenue. In response to the request of the states and territories, the Commonwealth announced on 6 August 1997 a package of measures to protect state revenues already collected and replace future revenues by increases in certain Commonwealth taxes. The taxes may be seen as state and territory taxes as the arrangements are being put in place at the request of the states and territories to replace revenue put at risk following the High Court's decision. The package will: . introduce a windfall tax. . increase wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages; increase customs and excises on petroleum and tobacco. The legislative package to give effect to these increases comprises nine bills. These bills are: Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Collection) Bill 1997 Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Imposition) Bill 1997 Franchise Fees Windfall Tax (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 Sales Tax (Customs) Alcoholic Beverages Bill 1997 Sales Tax (Excise) Alcoholic Beverages Bill 1997, Sales Tax (General) Alcoholic Beverages Bill 1997 Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1997 Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 NA The first three bills deal with the introduction of the windfall tax to protect state and territory budgets against refund claims for revenue collected prior to 5 August 1997. How the windfall tax will work The windfall tax will apply from 5 August 1997. The tax will apply whenever a person claims a refund of business franchise fees paid before 5 August 1997 because the fees are invalid under section 90 of the constitution. The tax will also apply if a court orders payment of a refund for a similar reason. The windfall tax will only apply to refunds of business franchise fees on tobacco, petroleum and liquor. The amount of the windfall tax will be 100 per cent of the refund claimed. However, the windfall tax will not apply to refunds in two circumstances. Firstly, the windfall tax will not apply to refunds which would have been made even if the franchise fees were valid. Secondly, the windfall tax will not apply to the portion of a refund of a liquor franchise fee which relates to a licensing period after 6 August 1997. This will minimise the risk of double taxation which could have arisen as a result of the other elements of the safety net arrangements which increase the excise on petroleum and tobacco and the sales tax on alcohol. I understand the state and territory governments are committed to refunding liquor licensing fees for the licensing period after 6 August 1997. The windfaII tax is to be coIIected under a withholding system. The states and territories will be required to withhold the tax from the refunds of franchise fees which give rise to the windfaII tax. The amount withheld will be applied as a credit against the taxpayer's liability for the tax. The regulations may also provide for the coIIection of unpaid windfall tax. While the Commissioner of Taxation will have the general administration of the act, he will be able to enter into arrangements with the states and territories for them to undertake that administration. Consequential Amendments It is also proposed to make consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as a result of the introduction of the windfaII tax. It is proposed that the refund of a state or territory business franchise fee will be tax exempt to the extent to which it is subject to the windfall tax. It is also proposed that an income tax deduction will not be available for windfall tax incurred. This will ensure the imposition of the windfall tax is income tax neutral. NA Four of the bills in this package relate to wholesale sales tax. Three of the bills impose increases in the rates of sales tax. Three separate bills have been drafted to increase the rate of tax to the extent that it is, retrospectively, a duty of customs, a duty of excise or a tax that is neither of these. Increase in Rate The rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages is to increase by 15 percentage points. This means that the rate of sales tax on wine, cider and similar beverages will rise to 41 per cent and for other alcohol the rate will rise to 37 per cent. The 12 per cent rate on low alcohol wine will not be affected by the price changes. The increase in the rates will apply to dealings from 3.30 p.m. on 6 August 1997. Consequential Amendments The fourth wholesale sales tax biII makes consequential amendments to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 as a result of the increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages. The changes aII apply from 6 August 1997. Small Business Exemption A consequence of the increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages is that it may force some taxpayers over the smaII business exemption threshold. Of particular concern is the impact on small liquor businesses and small wine producers. Under the small business exemption, sales tax is not payable if the taxpayer's annual tax liability is $10,000 or less. It is proposed that the extra tax paid on alcohol is not included in determining if the threshold has been exceeded. Quarterly Remittance A similar problem arises with quarterly remitters. The increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages may force taxpayers over the quarterly remitter threshold, resulting in the payment of sales tax on a monthly basis. To prevent this, it is proposed that the extra tax paid on alcohol not be included in determining if the quarterly remitter threshold has been exceeded. This measure and the small business exemption change will ensure that the temporary increase in rates requested by the states and territories does not increase the compliance costs of small businesses. Taxable value of goods As a result of the Commonwealth safety net arrangements, some states intend to implement arrangements to rebate the difference between the new sales tax rate and the previous rate of liquor franchise fees. While the rebate will reduce the final cost of the goods to consumers, the rebate may have the unintended effect of reducing the taxable value of the goods for sales tax purposes and thereby reducing the amount of sales tax payable. In order to ensure sales tax is paid on the correct value of the goods, it is proposed that the taxable value of alcoholic beverages cannot be reduced by any refund, rebate or similar payment made by a state or territory to a sales tax payer in relation to the goods. Disclosure of Information To assist in the administration of the state and territory rebate arrangements, the states and territories have asked for certain information to be made available on the additional sales tax collected. This Commissioner of Taxation is prohibited under the current law from disclosing such information. The bill proposes that the commissioner be allowed to disclose limited information to allow the states and territories to administer their rebate arrangements. Credit Entitlements As part of the safety net arrangements, the revenue collected by the Commonwealth as a result of the increase in the rate of sales tax on alcoholic beverages will be passed on to the states and territories. If a person is entitled to a credit under the sales tax law, they make seek a credit for the additional 15 per cent sales tax on alcoholic beverages. However, the Commonwealth will have passed that revenue on to the states and territories. Therefore, it is proposed to limit the sales tax credit which is available for alcoholic beverages to the amount which would have been available had the additional 15 per cent sales tax not been imposed. NA The remaining two bills in the package make amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to increase the excise and customs rates of duty on tobacco and petroleum. The excise and customs rates of duty on certain tobacco products will be increased by $167 per kilogram and on certain petroleum products by 8.1c per litre. These increases were notified in special Commonwealth gazettes on 6 August 1997 and apply from 7 August 1997. Financial Impact The increases in wholesale sales tax and customs and excise are estimated to raise around $6 billion in a full year. It is proposed the arrangements will be reviewed within six months. All of the revenue collected by the Commonwealth under these arrangements will be returned to the states and territories (after allowing for Commonwealth administrative costs). The package will accordingly be revenue neutral for the Commonwealth. Full details of the bills included in this package are contained in the three explanatory memoranda which I now present to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (FAMILY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 June, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",52
61,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga) (12.46 p.m.)Today we are debating a piece of legislation which is, I am sorry to say, further evidence of this government's failure to understand the needs of Australian families. It purports to be the family and other measures bill. I agree that it does contain some measures which will be beneficial to families, but it also contains measures which will not benefit families, which will make it even harder for families to make ends meet and, in particular, which will make it harder for them to put a decent roof over their own and their children's heads. To emphasise this point, I move the following: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for its relentless persecution of low income tenants for its failure to make any progress on the reform of housing assistance"". I want to focus my remarks today on the appalling way this government has handled the reform of housing assistance and, in particular, how it has treated people who are renting. As I have said before, this government's approach to public housing relies too much on the market and too little on basic common sense. They have compounded this attitude by making drastic cuts. This government has tried to railroad the reform of housing assistance by reducing the current Commonwealthstate housing agreement from three years to one. This was when they first came into office. We argued vehemently against this at the time, saying that such an arrangement effectively ruled out any long-term capital investment in new public housing by the states. We now know that progress on housing reform has stalled-completely stalled. They have taken everything back to the drawing board and now they have announced, or should I say 'conceded' that the interim Commonwealth-state housing agreement will take us through to the end of 1999-just where we started from when this government first came to office. In the meantime, while the government has dillydallied and has not had a clue about what to do about housing assistance, there has been much anxiety in the community and considerable disruption to public housing development in the states. In the most recent Howard budget, we have had a further cut to the funds available from the Commonwealth through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement-a $50 million a year cut which is supposed to come from unspecified efficiencies. There is no evidence in the budget papers or from the government about where these so-called efficiencies are supposed to come from. They are supposed to come some time in the future, even though the cuts start right now. What we do know is that this long period of uncertainty has caused the New South Wales government, for example, to greatly reduce its and planned construction of public housing units from around 3,500 starts a year to just 680 this year. It will also mean the loss of more than 4,000 jobs in the building and construction industry in that state alone. In my own electorate of Jagajaga, tenants in public housing and public housing workers are becoming increasingly frustrated by the uncertainty and delays to the necessary work that this government's half-baked attempts at housing reform have produced. The funds for minor capital upgrades have been cut. What that means in practice and what it means for people who live in public housing is that there can be no work carried out to modify housing for tenants with disabilities or for tenants whose increasing age or frailty necessitates modifications to their bathrooms, for example. Of equal concern is the fact that, where housing has become so run down-and this is certainly happening in Jagajaga, in West Heidelberg-replacement rather than repair is the recommendation. But there are no funds available so the unit is generally sold, bulldozed and a private dwelling constructed. The government's policy, or rather its lack of clear policy direction, is therefore leading to a net reduction in public housing stock. Government workers in public housing are becoming increasingly frustrated as they try to find answers to tenants' questions about their likely future. The uncertainty is breeding suspicion and distrust, and all because the government is sitting on its hands. It has failed to convince even the most conservative of its state governments-yet another example of the very poor relations between this government and the state governments which we saw represented in the daily papers yesterday-because the state governments can see that there are no benefits to them in the proposals being put under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. That the government has failed to carry the states along with its ideas is not surprising, because the states can see that the policies that the government is proposing will leave the states with increased responsibilities and less resources to meet those responsibilities. While the Commonwealth and the states have this argument and it goes backwards and forwards, nothing is done to improve public housing. In the meantime some of the states are just deciding to act of their own accord. In Victoria we have seen the announcement that priority access for public housing will now go to the aged and disabled. Therefore, poor families will probably never get into public housing because extra housing is not being built and the priorities have changed. The tenants associations have just heard that they are about to be abolished. This is just like the government's attitude to national shelter- 'We can't have any independent groups out there that might criticise the government.' The Kennett government has turned this into an art form and it too has made sure that tenants associations, those groups that do protect the interests of tenants in public housing, will no longer exist. Despite the government's rhetoric about moving to a system which better balances the provision of public housing by governments and the provision of a level of rent assistance to low income renters in the private rental market, the only thing that the government has done in the 18 months they have been in office is cut rent assistance. In July this year the maximum rate of rent assistance payable to single people sharing accommodation was cut by one-third. The government's justification for this, which I talked about in my remarks about students this morning, was a completely spurious argument about the economies of scale that supposedly exist when people share. But the government seems to miss the basic point: people who paid less rent because they were sharing with others were also receiving less rent assistance because the amount of rent assistance you get is related to the amount of rent you pay. During Senate estimates we were not able to find out anything about the impact of this measure because the government has no idea how many people have been affected by it; it does not know how old they are, where they live and so on. We have had many calls on this issue, and not all from young people. We have had calls from single people living in run-down private hotels who found themselves with $25 a fortnight less to live on. These are people who cannot afford that sort of cut in their incomes. We have had caIIs from households where three or four single people share. They are losing over $100 a fortnight from the household income. We have also heard from people forced to move to woeful accommodation because it is cheaper. That is the reality of this government's reform of housing assistance. That is what the government has so far delivered to low income people who are renting privately. In this bill we have the next instalment in the government's so-called housing reform process. People who are, in the government's words, 'subletting from public housing tenants', will no longer be eligible for rent assistance. Who are these people who will be affected by this measure? When we ask the government, just like with the rent assistance cut, they do not know. We have asked for more information about the people who will be affected through the Senate estimates process. We have been told that all will be revealed when the data collection has taken place. Let us make the policy to reduce people's rent assistance before we actually know who they are and what will be the impact on those families. Apparently we will find out when the state and territory governments have provided the Commonwealth with information about current public housing tenants. We do not know, for example, what the relationship might be between the so-called subletter and the primary tenant. We have some idea from our own electorates about what sort of people are likely to affected by this recent assault on tenants. They are the young adult members of low income families. They are living at home with their parents and paying board to help them out. Their contribution to the total family income is taken into account when state housing departments work out what rent is payable for their home or flat. Their parents already pay a higher rent because they are decent enough to put a roof over their young adult's head. Of course, what we do know is that if this 17-year-old, for example, is ing for a job, from 1 July next year he or she will not get any income support at all. They will not get any rent assistance from 1 January either. Rather than providing that very low income family with the help that it needs, the governnegotiating ment is saying to these families in public housing, 'It's up to you. It's your responsibility. It's entirely the family's responsibility to look after the young unemployed. It does not matter how low your incomes, the government is not going to help you.' It is the same story with older siblings sharing accommodation. This particularly applies to older women who have lost their husbands. The government is saying, 'You can't help your sister out and she can't help you.' At Senate estimates on 3 June, in answering questions about this measure, the Minister for Social Security said: Itfraudis more likely to be able to happen ... where it is family members that have transactions between them. We are more likely to support our own, even if it leads to illegality. That is what I mean. Senator Newman calls these families colluders, cheats, crooks and rorters. That is her view of public housing tenants. We on this side of the House call them families who need support, families whose help is slowly being worn away by a government who has absolutely no concern for them. There is no double subsidy here. It is just another assault on low income renters-a cut which paves the be way for further cuts to housing assistance down the track. No doubt Senator Newman would say, 'Get out the harps and violins,' as she did when Senator Faulkner pointed out to her in the Senate that the results of her policies are that public housing rental lists will soar, the amount of public housing being built will be reduced, and the quality of existing housing stock will decline. That was the depth of her response. Let me also take the opportunity to forelookshadow that the opposition will be moving substantive amendments to this bill in the Senate. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, would be aware that we have been with the government over some aspects of this bill to get a better outcome for low income people. Unfortunately, to date those negotiations have not been particularly fruitful, and that is why we are talking about this bill in the chamber today. Schedule 16 contains the revised impairment tables used to assess eligibility for disability support pension. Members may recall that we dealt with an earlier version of these tables late in 1996 and that, in the course of the debate in the Senate, the government withdrew the tables promising to consult with advocates of those affected and come back with an agreed set of tables. I look forward to the minister's speech at the end of this debate, when I assume he will enlighten us as to the views of disability groups on the set of impairment tables we have before us. I indicate that, if necessary, the opposition will move amendments to these impairment tables to address those reasonable concerns of the groups which the government has failed to deliver on. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this bill is yet another example of how out of touch the government is with families' concerns. From my remarks it should be quite clear that Labor has significant difficulties with schedule 19, which abolishes rent assistance for people who are, in the government's words, subletting public housing. Labor believes that this measure should not apply where the person is a family member of the primary tenant and where the person's income is taken into account in setting the rent payable for the property. I welcome the minister's indication that they will consider amending the bill along these lines and certainly look forward to negotiations continuing over the course of the next few weeks. Australian families are very concerned about their jobs. Of course, the government has sat on its hands in that regard. They are worried about how they are going to make ends meet as the costs of the basic necessities of life increase-and there is nothing more basic than rent. They are worried about how they are going to pay for their children's prescriptions now that the cost of a script has increased, including the cost to pensioners, as a result of this government's actions. They are worried about how they are going to raise the cash to buy their elderly parents a bed in a nursing home when they get sick. Families are worried about where their children are going to go to school because their local public school has been closed, and they are worried about how they are going to afford to put a decent roof over their heads as rents increase in the private rental market and public housing is increasingly hard to get into. This bill does very little to allay families' fears and insecurity about their and their children's future.",52
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,55
63,Dr NELSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I want to speak to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Families and Other Measures) Bill 1997 for a couple of reasons: specifically because it relates to families and I have a couple of issues I wish to raise that are relevant to families; also I want to make some points on immunisation. The bill gives effect to a measure for which I had campaigned long and hard as President of the Australian Medical Association and which was announced in the 1996-97 budget. It is the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance, an important part of this government's strategy to improve the rate of child immunisation in Australia. I feel very proud to be a part of a government that has had the courage to do that. I also applaud the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) for the welcoming and congratulatory remarks he made of our Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, when the announcement was made. In fact, if there was more of that in this place I think we would actually get a lot more done. The bill also allows for a family payment above the minimum rate to be made when a family payment child and/or the family payment recipient is outside Australia for up to eight weeks. Currently, family payment is paid above the minimum rate for up to 13 weeks when one or both parents leave Australia temporarily as long as the child remains in Australia. However, if the child leaves Australia at all, the family payment drops back to the minimum rate. It also addresses a number of anomalies, such as when children travel overseas for quite legitimate reasons-on community or school sponsored trips or for educational, cultural, sporting or even compassionate reasons. The measure also simplifies system when either parents or child are out of Australia for eight weeks. The opposition may well argue that parental absence overseas without an effect on the minimum rate of payment has been reduced from 13 weeks to eight weeks. As true as that may be, the child can now travel overseas also for up to eight weeks, and I think that is a much more balanced and sensible thing for our government to be doing. Also, the bill will better target family payment by excluding those families with ing both high assets and a moderately high income. Such families really could not be considered to be in hardship. It will not families with genuinely low incomes. Families with net market value assets, excluding family home, over $406,000 and with a being family income above $27,125, plus an extra $4,400 for each child after the first child-the point at which income reduces family payworry ment to the minimum rate-will not qualify for family payment. Families with incomes between $27,125 and $65,743 and net assets below $406,000 will still be entitled to the minimum rate family housing. payment. This is unchanged from the present situation. I heard one opposition person only a couple of weeks ago suggest that something else was likely to occur. In fact, there is going to be no change at all. Families with incomes below $15,647-how families survive on that is beyond me-and net assets less than $406,000 will be entitled to more than the minimum rate family ment. If they have net assets between $406,000 and $602,500 and low liquid assets, they also will be entitled to more than the minimum rate of family payment. If they have net assets above $602,500-1 do not know how many would be in that category-and low liquid assets, they may still be entitled to minimum rate family payment. Again it is important to emphasise that this is unchanged from the present situation. It is also important-I am not here to represent the National Party; it is hard enough representing my electorate-to stress the point that few farmers are likely to be affected in these the income and asset ranges. The third tranche of the legislation removes the entitlement to rent assistance-to which the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was just referring-of people who live in public housing but do not pay rent directly to the Public Housing Authority, other than those who live in public housing where market rent that is being charged. Public housing tenants receive subsidised accommodation from state and territory housing authorities, which generally charge rent at about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of income. As such, public houstenants are not entitled to rent assistance. However, rent assistance is available to a person who is paying rent for living in the affect already subsidised public housing. I think it is ridiculous that rent assistance is the available where accommodation is already subsidised. Quite rightly, as a parliament we worry about double dipping at the high income end of the spectrum. We also about double dipping by some members of parliaments across the country. So, too, I think we need to be concerned about potential double dipping even in lower income groups, particularly in relation to funding public I return to the immunisation strategy that is inherent in this bill. From 1 January 1998 it introduces a maternity immunisation allowance that will be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 and who, having reached 18 months of age, have achieved an age appropriate immunisation schedule up to that stage, unless of course paythey are otherwise exempted for medical reasons or they are conscientious objectors and have been counselled accordingly. The maternity immunisation allowance will also be paid in respect of stillborn children or those who die before reaching the age of 18 months. But there may be medical contraindications-for example, there are some children who are highly allergic and sensitive to eggs who cannot have certain vaccines, in particular the measles vaccines-and also conscientious objectors. The Australian Medical Association and the Australian College of Paediatrics estimate that between 1980 and 1990 there were 457 Australian children who died from measles and whooping cough. The 1992 Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for immunisation from the time of birth to the age of six years for the year 1989-90 showed that only 53 per cent of Australian children were fully immunised. That puts us behind Tunisia, Colombia, Tanzania and Iran. Those countries generally are not well known for having very high levels of public health, certainly not high levels of immunisation, or for their health initiatives. But they are actually doing better than Australia, which is clearly a developed country. Unfortunately only 29.5 per cent of children are partly covered, 3.6 per cent have no immunisation whatsoever and 14 per cent of parents responding to the ABS survey were unsure as to the immunisation status of their children. I suspect that within that group the vast majority are just ashamed to admit that they have not had their children vaccinated. Immunisation is one of the most powerful and cost-effective weapons that we have against disease prevention. With the exception of safe water, there is no other mechanismnot even antibiotics-that has had such a major effect in reducing death and improving population growth. This year alone something like three million children will die throughout the world from vaccine preventable diseases. That a number of them should die in Australia should be seen as nothing less than a national disgrace. There are some people who are opposed to immunisation and, for that reason, are opposed to the measures in this bill. They cite complications and accidents from vaccinations. Whilst the relatively common side effects are in fact inconsequential and serious side effects almost unheard of, everybody needs to realise that complications and side effects are the price we pay for the protection that vaccines confer upon us. I often say to people, 'You would not refuse to put your child in a seat belt in a car or restrain them on the back seat because you are concerned that they might get bruised in a car accident.' Similarly, people refuse to have their children vaccinated, exposing them to diseases from which they can die, on the basis of a concern about possible side effects. The large number of vaccine doses that are administered at an early age when children are prone to various illnesses mean that it is probable that there will be some temporal relationship at times and merely coincidental association between adverse events and vaccine administration. If you have a child who is being vaccinated every two months on average and then a couple of weeks after the previous vaccine that child has the misfortune to develop encephalitis or some other serious disease, not surprisingly some parents and some antagonists to immunisation would say, 'It must be due to the vaccine.' That is understandable. The fact that it is given credibility in some sections of the community, and even the medical community, is something about which we ought to be concerned. If you look at the 1970s, for example, in the United Kingdom there was a great fear about pertussis or whooping cough vaccination and the reactions that might come from it. As a result of that, immunisation rates in the United Kingdom fell 70 per cent to 80 per cent, down to less than 40 per cent. Subsequently, of course, there was a major outbreak of whooping cough, from which children clearly suffered and some died. Unfortunately, vaccines are victims of their own success. As diseases diminish in their prevalence and adverse reactions gain in relative importance, there is a perception that in some way the risk of having a vaccine outweighs any benefits that it might confer. Unfortunately, I have dealt with younger mothers in my previous life as a medical practitioner who, because they have never seen a case of polio and because they have never seen a child with whooping cough, mistakenly believe that these diseases no longer exist and as such believe they should not have their children vaccinated. The media has an extremely important public health role to play by avoiding the transmission of sensational and at times biased and unfounded information about risks without weighing them up against the benefits. One of the best pieces of research that has been done on cost-benefit analyses of vaccination was done by a fellow named Holden in 1987. He established that the risk of contracting whooping cough, for example, is 7,995 times greater than any risk conferred by the pertussis vaccine. Of course, we now have an acellular whooping cough vaccine which has even fewer side effects attached to it. The risk of contracting measles and dying from it is 60,840 times higher than any risk at all from being vaccinated against measles. Holden calculated that, in developed countries such as Australia, immunisation can prevent approximately 45 childhood deaths and 12 serious handicaps every month. In contrast, the program could cause, potentially, one death every 22 years and one serious handicap every 7V2 years. When the minister finally finishes-and hopefully he will be in this position for some time-and he looks back on his service as the health minister in this period of the Howard government, of all the things that he should be proud of, one of them is what he is doing in this bill and what he is doing with immunisation. Look at the advertising campaign that we have recently seen running in relation to whooping cough in which we have seen images of a sick baby put before us: people need to remember that the fatality rate for whooping cough for children under the age of one is one in 500. If your child is not vaccinated and contracts whooping cough, they run a one in 500 chance of death. It is one in every 2,500 cases of whooping cough for children of all ages. Turning to measles, it has been estimated that the 1981 outbreak in New South Waleswhen the population of New South Wales was only 5.2 million-led to 2,200 hospital admissions, five deaths and a cost of $2 million in medical services. Some parents unfortunately think that measles is just like a severe case the flu, with a few spots on the skin. It is much more than that. It is frequently associated with middle ear infection and pneumonia. Every one in 2,000 kids who contract measles will suffer from encephalitis, which is a very serious and frequently fatal infection of the brain. One in 3,000 children who contract measles will die from the disease. Between 1980 and 1990, there were 57 recorded deaths of Australian children from whooping cough and measles, but it is estimated that that was only 10 per cent of the cases that actually occurred and, hence, the figures I cited earlier from the Australian College of Paediatricians and the Australian Medical Association. It is also what I guess some of us would describe as a social justice issue. The poorest coverage in terms of immunisation is amongst lower socio-economic groups. For example, only 65 per cent of children coming from families earning less than $10,000 per yearor having that amount of money available to them-have had any kind of vaccine at all, whereas for those earning more than $70,000 per year, it is over 85 per cent. The problems are enormous in terms of improving Australia's vaccination rate, but I feel that this bill and these measures are going to play a significant role in address,ing them. I realise that someone may get up and say that I am straying from the point-and I am looking at the member on the other side-but this bill is about families. I find it very hard to get up in the adjournment debate, and when you are on a 26 per cent margin I suppose I can understand why. But in the remaining five minutes that I have, I would like to remind the House of a letter that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 6 June this year. It was authored by a constituent of mine, a mother of a child, trying to survive with a family with enormous problems. One of the issues which we, as Australians and as a parliament, are now trying to come to terms with is the whole issue of drug use, which destroys not only individuals but, of course, families. I now have about 20 families in my electorate-a conservative, relatively high income of electorate in Sydney-who either have children who are using heroin or have lost them because of it. I would like to read this letter to the House. It says: I am fighting for my only child's life. My daughter is a heroin addict, and in my fight for her life I hope she will get the strength to fight for her own. I climb the stairs of the hotel, a shooting gallery and brothel where she lives in the main street of Kings Cross, and pray she is still alive. The anxiety I feel is indescribable as I knock on the door. Eventually it is opened by her room-mate, naked and wrapped in a filthy blanket, bruised, staggering and seemingly half alive. She knows me now and as I enter she staggers to her bed and collapses into total squalor. The bed is filthy and the room is chaotic. There are containers of old food, ashtrays spilled over, drink bottles, make-up, dirty clothes, candles, some lit, condoms, garbage, some pathetic tokens of house decorating and everywhere there is drug paraphernalia: spoons, candles, wrappers, swabs, tourniquets and a large container of new syringes and an even larger yellow hazardous waste bin the size of a large garbage bin for the used syringes. The curtains are shut, there is no air, a television plays a very blurred version of Mad About You, and there in the bed is my beautiful daughter looking like an angel that fell into hell. We are in a race against time; she is now on the waiting list to go into de-to x at the public clinic. The rule is to ring every day until they give her a bed. There is a compulsory wait of two weeks, then the clinic will let her know when she can be admitted; this is the third attempt at de-tox. I am hopeful and anxious; did she remember to ring today and if so is she telling the truth? Heroin creates pathological lying. The drug is really powerful and she is in its control and struggling to fight back. Yes, she has emotional problems and has played around with other drugs before this, and we have been struggling to help her win the battle to survive. My daughter is from a loving family: we live on the North Shore, she went to a nice school, and no, it wasn't all perfect but nothing warrants this outcome to any child's life. How can I win this battle when speed and heroin are so cheap and so available? I can walk downstairs and buy any drug of choice, and now, to reach a bigger market of young people, dealers are lacing marijuana with either speed or heroin. There is a whole racket that is going on out there that is terrifying. The hotel where my daughter resides is full of young people who look like they are barely alive and are totally exploited by drugs and prostitution. The fact that the Government buses in tourists to view this desecration of our youthselling the sleaze like some romantic form of bohemia, offering young girls stripping, smacked off their brains and perhaps selling a blow job to a tourist for that extra buck-makes me weep. In the last six months I have learned a lot about the scum that Tony Trimingham spoke of in his article in the Herald (May 26). Damien should not have died, and that this has happened is an outrage. My heart aches for this family. His tragedy, however, has inspired me to speak of my own in the hope that the public and the Government will start to look at what is happening to our young people and our children, and I too support full legalisation and decriminalisation of heroin use, with government and health workers totally controlling its use and output. My plea is for my daughter's sake; you might have seen her some time, standing, somewhere in Kings Cross selling her body to support her heroin habit, or she could have been nodding off in a doorway; she is only 20, mere fodder for the dealers, just another junkie. My husband and I love her very much. Thank you for your indulgence; I appreciate it.",55
64,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"At the outset, I congratulate the previous speaker, the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson), not only for his congratulations of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) with regard to immunisation which obviously is strongly supported by this side of the House but also for his later comments with regard to the heroin trial. On the way through, he referred to what is often a platitude-apple pie, et cetera: the question of parties trying to work together on problems. Anyone following the politics of this country in recent weeks would know of his activity around this particular issue. I am a person who represents-it might be a surprise to some people but it was fairly obviously at the last elections-the conservative, working-class areas of the western suburbs. The kind of response that he is having from constituents in his electorate is repeated within my region, as people do, sometimes for the wrong reasons--essentially because they are increasingly frustrated by the theft of property from their houses. That might not be the best reason why they are thinking in this direction but, certainly, there is a very strong change of opinion in this country. It is to be hoped that, considering the sentiments that he put forward, people will not use that particular issue for short-term political grandstanding and that there will be a degree of commonality around that policy. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997 seeks to amend current provisions impacting on a range of payments including maternity allowances, family payments, rent assistance, the disability support pension and the family tax payments. It also alters the exchange rate process for the conversion of foreign currency income for social security purposes. As shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I wish to particularly concentrate on schedule 19 of the bill, which seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 to remove from 1 January 1998 the entitlement to rent assistance of subtenants living in public housing accommodation. The previous opposition speaker certainly detailed the realities for people in that sector. Rather than any rhetoric about fraud, corruption, collusion, et cetera, the reality out there is that people in public housing, as a general group of the population in any state in this country, because of the downturn in funding for public housing are increasingly, essentially and almost totally social welfare recipients. They are at the bottom rung of this society and, quite frankly, to start saying that this is an area for very significant fraud and implying that people are making big bucks out of this area is absolutely ridiculous. As the shadow minister indicated, it is essentially an attempt to erode and attack family cooperation, to undermine those people prepared to help each other and work together. This measure was announced by the coalition in the last budget. Needless to say, it is yet another reduction in assistance to battlers that was never raised by the coalition in the context of the 1996 campaign. That is essentially what they are: battlers are not only those people in middle Australia who hold down a job but people who are in the public housing sector in this country. I am concerned both with the nature of the proposal and the way that the government proposes to deal with it. Chiefly, the budget announcement will be achieved by simply defining the rent payable in such circumstances to be government rent for income support purposes. As rent assistance cannot be claimed in respect of government rent, this will bar subtenants in this situation from receiving any assistance whatsoever with their accommodation costs. This is surely a case of legislative doublespeak if ever there was one. It redefines particular private rental payments as government rent payments in order to establish that they are not private rental payments. Quite frankly, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has set himself up under this regime as a composite between Leni Riefenstahl, Joseph Goebbels and Big Brother. This particular measure is an attempt to mislead and is up there for awards in the next year or so on that criterion. For many years, public housing tenants have not been eligible for rent assistance from Social Security or Veterans' Affairs, as they are already in receipt of subsidised housing, particularly through the rental rebate system which ensures that they pay no more than 20 to 25 per cent of their gross income in rentdepending on which state they live in and what category they are in. The Commonwealth helps to underwrite this rental rebate system through its annual funding to the states and territories under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. In this circumstance, it is fair and reasonable to say that pensioners receiving such rebates should not also be eligible for rent assistance. It is entirely fallacious, however, to argue that those veterans and social security recipients who lose access to rent assistance because of this bill are in an identical situation to public housing tenants. Subtenants who are living temporarily in a house or a unit owned by a state housing authority do not have the legal rights afforded to tenants, particularly security of tenure, and nor are they covered by the rental rebate system that I referred to earlier. There is nothing to stop them from having to pay more than 25 per cent of their income in rent if this is the price they have to pay to get a roof over their head. It would appear that their situation is more analogous to that of boarders and lodgers, who are clearly entitled to rent assistance, albeit a slightly different formula to that applying to private tenants. The administrative arrangements to give effect to this cut are likely to be both confusing and intrusive. The relevant acts are to be amended to say that, if a person pays or is liable to pay rent for living in premises in respect of which someone else pays government rent, the rent paid by the person is taken to be government rent. In effect, this requires the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency-CSDA-and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to establish whether the person is living in a dwelling owned by a public housing authority. I note that in an era of spot purchasing, headleasing and so on, determining whether a dwelling is or is not used for public or community housing is something that will not always be readily apparent without extensive data matching between a range of agencies. There is in fact a further complication designed to overcome the clear inequity that would apply were rent assistance to be withdrawn from the subtenant of someone who is not themselves getting a rental rebate because the public housing tenant's income is above the rebate cut-off point. In this situation, the bill provides that, where the public housing authority advises the CSDA or the DV A that the public housing tenant is paying market rent, any subtenant living at that property will still be eligible for rent assistance. This illustrates the confused nature of this whole misconceived proposal. Essentially, these processes mean that the rent assistance entitlement of the subtenant will in future depend entirely on the circumstances of the actual public housing tenant. If the tenant gets a rental rebate, the subtenant is ineligible for rent assistance, but if the tenant pays market rent, the subtenant can claim rent assistance. Yet nowhere in the material supplied by the government on the bill is there any clear information on the composition of the relevant households or the relationships between the tenants and the subtenants. It appears that we are being asked to legislate on the basis of untested assumpunder tions about their living arrangements. Furthermore, the explanatory memorandum to the bill does not estimate the numbers of people who will lose eligibility for rent assistance. As the decision is estimated to lead to a net reduction in outlays of over $58 million in a full year, however, the number involved is clearly not insignificant. The vast majority of these savings are in the Social Security budget, which implies that the subtenants involved are themselves out of work, retired, have a disability or are acting as carers for a pensioner. They are the kind of people who will essentially be hit by this. The frequency with which the coalition has tried to reduce assistance to tenants would justify the belief that tenants are not seen as part of this battlers group, that they are cynically and insincerely promised they will be looked after. This latest measure comes on top of the one-third cut in rent assistance to single people sharing accommodation and cuts in the order of $200 million to funding for public housing under the CSHA. It also comes on top of Senator Newman's hamfisted efforts to 'reform' the CSHA, efforts which had to be abandoned in the face of vociferous opposition from the states, the churches and key housing groups. In conclusion, this is indeed part of a broader pattern of assaults on the disadvantaged in the context of a public housing sector which is increasingly the domain of those people, and those people alone. In an era when we do not have poorer working people in this accommodation, these are the people who are going to be undermined by this. Whilst the figures provided indicate that, for Veterans' Affairs alone, the reductions are not that high, on the history of this portfolio one would have to doubt the validity of figures because, after all, this is the portfolio where the minister went out and said, 'I am going to protect veterans from pharmaceutical changes. There are virtually going to be no changes. No-one is going to be affected; they are going to be protected. ' Yet the budget papers show that a $26 million saving is to occur over the next four years. Whilst in the short tenn it might appear that the crunch will come for those other social welfare recipients, there will be some-and certainly, on past indications, far more than we might expect at the moment-veterans in this country hit by this measure.",59
65,Mr BROUGH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Longman) (1.34 p.m.)The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill goes to four separate issues: immunisation, changes to family payments, introduction to new impainnent tables and the abolition of rent assistance for people subrenting government housing. The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson), who has just given his address, chose to focus on one area and one area alone-that of the abolition of rent assistance. In the spirit of goodwill of which he spoke at the opening of his address I would have thought he might have dedicated a little more time to those measures which he felt warranted the support of the opposition. But we did not hear anything about that because the last thing we want to do in this place is to throw bouquets where they are desired or deserved! In fact, all the member for Reid did was simply to pick holes in areas which, quite frankly, he has failed to recognise as being unwarranted of his remarks. I would like to commence my address this afternoon on immunisation. As the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) quite rightly said, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and this government should be very proud of the fact that this bill will leave a lasting legacy in Australia. It addresses not only those economically rational types of subjects but also a social issue and one of health where we will look after the well-being of future generations. Prevention is certainly better than cure. This measure goes to the very prevention of diseases and their ceasing to have a negative impact on Australian society. I cannot help but reflect upon my father who in fact suffered polio as a boy of four years of age. At that time polio was rampant throughout Australia, as it was around the world. Its legacy is that he has never been able to run or to walk quickly up a flight of stairs, and he always wears a caliper. As a young father, I would hate to think that it was through my negligence in not immunising my own children that I passed such a legacy on to one of them. Rather than going into the detail of the bill, I want to look at why Australians and such an educated nation with such a high standard of living would choose not to immunise their children. The first issue would be the fear of side effects-an issue also addressed by the member for Bradfield. This fear comes from ignorance, because the statistics that he outlined quite clearly indicate that the risks of any side effects are very minimal indeed and certainly do not stack up when you look at the benefits that can be derived from immunisation. So that is a lack of understanding and knowledge. But then we have those that refuse. When this measure was announced by Dr Wooldridge a couple of people wrote to me to state that this was part of a new world order and that we were in some way trying to do something terrible to the Australian community. I do not nonnally respond to people like this because, quite obviously, they do not have both feet on the ground-they are perhaps a few sandwiches short of a picnicbut I decided to ring one of these women and she said, 'I'm sorry, my husband made me sign this letter; I don't agree with it and I have children of my own.' I thought, 'What sort of a household would this be?' The fact is that refusal simply because of unsubstantiated beliefs is not a reason to put the rest of our children and our community at risk. That is why some of the measures which have been taken here preclude people from simply saying, 'I don't want to have my children immunised.' That is not going to be good enough. Parents now actually have to take some steps. They have to physically go along to a doctor to be given the information as to the ramifications of the decision they are taking and sign a statutory declaration that they have received that information and that they understand it. So they have to do something. That is a big step forward. I believe that the one reason that most parents take the irresponsible step of not immunising their children is simply that they are too lazy, that they have the 'she'll be right attitude' and that 'it'll never happen to me'. That is a very dangerous thing indeed, as we have seen with some of the advertising footage recently going to air, particularly with whooping cough. So now, when parents actually have to do something to prevent their children from having the inoculations, it means that they are more likely to take the steps necessary to protect not only their own children but also the wider community. The government has provided an incentive for parents to take this step. We are not hitting them with a big stick or forcing people into anything. We are actually providing incentives to ensure that they take the responsible step for their offspring. We are also educating the population. I think that is an important step, so that people like the gentleman who had his wife write to me can have a full understanding of the decisions that they are taking. This will provide wider community interest in the subject and, in doing so, I believe, will ensure that people will ask the question of each other: 'Are your children immunised?' Perhaps then we will have not only an awareness campaign but also an understanding of the poor decisions that have been taken in some instances in the past. We must get rid of the 'she'll be right' attitude as an option. By forcing people, if you wish, to take some simple steps to educate themselves and to sign off that they realise they are being irresponsible, we will remove a lot of that 'it won't happen to me' attitude. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the minister for health and the entire government on this bill. I know that we have had bipartisan support on it but it is something for which I believe this government will be remembered for many years to come-as the government that took the time and the money to take the steps necessary to protect Australian children today and into the future. I will move on to the other areas within the bill which are a little more contentious: first of all, the changes to the family payments. There are four schedules to be dealt with here: schedules 5, 6, 7 and 8. Schedule 5 relates to the payment of family payment when an organisation has responsibility for a child yet that child may be in the care of a foster-parent. What currently occurs under the existing law is that the family payment for a child who may be a ward of the state can be claimed by the organisation, yet the organisation may not physically have care of that child; the child may well be in the care of a foster-parent. All we are proposing here is to change that situation so that the person who actually has the day-today care of the child receives the payment. But where they have assets and income over and above that which the rest of the community find is necessary for their eligibility to be cancelled, they will not be able to fall back upon the organisation to ask for that money and then pass it on to the family. So it is a safeguard, once again, to ensure that the money out of the public purse is going towards those people who genuinely need it, and that it goes to the person who actually has the rights and responsibility of looking after the child. Schedule 6 deals with the children of parents who leave Australia. All we have here is a simple process of ensuring that there is some equity. Currently, the parent can leave the country for up to 13 weeks and still receive the payment. But the moment the child steps out of the country-no payment. As the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) alluded to, young people who were leaving the country, some on grant-a-wish programs, were losing their payments, as were others who were representing Australia in sport or who were getting some sort of medical attention; and there were numerous other shortterm reasons for people were losing their payments. There was obviously a problem in the legislation that had to be addressed. What we have now said is that both the parent and the child can leave the country for up to an eight-week period and continue to receive their payment. I think that is an excellent and positive response to the needs of families within our community. Schedule 7 deals with the test of hardship for family payment. It may interest the House to know that under the current laws you can actually earn up to $65,734 per annum and still apply under the hardship provision. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are not too many people on that sort of money who could really claim hardship. We have reduced that down to $27,125, with an additional $4,399 for each additional child. That is far more realistic; and we know full well that there are people in Australia trying to survive on figures well under $27,000 and, therefore, the hardship provision is warranted. The final schedule is schedule 8, which tightens up the provision of fringe benefits. Once again, this goes to making sure that the Australian taxpayer's dollar is used in as responsible a manner as possible in the social security area. What people have done, in order to lower their taxable income, is to put some of their remuneration package into fuel cards, grocery accounts, share markets and cash management portfolios, to name a few, so that they are actually eligible to pick up a benefit from the government whilst having a remuneration package far greater than was ever intended. These four measures are very responsible in ensuring that Australian taxpayers' money is spent on those people who genuinely need it. We do not want a universal tax system which anybody can dip into, but one based on need. The next area of this bill deals with the disability support pension. I would like to explain the bill by relaying a story of a constituent of mine. I was at a meeting some time ago with a group of unemployed people. I said to this chap, 'Are you receiving unemployment benefits?' He answered, 'No, I'm actually on a disability support pension.' I said, 'What is your disability?, He said, 'I'm deaf in one ear.' I asked, 'What do you do for a living?' He answered, 'I'm a farm labourer.' I thought, 'Yes, it's really going to cause you great difficulty in carrying out your task as a farm labourer if you can't hear properly out of one ear.' He was, under our current system, able to get a disability support pension. Quite obviously, this was not something which was preventing him from entering the work force, but, under the current system, he was able to access this benefit rather than be out there looking for work. Some people would cynically say that it was one of those options that the government of the day left open to ensure that the figures for unemployment were actually down, because everyone of those people in that room on that particular dayall of about 10 of them-was on a disability support pension. So the changes that have been brought in simply mean that people genuinely have to have a disability which prevents them from working before they can access this support. I think, once again, that goes to being responsible and spending taxpayers' money in the right manner. Finally, the area that the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) focused upon was rental assistance. Currently, the federal government makes grants to the states for the provision of public housing, so those who are lower income earners and those who are disadvantaged in some way and cannot meet market rents are able to access public housing at a much cheaper rate, therefore enabling them to have a standard of living commensurate with many others in society. All we are proposing here is that when they are already, as a household, in subsidised housing, that household cannot double-dip. Quite obviously, if a household is receiving a cheaper form of rent due to government assistance, why should a second body within that house be able to get even more assistance? Why not ensure that more people are able to access the available dollars rather than ensure that one or two people, or a small group of people, are able to double dip into the public purse and gain a greater benefit? These measures are not, as the member for Reid alluded, about fraud; they are about responsible use of the public purse. They claim that we, on this side of the House, have no social conscience. I would suggest to you that the first part of this bill, regarding immunisation, is an effective portrayal of our social conscience. The responsible expenditure of taxpayers' money is the best way you can demonstrate to any community that you have a very strong social conscience; that you use their money not in some misguided fashion but to ensure that it is spread across the greater community-the wider community-in the most effective way possible. In relation to fraud-since you have brought it up-the fact is that this government is now securing in excess of $19 million a week in social security fraud-$19 million a week. That calculates to about a billion dollars a year. That is more than is spent on Aboriginal affairs and ATSIC for an entire year-and that is what has been picked up simply on fraud by this government due to the new measures we have brought in. There is a 98.7 per cent prosecution rate for those people who are actually being charged. My wife is a hairdresser and last week she had a gentleman in from the social security office. He did not know what I do and he was talking about how the government is making a big noise of the fact that they are picking up $1,000 million in social security fraud. She said, 'I think it is a damned good thing.' He said, 'We always knew that money was there; we always knew it was being defrauded.' She said, 'Why didn't you do something about it?' He said, 'No-one actually wanted us to do anything about it. No-one encouraged us to do anything about it and no-one gave us the means in which to do anything about it, but we knew it was there.' I thought, 'Isn't that a great way to go about it?' It is like, 'We know who stole your car, Sir, but we're not that interested in picking it up.' We know there is a billion dollars of taxpayers' money already that we have been able to recover through fraud alone-more than we spent on ATSIC in its entirety-yet the previous government did not have the will to recover that money. Mr Latham-We are always getting fraud money. Fraud is an ongoing process. It's not frozen like an iceberg.",62
66,Mr BROUGH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"You are dead right. You tell me that fraud is an ongoing process, yet you decided not to do anything about it. Does this mean that you are quite happy to continue to throw money at people who do not need it? Is that right? Mr Latham-I'm not saying that.",65
67,Mr BROUGH,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"No, no response now, because you allowed the Australian taxpayer to have the burden of a billion dollars a year and you did nothing about it. All we have done in this bill is ensure that the Australian taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, that those people who have a need for the Australian taxpayers' money are supported and that the loopholes that were left there by the previous government have been filled. As far as fraud is concerned, I make no excuses. I think it is fabulous that this government is ensuring that those people who choose to cheat their fellow residents, who choose to cheat their fellow Australians, are going to be picked up and are going to be pursued by this government. The social conscience of the Liberal and National parties will ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent where it is going to do the most good and where it is deserved. This is a wide-ranging bill, but the point I would like to make is that, regardless of whether it is tightening the loopholes from the previous government's legislation or whether it is a wonderful implementation of the immunisation bill, it shows that this government is sending a message to Australia-that we care for the children, that we care for families, that we care for the health and well-being of Australians and that we will use the taxpayers' money to gain the best benefit for all Australians.",65
68,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The member for Longman (Mr Brough) spoke about the social conscience of the Liberal Party. He ought to go out into sections of my electorate-and indeed into the cities in Melbourne and Sydney-and have a look at the extent of poverty and deprivation that has been created ever since this government got into office, and have a look at the extent to which people are actually begging for food and shelter, and then he should talk about a social conscience. The reality is that, if you have saved a billion dollars by collecting from fraud, your government ought to give some money to the emergency services that cannot even cope with the extent of poverty and deprivation that has been created in this country. Mr Miles-Thirteen years of Labor.",65
69,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Here we go: the same line, 'It's the fault of the Labor Party.' Under our administration, we had a social justice program that covered a whole range of areas. We had a social justice philosophy for this country. What has happened since this government came into power? That can be seen in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997. On the one hand, we have some positive measures from the minister in relation to the immunisation program, which I support and we all support on this side of the House. But on the other hand, we have another range of measures--especially the measures in relation to rental assistance-which are nothing more than appalling in relation to what they are going to do for poverty in this country. Let me say this: we are being bombarded in our electoral offices--especially members from Melbourne and Sydney-about the impact of the programs and the cuts to the programs. I might say that in Victoria we have the double sword. We have the cuts from the federal government and we have the cuts from the Kennett state government. As a result of both of those cuts, welfare services are being stretched to the absolute limit. We have got to the point in Victoria where even services such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other organisations cannot cope with the pressures and they are sending the people who come to them to other organisations. Even neighbourhood houses are being asked to take on central welfare tasks because people are falling through the cracks, people are finding that they are not being looked after at all. That is the situation in this try for the poor. This situation comes out of this absolute pursuit of the economic rationalist philosophy, the economic strategy and the New Right Thatcherist ideas of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Mr Miles-Ha, hal",65
70,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"You may laugh. You may think this is funny. You may think the creation of poverty in this country is a joke, but it is not a joke. It is a very serious matter and the poor are getting poorer. We now have a situation where the poorest in our society are in desperate situations. They are committing suicide. They are going onto drugs. They are suffering from the worse situatIon we have had in this country for many years. That sector of the community is not being looked after by you or your policies. So do not come in here and pretend that you have some kind of social conscience. If you have saved a billion dollars, as you claim, why isn't that money being put back into solving the problems of poverty? That is what I want to know. Why are you continuing to cut those programs? Why have you cut emergency services? Why is this bill cutting certain disability pension support measures? Let me tell you that, in terms of the disabled people in our community, we have a situation now where many of them have noone to tum to. People with disabled children and even disabled adults in their family are giving up because of a lack of support for the disabled from governments, both state and federal. That is the situation. Mr Hardgrave-What rubbish!",66
71,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"You think it is rubbish, do you? What sorts of cases are coming to your electoral office? You are not getting anyone with a disability coming to your office and complaining? If you are not, you must be the only member in this place who is not getting such complaints, because the disabled are certainly suffering as a result of the programs. This is particularly true in Victoria, where the state government has totally failed in its responsibility to meet its end of the disability services provision. We counare now having pious comments from government members here about how these measures come together as some kind of social justice program. They do not. Let me say, as the shadow minister has pointed out, that what is going on with this rent assistance arrangement is an absolute disgrace. It is a very small amount of money that will be saved, but it is the poorest and the most vulnerable group in the community which is going to be affected. It is those people who relied on the fact that they could get into public housing with rental assistance in this particular way who will be affected. Why should it be the case that people who have drawn on this allowance, because it was their one lifeline, should have that lifeline taken from them? We are not talking about hundreds of thousands of people. We are only talking about a few people, but they are the people who are in the most vulnerable position. They are having this allowance and this provision taken away from them in this penny-pinching program which the government has put forward. I ask the member for Longman and other members on that side of the House this question: if you have saved, as you claim, a billion dollars in collections from social security fraud, why not put aside at least $100 million of that to help the poorer sector of the community? Why not do something for the poorer sector of the community? Why not help the organisations that are trying to assist the poorer sector of the community? Those organisations are having their resources stretched. Mr Miles interjecting",66
72,Dr THEOPHANOUS,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"We have a fool Minister here for a parliamentary secretary. Why don't you listen to what I am saying? If you have saved a billion dollars, why not at least $100 million aside to assist emergency serunaware vices so they can provide food? Why not give it to the welfare organisations-such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the other organisations-that need that poorer sector in the community? The fact of the matter is that you are not doing that. As a result, those services are being totally stretched and there are people our society who are really suffering. There people in our society who are suicide or to drugs. They are turning to all those things as a result of the programs and the cuts which you have put into place. The Prime Minister has come in. I say to him: if you have saved a billion dollars, should give some money to the poor and not have this penny-pinching program.",67

Is the minister aware of a letter from the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone, which has recently been sent, in the context of the election campaign, to military personnel in the Northern Territory? Is the minister aware that these letters addressed their recipients by name and by military rank? Minister, how is it possible for the Country-Liberal Party to obtain a list of military personnel of the Northern Territory by home address and by military rank? Will you instigate an immediate investigation of what is a very serious matter and report back totally to this House today?",67

With regard to the question that you put asked about the source of that list, I am of any lists that they may have. I will make an inquiry. It mayor may not be possible to do it by the end of today.

78,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer please advise the House of today' s figures on you the current account deficit? What do these do figures say about the improvement in the current account since the change of govern,67
79,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable be member for Macquarie for his question. Today's figures on the June quarter for 1997 in relation to the current account deficit that the current account deficit for the ending June 1997 was $16.5 billion, signifideficit cantly better than the $20 billion forecast the budget and significantly down on the outcome for 1995-96. This largely retlected a $3.2 billion around in the balance on the merchandise trade. The merchandise trade was not only a 1983 to 1996. surplus but a surplus in relation to the net services. So in the year 1996-97, Australia traded in surplus on both goods and services. The only reason Australia ran a current account deficit in 1996-97 of $20 billion on the net income deficit was to service Labor's foreign debt. That is the only reason. The current account deficit in this country is not defeated. It will not be defeated cause of the huge run-up in foreign debt under the wanton Keating-Beazley Labor mismanagement of the economy. The June quarter current account deficit to GDP ratio could be less than two per cent of GDP-the best result since March 1980.",67
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who was in power then?,68
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, we had a very honourable good Treasurer in March 1980, as the Prime come. Minister reminds me! The June quarter, of course, had a number of one-off figures-in particular, a one-off figure in relation to the Reserve Bank gold sales. However, on a trend basis, excluding the large one-off exports, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP is likely to be the lowest in 3V2 years.

82,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You come in on cue. Aren't we lucky to have you. This is despite a 4.4 per cent rise in merchandise imports offset by an 11.9 per cent rise in equipment investment, which was recorded in the latest private new capital expenditure survey. This is a result which has been led by exports. Australia is now trading in a surplus on both goods and services. We have a current acwas count deficit which has come in the best three years and significantly better than budget. But the solving of Australia's current account deficit will not be accomplished show overnight; it will take years of hard work. year This government and the current account will be weighed down, because of in Labor's run-up of foreign debt, for quite some period to come.

87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Isn't it true that under the first six years of Labor's agreement with DuPont the company met all of their investment commitments? Isn't it also true that it only last year under your government that of the company failed to meet its commitments? Minister, have you spoken as we have to DuPont? Are you aware that if the government adopts Labor's plan for the TCF industry DuPont would not only honour its commitments but invest another $40 million in its Bayswater plant?",68
88,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition is claiming this point after his spokesman yesterday rather bombed out on it, I thought. Just let me remind you what happened: this was done under the Labor Party's plans for the industry. Mr Crean No, that is not right.",69
89,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no; the ones that you said would end up with zero tariffs and no support if they took this particular capitalised bounty payment. That is what you said. Now you are back here saying they must have exactly the opposite. No-one trusts the Labor Party. People outside know that, if the Labor Party ever got back into government, it would go back to where it was before. That is the way it would go about it. Let me tell those opposite just what did happen. I spoke with the company a long time before I heard you on the ABC. To add to what I said yesterday, the company entered obligations with the previous Labor government under their tariff reduction rules-which you are now completely repUdiating to a certain agreement. Those that they were required to meet, as I said yesterday, they did. Those that were on a best endeavours basis they did not complete. Mr Crean-That is not correct.",69

100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we can return to the convention: this is yet another promise of the government which has been delivered in full. It was not delivered on time like the other promises of the government because of the obstructive tactics of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I am delighted that the policy to allow the discussion at a convention on the terms stipulated by the coalition parties in the lead-up to the election can now go ahead. I congratulate the Independent senator and the Green senator who supported the government's legislation on their last minute decision to do so. It remains the standing irony of this whole debate that those rabid republicans in the Labor Party and the Democrats tried to scuttle the whole thing. If they had had their way, the process towards a rational debate about the future of Australia's constitutional arrangements would not have proceeded. The Labor Party and the Democrats paraded this nonsense about the voting system, which was always an absurd objection without substance of any kind. Their proposition was to threaten people with a fine if they refuse to participate in a ballot to choose people to attend a convention-not a ballot to elect members of parliament, not a ballot to decide on whether or not the constitution was to be changed, not a ballot to determine something directly impacting on the future; rather, a ballot to determine the election of people to a convention. I am very pleased indeed that this ballot will now proceed and that the constitutional convention promised by the coalition will now take place. Australians will now be able to have their say through a voluntary secret postal ballot to elect 76 delegates to the convention. I am pleased to inform the House that the election for the delegates will take place in November and December this year, with the convention to be held in the first half of 1998. I hope to announce very shortly the names of the delegates nominated by the government. I think the Australian public will see that they represent a broad spectrum of the Australian community and also a broad spectrum of views on this issue. I confirm to the House that the chairman of the convention will be the right honourable member for New England, who is the father of the House, and the deputy chairman of the convention will be the honourable member for Lalor, who is also the National President of the Australian Labor Party. I think both of those honourable members will bring particular skills and a particular understanding and also certain capacities for repartee, which will add to the substance and I hope the dignity and the purpose of the convention. I have said all along that, notwithstanding the variety of personal views that people may hold on the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic, it is important that there be a proper discussion and it is important that, if from that discussion a consensus for change emerges, that consensus be put to the Australian people. That was the promise we made to the Australian people. If no consensus emerges, then we will, as promised before the last election, conduct an indicative plebiscite to obtain the views of the Australian people. I repeat again what I said in June of 1995: it is the intention of my government and the two parties that I lead in coalition to ensure that the Australian people are involved at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the debate on this very important issue. I believe the passage of the legislation by the Senate, notwithstanding the obstruction of the Labor Party and the Democrats, represents an important milestone along the process of an intelligent debate and consideration of this important issue. Tariff Policy",69
101,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Minister, isn't it true that Labor's bounty capitalisation with DuPont saved taxpayers almost $100 million? Isn't it also true that in opposition the coalition supported the capitalisation? Minister, if you supported the scheme then, why won't you enforce it now?",70
102,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Returning to the scene of the crime again is this person. Yesterday, on the advice of the department, I had a good look at the contract, which you were responsible for. It was a very remarkable contract on two parts: on a must-do basis and on best endeavours. As I said before, the company certainly met all its requirements under law. It did not meet all the requirements on the best endeavours.",70
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What did you do about it?,70
104,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The hypocrisy of the Labor Party, the sheer hypocrisy of it allMr Crean-What did you do about it? You just sit on your hands!",70
105,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are the party that are out there tearing down tariff one day and advocating a tariff the next day. This problem at DuPont is wholly of the Labor Party's making; wholly of your making. Foreign and Trade Policy,70
106,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the white paper on foreign policy and trade tabled by the foreign minister earlier today. Can the Prime Minister advise the House how the government's foreign and trade policy advances the interests of all Australians?,70
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member for Bowman, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Foreign Affairs and also the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade for the outstanding job that they have done in putting together this first ever white paper on foreign and trade policy in Australia. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking the many outside experts, including the former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Fraser, the former very distinguished head of the department of foreign affairs Mr Richard Woolcott and many other people for the intelligent and helpful contributions they made towards the compilation of this very succinct and compelling statement of the priorities and the values of the Australian government, and I believe in large measure the great bulk of the Australian people, about our foreign policy objectives. It is important to note, as the foreign minister did in his tabling statement today, that our foreign and trade policies are based overwhelmingly on a hard-headed assessment of Australia's national interests. In the first place, that of course means advancing the security of Australia and the living standards of all Australians. We all have a vested interest in a successful and well-focused foreign and trade policy, because it brings direct benefits in terms of employment and improved living standards. The foreign minister made the point, as I have on many occasions, that in shaping the foreign policy of Australia there is no requireDowner ment that this nation choose between her geography and her history. It is absolutely possible and entirely consonant with the long term objectives of this nation to invest, as we have and as successive Australian governments have done on both sides of politics, the highest possible priority in the relationship between Australia and the nations of the Asia Pacific region whilst at the same time retaining a very strong association with nations in other parts of the world. The notion that you cannot do that, the notion that you do have to make that kind of choice, represents one of the differences that do exist between the approach taken by this government and the approach taken by our predecessor. But it is also fair to say immediately that there are many areas of bipartisan agreement between my government and the government of my Labor predecessors. The emphasis placed on the Asia-Pacific region, the increasing linkages between foreign policy and trade policy, and the very strong commitment to regional security are all things that we have in common. If we are to have an intelligent debate, then the points of similarity should be emphasised and acknowledged as well as the points of difference. I think one of the other important features of the white paper put down by the foreign minister earlier today is the way in which it emphasises the job boosting capacity of strong export industries from Australia. The white paper makes the point, for example, that 345,000 Australian jobs flow from trade and investment links with Japan alone. Japan is Australia's third largest foreign investor. Those who would denigrate foreign investment, those who would take cheap, populist jibes at foreign investment in Australia, ought to be reminded that they are attacking the security of 345,000 Australian jobs, because they are directly associated with the trade and investment links that we have with the Japanese people. All round, the white paper is a first-class effort. It is a succinct and compelling statement of the priorities and the values of Australian foreign and trade policy. I again warmly congratulate my colleagues Alexander and Tim Fischer for the very fine job that they have done in bringing the document to the parliament. Pharmaceutical Industry",71
108,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Does the Prime Minister recall his recent speech on industry policy in Queensland and his claim that his government had encouraged investment in the pharmaceutical industry by extending the factor F scheme? Is the Prime Minister aware that the $300 million given to assist industry under factor F has been completely cancelled out by his government's budget changes, which will cost the industry up to $600 million? Is he also aware that, as a result of this attack on the pharmaceutical industry, a $100 million cutting edge, high-tech, bio-pharmaceutical plant planned for south east Melbourne, one of only two in the world, is now in grave danger of being lost to Singapore? Will the Prime Minister now act to capture this investment for Australia, by agreeing today to overturn this job destroying budget decision?",71
109,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that the two claims that are made in his question I will have analysed. I do not accept at face value what the Leader of the Opposition says about budget cuts. Every allegation that you made about budget cuts has been proved wrong. So why should I concede you anything on the question of budget cuts? As for the investment in relation to a particular plant, I will get some information about that. Apprenticeships and Traineeships Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. The government's recently announced new apprenticeships initiative has been welcomed in my electorate of Lindsay. What has been the reaction from employers, large and small business groups and young people to this important initiative, which will provide real jobs for thousands of young Australians and help make Australian businesses more competitive? Is the government aware of any other comments which have been made regarding this initiative?",72
110,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. Since the last election the government has taken a number of specific steps to increase awareness and availability of traineeships which can help many young Australians get the sorts of jobs they want. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that in the year to June there were over 52,000 new traineeship commencements, a record number, a 44 per cent increase over the previous 12 months. The government's policies to help young Australians are working. Last week I launched the government's new apprenticeships campaign to promote new apprenticeships to employers. I am pleased also to be able to tell members that the response to this launch has also been overwhelming. In the first week of the government's national campaign over 3,650 inquiries have been received on the hotline. There has been great support from industry for these initiatives. Mr Mark Patterson of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: New apprenticeships will deliver a range of new benefits for employers and as a result we expect that employers will increase their investment in vocational education and training. We congratulate the government on this major initiative. Jenny Mowatt of Woolworths said: We would expect to increase the number of trainees threefold to 1,000 trainees in next four years as a result of the opportunities and flexibilities granted within the scheme. This support for the government's new apprenticeships extends right into the trade union movement. Mr Julius Roe of the Manufacturing Workers Union said: It is absolutely refreshing that the federal government has made such a strong commitment to increasing the focus on apprenticeships in Australia. Last week no-one less than Jennie George",72
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Jennie George!,72
112,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jennie George wrote to the government, along with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and II.ldustry, to say that she supports the significant progress that has been achieved and backs new apprenticeships. This may raise some doubts on our side, but I can assure you we are delighted to get the broad support. There is only one discordant voice in this chorus of support, and that discordant voice comes from the Australian Labor Party. Senator Kim Carr, who appears to be the new training spokesman for the Australian Labor Party-he seems to have superseded the member for Werriwa and the member for Batman-laims that the new apprenticeships initiative 'is aimed at promoting short-term, cheap and nasty training packages at the expense of traditional apprenticeships'. If this is a description of anything, it is a description of Labor's failed Working Nation program. It indicates that the Labor Party, once again, is heading back 100 miles an hour to the 1950s. It is utterly out of touch with the needs of young Australians. It is utterly out of touch with industry. It is utterly out of the touch with the views of the trade union movement itself. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to bring Senator Carr into line. We know that he is not going to do that because he has no control over Senator Carr. He has no control over the young and the restless. He has no control over the member for Sydney, the truth teller now on the back bench of the Labor Party. What is now clear is that that 'major backflip' has been succeeded by 'general confusion'. Pharmaceutical Benefits",72
113,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. When the government decided to force ordinary Australians to pay more for the best and newest medicines, did the Prime Minister intend to hit heart transplant recipients, including a constituent of mine, Mr David Schneider, who is currently taking four drugs which will be affected by your government's changes? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I refer to standing order 144(0. I note that the member is in the habit of including some cynical remark in every one of his questions. Standing order 144(0 specifically precludes the use of cynical expressions. The Collins dictionary describes cynicism as 'the crudest attempt at irony'. Irony is prohibited understanding order 144(0. I ask you to rule it out of order, no matter how crude that attempt may be.",73
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parramatta, and I take heed of the thrust of your remarks. We all recognise that this is a very robust chamber and, whilst cautioning the member for Dobell, I will not rule the question out of order.",73
115,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Prime Minister intend to hit heart transplant recipients such as Mr Schneider, who is currently taking four drugs, affected by the changes? Is the Prime Minister also aware of a recent report by Paul Gross, who the Prime Minister invited to brief cabinet on private health insurance, which shows that Mr Schneider may be up to $38 a month worse off as a result of these changes? Finally, Prime Minister, is it your plan to force battlers such as Mr Schneider to pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their essential medicines, or will you act today to reverse this unfair measure?",73
116,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is very interesting to look at the last two questions from the Labor Party because they are internally inconsistent. The Leader of the Opposition on one hand is saying that all this money is going to come out of the pockets of the drug companies and the shadow minister for health is saying that all the money is going to come out of the pockets of the consumers. Both cannot be right. The fact is that you are trying to have it both ways, and you cannot. You do not understand the pharmaceutical benefits system. You could not keep it under control when you were a government and now you are whingeing when we try to do something that you should have done years ago. The fact is that what we accepted with the pharmaceutical benefits system was a system that was doubling in cost every four years. The shadow minister for health himself got up in this House in 1990 and complained about how we could not afford a pharmaceutical benefits system that was $1.5 billion. This year it is $2.7 billion. The fact is that this year we are spending $200 million more on the PBS, even after all the changes, than last year-$200 million that will predominantly go into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies. With respect to the question that the shadow minister for health raises, the categories of drugs, the drugs in those categories and the bench prices have not been determined. They are not being determined on a political basis; they are being determined by an expert committee. Any speculation that you may raise as to what price people will be up for for drugs is meaningless because in the end it will be the scientific experts on the PBAC that make that determination. Finally, I would say: why on earth should the federal government subsidise a floor price that is not a market price? The companies want to have flexibility in charging. They will have that and in the end the competition in the system will determine what the price to the consumer is. We think at most that will be a difference of about $1.50 to $2.00 in a circumstance where there are alternative drugs, which you cannot seem to understand.",73
117,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a supplementary question.  estimate that Mr Schneider will be $38 a month worse off?,74
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is out of order. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Why is the question out of order?",74

120,Mr W AKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Could the minister advise the House of the significance of the announcement of the sale of Australian National for the reform of the Australian rail industry, and of the benefits this will bring to regional Australia and to the Australian economy as a whole?",74
121,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Grey, who has had a very deep interest in this issue, as indeed have his colleagues in the Liberal Party in South Australia, who have taken a vital interest in the future of AN and its work force. When we came into office last year we inherited an Australian National Railways Commission that was in a shocking state. It had racked up debts of $1,000 million. It produced in its last year of operation a loss of $250 million. During Labor's tenure of office administering the Australian National Railways Commission, 7,000 jobs had gone from AN. Of course, AN was mortally wounded by the former Labor government's decision to establish the National Rail Corporation in the way in which they did. Along with that, the staff of AN were shell-shocked, disillusioned and demoralised. The customers and clients of AN had lost confidence in that business to provide a service. So it was incumbent upon us to undertake some very substantial reforms. Last November I announced on behalf of the government a $2 billion rail reform package to revitalise rail in Australia and, particularly, Australian National Railways. As part of that we agreed that we would transfer ownership of Australian National Railways from the government to the private sector. Today, in partnership with my colleague the Minister for Finance we have announced the successful bidders for the sale of AN. I am pleased to say that the sale process has been an outstanding success. The sale has gone to three separate companies. AN has been split into three organisations: one based solely in Tasmania, another one focused on South Australian freight rail and the other one on passenger services. Right at the outset we promised we would not sell AN solely based on price alone. We said that we wanted to ensure the best sale for South Australia and for the rail industry of Australia. So we took a lower price in order to maximise the quality of the bid. When we maximised the quality of the bid, we maximised the jobs in AN. We protected every job of every apprentice who works for AN. Not one of them will lose their job. Everyone of them will go on to take a job with a new owner. We maximised the opportunity for those people who work in the workshops, particularly in places like Port Augusta. We ensured that there were no line closures, unlike under the Labor Party's tenure of office, when 14 lines were closed. We ensured that there were no passenger service closures, unlike when Labor was in office, when six passenger services were closed. We ensured that we maximised capital expenditure on the new business of rail in South Australia and Tasmania. Some $97 million is being committed by the new owners on upgrading the rail system that was once owned by this government through AN. Not only will there not be any line closures or passenger service closures; there will be increases in passenger services as a result of the deal that we have struck in this sale. For example, the honourable member for Parkes would be pleased to know that there will be a 50 per cent increase in passenger rail services to Broken Hill as a result of this sale announced today. A-so, The Ghan will be providing services not Just between Adelaide and Alice Springs but also - o Melbourne and Sydney, improving the qualIty and nature of passenger services around Australia. When you look at this in its entirety and you add to it the decision by the Prime Minister announced last Saturday of our commitment towards the conclusion of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway, you can see that this coalition government is building Australia. . We are building the transport system and mfrastructure of Australia to improve the transport services this country has. We are refo-ng them to make them better. Compare that wIth the sorry track record of mismanagement and incompetence of the former Labor government. They lost 7,000 jobs through the Australian National Railways Commission, closed passenger services, closed lines, ran huge debts of $1,000 million and incurred huge operating losses in their final year. Under this government, rail in Australia is expanding, not receding as it was with Labor. Under this government, private sector investment will drive the future of rail in this country. Under this government, we have a vision to deve-op our rail services, to develop our transport mfrastructure and to build the - con?my of Australia to create more jobs not Just m .South Australia but right throughout our natIon. Newsagencies",74
122,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. In a question I asked you on 16 October last year, you said your government would honour its rock solid commitment to ?ewsagents to preserve the existing territonal system. Could you inform the House what you have done to deliver on this commitment?",75
123,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The commitment we made will be honoured. We have made representations, as is appropriate, to the A-st-alian Consumer and Competition Com-IsslOn. The honourable member for Oxley gIves me the opportunity to say something about some of the other small business commitments that were made, including commitments to the pharmacies of Australia. We made commitments to them and those commitments will be honoured. We made commitments to the news agents and those commitments will be honoured. We also made commitments to the generality of small business in Australia and those commitments not only have been honoured but, in certain cases, have been overdelivered. It is only the obstructive tactics of the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate which have put in doubt at t-e present time the overdelivery of our commItment in relation to capital gains tax relief. But by far the most important commitment that we gave to the small business sector of Australia, which has been met and in some areas ex-eeded, is the commitment to provide them wIth more stable general economic conditions. The five reductions in interest up rates, the very significant reduction in the budget deficit and the reform of the industrial relations system-all of those-have made a si¥nificant contribution to improving the clImate for small business. But, as far as the newsagents are concerned, I would say to the honourable member for Oxley that the commitments we made about making submissions to the Consumer and Competition Commission and arguing that there was a public interest, which there is overwhelmingly, in preserving a system where the home delivery of newspapers, which has been part and parcel of life in many parts of Australia for as long as anybody in this House can r-member,. w.ill be maintained. I happen to belIeve that It IS a very important element of life in Australia that there are home delive.ries. It has been a very important element of lIfe not only in the cities but also in other parts of Australia, and we are determined to do all we can within the law to maintain that system. That was the promise that I made on behalf of the coalition, and that is the promise that is being delivered and will be delivered. Capital Gains Tax",75
124,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware that some small business owners are not fully aware of the very significant measures we have implemented with regard to the capital gains tax? Would the minister please outline to the House the implications of these capital gains tax measures that the government has implemented and what these reforms will mean for small business owners trying to build up their businesses?,75
125,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his timely question. The Prime Minister was just saying that this government made a series of commitments to the small business community. In some respects we have overdelivered on those commitments. We are pleased to have done more; we are delighted to have done more. The small business community needs the assistance of a federal government that is on its side. If you have a government that is pro-small business, that is a benefit for everybody-not just for small businesses themselves but for the people they employ, for the consumers that they serve and for big business, which also benefits from a thriving and prosperous small business community. One of those promises we made was in respect of the capital gains tax. I think the honourable member makes a good point: that is, these reforms can be introduced and the changes made. But it is also important that people running small businesses are informed of these changes. Apart from the benefit it provides, I think it also gives them additional confidence that they have government on their side, which is so important to a prosperous economy. The government has delivered on those promises in the face of fierce opposition from the opposition. It is amazing-you opposite created a lot of the problems for the small business community, and when we introduce the solutions you are opposed to those as well. The fact is you like the capital gains tax. You put it on the small business community and you would be the last people to support any relief for the small business community from capital gains tax. That is why you are in favour of death duties; exactly the same thing. If you can do something against the small business community, ask the Labor Party. That is basically your policy-not just death duties but, as you opposed the capital gains tax rollover relief during the Senate debate some month or so back, it is obvious that that is your policy for the next election. You are going into the next election saying that if you have the numbers you will reduce that benefit, if not remove it entirely. Then we have seen the debate in respect of those people in small business who ought to be commended, ought to be applauded, for the fact that they have been in small business and they have survived small business long enough to be able to retire from it. You would think that those people would be deserving of some encouragement or, at the very least, if you like, a policy which removes the disincentive for them to be in small business in the first place. It is incredible that the spokesperson on small business on the Labor side says he is in favour of small business but he actually comes into the House and votes against it. That is the ultimate hypocrisy. You claim to be in favour but if you were in office you would have the tax office sending them assessments for liability on capital gains tax. The measure that has been implemented which came into effect on 1 July provides rollover relief if you are going from one business into another. That is a very generous benefit. That is a benefit which has been calculated to be worth something in the order of $300 million. It was very well described by Robert Gottliebsen in the Business Review Weekly back in December. We should have every small business in the country hanging his comment on their wall behind their desk. These are the opening words to his comment. He says: The small business capital gains tax rollover relief is the most significant change made to taxation in Australia in decades. It is most important that they know about it and most important that that also gives them the confidence of having a government that is pro-small business. Pharmaceutical Benefits",76
126,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of recent clinical trials of a new terol lowering drug called Pravastatin, which were stopped early because they were so successful in saving lives? If you do not recall that, do you recall your own promise to this House on 14 May that your higher drug charges would only apply to drugs 'of equal clinical value'? In the light of the evidence on Pravastatin, Prime Minister, will you put your promise into action and guarantee that no patient will pay more for this life saving drug?",76
127,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will ask the Minister for Health and Family Services to answer the question.,77
128,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I had mine checked, Mr Speaker; I am okay. The whole point of therapeutic premiums that the opposition seems to be missing is that if one medication shows a therapeutic benefit we will pay a premium for that benefit. But we will not pay a premium where there is no therapeutic benefit. That is the whole point behind it. We have chosen very narrowly defined groups, and everyone will have an alternative. So we hope no-one has to pay more at all. We hope that the majority will lead to changes in prescription patterns by doctors. So it will effectively come down to consumer choice. Black Hawk Helicopter Accident",77
129,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of media reports concerning disciplinary procedures arising from the Townsville Black Hawk tragedy? Can the minister inform the House of the principles and procedures which are to be applied to such matters?,77
130,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of the reports, and on this very sad matter it is somewhat disappointing to find that the member for Brisbane has been offering his advice publicly on the matter. Mr Bevis-What is your advice?",77
131,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, you will find out. A properly convened and open board of inquiry on this matter made findings and recommendations in relation to the Black choles- Hawk accident. Amongst the many recommendations that were made, which are now being assiduously implemented, the board recommended that disciplinary action be considered against five members. Having reviewed these, the Chief of Army appointed a convening authority to consider whether the charges should be laid. Subsequent proceedings have led to the preferring of charges against three officers. My responsibility as minister is to satisfy myself that the appropriate legal procedures and processes are being followed at all times and, accordingly, from time to time. I have sought independent legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor concerning the appropriateness of the investigatory procedures being followed. I have also sought advice on the role of the minister in relation to the administration of the Defence Force Discipline Act. In his advice to me, the Acting Deputy Government Solicitor says, amongst other things, that 'the convening authority cannot be directed as to how to exercise his statutory discretion by a superior officer, or indeed by the minister or anyone else'. For this reason I am extremely disappointed that the member for Brisbane has sought to influence the administration of military justice in his press release of 26 August and in his subsequent radio interviews, in which he said that 'he would encourage the minister, the department and the commanding officer not to proceed'. To so encourage the minister or the convening authority is entirely improper.",77
132,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is not blaming you.,77
133,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Did you know about it? Did you know about his press release?,77
134,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is just suggesting to you; he is not blaming you.,77
135,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These procedures have taken some time. Regrettably, they have some time to run. But it must be recognised that the key principle in this matter is that there be no political intervention in the administration of justice, whether civil or military. I regret that the member for Brisbane has acted with such indiscretion, but I can only assume that he knew no better.",77
136,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Stop blaming him for it.,78
137,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is more, I notice that the interventions of the Leader of the Opposition",78
138,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Don't be silly.,78
139,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"it is not silly, it is a very serious matter. If you knew about it, you should be ashamed; if you did not know about it, you had better discipline him and pull him into gear. This matter is a very emotional issue and you ought to pull him into gear and keep him quiet. Research and Development",78
140,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry.,78
141,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,78
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much across-the-table debate going on.,78
143,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer to last week's engineering excellence awards night, which the Prime Minister failed to attend. Is the minister aware that his own department's innovation prize went to the Victorian firm Invetech for its world beating work on a new instrument that automates the smearing of blood film slides, a development that is earning Australia over $30 million in exports? Is the minister also aware that Invetech's work was funded as a syndicated research and development project? Minister, were you referring to Invetech when you said: 'This is one of the areas where your mates and the rorts were ... these ones are on the police list'? Minister, if you think Invetech is rorting the taxpayer, why did your own department give them this prestigious award?",78
144,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no doubt about it: they were fairly well stung yesterday-the member for Hotham has not shut up. For the whole of the winter recess, you could not find him anywhere. Government members-Where was he?",78
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right! Order!,78
146,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And about 11 August he surfaced to admit that their industry policy in government was not too good. But while he was away there was a publication called the Republican which I am, of course, a frequent reader of. In that edition there is a reference to the member for Hotham. It says: 'Simon Crean was described ... ' Mr MCCleliand- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",78
147,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,78
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Barton on a point of order. Mr MCClelland-My point of order is that this is nowhere near relevant to the question which was asked on an important issue.,78
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Barton. The minister is about to address the substance of the question.,78
150,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But I am sure you would like to hear what the Republican had to say, because it is such a well written article. And it described the member for Hotham in these terms: 'A member of the Labor Unity faction described him as ""an empty suit"".' It is no wonder he went away for the winter to France and all those other places. He did well. As for the award the other night, I congratulate the company on the outcome. But I am surprised that you come back to defend syndication again with all your mates. As I said at the time, there were always good outcomes, but that particular scheme was being used more for financial outcomes than for scientific outcomes. And it is your mates in the Rolls Royces-the old Rolls Royce you get around in, the 'high-flying member for Hotham' - who are the ones I would not talk about too much, if I were you. Trade",78
151,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Trade. I ask the minister: in the light of today's tabling of the first foreign affairs and trade policy white paper, in the light of the Supermarket to Asia Council's market access working group's meeting to day and in the light of the market development task force, what progress and breakthroughs have been made on trade? In particular, has Thailand effectively lowered its tariff rates?",78
152,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wannon for his question, and I am very pleased to inform the House that, again reflecting the determination of the government to pursue a hard-edged, pragmatic trade policy, we have produced the white paper today, which the Prime Minister commented on and which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, tabled at noon today. In addition to that, working group 5, the market access working group of the Supermarket to Asia Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, also had a constructive and parallel meeting to really push on with the agenda of boosting our market access. As a consequence, and reflecting the record figure of $104.4 billion of exports last financial year, I am happy to inform the member for Wannon that Thailand on the overall base approach has in fact lowered its general rate of tariff from 30.2 per cent three years ago to 17 per cent now, this year. That is on an MFN basis. In addition to that, on specific matters we have been pursuing as part of the working group 5 of the Supermarket to Asia Councilcase workers with the market development task force-I am pleased to be able to advise the House that we have achieved, firstly, a reclassification of AMF, a key dairy export, a good result in better and more accurate labelling of that product being permitted and fully allowed on to the Thai market but, secondly, a specific reduction of the tariff on that item from 19.8 per cent to five per cent. Thirdly, we have developed new operational procedures between Australia and Thailand to meet Thailand's import requirements for citrus. It is of particular interest to the memelectorate. ber for Mallee, the member for Riverina and the member for Wakefield that the market value of this particular breakthrough on citrus will be an additional $2 million, remembering that the citrus industry now, to its credit, exports over 52 per cent of their product to the world. We are not resting there. We are determined to push ahead with the country-to-country bilaterals, and I acknowledge the assistance we have received from our embassy network around the world, including the ambassador to the United States-the world's largest economY--on a range of issues, and also from Austrade and through other activities of my colleagues, including the Minister for Primary Industries, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister on his travels. Therefore, I am also pleased to advise the House that there are new arrangements for cattle to China, which is a potential market of 85 million. Kangaroo meat is now going to be permitted into Ireland and France-something you never achieved. Tomatoes and capsicums from Tasmania are going into Japan, along with our oysters-but I do not choose to taste another one in the Tokyo fish market; I am allergic to them. Access to the chilled beef market of Korea has been achieved as well as poultry access into Korea. We are determined to push on at the bilateral level, country to country; at the regional level, examining regional trade agreements; and at the multilateral level. My colleagues, contrast that with what happened under the years of Labor in government. We have the lament of Senator Button, a former senior minister, recorded in the Edwards autobiography on Keating. What did he say? He said, 'I do not know about Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are all down there on the multilaterals. No-one is doing anything about the bilaterals.' We are; and we will continue to do so. Research and Development",78
153,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Science and Technology. I refer to last week's welcome announcement of a major breakthrough in breast cancer research by the Austin Research Institute, based in my Is the minister aware that this vital breakthrough would have been impossible without syndicated R&D funding? Does he recall the Treasurer's description of syndicated R&D as 'one of the great rorts'? What steps has the government taken to ensure future funding for the Austin Research Institute's very important, lifesaving work?",79
154,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Both the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism have made the point that of course there were some good outcomes from the syndicated R&D scheme, but there were too many distortions and outright rorts to be tolerated. Instead, the government has put in place an infrastructure to support R&D across the board, whether it be our support for public sector research agencies, the 125 per cent tax incentive; or the START program, with $520 million over four years, including $120 million for the small business innovation fund which will be matched two for one against private sector fundraising. In addition to that, NHMRC grants are up in real terms in this budget. We have maintained and expanded our research and development base with a special focus on commercialisation. You are just running a scare campaign. You are throwing around some emotive terms and you certainly do not do any of those research organisations, agencies or efforts that you refer to any good at all by politicising them in this way. Credit Unions",79
155,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Following the closure of numerous bank branches throughout regional Australia, a number of credit unions have taken on the role of providing banking services to rural communities. Can the Treasurer inform the House how the latest amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act will affect financial institutions, such as the Holiday Coast Credit Union in my electorate of Lyne and the electorate of Paterson, in delivering improved banking services to people in the bush?",80
156,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The good news for the people of Lyne and the Holiday Coast Credit Union is that the announcement which the government made yesterday will, for the first time, give credit unions the opportunity to issue cheques without having to go through a bank. It will do the same for building societies. This is part of the government's drive to increase and heighten competition and new financial services. In this case, this is a good news story for rural and regional Australia. It is good news for rural and regional Australia because now financial institutions, for the first time ever, can offer a financial service whereby they can write their cheques directly. This has been welcomed by building societies and credit unions. The Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies issued a press release yesterday saying: The Treasurer's announcement will pave the way for building societies to provide their own cheques to customers and add to competitive pressure on the major banks. Customers will have greater choice of financial service provider as building societies will offer a comparable range of products to banks. The Credit Union Services Corporation yesterday welcomed this announcement by the government. The Credit Union Services Corporation said as follows: We warmly welcome today's announcement by the Treasurer that the government will amend the Cheques and Payment Orders Act to introduce this important reform. It is good news for competition in retail banking and therefore good news for credit union members and for all consumers. By allowing credit unions and building societies to issue cheques you have a new range of financial services available in rural and regional Australia, where local credit unions are taking deposits, making loans and now issuing cheques, giving benefits in a competitive financial environment, which is all good news for rural and regional Australia. Goods and Services Tax",80
157,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, I refer to the failure of you and your ministers in successive question times this week to rule out the imposition of a GST or anything like it on food, on education expenses and on health services. In light of that failure to rule that out, what confidence can lower and middle-income earners now possibly have that your so-called tax reform agenda will not simply be a means to belt them every time they purchase essential everyday goods and crucial family services? Why don't you stand by your promise to never, ever introduce a GST?",80
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You cannot believe your luck. This is from the deputy leader for death duties. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Can I remind you that that was the subject of a personal explanation earlier in the week. The Prime Minister is repeating a blatant and misleading untruth, which he knows to be the case. You should rule him out of order and not allow him to continue with it.",80
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,81
160,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are impaled on the consequences of your own loose tongue. You want to reintroduce death duties. You want to introduce death duties. You want to force the states to introduce death duties. You can imagine that, in the unfortunate event that a Labor government were ever re-elected in this country and he was the Treasurer, at the very first premiers' conference he would be banging the table and saying, 'If you have any money troubles, go away and reintroduce death duties.' That is what he would be saying. Instead of offeringMr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. If the Prime Minister feels so strongly about death duties, why is it part of the brief to the Treasurer's department to examine just them?",81
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,81
162,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have had the relevance deprivation syndrome; we now have the sensitivity to truth syndrome. You want the states to introduce death duties. You sat on that Sunday program with Laurie Oakes and said 'Oh, you don't need any fundamental reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. If they want extra money, they can put on a double income tax, they can put on a death duty.' Yes, he is nodding; he is still nodding. The reality is that you are in a hopeless mess on the issue of taxation because you do not have the guts, you do not have the courage, you do not have the policy vision to realise that this nation needs a modem, fair reform taxation system into the 21st centuryand only the coalition parties have the courage and the leadership to deliver it. Defence Industries",81
163,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. Would the minister inform the House of any plans to promote Australia's defence industry and exports, which are so important in my electorate of Paterson? Minister, is this an area open for expansion; and, more importantly, how will this deliver on Australian jobs, particularly in the greater Hunter?",81
164,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know how keen he is to see more defence industry in his electorate. I would simply say that, when last in Newcastle, I explained that our defence industries-in the plural-are the biggest employer in the Hunter as a whole. I am pleased to say to that member that next week I will be leading the largest ever defence industry trade mission to the United Kingdom, comprising 25 defence industry firms. Many of those firms, in fact, do business in the Hunter. What we are doing is giving these firms the opportunity for the first time to have a crack at the $250 billion market which exists in the UK and in Europe. Presently we get a miserable $34 million worth. We have firms which are innovative and which are able to market particularly in niche areas. We want them to have the opportunity to do joint venturing with firms in the UK and Europe in order that they can be successful in tapping that very large market. We are also very keen to maintain our penetration of Asian markets and, later in the year, I will be taking an industry mission there as well.",81
165,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,81
166,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am interested to hear the interjections coming from the other side, because they were simply hopeless, simply pathetic, in their dealings with defence industry. To them, it seemed to be simply playing games with toys. The fact of the matter is that in this country we need thorough investment where we get intellectual property developed. The last government, the Labor government, invested $11 Y2 billion of taxpayers' money in buying goods platforms-but, in fact, we do not own the intellectual property in any of them and we cannot export them. The 25 firms that are coming wi th me to the United Kingdom-and in London I will also be addressing a defence manufacturers seminar-will have the first opportunity to get a fair crack at that huge market where their talents, their innovation can be seen to be getting some delivery and some attention. We care about defence industry; you lot never did.",81
167,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper-a very agreeable note on which to end; a very successful first week for the government. NA Answers to Questions",82
168,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you, pursuant to standing order 150. Would you please write to the Minister for Health and Family Services about question No. 1918 and ask why I have not yet had a reply?",82
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will be happy to do so this afternoon. Right of Reply of Persons Referred to in the House,82
170,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. I refer to yesterday's resolution by the House regarding the right of reply of persons referred to in the House. Have you received any correspondence complaining of a misuse of parliamentary privilege; and, if so, given that yesterday's resolution will have prospective rather than retrospective effect, will you table any such correspondence which you have received?",82
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Barton for his question. I did have some indication that the honourable member proposed to raise this matter, and I thank him for his courtesy in so advising me. There are certainly records of approaches by, or on behalf of, persons concerned about criticism or claims made about them in the House during my period as Speaker and before. I am also sure that many members would have received approaches from persons complaining about statements made in the House. I listened with interest comments made by the Leader of the House and the Leader of Opposition Business about the right of reply procedure, and I noted their comments that the new procedure was not intended to have any retrospective effect. While I understand the concern of the honourable member for Barton, I am not convinced that the various and, no doubt, incomplete records that are available on these matters should be tabled. It has always been open to a person concerned about a statement made in the House either to approach the member who has made the statement or, far more usually, to approach another member and ask that member to place their rebuttal on the record. Members have always been able to do this without necessarily adopting the views of the person complaining to them. It still remains open to any member to place a denial or explanation on the parliamentary record by reading out the details provided by the person concerned. The ability of members to do this is not affected by the passage of the right of reply resolution; and there is no reason why members cannot place denials on the record if they wish to, even if the original accusation or claim is somewhat dated. To this extent, retrospectivity is not an issue. Provision of Additional Information to Answers to Questions Without Notice",82
172,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question to you follows from yesterday's question time in which the Prime Minister added to an answer during question time. The reason I ask the question is that my recollection is that, during the time. I have been a member, ministers were allowed to add to answers at the end of question time or subsequently during the day. I refer you to page 521 of House of Representatives Practice, which says: Ministers may seek and be granted the indulgence of the Chair after Question Time or later in the day, to add to or correct an answer given to a question without notice asked on that day or even a previous day. I would simply ask that perhaps you could obtain some guidance either today or some time in the future as to what the practice might be about when ministers are allowed to yesterday to the add to answers.",82
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Usually it is the practice of ministers to provide the information as soon thereafter, and the common practice has been at the conclusion of question time. Noting the Prime Minister's response, I think the information came to him a little quicker than that. In order to keep the House fully informed, indulgence was given to him to address his response earlier than is the practice. I think the information and the thrust of all of the ministers will be to provide an update where that is necessary as soon as possible thereafter. I would normally expect it to take place at the end of question time or as soon thereafter as possible.",82
174,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Papers are tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the papers will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and Hansard. The schedule read as followsCorporations and Securities-Parliamentary Joint Committee-Report, March 1997, on the annual reports of the Australian Securities Commrnission and other bodies-1994-95--Government response. NA Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",83
175,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's failure to provide job security for thousands of workers in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",83
176,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We just had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) arrogantly walk from this chamber claiming it has been a successful week. I wonder whether the 160 workers who lost their jobs at DuPont think it has been a successful week. I wonder whether the hundreds of others of textile workers whose jobs are threatened because of this government's inaction think it has been a successful week. The fact is that this is a government with its hands off the rudder and the ship of state careering into the reef. This is a government without direction, without policy and particularly without an industry policy. The other day we had the Prime Minister, jarred into action, go to a black-tie dinner in Brisbane to tell them about his newfound direction on industry policy. This is the Prime Minister who, 12 months ago when Labor was calling for an industry policy, said, 'Our industry policy is low inflation and low PAPERS interest rates; you don't need anything else.' We were saying then that you did need something else. You need to have a view about what industries we should be encouraging in this country and have a strategic plan to get those industries going. We said that it needed something more. Similarly, the minister's own reporter, David Mortimer, said that something else was needed. We were saying that 12 months ago. But when did the Prime Minister come to this conversion? He came to it when the polls started telling him that he had to do something on industry policy. Rather than St Paul on the road to Damascus, this is St Poll on the road to Mark Textor. This is the Prime Minister without an original thought in his head, driven only by the fact that what he has to do is respond to the latest opinion poll and then have no concept as to how you put it together. Let me give an example of that, because it relates to the pharmaceuticals industry. You have seen the clueless approach of not only the Prime Minister but also the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) when we questioned him about that shining example that the Prime Minister held up in Brisbane as to what his government meant by strategic intervention in the pharmaceuticals industry. We asked questions yesterday and today to get the government to understand that the decision they took this year to extend factor F-Labor's industry program for the pharmaceuticals industry-they undid in spades with the budget decision on pharmaceutical pricing policy. So much so that the $300 million that was given in March to industry to address the market failure because of the pricing scheme for drugs in this country was wiped out by a $500 million deficit two months later. What you have is a government that says it has an industry policy to encourage drug manufacturing but, when it comes to pricing policy, from the health minister's point of view, it is a policy that runs completely counter to it. The initiatives that were taken to extend patents to also extend the factor F have been wiped out. What happened when we asked the Prime Minister about that? He said yesterday, 'I don't know about this.' This is the man who has been to Brisbane extolling the virtues of this policy, mind you, holding it up as the shining beacon. But yesterday he came into the House and said that he knew nothing about it. Today when he was asked the question again he turned to his industry minister-I think at the time to throw the question to him-and, realising that he would get a useless response from him, took the question himself and still did not know the answer. Then he went immediately over to his adviser's box and said, 'You had better get out and find this, but by the way don't ask Moore. He has not got a clue. He would not know what is going on in this industry.' The simple fact of the matter is this: the one example that this government has so far held up of strategic intervention in industry has been a failure. Let me tum to another area of industry policy that this government has in: the automotive industry. You know, the automotive industry that Labor had been campaigning for months day in, day out, saying, 'Adopt Labor's plan for the automotive industry. It is the only plan that will produce jobs. It is the only plan that will produce investment and exports.' The Prime Minister said in here, 'That's cheapjack opportunism. Oh, no, we're not going to have a bar of Labor's plan because that's cheapjack opportunism.' Then at the eleventh hour he adopts Labor's plan almost in its entirety. He could not help himself in getting down to Victoria to be at the opening of the Toyota plant. Having told the engineers he was too sick to travel to their meeting two days later, he turns up to wallow in the glory of the Toyota plant, which would not have occurred if it had not been for Labor's plan. Yet this government masquerades on the basis that it is theirs. We do not mind in the end. We happen to believe that industry policy needs to be bipartisan in this country and that it needs to be supported by both sides of government to give business the security under which they can invest. But this government has no ideas and the only policy it has in industry at the moment is that which Labor has developed for it. I saw the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) the first day back in here asking the Prime Minister about the Prime Minister's plan for the automotive industry that resulted in the Toyota expansion and what that meant for Bendigo. This was the same Bruce Reid who was missing in New York when the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) and myself were up at Empire Rubber arguing and developing the strategy for Labor's plan. When the Prime Minister got up to ask the question, everyone on this side of the House broke up and they were all looking glum on that side. Everyone in this place who has followed the debate knows that it was Labor's plan, not that of the Liberals. I come now to the question of the textile, clothing and footwear industry.",83
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,At last.,84
178,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is an MPI, I understand, involved itself Mr Deputy Speaker.",84
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say to the member for Hotham that it certainly is an MPI. I had noted that the terms of the MPI referred specifically to the workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry, and so far you have taken the first eight minutes to speak only about the pharmacy and automotive industries.",84
180,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you for the direction that constantly comes to our side of the chamber and never to the other side. Let me go on with the textile, clothing and footwear industry because my time is short enough in any event other than to be curtailed by that. In the case of the textile, clothing and footwear industry, this is not just about capital city investment. Regional Australia is at threat. There are many women's jobs at threat in this industry. There are 100,000 people employed in this industry. If the Productivity Commission's recommendations are adopted, 50,000 of them will be wiped out and those who remain will be forced into the backyard. The Productivity Commission's recommendations are a strategy for jobs offshore and jobs underground. If that report is adopted, that is what will happen. I notice that the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), who is in the chamber, has a notice of motion on the Notice Paper to support the tariff freeze. I welcome him in terms of that, but let me say that his motion does not go far enough, because what is needed to secure the jobs in this industry is not just the freeze but the retention of the import credit scheme. Mr Lieberman-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I might seek some guidance from you as well. Whilst I welcome the publicity about the notice of motion, it is an anticipation of the debate on the notice of motion that the member is now debating.",84
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not. Mr Lieberman-If you are happy with it, I am happy with it.",85
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I remind the House that while points of order are technically correct, it is the convention that they are not asked during MPIs.",85
183,Mr CREAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It also needs the retention of the import credit scheme because it is that scheme which has taken this industry from an inward-looking, domestically oriented only industry to an export growing industry. It is that scheme that resulted in the Givoni workers outside Parliament House yesterday with whom the Prime Minister refused to meet and from whom the Prime Minister refused to receive the gift of the dressing gown. Those Givoni workers are not just producing for the domestic market; they are exporting their product, and they are doing it because of the import credit scheme. The member for Indi now scurries out of the parliament, having interrupted me and taken up my time. He should understand that his motion will be meaningless unless it retains the import credit scheme. Labor's strategy is this: we say that there should be a freeze on tariffs to 2005, that there should be a review in 2004 that has regard to what our trading partners do and that we should retain the import credit scheme. We also say that the industry is required to set targets-targets for investment, targets for export and targets for jobs. These are targets that we got with the automotive industry and targets that we are now seeing realised with the Toyota development. We have also said in relation to the textile industry that we want the issue of the outworkers addressed. I am confident that, in the discussions we have had, we will come forward with that. Again, the government should be embracing that plan now, not leaving further uncertainty and not putting further jobs at risk but creating the environment in which places like DuPont can actually get on and make the investment. Let me go to the question of DuPont, because the government, again, has shown itself to have misunderstood what happened here. The fact of the matter is that the DuPont payment saved the nation $100 million. We should understand that. It was a net saving to the nation, not a cost. The second thing is that it resulted in a zero bounty five years ahead of time because of the cashing out arrangement. The third thing is that that proposal was supported by the opposition. If it was backed by them then when they were in opposition, why won't they support it now in government? Where is the consistency on your part? More than the $100 million saving to taxpayers that was obtained, we got commitments from the industry-seven years of them and all of them met, all except the last year. Why? Because we had a change of government. This government is not trying. The only reason the arrangements failed with DuPont is because the government walked away from its responsibility and had its hands off the lever. Where do we go from here? The fact of the matter is that on our side we have picked up the phone. We have spoken to DuPont. We have established that, if Labor's plan for the TCF industries is embraced, not only will the existing commitments so far as DuPont is concerned be honoured but we will get additional investment expenditure up to $40 million. The reason the textile plan is necessary is not anything for them directly as a company. They do not get anything because all they have is a five per cent tariff. They stand to gain nothing. But the significance of Labor's plan for the textile industry is for the carpet manufacturers themselves-the people that DuPont supply. There is no point in them investing if the carpet manufacturers have been wiped out. If the minister does not understand the integration of this industry, he ought to get down to Bayswater and have a look. What we have is this situation: the ability, yet again, to secure the market; the ability to create confidence if the coalition is prepared to embrace Labor's plan for the TCF industry. But where was the minister? They could not get him on the radio today to defend the position-our attack on him about their not enforcing the agreement against DuPont. We finally got him. He admitted today in parliament that he had actually rung DuPont. I would like to know what the conversation was. Did you say to them, 'Honour the commitment?' When did the conversation take place? Did you get the commitment from them, as we did, for the $40 million expansion? This is an industry minister that view of life. He thinks the solution to things is through the GST tax reform. We all know on this side what drives the minister. I think he was confusing the symbols when he got the GST up. He was looking at what he would like next. What he did was get the symbols confused. Here is the man who has no idea of his portfolio, no understanding of the problems continuing to confront the pharmaceutical industry, no understanding or courage in terms of what is needed for the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Whilst this government dithers, the economy will continue to falter. (Time expired)",85
184,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was 15 minutes of bluster and humbug. Being away during the winter recess does not do members of parliament much good. They get out of touch with things. This is especially so when you are out of the country rocking around the south of France and those parts. Mrs Crosio- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I would ask you to ask the minister on his feet to read the MPI. It has nothing to do with overseas travel but with the jobs of thousands of workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The minister should stick to the MPI, I believe, with your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker.",86
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the honourable member for Prospect. I do commend to the minister that he should try to stay within the terms of the MPI and at least emulate the same percentage as the member for Hotham.,86
186,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I was saying, 10 his study of France-no doubt looking at the textile, clothing and footwear industries over there-the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) would have had an immensely enjoyable time because nobody was around. He could not hear from any of those burnt out old ministers who chase the old ministers around. He could not hear from his backbenchers, the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and the other people there, who know far more about industry than he does. He was overseas. There was no need has a funny to worry about those things. I am glad to see the member for Corio is here. He comes from Geelong and knows a bit about these industry matters. He worked in the office of Senator Button. Senator Button and I talk about industry matters from time to time. It was very interesting to hear some of the old history-what things were said around the place. It was extraordinarily interesting that when the member for Hotham came back to Australia all of a sudden he bounced onto ABC Radio National and said in response to the MTIA report, 'Yes, we didn't get it all right. We were wrong on industry policy.' That reminds me of an article in the Bulletin by Graham Richardson. He is almost a factional ally of yours so you should listen to this one. Richardson said, 'For the whole of the 13 years of Labor government they never had a coherent industry policy.' Those are two things you should think about. As he stalked around Bordeaux and thought about matters, he could not toss up whether he wanted to have a light red, a heavy red or just a big red",86
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I think the minister should stay on the point.,87
188,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was considering what might go on in industry policy in Australia. I thought one of the best places he could start at was with the report of the Productivity Commission on the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The Productivity Commission issued an interim response not long ago and we are expecting its final report in the near future. The other day the member for Hotham was on the radio saying, 'They should jump in straight away and make a response. They should not wait for these things. They should make up their mind.' He knows as well as I do that the Labor Party for years just waited for the final report and then just went along with it. It is their reports and their tariff policies which he is now complaining about. It is Labor's policy which is affecting DuPont and other industries today. As a consequence of that, we have improved on this. One of the first things I insisted on doing in these industry reviews was to appoint a member from the industry itself to the Productivity Commission. That was a contested matter; nevertheless, they were there, and they made a particularly good contribution-something Labor never did. I am looking to see what Mr Brass, who is the third commissioner on this particular industry review, might come up with in the final report. On top of that, I also formed the advisory committee of TCF, which braced all aspects of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. While you were yapping on the ABC at lunchtime today, I was meeting with them. There were trade unionists there. We had across-the-board representation. They all have a concerted view as to what might happen. I did not hear anything about the Labor Party pluses; there were quite a few negatives on what they thought you were talking about. They did not think you knew much about it at all. I said that I was not surprised because you were not here. The only thing you have done so far this year is defend syndications and your mates in the Rolls Royces in Melbourne. The winter recess came. You beaut! You went off to France. You rock on back here in August, make a few statements, and then come into the House. It is no wonder those on the front-bench are pretty restless and it is no wonder, Simon, that they talk about you as the empty suit. There is no doubt about that. It is no wonder you get these sorts of titles thrown about the place. As a consequence of all that, I do not think we have to worry too much about all your comments on TCF at present. Mr Crean-Oh, so you don't agree with them.",87
189,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are not worth considering. On the topic of DuPont, which the opposition has been focusing on, can I make sure that everyone knows the facts because they seem to be missing. DuPont took over Fibremakers in a $150 million deal on 20 June 1990. At the same time, the Commonwealth government approved a one-off taxable grant to DuPont. The grant represented the capitalisation of the company's future bounty revenues over the period to 30 June 1995. At the time the acting minister for industry, the one who is now for tariffs, then said that the grants would allow the company to operate competitively in a zero-tariff, zero-bounty environment. As part of the agreement, the company agreed to meet by December 1993 a number of obligations in terms of performance indicators. I am advised that the company met these indicators at that time. Mr Crean-Oh!",87
190,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Don't jump too soon. However, the company also agreed to meet on a reasonable endeavours basis following performance targets between 1994 and 1995: capital investment of $8 million, exports of $20 million, employment of 400, productivity capacity of 12,600 tonnes and R&D of $1.5 million. Unfortunately, these targets were not met. The Labor Party failed to enforce the contract in 1994 and in 1995. I am advised also four subsequent amendments to the contracts were made between 1990Mr Crean-You advised they failed to enforce it; is that what you are saying?",87
191,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I said, Labor failed to enforce the contract in 1994 and 1995. I am advised also of four subsequent amendments to the contracts between 1990 and 1995, agreed to by the previous government. These had the effect of changing the composition of the capital investment requirement, lowering the performance target for investment expenditure in 1994 and 1995 from $8 million to $7 million, extending the period for the achievement of the performance targets by one year, to December 1996. So you watered down the contract even though you could not enforce it. Due to an oversight by the previous government, the termination date of the contract was not extended. Accordingly, I am advised, the contract expired before the performance targets were required to be met--quite extraordinary. As is the history of the Labor government in other areas. The story here is the same: grand plans, bold promises, poor performances, resulting in underperformance. Just to emphasise that point, I quote from an ACTU newsletter-the member for Hotham should know the address of that organisation, and so should the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), come to think of it: As a result of this Federal Government policythat is, the federal Labor Party government's policyimports generally rose sharply, but an unparalleled rise in imports of clothing, textiles and footwear caused great suffering in those industries. Australian companies were forced to either go out of business or compete with the imported goods by lowering production costs and moving production out of the factory and into the workers' That is what your people thought of your policy. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Even the ACTU has written that about your policies.",88
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I would like to encourage the minister to address his remarks through the chair. Mr Crean-Just get on with it. You are just rambling all over the place.,88
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,And I would like to encourage the member for Hotham to restrain himself. Mr MCGauran-The champion rambler.,88
194,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Government members interjecting,88
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Members on my right.,88
196,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am not surprised that you respond in that way to my quoting of the newsletter of the ACTU. Can I just mention a couple of aspects about industry policy, as time is running out. One of the great achievements of the Howard government to date was its response to the motor car industry report. By implementing the decision between 2000 and 2010 we expect to achieve up to $6 billion of investment, increased investment of a very high amount, increased employment, increased exports and increased research and development, and down the track I expect to see design centres for major companies here. As a consequence of these movements in investment and these areas, Toyota first responded-and not because of the Labor Party. While the ACTU geniuses over here were off having a winter holiday, I was in Tokyo speaking to Toyota. In those discussions, we agreed on what their programs will be in the near future, and that was announced in Australia subsequent to that visit. The government's decision in response to the motor car industry is the most significant decision we have made this year. In relation to another area of industry policy, we have the PII program, or PIIP, where $300 million is given towards investment in the pharmaceutical area. I have heard some comments today attempting to deride this program. It is quite natural when operathomes. ing a compulsory acquisition for pharmaceuticals that there is a market distortion. To overcome that market distortion, both this government and the previous government operated a scheme which compensated corporations for doing research and development in this nation. I think that both programs were in the national interest, and I am surprised that you are now carrying on in the way that you are in relation to this. On top of that, the government's industry policy is very clear. Firstly, we were confronted with a $10 billion deficit. That has been rectified. As' a consequence, we find interest rates and inflation are down to very low levels. That in itself is a major and significant contribution towards any industry in Australia. In relation to growth in Australia, GDP is 3 per cent, and the Reserve Bank Governor has indicated for the first time in my political career that we could push up the levels of growth in this nation for the first time beyond four per cent without getting the usual contraction within the balance of payments and the blow-out in interest rates which follows. So for the first time in 20-odd years we have this concurrence. When growth under those opposite got to over four per cent, we had record interest rates and we had record unemployment-all because they mismanaged the economy. They sent industries everywhere broke, they had the highest level of unemploymentMr Crean-How do you get 4Y2 per cent growth if they were going broke everywhere?",88
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will ignore the interjections of the member for Hotham.,89
198,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,In the period when this man was the minister we had a high level of unemployment-40 per cent of youth in Australia were forced out of employment. It was a disgraceful performance and you should be ashamed of yourself. The worse thing that has occurred for the industry is that recovery from that has taken so long. You burnt out industry in this nation. You have never understood what is necessary to develop an industry policy. Mr Crean-Go and ask them.,89
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Hotham; we do not need a running commentary.,89
200,Mr MOORE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You need a balanced budget, you need low interest rates, you need a low inflation rate, you need high levels of productivity, you need growth in GDP and you need to encourage and develop skills within the work force. The government is doing that. On top of that, we are moving the industry towards sectional policies-the motor car industry, the pharmaceutical area and in footwear, clothing and textiles. I have every reason to be confident that the TCF decision will be in the interests of the nation. Today's MPI is the usual huff and puff from the member for Hotham-nothing more than that. I am not surprised, when you are away for such a long time, that you come back here and miss the mark so easily. Mr Martin Ferguson-How long were you away? Mrs Crosio-Where did you go?",89
201,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the next speaker, I caution everybody in this chamber at present. Nobody has been sent out today, yet.",89
202,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Corio) (3.47 p.m.)After listening to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) dissertate on the coalition's industry policy, it is obvious to all in this chamber that there is a kangaroo loose in the top paddock. The opposition rests its case on industry policy. The industry minister of this country has spent five minutes dissertating on the internal affairs of the ALP and the winter recess. For five minutes he has gone into the intricacies of the contract between the previous government and DuPont. With three minutes to go, he tells us that the linchpin of the coalition's industry policy is a low interest rate regime, with a few other macro-economic variables thrown into the equation. It is very apparent froW the contribution of the industry minister to this debate that there is a very insidious disease that is eating away at the bowels of the Howard cabinet and spreading rapidly from the prime ministerial level into the other levels of the cabinet. This great country is currently suffering from a crisis in national leadership. This is not something that has developed overnight but has slowly eaten away at this government's credibility since it came to office-to the point where 1Y2 years into its term of government there is now a paralysis in very key and important national policy areas. Nowhere is it more pronounced than in the industry policy area. Nowhere are the effects of this being felt more than in the great textile, clothing and footwear industries of this nation. The simple fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has demonstrated weakness of leadership on too many occasions in too many areas. The industry policy area is one where his senior cabinet minister is demonstrating that weakness of leadership also. There is a paralysis, a crisis of confidence, which is now being reflected in public opinion and in enterprises and workplaces throughout the length and breadth of this country. The tragedy in all this is that Australia deserves better-better than it is getting from the Prime Minister and better than it is getting from its industry minister. It is not getting the national leadership it deserves from the Prime Minister in key areas of economic and social policy and it is not getting leadership from the industry minister in this very critical area of the Australian economy. The Prime Minister to date has shown extraordinary weakness in dealing with the Hanson debate, and that debate has impacted already on the future of Australian industry. We have yet to hear the strong statements from the Prime Minister on this particular matter and we have yet to hear any strong statements from the industry minister on the impacts of this on Australian industry. We have seen weakness of leadership from the Prime Minister on the stolen children report. All he had to do was come in here and put us on a new path by apologising to the Aboriginal people for what was foisted upon them in years gone by. He could not do that. On the issue of ministerial standards the Prime Minister has been found wanting also. In no other policy area is this lack of enforce- industry. ment of ministerial standards more apparent than in the industry policy portfolio. Both the senior minister, the industry minister, and the previous junior minister, the member for  for small business, were under a cloud on the issue of ministerial standards. The industry minister should have gone; the previous small  But it was only after we pushed the carcass and let it swing in the breeze for many months that the Prime Minister finally realised the damage being done to the confidence of small businesses and to larger businesses in this country by the ineffectual performance of his small business minister. He had to throw a sacrificial lamb-and the former small business minister was that. On this side of the House in 18 months we have got used to government from opposition. We have led the automotive industry debate in this country. The government picked up on the recommendations that we put before the Australian community regarding the automotive industry and its workers. We are saying to the government: you followed us on the automotive industry. Do not wait for the final report on textile, clothing and footwear. Send the industry a signal now because jobs are being lost. We must serid this industry a signal now. It is within the government's capacity to reject the major recommendations of this draft report and give some hope to the enterprises and the workers in those enterprises that it will come up with a policy setting that will guarantee investment and jobs. Labor's position on this industry is now very clear. We have said that we will freeze tariffs from the year 2000 to 2005. The Productivity Commission's position is very clear also. It wants to reduce all tariffs to five per cent by 2008 regardless of what our competitors do. Labor's position is very clear on the retention of the import credit scheme. We will do that. The Productivity Commission's position is clear. It wants it abolished by the year 2000. Labor has argued that we will conduct a further review of this industry in 2004. The Productivity . Commission has said that there will be no future review of this Our position, as we articulated with the automotive sector, will lead to an increase in investment and jobs in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The Productivity Commission in its own report says that 5000 jobs will be lost. There is a clear choice for the government. You can adopt Labor's plan and send some positive signals to this industry, or you can dither on with this draft report and send no signals and we will continue to suffer the job losses in this industry. The shadow minister, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), has alluded to the importance of the textile, clothing and footwear industries to the regional areas of this country. In the great state of Victoria, some 10 per cent of the enterprises involved in textile, clothing and footwear are located in regional areas. In my own electorate of Geelong there are 60 companies with a turnover of $440 million, paying wages and salaries of $100 million that go into other private businesses in Geelong. We have over 3,300 workers directly threatened by this report, with over 7,500 dependent on this industry. All major community groups in my electorate have rejected, as we have, the major recommendations of the textile, clothing and footwear report produced by the Productivity Commission: the Chamber of Commerce, the City of Greater Geelong, the Trades and Labour Council and the general community. But there is one person in Geelong and one person on the floor of this parliament who stands at odds with the total Geelong community-and he is in this chamber today-the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). He is the one member in this place who is prepared to betray the 3,300 workers and the additional 7,000 workers and put those families and their incomes at risk. This is the zero tariff man from the Hewson era, who still articulates that policy. This is the hypocritical member who gets his photo taken with the Geelong delegation for distribution in the community while arguing for the demise of the jobs that he is purporting to protect. There is no greater act of hypocrisy. You will wear this throughout the length and breadth of the Geelong region. There is much at stake in this debate. The honourable member for Hotham has drawn to the attention of this House the critical nature of this decision that the government is going to make. I make this plea to the Prime Minister: disregard the member for Corangamite. He is on his own in the Geelong community. There is too much at stake to follow the false prophets on this. Do the sensible thing. Take regard of this MPI and the sentiments that are expressed in this debate because they reflect the aspirations of the workers in this industry. (Time expired)",89
203,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a pleasure to be able to speak on this matter of public importance: The government's failure to provide job security for thousands of workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industries. I do not know what year that was written. It sounds like it was written in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 or 1994-all the way through up to 1996. That is when the MPI was written: the failure of the government-the ALP at that stage-to protect the TCF industries and all the other industries in this country. I have sat here and listened to two opposition speakers get up and bluster their way through the debate. Even though I find at a personal level the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) to be quite an agreeable individual, and we have had some good times at the football together, I would have thought that he and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) would have stood up here today and, rather than bluster, realised the importance of this situation. The 160 people in my electorate who will be affected by this decision certainly would not be taking any heart from the cheap political points that have been made today. They know that the tariff regime that we have now was created by the former government, not by this government. We have not had a final report yet. We have a draft report. We do not respond to draft reports. You never did. We will not be responding to draft reports. At the appropriate time we will make our decision. Let me say that as the federal member for Deakin, the electorate in which the DuPont manufacturing site is located, I regret DuPont's decision, announced on Tuesday evening, to partially close its Bayswater plant. I know that not all the 160 workers concerned will lose their jobs. Some of them will move across into the carpet division. But for those who do I regret the unfortunate nature of this decision and the impact it will have on their families and their future circumstances. However, most of those involved are highly skilled and motivated employees and I am sure that with this government's industry policy in place they will be able to secure employment elsewhere. It is a decision that we regret and as their federal member I am saddened by it. In the last three days in particular we have seen the Australian Labor Party going from one stunt to another. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) brought a bathrobe in yesterday it was purely and simply a stunt. Was a similar stunt performed in 1990? Was a similar stunt performed in 1987 when Button came down with his plan? Was a bathrobe from the TCF presented to then Prime Minister Bob Hawke? No, they could not talk to him. We have had the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, stand on the back of trucks and say, 'Here I am, I am supporting you guys. Tariffs, after all, are bad. You need to be protected.' One thing that I will not be doing is standing on the back of a truck and saying that tariffs are bad and then seven years later saying 'Hey, tariffs are good.' The flip-flop nature of the member for Hotham is simply indicative of what we have seen from other members of the opposition. They all seem to be changing their views based on whatever seems to be the most opportunistic situation at the time. It really has become a situation of policy by amnesia. I want to make sure that people at DuPont and elsewhere in the TCF industries realise what is happening. And it is not simply the 160 jobs. It is also those people at Berlei and now we find they are threatened over at Blundstone as well. Those people are operating in the current regime. The Labor Party claims that the coalition government has failed to provide job security. The insecurity has arisen because of concerns about the viability of the TCF industries. This did not start on 3 March 1996. It certainly did not. Rather, it is a product of 13 years of Labor government. They are playing cheap tricks and playing on the fears of the women and men in this country. People in my electorate will certainly see right through it. Let me give you an indication of that. In an article in the Australian of 26 August 1997 Glenn Milne, the chief political correspondent for the Seven network, stated: In October 1995, with the election looming, Beazley sang the praises of Labor's pro-competitive policies, stressing in an ""achievements document"" that these policies involved choices. ""The government did not have to deregulate the economy and open it up to international competition in response to globalisation of the world economy and the collapse of prices ... "" ""Labor could have turned its back on these challenges, raised tariffs, restricted competition in the financial sector, increased subsidies and isolated the country further as successive conservative governments have done. In doing so, Labor could have let Australians' living standards faIL"" What has changed since then? Once again it is a flip-flop situation. Well done to the Labor Party . Well done to the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in what they are trying to sell at the moment. In opposition it is easy to oppose for the sake of opposing. It is easy to complain and to say 'we have the answers and we have a plan.' Recent examples highlight Labor's failures. DuPont's closure of the apparel division in my electorate is an example of this. It took over the Bayswater plant in 1990. As has been already stated in this House, it was an agreement between the company and the Commonwealth. At the time the member for Hotham said, in a press release on 20 June 1990: Australia can play a central role in Du Pont's aggressive strategy to increase its presence in the Asia Pacific-region. But what have we seen this week? Where has the insecurity come from? Did Labor's actions and policies in government provide the security that Labor now demands? Mr Crean said in the same press release: In summary, Du Pont will make a considerable new investment yielding a much larger, more exportoriented business which will operate in a zerotariff, zero-bounty environment. If they have operated, why aren't they still operating? Mr Crean interjecting",91
204,Mr BARRESI,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oh, okay, we have a cutoff time. You can operate until here but you cannot operate after that. Labor's feeling is Throw money at them; throw another $40 million.' The only thing you create by throwing money at them is a false dawn for the workers at DuPont and the TCF industries. We all know that industry needs more than just simply money thrown at it. This government unlike the opposition, takes a multifaceted approach to helping industry. It is not simply a matter of throwing money. It is also a matter of addressing the other fundamentals that go with it. I say this for a reason. I spoke to DuPont. Yes, I spoke to the general managers and I spoke to John Foote, the Managing Director. In my conversations they certainly cite such things as the volume capacity in their industry. When you have a site that can produce only 5,000 tonnes compared with a similar site with a capacity for 50,000 tonnes in Taiwan it becomes a commercial decision. This decision by DuPont was purely commercial. To reiterate that, in a press release today Mr Foote said: Mr Foote reiterated that the announcement his nylon apparel assets by March 1998 was based on a major review of the company's nylon manufacturing capacity worldwide ... They took a global decision. Why did they do that? They did that because their customer base in this country has reduced. Why has the customer base in this country reduced? Because of the former Labor government's policy. Do not throw the problem onto us. Do not say it was our policy. If the marketplace has shrunk in this country it is due to your policies since 1987 under the Button plan. So I say to those workers, 'Send your letters to Crean. Ask for Crean's apology. Next time he stands on that truck and says, ''I'm with you, I'm here to protect you,"" you say, ""Apologise first for what you have done to our industry. Apologise for the fact that we only have two or three customers left in this country whereas in the past we had a lot more. Apologise for that."" , I look forward to DuPont succeeding and continuing in Australia. I look forward to their investments in their carpet division and the security it will give to the employees over in DuPont. But let us make sure that we do not get duped into believing that the only way to protect our TCF industries is by throwing money or by changing some of the rules. Let us look at taxation reforms. Support us in waterside reforms. Support us in terms of being able to ship products. Mr Tanner-What are you doing? You haven't done anything.",93

208,Mr JULL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the further amendments made by the Senate be agreed to. Earlier today the Senate decided not to insist on the amendments to which this House did not agree. While not insisting on its earlier amendments, the Senate did pass other amendments with the support of the government and the opposition. These amendments increased the number of below the line preference boxes for the territories, South Australia and Tasmania to nine. This will give voters in those areas some further scope to Australia before express preferences. On the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, it will allow for a different layout of candidates' names and group names on the ballot paper so that voters can more easily distinguish between groups and individual candidates on part A of the ballot paper dealing with above the line voting. It provides for overseas voting in this election in a manner similar to that applying in parliamentary elections, including the provision of voting facilities for electors in some 99 missions and embassies, and clarifies the parliament's intention that this bill provides for a voting system designed for the purpose of electing half of the delegates to the constitutional convention. I am pleased to announce that the government supports these amendments in this House, which will enable the government to deliver in full on its election commitment to the Australian people to debate the issue of the republic. The election for delegates will be held in November-December this year and the constitutional convention will be in the first half of 1998.",95
209,Mr LATHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Werriwa) (4.13 p.m.)Obviously the opposition is disappointed with the Senate message and the apparent outcome in this matter. It is disappointed on a number of levels. First, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has said that he wants to maximise participation in this process as Australia moves towards constitutional change yet now, by virtue of the establishment of a voluntary voting system by the Senate, millions of Australians will not participate lar process of election of delegates to the constitutional convention. The Prime Minister has said that he wants to maximise public confidence in the process, but how can anyone have full public confidence in a voting system that is voluntary and postal and thereby subject to possible abuse? We are going to see a ballot paper as long as your arm, a ballot paper that, for most Australian voters, will be rather confusing and rather unusual. So it is not possible to maximise public confidence in this process. What was wrong with having a voting system as per the normal method of election in Australian democratic process? I would have thought it was also disappointing for the Senate to pretend that this is not something of a precedent for voluntary voting in Australia. When is a precedent not a precedent? According to the Senate, apparently it is whenever Senator Harradine sanctimoniously rolls over on a matter such as this. In this particular regard, looking at the Senate motion, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and squawks like a duck, it is a duck. This is a precedent for voluntary voting in Australia. There is no doubt at all that at the conclusion of this process there will be members of the coalition, members of the federal government, pointing, in their assessment, to the virtue of voluntary voting and using this decision by the Senate as a precedent in that regard. For the Labor Party, at the end of this process, the republic and all it stands for, the cause of a republic in Australia, is bigger than the process. The cause of establishing an Australian head of state who is an Australian citizen is bigger than these questions of process. The coalition would appreciate-and I know the minister would understand thisthat the promise of a constitutional convention started out with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) trying to take the republic off his agenda prior !n the last federal election. This started out (.., a diversion, a political tactic, developed b'- the coalition to paper over the divisions in -; own ranks. It still stands as nothing mo --dible than a political tactic in this particuin that rega For the average Australian, they want a head of state who is one of us. They do not take for a moment the talk of the monarchists that the Governor General is somehow our head of state. There is one clear proof of the absurdity of that claim. If the Queen were to arrive in Australia tomorrow, who would be our head of state? If the Queen were to arrive in Australia tomorrow, she would be the head of state. The claims of people like the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and his colleague the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) that the Governor General is our head of state is clearly outside the Australian constitution and the practical impact of what happens when they are both in the country at the same time. The Queen of England is Australia's head of state, and that of course is something that is not tolerable for the average Australian. That has been the pOSItive issue in this debate that the Labor Party has always put. We just want a head of state who is one of us. We want a head of state who is an Australian citizen. The republic in that regard is inevitable. The constitutional convention and this voting process are clearly flawed, and I would have thought that with regard to all of these matters members would need to look no further than the Melbourne Age of 13 August and the following report: As the Princess of Wales frolics on a yacht in the Mediterranean with her new lover and the Prince of Wales showers his old one with baubles on her jubilee, the British are starting to think that monarchy is enough. For the first time, support for the royal family has fallen below 50 per cent in an ICM poll published in the Guardian newspaper, and those still backing the House of Windsor are getting older. Asked in Britain would they be better off or worse off without a royal family, only 48 per cent said worse off. That compares with 70 per cent five years ago and 77 per cent 10 years ago. That shows the absurdity of messing around with constitutional conventions at a time when the British people themselves are declaring no confidence in the royal family, this inappropriate institution for the 1990s. How foolish and backward does it make Australia look to be messing around with a constitutional convention when clearly the Australian people should be moving forward, by way of plebiscite and referendum, towards the republic. The Australian people, in my assessment, have had enough of Di and Dodi shows, Chucky and Camilla and all the high jinks of the latest generation of the royals. It is an inappropriate institution carrying all the worse features of hereditary privilege and class distinction in our society. It is not our institution; it is a British institution which the British people themselves have rapidly lost confidence in in recent times. No wonder they have done that, and we should heed that advice and move on to the republic as soon as possible. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA The following bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or request: Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Bill 1996 Carriage of Goods by Sea Amendment Bill 1997 NA Public Works Committee Report",96
210,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the eighth report of the committee for 1997 relating to enough the proposed development of infrastructure on the Bradshaw Field Training Area, near Timber Creek, Northern Territory. Ordered that the report be printed.",97
211,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of infrastructure on the Bradshaw Field Training Area, near Timber Creek, Northern Territory. Bradshaw Station is an 871,000 hectare pastoral station which was purchased by Defence in February 1996 as a training area for the Army's 1st Brigade. The property is about 600 kilometres by road from Darwin along the Stuart and Victoria Highways, and about 285 kilometres from Katherine in the east and 230 kilometres from Kununurra to the west. It is a huge property, about four times the size of the ACT. In terms of distances, the property is 150 kilometres east to west and 70 kilometres north to south. The 1st Brigade is currently being relocated to increase the defence presence in northern Australia. The relocation will be completed by the year 2000. New facilities for the brigade are being provided under the $530 million Army Presence in the North project at Robertson Barracks, about 20 kilometres east of Darwin. This project was previously examined and reported on by the committee. The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of: a bridge over the Victoria River in the vicinity of Timber Creek; working accommodation for the range control organisation; living and working accommodation for the range managers; communications facilities; an internal road network; two 500-person camps; vehicle crossing points over creeks and rivers; two C-130 capable airfields; and vehicle wash points. The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $53.66 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed. The closest large training area used by the army in the Northern Territory is the Mount Bundey training area. This is located 120 kilometres south-east of Darwin and comprises 114,000 hectares. Whilst twice the size of the Puckapunyal range, its size is inadequate for the 1st Brigade to manoeuvre and undertake live firing. For this reason, Defence acquired Bradshaw. The infrastructure on Bradshaw is limited and intended only to support the operation of a remote cattle property. The committee concluded that the Bradshaw property lacks the necessary infrastructure to enable training at brigade strength to be undertaken and that there is a need to develop the necessary infrastructure to allow subunits, units and formations to conduct collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre activities. After defining user requirements for the property, Defence examined a series of development alternatives. These ranged from a 'do nothing' approach to full infrastructure development. Bearing in mind that 1st Brigade will be totally relocated to Darwin by 2000, the committee agreed with Defence that the most appropriate alternative would be full infrastructure development comprising access and training support facilities to meet Defence requirements. The committee concluded that the proposed facilities will provide the infrastructure to permit and support cost-effective and realistic training for Australian Defence Force units stationed or deployed for training in the The infrastructure to be provided is necessary to ensure the long-term operational and environmental viability of the Bradshaw Field Training Area as a manoeuvre and live fire training area. The report briefly mentions the Defence record in the environmental management of its training areas. For example, the restoration of the seriously degraded Puckapunyal Training Area in Victoria which has taken place over three decades has, according to Defence, produced a remarkable result. Puckapunyal was formerly seriously degraded by previous grazing, heavy traffic and constant use during the Second World War. The area is now recognised as a model of restoration and environmental management and the committee commends Defence for its environmental management policies. The Northern Territory government expressed strong support for the proposal at the public hearing and in a written submission. The government commended Defence in being transparent and consultative in its planning and development processes. As part of its inquiry, the committee convened a public meeting at Timber Creek. It was evident to everyone that the proposed development has the strong support of the local community. There will be economic benefits to be derived from the construction works, which are planned to extend over 42 months. Some of the works will be of a suitable size and nature to attract tenders from local trades and builders. Initial investigations by Defence indicate that the expected nature and frequency of usage of the training area will provide some benefits through increases in commodity consumption as a result of troop deployments into the area. Period contracts for the supply of commodities such as fuel and foodstuffs will be let competitively. This report should have been delivered by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), but his appointment as the Chief Government Whip means that he has had to resign not only from the position of chairman of the committee but also from the committee itself. Let me, on behalf of the committee, put north. on record his work on the Public Works Committee over many years and, in particular, the exemplary way in which he led the Public Works Committee during its 18 or so months under his chairmanship. The committee wishes him well in his new position. He will be sorely missed on the Public Works Committee. I commend the report to the House. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT (FAMILY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",97
212,Mr HARDGRAVE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997 is a very important bill which gives effect to a number of measures announced in the last two budgets and a number of non-budget measures which will assist in more effective and efficient social security administration and, importantly, facilitate the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance which forms part of the government's seven-point strategy to improve the rate of child immunisation in Australia. I would like to deal with the general matters of the bill first-they are very important issues-but then deal in the main in my contribution today with the immunisation agenda. Firstly, to a matter which I have had to deal with on a number of occasions as the member for Moreton on behalf of the people in my electorate-it is a simple measure which the previous government ignored and which this Howard government is fixing-namely, under current arrangements, family payments above a minimum rate can be paid for up to 13 weeks when one or both parents go overseas temporarily, providing the child stays in Australia. However, if the child goes overseas, family payment above the minimum rate is not paid and families currently receive only the minimum rate of family payment. This can certainly cause a family financial stress. It is a silly law, and it is now being changed as a result of this bill. It will provide a greater deal of certainty for those in my electorate and all around the country who may leave the nation temporarily. Another 1997-98 budget measure included in this bill will allow the better targeting of family payment and maternity allowance to those in need. As qualification for a maternity allowance is based on qualification for family payment, those families who do not receive family payment because of this initiative will also not qualify for maternity allowance. A number of non-budget measures included in this bill are aimed at ensuring more equitable and efficient delivery of services to families. A number of other non-budget measures included in this bill deal with disability related payments. Two such measures provide for the introduction of revised impairment tables for disability support pension and the subsuming of the disability wag- supplement into a disability support penSIOn. As I said, I would like to deal in particular with a very important issue, particularly in Queensland at the moment, where there is eVIdence of 145 cases of whooping cough at the moment. The issue I want to deal with is the matter of the immunisation of our nation's children. This bill provides for a key part of the government's seven-point strategy to improve our quite appalling immunisation record in recent years by the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance. This allowance will be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 who, having reached 18 months of age, have received age appropriate immunisation up to that stage, unless the child is otherwise exempt from that particular requirement. This new maternity immunisation allowance of $200 will be payable in addition to the maternity allowance of $750 payable following the birth of such a child. This allowance will also be paid in addition to the maternity allowance in respect of stillborn children or children who die before reaching 18 months of age. A maternity allowance-currently $870.30-will continue to be payable following the birth of a child who is born on or after 1 February 1996 but before 1 January 1998. I am sure all in this place would agreeand certainly judging by the debate to this stage it is the case all in this place would agree with this proposal-it is a carrot to those who have perhaps believed they cannot afford to immunise their children. It may not encourage those who quite irresponsibly exercise some philosophical belief they should not immunise their children and that these particular diseases immunisation is designed to eradicate are no longer a problem here in Australia-but, quite simply, in Queensland at the moment we know 145 children are coughing and spluttering and shaking and hurting because of whooping cough. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you have seen the television advertisements currently showing on the television, which is another part of the government strategy to boost immunisation numbers, I am sure you would agree whooping cough is a horrible ailment. As a father of two, it really does upset me to think some parents could have, for quite erroneous reasons, failed to immunise their children and allowed them to contract this disease. Perhaps worse, their failure to immunise their own children has meant other children have contracted these diseases-others who may not have originally been the carriers of a disease but have caught it through the obvious means kids catch things. I really do question the common sense of some of those who can afford to immunise and yet choose not to, and all too often, as I said, the penalty for failing to is a cost borne by innocent children. Some believe diseases like diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough just simply do not exist in Australia and, because we are our island state, these diseases are now eradicated. I heard the honourable member for Longman (Mr Brough) contribute the story about his own father, whom I have known for a long time. To know the honourable member's father was a childhood polio sufferer, I can certainly understand and empathise with the member's desire to never allow his own children or those who are close to him to ever suffer what his own father has. If parents choose not to immunise, I believe we should see some sort of penalty paid by these parents towards the additional cost of health care borne by the general community. Let us face it: children who do contract these diseases require so much support and so much help, and they are getting support and help in Queensland hospitals at the moment, yet this is borne out of the basic health system which we all contribute to as taxpayers. It disappoints me to think that evidence of the decline in the level of immunisation has been very obvious for almost a decade in this country and the previous government did not respond and did not do anything, but I do not want to tarnish the support coming from the other side by criticising them for their past mistakes. I praise them for their support for this measure, and I think it is best to move on from today and into the future rather than harp on the past. Some in this place might think it is an unusual generosity, but I will extend it nevertheless. As I said, the epidemic of whooping cough in Queensland is one which health authorities are dealing with and coping with. The Queensland Minister for Health, Mike Horan, says it is an epidemic and a real worry to all parents of young children. I know someone who is about to give birth over the next few days to a child and I am sure the people close to this person must be thinking very much so about what sort of an environment the child is being born into and how important immunisation is. I have recently distributed to my electorate a special report about immunisation which folds into a wall chart so parents can map the growth of their child, and also it provides quality information and prompts on when it is an appropriate time to immunise and also a record of the immunisation. In the process of delivering this to child-care centres, pharmacies and doctors in my electorate, a number of child-care centre operators said, in one case, none of their children were not immunised; in another, a couple were; and, in a few others, perhaps a dozen or so were. They also shared my concern for those who were not and the potential effect they had on the general community. Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria. It is spread by coughing or sneezing. It affects the air passages and it can cause difficulty breathing. The cough can last for months and permanent brain and long-term lung damage can result. Around one in every 200 children under six who actually catch whooping cough will die. It is most serious amongst babies under 12 months. There have been 145 cases of whooping cough notified to the Queensland health authorities since July. This is 45 per cent above the figure for the same time last year. The July average for previous cases was about 101 cases. The only protection against whooping cough is to immunise against it. Last year 4,000 children around Australia had whooping cough and four died, 500 had measles and 2,500 had german measles. All those four who died were from New South Wales. People have perhaps forgotten what the children with these diseases go through and what the long-term results can be for the children, their parents and the broader community. Whooping cough is particularly horrible for a child and its family watching the child go through coughing spasms-sometimes vomiting-and the young child's contorted face as they try to find air. In the end-and it could last as long as eight months-a child could have permanent brain damage or lung damage, all because a parent did not get their child immunised. As for measles, one in 25 children who develop measles will develop pneumonia, one in 2,000 will get inflammation of the brain, one in 2,500 will get permanent brain damage and one in 25,000 will die. The disease is preventable. There are arguments against immunisation, but the arguments are viable only for a few, and then there are alternatives. One woman recounted to me she knew of a child who had suffered a side effect from immunisation. I thought she must know a lot of children, because the odds of knowing a child who has actually suffered as a result of immunisation are very big indeed. I submit the actions of parents, being in untold way quite selfish by not preventing something which could be very painful, have long-term effects on their own children. No more than 70 per cent of children under two years in Australia are properly immunised at the moment and 30 per cent of our childrenone in three-are not. In 1989-90 the ABS survey suggested only 53 per cent of our children were fully immunised; almost half were not. So there is a generation of Australian children who were not properly protected in the way I know my parents made sure I was and, I am sure, all honourable members in this place have made sure their children have been. We certainly cannot continue to tolerate a situation any more where children are going through pain and agony and some are dying due to not being immunised from something that is quite simply preventable. I myself have two children. I certainly would not put my children, or want anyone to put them, through the agony and the possibility of disastrous long-term health effects if it is at all preventable. Surely no parent would want this to happen to their children. But it is happening in too many instances because of an attitude of complacency of 'I'll do it next week' or due to a lack of education. Parents are putting at risk not only their own children but also other children by not immunising. In 1996 those four children who died of whooping cough in New South Wales all picked it up from other children. So who takes responsibility for this? Education is certainly an important issue. Australians have a lack of awareness about the effects of the disease, what children should be immunised against and when-and parents obviously need to be re-educated. It is for this reason I and I know a lot of other government members have put out an immunisation wall chart around our electorates-to prompt parents in a very simple and straightforward way. No more important an issue there is than our children, and in particular the health of our children. They are our future. They are our responsibility. We in this place need to make responsible decisions for them-and for an their parents, it seems-so our children are guaranteed a healthy and secure future. New eligibility requirements will also be introduced through this bill for a number of other matters relating to the child-care cash rebate, which I will come back to in a moment. In the end, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you look at Australia's very low rate of immunisation, you have to ask yourself: what is different about Australia? Why is it here in Australia, compared with other Western countries, immunisation rates are so low? One of the key areas of difference is because Australia has no one personal body responsible for seeing immunisation is complete, and the medical profession has long had this responsibility. The government is very, very serious about this matter, and I am hoping doctors around Australia will play their part in checking to make sure their patients are properly immunised. The government will be assisting them with this. What I found a little astonishing was, as we circulated this particular wall chart I have produced, some doctors in my electorate refused to take it. I would certainly like to think doctors would like to be a little more responsible. I will not name the doctors, but I would like to think they would be a lot more responsible for the care of their patients by making available what basically is straightforward, simple and easy to understand, easy to read information. Doctors really do have to play their part and assume some responsibility for the immunisation status of the children they see. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), in his contribution, in his announcement of the seven-point strategy earlier this year, forecast the use of Medicare data and the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register information just to let medical practitioners know which of their patients are not appropriately immunised. It is not a case of Big Brother; there is no new patient register; there is no need to change the information which is already available. But the information is there. Doctors should be consulting it. Doctors should be then taking it up on a oneto-one basis with parents to make sure parents are actually fulfilling their obligations to children and the community. The government certainly wants to encourage doctors to help obtain higher immunisation rates. In fact, we need at least 90 per cent of children to be immunised, and doctors get to see children on a very regular basis each and every year. I do not think it would surprise anyone to know most children get to see their doctor six or seven times a year on average. Doctors do have a vital role to play. In fact, this particular doctor based approach has been very successful in overseas countries. The current media education campaign targets both the immunisation providers-the doctors-and the general public. The campaign is impacting; it has some dreadful and very graphic depictions of the results of not immunising. Hopefully, those people who do not know what whooping cough, measles and rubella do to a child will now understand a little better because those as certainly do help set the record straight. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services for his personal crusade on this particular matter, and I applaud the government in general for following through on his initiative in the form of this bill, which provides this additional incentive to parents to immunise. They will get the proceeds from this bill, providing they actually do immunise their children. The government will also be working with states and territories to try to implement consistent school entry requirements to ensure parents submit details of their children's immunisation history upon enrolment. As I have said, we do not need 100 per cent of children immunised to stop epidemics, but we certainly do need 90 per cent of children immunised to stop epidemics here in Australia-epidemics like the one which is happening in Queensland; epidemics which do a lot of damage to a lot of innocent Australians. These are people who cannot fight for themselves and need their parents-and it seems their parents need their government to prompt them-to act. It is just so hard to believe we are actually having a debate on immunisation in this their country; that we have actually had to go to the expense of providing an incentive of a couple of hundred dollars, as detailed in this bill, to parents to get them to look after their children. It is extraordinary we have reached this poor level of immunisation here in Australia. Surely we could again have a more fully immunised nation of children. It is interesting to note-in light of comments from some people who come to this place from time to time and make contributions about disease and migrants coming to Australia--{)ur neighbours, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and China, actually do a substantially improved job on the matter of immunisation to the job we do. Immigrants face exacting health scrutiny before being allowed into Australia. In light of this, in light of the facts we have before us, and in light of this bill we have, it is certainly most likely the case 'imported Australians' are more likely to be without some of the diseases we have here in Australia which some born in Australia are now contracting. This bill is very important because of the immunisation matters alone. It is doing something practical about our national immunisation record. In the closing stages of my contribution, I would like briefly to address one matter which I prefaced before: there will be new eligibility requirements introduced for the recipients of child-care assistance or the childcare cash rebate. For the 100,000 parents enrolling their children in child care for the first time this year, there will be a requirement to provide proof of age appropriate immunisation in order for those benefits to be paid. All in all, the role the government has played in picking up some of the mistakes of the recent past and in addressing the complacency that has developed because traditionally Australia has been able to rid our nation and our nation's children of so many diseases is a good one and an important one. This bill is very important. It is a very important debate we are having. I commend the bill and its contents to the House.",99
213,Mr LINDSAY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Herbert) (4.46 p.m.)While there are perhaps eight people in the public gallery this afternoon, I would like to recognise the many thousands of people who might be listening to this parliament across Australia. I am the member for Herbert and I represent Australia's largest tropical city which is Townsville. In speaking to this bill today, I would like to say that when I was four years old I contracted whooping cough. It was quite a difficult situation because it was at a time when I had my tonsils and adenoids out. My mum and dad told me that in contracting that I almost lost my life because I almost bled to death. In those days-and I am only 22 years of age at this stage-there was not a remedy for whooping cough, but now there is no excuse for that to happen. Mr Hardgrave-He is misleading the House, I think.",103
214,Mr LINDSAY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Sorry, perhaps I did mislead the House. I am a little older than 22. Earlier this month the Sydney Morning Herald reported that a four-month old baby boy had become the fifth infant to die from whooping cough this year. Sadly this boy, according to the media reports, was only two months away from being immune to the disease and tragically almost certainly contracted whooping cough from another non-immunised child. The same was the case with the child featured in the immunise Australia television campaign. Again, seven-week-old Nathaniel Eason, an innocent child too young to be immunised, contracted the disease from another non-immunised child. I have not yet met one single person who has not been moved by the ad, where young Nathaniel struggles to breathe as he coughs violently. As a parent, I admit that I was shocked by the ad. You hear about the effects of whooping cough and yet, when you actually see what it can do to an innocent child, you really appreciate how terrible it is. Young Nathaniel was lucky: he survived. But this year in New South Wales alone five children have not. Like many government MPs and opposition members, I have been busy trying to raise public awareness, certainly in Townsville and Thuringowa, about the need to have our children fully immunised and to protect them from preventable diseases such as whooping cough and measles, as the member for Moreton (Mr Hardgrave) has pointed out. Early indications are that the immunisation education campaign is having a very positive effect on immunisation awareness and on immunisation levels in Townsville and Thuringowa. Doctors and health workers have reported to me a sharp rise in the number of parents checking to see whether their child's immunisation records are up to date and bringing their children into be immunised. The rise in awareness has coincided with the government's launch of the immunise Australia campaign. The material that has been released in this campaign has been widely and warmly accepted in the Australian community. While this early success is very welcome, Australia's immunisation record will be something that we are all going to have to work at consistently over a number of years. While the ad campaign featuring the young baby afflicted with whooping cough has been successful in Herbert, it is only one part of the wider government approach to lifting Australia's immunisation levels. There is also to be a restructuring of the maternity allowance for parents of newborn children to provide a bonus for ensuring that their child's immunisation coverage is complete. There is to be linking of child-care assistance and child-care cash rebates to a child's immunisation status. There are to be offers of financial incentives to medical practitioners as part of the better practice program to obtain high immunisation levels. These are just some of the other features of the government's immunisation plan. This bill provides for the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance to be payable in respect of children born on or after 1 January 1998 and who, having reached 18 months of age, have received age appropriate immunisation up to that stage. An additional $68 will be provided to parents, taking the maternity allowance from an estimated $882 to $950 per eligible child. The maternity allowance is also to be made in two payments of $750 at birth and $200 at 18 months. These immunisation changes are welcome, and they are an attack on childhood preventable diseases. They are good for our children and our families, they are good for Townsville and Thuringowa communities, and they are good for Australia. Everyone would be aware of the phrase 'prevention is better than cure' . Immunisation sums up that saying perfectly. The cost of lifting Australia's immunisation levels back up to acceptable levels is insignificant in relation to the lives it will save every year. The cost of the program is insignificant in relation to the economic savings that will be achieved in preventing children from falling ill in the first place. With fewer children contracting diseases requiring medical attention, pressure will be eased on our hospitals and medical systems. The amount of money we invest now in our children's health and well-being-in raising the public awareness about the need to have our children fully immunised-will be repaid in spades in the future. This bill also seeks to make a number of other changes in relation to social security assistance payments, such as family payments, maternity and parenting allowances, and disability support payments. I would like to address the amendments to the disability support pension components first. One of the changes relates to the provision of a revised cash impairment table in determining a person's eligibility for the disability support pension. I note the earlier attempt to revise the impairment table and the fact that it has been taken back to a committee of medical experts for a second look, and I think rightly so. While I am in favour of trying to get and encourage people with disabilities to get off welfare support and into the work force, I am mindful of some of the sometimes precarious positions disabled people find themselves in. It is not always easy for people with disabilities or impairments, be they major or minor, to find employment. There is a whole raft of reasons why that might be so. Not being an expert myself in this matter, I will respect the opinion of the medical experts and the disability and welfare groups that the government consulted in reaching the amendments being proposed today in relation to the impairment table. At the same time, I would encourage members to keep an eye on the matter and ensure that people edged out of the disability support system are given the ready access to other support measures and assistance in finding employment that they need. There is often a fine line between the level of physical or psychiatric impairment required for support being approved or not being approved. It may be a fine line for those who administer the system, but it can also be an enormous chasm for those affected by the scale and system that we set. Having said that, I am glad the system will be changed from a percentage to a points system. My office staff has encountered a high level of constituent confusion or misunderstanding in relation to the 20 per cent impairment scale that has been previously used in relation to individuals. Any change that enhances public understanding of a particular measure is certainly worthy of merit. Another change contained in this bill that is worthy of merit is with respect to the lodgement of social security claims via phone, fax or computer. This is a minor change, but as we all move further and further into the electronic age it is certainly one that is welcome. It ensures that certain payments can be backdated to when people contact the department verbally-for example, via the phoneand then come in a short time after to fill out the necessary application forms. In cases where people are having trouble getting to DSS offices in person, due to them being sick or perhaps incapacitated, aged or frail, this change can be seen only as fair and equitable. This bill also contains measures in relation to rent assistance for people paying rent for living in public housing-a situation that is not quite so fair and equitable. Honourable members would realise that rent assistance is not paid to people living in public housing. Public housing tenants already receive subsidised accommodation from the state and territory governments. However, as the explanatory memorandum to the bill points out, the situation exists where rent assistance may be paid to people who are paying rent for living in public housing. Some people have suggested that in such cases people are effectively getting a double subsidy--cheap rent, with rent assistance on top of that. Certainly that could be one perception. Another could be that a small number of people are trying to capitalise on the subsidised accommodation that the various governments provide in the first place. Whatever the view, I support the decision to remove rent assistance entitlements for people who pay rent for living in premises for which a public housing tenant receives subsidised accommodation. Once again, the opposition is adopting a position of saying, 'Well, we sat on our hands for 13 years, but now that the coalition is in office we want everything fixed with the wave of a magic wand.' The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), who is here, offered no solutions in government and she is offering no solutions now. This amendment is not preventing public housing tenants from subleasing space to another person, be they family or friend. This amendment is about equity. I reject the assertions made earlier in this debate by the honourable member for Jagajaga. There is another section to this bill also dealing with rent assistance but in relation to the family payment. A few problems have been identified with the family measures act, which changes to this bill seek to redress. The amendments will restore some people's entitlement to rent assistance as an adjunct to their family payment, an entitlement that was lost when certain changes were implemented at the beginning of this year. Other amendments will also be made to tighten areas where rent assistance payment could be claimed but should never have been allowed. I will not dwell on these technical changes other than to say that these changes are just. If unintended changes have occurred, they should be corrected. This bill addresses quite a number of other amendments, but I do not intend to go into those at this time. I do support the amendments contained in this bill and, in particular, I support the changes being introduced in relation to the government's immunise Australia program.",103
215,Mrs JOHNSTON,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Canning) (4.57 p.m.)Although the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill 1997 seeks to address various measures on matters relating to social security and veterans' affairs, I wish to limit myself today to debating the benefits of those amendments as listed under schedules 1 and 6 of this bill. Schedule 1 deals with maternity allowances and schedule 6 relates to the provision of family payment when either children or parents are overseas. We all know that children are our future. We also know that as a responsible and caring parent there are certain actions which must be taken in order to ensure that the children are looked after in terms of their safety and well-being. Some of the decisions we make as parents are not always easy but often must be made in the best long-term interest of our children's welfare. Immunisation is just one such example. The fact that children are still dying from preventable diseases in Australia today is extraordinary. As a mother and a former nurse, I find it appalling that only 53 per cent of Australia's under six-year-olds are fully immunised. This is a national disgrace. Surveys have indicated that around 98 per cent of Australian parents support immunising their children, but why has this not transferred into reality? Part of the reason must lie with the members opposite who, for the last decade or so, led this country. The fact that only 53 per cent of children under six in this country are immunised is partly due to Labor's past failure to adequately inform Australian families of the dangers children in particular are exposed to as well as a failure to introduce policy incentives that foster a change in attitude. The fact that so few children have been immunised is another sad legacy of how the previous Labor government failed to deliver real benefits to families. The coalition government believes that the health and well-being of our children is a national concern. This is why we have taken the decisive steps to combat the recurrence of preventable illnesses. Overcoming the current complacency through targeted education campaigns is one such measure introduced last February by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) as part of 'Immunise Australiathe seven point plan'. Another measure is to provide families with real incentives in the form of a maternity immunisation allowance, as set down in this amendment bill, so as to encourage full immunisation from life threatening infectious diseases. At a 1971 seminar on immunisation, F.e. Robbins made this comment: It is generally recognised that immunisation is one of the best and most effective investments which a government can make in the health of its citizens. Schedule 1 of this bill lays the groundwork for such an investment through the introduction of a maternity immunisation allowance. It will be payable to children born on or after 1 January 1998. It is an additional payment to the current maternity allowance, which is payable on the birth of a child. So what does this mean in real figures? It means that a payment of $750 will be made on the birth of a child, whilst a further $200 will be made available at the age of 18 months after it can be demonstrated that the child has received the set down immunisation. Some people may argue and say that a monetary incentive is unreasonable or, indeed, not necessary. They may argue and say that it is the sole responsibility of the parents and not the government to ensure the immunisation of their children. In a perfect world we would not have to resort to a carrot and stick method of such financial inducement to ensure that our children's health is protected. But reality is quick to remind us that we do not live in a perfect world. It has, indeed, been widely recognised that children from economically disadvantaged families have low immunisation rates. Thus, the introduction of the maternity immunisation allowance may well act as a real incentive to these people to ensure their child's protection from preventable diseases is complete. 'Immunise Australia-the seven point plan' acknowledges the role of practitioners and school nurses in improving the current unacceptable level of immunisation. General practitioners provide 60 per cent of all immunisations and, therefore, playa pivotal role in ensuring that their young patients are fully vaccinated from preventable diseases. This they can add to by advising expecting mothers of the provisions of schedule 1, which will be applicable in January 1998. The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register has been introduced to assign responsibility to general practitioners for each child's immunisation status. The register has been designed so as to maximise accuracy and identify those not picked up on a national basis. In addition, some states-namely, New South Wales, Victoria, and the ACT-have school entry requirements which insist parents submit details of their child's immunisation history. Indeed, I know that when I had my children, which is almost 30 years ago, that was also the case in Western Australia. I would encourage my counterparts in Western Australia to reintroduce this measure. In the overwhelming majority of cases, vaccines are far safer than the diseases. they aim to prevent. However, as with all other health care intervention techniques, immunisation is not entirely risk free. Immunisation may also be opposed by some people on religious grounds. It is for these reasons that we have made provisions for parents who, even after being fully informed of the obvious benefits of immunisation, put forth a compelling justification to conscientiously object. Nevertheless, the overarching message the government is conveying to families throughout schedule 1 of this amendment is that immunisation has the power to save lives and prevent serious illness. Many of us would have seen the television advertisement which, as part of the immunisation education campaign, shows footage of a small baby suffering from whooping cough. The ad is a disturbing but extremely powerful reminder of the tragedy that can occur from failure to immunise. Parents who do not fully immunise their children not only put their own children at risk but also put other children in serious danger of contracting a preventable disease, and the government has a duty to do all in its power to protect its people. Immunisation protects, therefore, not only our own children but increases the overall level of immunity in our community, hence reducing any further spread of infection. Illnesses such as rubella, smallpox and diphtheria may seem uncommon in Australia these days but they have previously been killers on a very large scale. It is not uncommon for a virus to wipe out more people over a relatively short period than a world war battle. As Winston Churchill said: Science, now so largely perverted to destruction must raise its glittering shield not only over the children but over the mothers, not only over the family but over the home ... The longer you look back the longer you look forward: the wider the span, the longer the continuity. I would now like to comment briefly on schedule 6 of this bill. Schedule 6 seeks to amend the provision of family payments to parents and children when travelling overseas. The coalition government gave a pre-election commitment to get a better deal for families. This amendment is yet another example of how we, the government, follow through on our promises. Currently, if a parent receiving above the minimum rate of family payment leaves the country temporarily, their level of benefit remains the same up to a period of 13 weeks, given that the child remains in Australia. If the parent stays out of the country for longer than 13 weeks, their family payment is reduced to the minimum rate. If the child accompanies the parent or otherwise leaves the country for educational, family, sporting or medical purposes, their family payment automatically falls to the minimum rate. This policy obviously has drawbacks for families wishing to travel together or for children who must leave the country temporarily to seek medical treatments or perhaps take part in school or sporting events. Schedule 6 of this bill will now allow for the minimum rate of family payment to be made available if the recipient parent or child travels overseas temporarily up to a period of eight weeks. Affected families, as of 1 January 1998, will be able to travel on short trips overseas with their whole family or send their children away to visit their non-custodial parent without suffering financial drawbacks, as experienced under the current system. Schedules 1 and 6 of this bill give Australian families a helping hand, the kind of helping hand Labor failed to offer during its 13 years in office. Our children's health and well-being are paramount not only to their parents and families but also for the future of this great country of ours. There is absolutely nothing more precious than being in good health, and measures such as those discussed today in the amendment bill before us go a long way to encouraging a fit, active and prosperous nation. I commend this bill to the House. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

216,Mr SLIPPER,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Fisher) (5.15 p.m.)Speaking on the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill this afternoon at this time is an unexpected pleasure, as the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was indeed intended to be speaking and I was the third speaker on this bill. I certainly did not anticipate that we would be getting to it on Thursday afternoon. The government is, however, very keen to facilitate a debate in relation to the Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill. The government is determined to ensure that the tribunal operates in an appropriate way, and therefore this bill makes certain changes with respect to the appointment of the registrar of the tribunal. At the present time, the appointment of the existing registrar has expired and the government is in the process of looking at replacement appointments. The bill includes certain criteria which the government will take into account when considering the appointment of a new person to this very important position. The government is on record as recognising the concept of native title. This government accepts the decision of the High Court in the Mabo case and also has given its response to the Wik decision of the High Court brought down earlier this year. So this government is on record as recognising the rights of indigenous people, but it also believes that other sectors of the community have important rights which ought to be enshrined in the law of Australia. The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 includes a number of matters and there are two principal amendments in the bill. The first government amendment removes the requirement for the registrar to be admitted to legal practice for five years; rather, a registrar would have to be legally qualified, and that is certainly very important. The government also believes that it is important that registrars have experience 1997 in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies, or the law, or administration or any other class of activity seen as being relevant to the duties of the registrar. Proposed amendments to the Native Title Act will remove the need for the registrar to apply an acceptance test to native title claims. Although a new registration test will be applied, and hence legal qualifications are necessary, it is no longer necessary to have the same level of legal experience. Qualification provisions for appointment of registrars in other federal courts and tribunals do not require an applicant to be admitted and practising for a period of five years. Traditionally, of course, the requirement for appointment and practice for a period of five years is something which has existed in a wide range of legislation, yet the government in introducing this legislation is updating the law and in doing so is recognising that, while it is very important that a registrar have an understanding of the law and be admitted to practice, there is no magic in the period of five years of law practice. What the government will do when looking at appointing a replacement registrar for the tribunal is consider a whole range of activities, the whole range of experience, the whole range of abilities which will benefit the registrar native title tribunal area. The second government amendment provides further clarification of when a member of the tribunal is considered to have a conflict of interest. It expands on the existing section 122 in the Native Title Act. It relates majority recommendation 9 of the report on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 by Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title. The amendment will mean that memadopting bers, except where the parties agree, will be eligible to participate in any proceedings where they are or have been employed or engaged as a consultant in the previous 12 months. This amendment will address commakes munity concerns that tribunal members are and are seen to be impartial, but it is flexible enough to allow people experienced in native title matters to be appointed to the National Native Title Tribunal. It is important that everyone who has an interest in native title, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, pastoralists and miners, is in fact confident in the stanment, dard of treatment handed out by the tribunal. I believe that the amendments being made the government in the qualifications of sons eligible for appointment as registrar will move very strongly in the right will make sure that the entire Australian community can have confidence in the ability, capacity and competence of the person who from time to time is appointed as registrar. There is absolutely no truth in any suggeshas tion that the government's amendments may matters be criticised as downgrading the position registrar. Given the changes in the role of the National Native Title Tribunal, it is appropristate ate to review the qualifications of the tribunal to allow a more diverse group of applicants to be considered for the position. In other words, this government is determined to make Peninsula. sure that we have members and registrars of merit. What we aim to do is to have the best possible people doing the job so that the Australian community will feel that they have value for money. It is without doubt that there are some in the Australian community who have expressed very great concern over native title and over in the the way the whole debate has gone. This is why this government is absolutely determined to ensure that we have integrity in the system. This is why this government is bringing in this legislation to ensure that we will be able to select from a wide range of applicants for to the this very important position. Some might also suggest that the second the amendment included in the bill before the House today could be criticised for not the full text of recommendation 9 not which would mean that a member, often appointed on a part-time basis, could not continue to have any involvement in native title matters once appointed. The government no apology whatsoever for saying that we believe that this would be too restrictive and it would make it almost impossible to attract people with the most appropriate and relevant experience to the National Native Title Tribunal as members. This is quite a small piece of legislation before the parliament. Unlike many of the bills introduced by the former Labor governit seems to have only two pages. It is a very clear and concise bill, with two parts. by We hope that we receive the endorsement not peronly of this chamber but also of the other place. I am very pleased to urge this House to direction and support this bill.",108
217,Mr WILTON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"It seems to me that the submission put by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) smacks of some hypocrisy, given the fact that his party no integrity whatsoever when it comes to that go to native title. Clearly the 10of point plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is discredited. It is discredited within my own of Victoria and, having recently visited Queensland, it is discredited amongst many sectors of the population in the northern part of that state, particularly on the Cape York The Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill allows for the appointment of an acting registrar of the Native Title Tribunal and to expand the range of persons eligible for appointment as presidential members of the tribunal. We oppose it for a number of reasons. One is the fact that we consider that there are already registrars of merit and that this bill does nothing to ensure that registrars as contended by the previous speaker are, indeed, registrars of merit. The bill also contains two amendments to the Native Title Act 1993. Clause 1 of schedule 1 allows the President of the Native Title Tribunal to appoint an acting registrar for a period of up to 12 months. Clause 2 of schedule 1 broadens the qualification for appointment of presidential members of the tribunal to include persons who have been legally qualified for five years.  idea.",109
218,Mr WILTON,NA TIVE TITLE AMENDMENT,"Indeed, as the member for Chifley has put to me quite lucidly and succinctly in his interjection, that might not be such a good idea. I may go at some length, at least for the next four minutes, into outlining why that is not necessarily such a good idea. The government's current attacks on the tribunal, and the intention to downgrade its responsibilities through the establishment of so-called state based tribunals, raises serious questions about its commitment to the native title process. In this context we would contend that it is largely inappropriate to downgrade the role of the tribunal by allowing a person who is indeed not a judge to be its president. With those remarks I conclude my submission. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mrs Moylan) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.  to raise a case involving a constituent of mine whom I will call Sandra Smith, a postal worker. Sandra had a joint account at the St Marys branch of the Commonwealth Bank and was in the habit of having her salary and wages paid into that account. Apparently a payment was made on 17 March into that joint account she had with her husband which was duplicated on 27 March without either the bank or Sandra realising there had been a double payment. Sandra subsequently closed the account but still had a savings account at the same branch. On 1 August-some four months after the double payment-the bank took out of Sandra's passbook account the amount of $200 but did not notify her of the error and did not seek her concurrence to any action. In pursuing these matters on behalf of my constituent, I have to say that my staff have been constantly challenged by the bank as to why in the first place we would make inquiries on her behalf and why we would seek to obtain any redress on her behalf. I must say that I find the approach of some of those banking officials quite offensive. I do not care whether it is the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac or a Commonwealth department, I see my duty as standing up for my constituents in all cases. This case has a number of serious issues. Do banks, if they have made a mistake, have the right without a customer's permission to automatically debit an active account where a mistake has occurred in the closed account? I do not believe that they should have the right, even if they do on past banking practice. I know that the Banking Ombudsmannot so much interested in this case-is completely impotent in making recommendations to change legislation to ensure that my constituent should have been notified. There is another serious element to this case: that is, when my constituent, having noticed that $200 had been debited to her passbook account, asked the bank to send her details of her banking record, all her details were faxed to a third party. This is a gross breach of privacy and a very current and Banking topical issue. There is no provision for citizens dealing with private corporations such as banks to have their records treated privately. There is no redress in this matter. We do not have a privacy commissioner to ensure that privacy is respected and enforced, the way we do for Commonwealth departments and organisations. I am pleased to say that I have written to the Commonwealth Bank and they have apologised to my constituent. They had no right whatsoever to do what they did. They claim that all the things that I complained about reflected breaches of bank policy. All I have to say is that, if the Commonwealth Bank do have a policy surrounding these matters to protect their clients and customers, then they are showing precious little evidence that this policy is being enforced by their staff. I have a number of other issues concerning my constituents and the banks. I hope that I will have the opportunity in a subsequent adjournment speech to raise these issues. I want to conclude by saying that it is absolutely outrageous that a bank can take out money for a mistake it made in the first place without notifying a customer. The issue is not that they should not be entitled to the money but that my constituent should have been informed and asked for permission to withdraw this money or should have been requested to make a sensible repayment schedule. After all, not too many of my constituents can afford to have an unexpected $200 whacked out of their account without notice. Politicians",110
219,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"Recent headlines on what expenses politicians do and do not claim, how much they are paid and how much they work have done little good to the reputation of our profession. It is no secret that politicians as a whole from any side of politics rate alongside used car salesmen in popularity surveys. These are statistics which, I am told, offend used car salesmen in my electorate, who never thought that they were that bad. The reputation of a profession, both in the negative and the positive, is acquired over the course of years, if not centuries. So whatever steps are put in place to salvage what remains of our reputation would be seen by many as too little, too late. That is a shame because I have come across many politicians from both sides of the House who are good people. They work much harder than they have to and they got into this business thinking that they could do some good for their country. The reputation of these politicians matters to me. That is why I commend the initiative of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) to create a more transparent and streamlined system to deal with politicians' entitlements. It is an area in which we not only must be honest but also must be seen to be honest. The minister's reforms address that very issue. For too long the system has been kind to those who abused it, with people who were elected to act honestly betraying the trust of the people of their electorates or states and behaving in ways which brought little credit to any of us. It is clearly of great embarrassment to all good members, to their families and friends and to all those who know them to be honest and hard working to see them associated with the antics of dishonesty of a few unscrupulous politicians. I know that many of us 'recent arrivals' to parliament resent being tarred with the same brush as those who have shown a total lack of respect for the institutions of this country. My party has always done everything in its power to deal with the issue of less than honest conduct of a party member and we will continue to address the debate over the declining esteem in which all politicians are held by the Australian public. These are issues that concern backbenchers greatly. We are the ones who almost every sitting week look up into the public galleries and see our constituents looking down-often entire schools on their once in a lifetime visit to the nation's capital. These are people who, if inspired by the work of a dignified and hard working local member, may themselves go on and achieve great things in the name of Australian democracy but who, if disappointed, may choose not to make that valuable contribution. Although I support and encourage the media in its endeavour to expose dishonest behaviour among politicians, we all know that recent articles and television reports have damaged all politicians greatly. The school children from my electorate who visit my office believe what they hear and see about us. To be honest, they are never particularly impressed by our parliamentary behaviour either. They often ask me why we shout and argue so much. I often find it hard to come up with the answers. Some of my colleagues would say that it is all part of a robust democratic debate but I honestly think we can do better. In terms of the honesty of members of parliament, I feel that a greater level of transparency is an important point of departure. If our communities come to understand how much we earn and the hours we work, I feel they may be slightly less hostile towards our profession. As a backbencher I earn $81,170 a year, on which I pay over $34,000 in tax and contribute in part to the running of the car. Backbenchers are provided with an electorate allowance which they are expected to spend entirely on their electorate and cover major expenses incurred in running their electorate office. In my case, the entire amount is spent on the electorate. I do not use it to supplement my wages. I choose to bring such issues to the attention of the House for three reasons. First, to clear up the misconception that all politicians earn $150,000-plus. We do not. Second, to state that not all politicians rort the system. Many of them have put their electorates before anything else. Third, to say that my work as a politician is based on a sense of pride that comes from serving my community and all of the people in the electorate of Gilmore. Under the changes suggested by Minister Jull, hopefully such public clarifications will not be necessary. They will in fact become mandatory. I support such measures wholeheartedly but I am also of the belief that parliamentarians care about their reputations and careers more than rules and regulations. They realise that all it would take is one instance of abuse to bring all of their political ambitions crashing down. Exposure of all fraud may be in itself the harshest penalty around. Y outhsafe Campaign",111
220,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"During the winter break, I was pleased to host the western Sydney launch of the Youthsafe campaign in my electorate office in Blacktown. The launch was attended by representatives from the Labor Council of NSW, the CFMEU, the Western Sydney Youthsafe Committee members, and students from local high schools. Youthsafe grew out of a national campaign run by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission called Worksafe. This campaign was launched with the slogan: 'Don't let your first day be your worse day'. The reason for this campaign was to create a culture change amongst young workers and to highlight their awareness about workplace safety. This campaign was extremely successful but was discontinued after the change of government. The Labour Council of New South Wales recognised the enormous potential of this campaign and therefore decided to continue to promote workplace safety issues to young people by establishing a youth occupational health and safety committee called Youthsafe. The committee is made up of young people from a diverse range of industries, such as apprentices, nurses, building and construction workers, clerical workers, unions, representatives of the financial sector and also high schools and university students. The major aim of the committee is to raise awareness about workplace safety amongst young people who will be entering the workplace. The launch was to help achieve this aim in western Sydney. The Labour Council of New South Wales has received great support for this initiative, including a sponsorship from Multiplex Constructions. I have been supplied with case studies of young people who have been killed at work. There was the case of an apprentice plumber who was killed while another was badly injured when they fell seven metres to the ground after a mobile scaffolding collapse. There was the case of a 22-year-old labourer controlling traffic who was run down and killed. There was the case of a 17-year-old apprentice who was electrocuted while working alone. There was the case of a 16-year-old apprentice cabinet maker who was crushed by pineboard sheets that fell on him. Australia wide workplace fatalities among 15to 24year-old workers for the most recently reported years are: 1991-92,46; 1992-93,24; 199394,47; and 1994-95,49. But any person who has worked in industry does not have to rely on recorded cases; we can recall our own experiences. I experienced my first industrial accident while I was at school at St Benedict's, Broadway, Sydney, which was a technical school. It happened in the metalwork room. Two silly students started a sword fight with files. One file flew out of the handle and hit the other student's mouth, knocking his two front teeth so far back that he had to go to the dental hospital at Broadway to have them removed. When I got home, my mother was ropeable because her 14-year-old son had lost his two front teeth. Unfortunately, there was a sadder case than my own personal experience. While I was a union official responsible for apprentices in the railway, a similar accident occurred but on this occasion the tang of the file pierced the apprentice's neck and he died. So we just cannot be too careful, and industrial safety must commence at school. I would like to congratulate the following people and groups-the Labour Council of New South Wales and, in particular, Mary Yaager, the council's occupational health and safety and workers compensation coordinator; Rebel Hanlon, a member of the AMWU and the western Sydney representative on the Youthsafe committee; Brad Parker, the education officer with the CFMEU; as well as various industry groups including Multiplexfor promoting workplace safety among young workers. Politicians Alice Springs-Darwin Rail Link",112
221,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak tonight on the Alice Springs-Darwin rail link, but first I will make a few observations on the comments made by the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) on the public perception of politicians. It was only in March last year that, as a nurse in the area of aged care, my public approval rating was 86 per cent. I note that we have the member for Adelaide, Ms Trish Worth, here in the House too whose public approval rating before she got elected in 1993 would also have been 86 per cent. It is a very hard thing to do in one day-go from 86 per cent public approval rating for your occupation in nursing to less than that of a used car salesman. I would also like to comment on the public perception of wages. We do earn $81,000 gross a year but our net wages are roughly $832 clear per week, and I would have to say that I know many colleagues, as well as myself, who work very hard, often from 7.30 in the morning to 11 o'clock at night seven days a week-not five but seven days a week. It was my son's 11th birthday on Tuesday in Adelaide-happy birthday, Graham-but I was here doing my duty for my country as a federal member of parliament so I was not able to be with my family. But it is a sacrifice that I gladly make to serve. Having said all of that, in the first decade after Federation Australia was in the process of nation building. The old debates between the various colonies were being settled or postponed for later years, and the words of our first Prime Minister rang true as we became 'one people, one destiny'. Eleven years after Federation, South Australia was given a promise by the federal government for the building of the north-south railway linking Adelaide to Darwin. This was in compensation for the cession of the northern part of what had been South Australia and which then became the Northern Territory. The potential benefits from a north-south railway were recognised even in 1911. Eighty-six years later, I had the honour of being present when our Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that finally the Alice Springs-Darwin rail link would be built. He was joined in the announcement by the South Australian Premier, John Olsen, who has a bulldog determination to fight for projects and job opportunities for the people of his state, as well as the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Shane Stone. The response to the announcement in South Australia, particularly in my electorate of Makin, has been overwhelming. South Australians know how important this project is for the future economic well-being of our state. They know it means jobs-jobs for their husbands and wives and jobs for their children. They also know that for 13 long years South Australia got nothing from the federal Labor government led by Hawke and Keating. For 13 years, we were treated with contempt by arrogant Labor leaders. The Alice SpringsDarwin rail link had no chance of being constructed while the likes of Beazley, Keating and Gareth Evans ever had any say in the matter. The only way it could be built was to remove them from office, and that is exactly what the people did. The Prime Minister announced that $ 100 million would be provided by the federal government to assist in the construction of the rail link. The South Australian and Northern Territory governments will each provide a further $ 100 million for the project and the remaining funds will come from private sector involvement. The South Australian Premier has already announced the formation of the AustralAsia Railway Corporation board, which will oversee the submission process for the rail link. is estimated that the rail link will create than 2,000 jobs in the construction phase of the project and 200 jobs when in operation. It will provide our mining industry with further opportunities to expand, and has already led to an increasing confidence among the people of South Australia. As we move towards the beginning of the next millennium, what greater project could there be but to link our continent from north to south with a railway line that cuts right through the centre of Australia, providing us with a gateway into Asia? The future is before us and, thanks to this government and the Liberal governments of South Australia and the Northern Territory, that future is looking brighter. On behalf of the people of my electorate of Makin, I thank the Prime Minister, Premier Olsen and Chief Minister Stone for their commitment to this project. Let history record that it took Liberal and Country-Liberal governments led by men with such tenacity and foresight to bring this nation building project finally to fruition. Unfair Dismissal",113
222,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Barton) (5.46 p.m.)I rise to express my concern at the fact that small business are being misled by the government into thinking that a bill passed by this House will quarantine them from actions for unlawful dismissal. That is not the case. All that will happen is that a simple and straightforward procedure which focuses on conciliation will be replaced by much more complicated, complex and expensive procedures. For instance, clearly employees have had and continue to have their common law rights to seek damages for wrongful dismissal. There are a number of cases in which quite significant damages have been awarded, for example, Gregory v. Philip Morris, Wheeler v. Philip Morris and Giorgevski's case. Indeed, there is an increasing phenomenon, primarily in the United Kingdom courts, where the courts are being prepared to imply an obligation of good faith in any contractual relationship, including an employment relaIt tionship. They are determining that dismissing more someone without complying with the principles of procedural fairness is a breach of that implied obligation of good faith and are awarding damages. The damages that they are awarding are not restricted to the 26 weeks which is contained in the Workplace Relations Act but they are awarding damages on an open-ended basis, including things such as, for instance, nervous distress and psychological conditions arising from the real stress that can occur in losing one's livelihood. So small business, instead of facing the prospect-in my experience very rarely if ever awarded-of 26 weeks, will face, as a result of this government's actions, prospects of much greater awards of damages. In addition, quite clearly the common law courts have the power to award specific performance of contracts of employment. For example, Lumley v. Wagner and Hill v. Parsons are famous cases where that has been done. That is the common law situation. In terms of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia, the court has jurisdiction under section 178 to penalise an employer who breaches an award or an agreement. As part of that enforcement mechanism, under the Federal Court's original jurisdiction they have the power to grant injunctive relief to prevent a breach of award occurring. That is again effectively ordering reinstatement in enjoining an employer from breaching an award obligation where it precludes unfair dismissal. Further, the Federal Court of Australia quite clearly has an accrued jurisdiction, and again we have specific authority in the case of Turner v. the Miners Federation, where the court literally awarded specific performance of Mr Turner's contract of employment with Elcom-again, effectively the remedy of reinstatement. In addition to those individual remedies, unions still have their general dispute notification capabilities under section 170HA of the act, specifically preserved even in the case of unfair dismissal. One can recall the complicated and complex litigation-indeed, in each case, litigation which went up to the High Court of Australia-in the Ranger Uranium case, the Wooldumpers case and the Vista Paper Products case, where the High Court found that an appropriately worded dispute notification established the capability of the commission to award reinstatement. All these remedies are horrifically complex, horrifically expensive and horrifically time consuming. But what small business now faces, if the government succeeds in having its bill passed, is this complex and expensive route rather than a simple, straightforward and conciliatory route which exists in the current Workplace Relations Act provisions. Sri Lanka: Tamils",114
223,Mr ZAMMIT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the Australian nation a genocide occurring not far from our shores. I refer to the slow genocide that is happening in Sri Lanka aimed at the Tamil people. I have a sizeable Tamil community in my electorate and I have been watching the situation closely for the past 13 or 14 years, and all I can say is that what is happening there is a blight on humanity. The latest thing that has occurred that I have to bring to the attention of this House and of the Australian nation is the deliberate bombings and indiscriminate shellings by the Sri Lankan armed forces. The latest carnage occurred on 15 August, when two Sri Lanka Kfir bombers attacked a Catholic church, killing nine people, including a four-year-old child, and wounding 15. In addition to that, on 9 July 1995 the Sri Lankan government bombed a Catholic church in Navaly, killing 120 civilians. On 22 September 1995 Sri Lankan Puccara aircraft bombed a school in the village of Nagar Kovil, killing over 40 people, including 25 children. On these occasions, as well as the one on 15 August 1997, the killing was deliberate. I have a statement here issued in 1997. The source is the Tamil Centre for Human Rights reports to the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Geneva. These are official figures of human rights violations of Tamil civilians by the present Sri Lankan government over a period of approximately 2% years. They are as follows: Disappearances 759 Summary executions of Tamils 1330 Innocent Tamils injured 2332 Tamil women raped by Sri Lankan security forces 33 Arbitrary detention of Tamils 14,953 I want to read into the record a statement issued by Amnesty International. I am a member of Amnesty International and I know many members of this House are also longtime members. This statement was issued very recently by the international secretariat from the United Kingdom. They say: The level of ""disappearances"" in Sri Lanka has hit a new high, Amnesty International warned as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights examined the country's human rights record. Coinciding with the Sri Lankan Government's pledge at the Commission that ""full rigours of the law will be brought to bear"" on the perpetrators of human rights violations, Amnesty International submitted more than 400 cases of ""disappearances"" to President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga urging her to bring those responsible to justice. Since the security forces regained control over the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka between late 1995 and early 1997, the total number of ""disappearances"" reported to the organization has reached 648-the highest number since 1990. ""That more than 600 ""disappearances"" can occur in one year despite the government's claim that it is addressing the problem is outrageous. This highlights the need for action too be taken now-to prevent these violations from continuing,"" Amnesty International said. There is a clear pattern of the security forces resorting to ""disappearances"" in reprisal on the security forces by members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In one incident which occurred on 19 July 1996, the day after the LTTE attacked the Mullaitivu army camp, at least 40 young men ""disappeared"" after they were rounded up by army personnel in Kaithady and surrounding villages in the Thennamarachchi Division. They were allegedly taken to Navatkuli army camp but when relatives went to make inquiries, they were not given any information. Amnesty International fears that they may have been massacred. There is a lot more I want to say about this issue, but I call on the Sri Lankan government to respect the human rights of all individuals, to respect the right that humans have to be treated as decent people and as decent humans in our society and their society as well. They have a responsibility to humanity, and these indiscriminate bombings of individuals who are innocent and not part of any war should be stopped and outlawed immediately by the world community. I call on the Sri Lankan government to allow the Tamil people of Sri Lanka the right to self-determination.  I am pleased to rise to talk about a case I have had about banking. It concerns Lionel Tipping, a constituent of mine, who was a 30year long customer of Westpac. If I described Lionel as a battler, he would not be offended. In fact I think it is a badge of honour that I should describe him so. A casual worker, Lionel was in receipt of a disability allowance on behalf of his daughter. He was notified in writing by the Department of Social Security that they believed they had overpaid him. Lionel, naturally, panicked about this and sought the best means possible of trying to refute the department's assertions in the letter. He rushed down to his local Westpac branch and sought to get statements of his account. It is not disputed that he was advised that these statements would cost $7 each. He went home, relieved, knowing that the bank would get those statements to him and, in due course, he would have the proof that he needed to dispute the Department of Social Security's claim. As it turned out, the department made a mistake. He was for attacks not overpaid at all. However, a problem arose in that the cost of the statements that were sent to him amounted to, from memory, about $196. Lionel did not have that sort of money to pay the bank-certainly not in his account. And I must say I find the bank providing Lionel with an overdraft to meet these charges reprehensible. I think Westpac has acted illegally. I do not believe they were legally and validly correct in merely advising Lionel that the statements were going to cost $7 each. Under the national credit laws, they are required to say not only how much it was going to cost per statement but what the totality of the cost of the statements was going to be. The bank, quite graciously I suppose, admits that they did not disclose the number of statements that would be involved-that is, the total cost. The bank offered to waive half the charges, provided Lionel would not, through me, go to the papers. I am pleased to report to the House that I have succeeded in having all those charges wiped. But I certainly encourBanking age Faye Lo Po, the Minister for Consumer Affairs in the New South Wales government, to have her officers investigate this matter and even bring legal charges. It is quite clear to me, in the two cases that I have mentioned today, that either the banks are acting outside the law and need to be prosecuted or customers need to be protected by way of much more rigorous legislation to protect their rights and interests. It is true that I contacted the Banking Ombudsman about this matter. I can only report that I found the Ombudsman's advice quite unsatisfactory. I believe I obtained far more benefit for my constituent than was ever going to be possible by contacting this lame duck Ombudsman. These cases are coming through my door. I invite all my constituents not to put up with their treatment from the banks but to please contact me. I will take up their cases. On the Notice Paper today I have two notices of motion. One is seeking a parliamentary inquiry into the operation and effectiveness of the Banking Ombudsman.",115

The risk with this protocol-indeed, with are perhaps less concerned about humanitarian these kinds of weapons if they could gain access protocol. So countries that have a more responsible exposure of their troops or their people in chosen not to use. So, in a sense, many countries mechanism by saying that they are prepared use it when the time comes. There is also no absolute ban under protocol the use of blinding laser weapons.

It is undertaken in the case of de facto relationships is another area of concern. But what concerns me most is the fact that, government to beefing up the family unit as education in our community, there are aspects weakening substantially the opportunity for paedophile behaviour. I can give you a few examples from my recently. Amongst some more recent ones was from home. They met up with some youths live at their place, which was like an open who was seeing a number of men.

The interesting thing was that, notwithstanding missing immediately, the police could not tell would not act to bring these girls back considered that to be entirely reprehensible. the family and community services department coalition government, I might add, in its second the act which it has responsibility for administering.

The other problem is: what does the government has responded to a range of recommendations cases they have agreed to them.

It is not a very nice of us who have had some responsibilities and abrogated those responsibilities by not being in recent days, the extent of this problem and, actual nature of it, which Justice Wood spelt interviews. I think he was not able to say NA 7354 graphically enough some of the horrific presented on this particular activity. But the point, in relation to Queensland, that: The existence of a hard-core group of some 300 active concern. That has to be an understatement.

One of is the fear of relocation. A shopping centre there for a very long time and say, 'We are if I have to, I have to.' The manager then says, that is the decision.' Then the shopkeeper asks, 'We're going to move you around the back, 'But no-one will know where we will be,' and finally asks, 'What about the fit-outs?' and to have to pay for the fit-outs as well.' and in m<'.ny instances it virtually destroys shop from where they are known to another place NA 7368 MAIN COMMITTEE where they are not known and which is perhaps money to do up the shop to the satisfaction I feel that this is a very important step that difficulties involved in running a small business. here are very sensible and moderate, and businesses tremendously.

There will not be the threat Main Committee adjourned at 1.34 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Census Data: Public Inquiry (Question No. 1679) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 May] 997: Has he commenced, or undertaken to consider, a public inquiry into the preservation of census data; if so, (a) what will be the inquiry's terms of reference and (b) what is the anticipated role of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the inquiry. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. I have referred the matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. (a) The terms of reference are as follows: The Committee shall look at the current practice of destroying name-identified forms collected in population censuses and make recommendations for future censuses taking into account: (i) the effect retention would have on the quality, and hence the value, of data from future censuses and other ABS collections; (ii) the privacy concerns relating to the storage and use of name-identified census data; (iii) the value of name-identified records for medical, social and genealogical research released after a significant period; and (iv) the cost of retention. (b) The Australian Bureau of Statistics will make a submission to the Committee. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1734) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: How many aborted landings have occurred at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (a) each year since 1992 and (b) in the period 1 January to 26 May 1997. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) 1992-247; 1993-271; 1994-313; 1995289; 1996-293. (b) In the period 1 January to 26 May 1997, 116. NA Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1735) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: Have air traffic controllers employed at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (KSA) complained about the current operating system at KSA; if so, (a) who made the complaint, (b) when was the complaint or complaints made and (c) what was the nature of the complaint or complaints. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c) Airservices Australia advises that the introduction of new Air Traffic Control procedures is undertaken in the context of discussions with Airservices operating staff. Expressions of concern from staff are dealt with immediately in this context by Air Traffic Control management. Accordingly, consolidated records are not kept on the date and nature of complaints or name of complainants. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1736) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: Has the Australian International Pilots Association complained about the current operating system at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; if so, (a) when was the complaint made and (b) what was the nature of the complaint. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes, on 7 March 1997. (b) Use of the east-west runway in cross-wind conditions up to 25 knots. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1738) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: Has his attention been drawn to a letter from Captain M. Glynn to the Sydney Morning Herald, dated 22 April 1997, in which Captain Glynn expressed concern that the duty runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport on 20 April 1997 was the east-west runway in circumstances when the wind was straight down the north-south runway; if so, has he taken steps to investigate the complaints of Captain Glynn; if so, what. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The noise abatement procedures applicable at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport require the nomination of a preferred runway in accordance with specified criteria. Airservices Australia advises that, although on 20 April 1997 there was a southerly wind, the preferred runway was the east-west and the weather conditions permitted its nomination by Air Traffic Control. If the pilot had determined that, for safety reasons, the east-west runway was unsuitable then the longer north-south runway would have been available for the aircraft's operation. Surrendered Firearms Payments (Question No. 1743) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How long is it taking to facilitate payments to persons who have surrendered firearms in each State. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Officers of my Department have consulted with the Coordinators of the buyback scheme in each jurisdiction, who have provided the following advice. Australian Capital Territory Firearms identified in the Commonwealth Government's Firearms Price List (""the Price List"") are grouped together in batches of 50 and forwarded to the appropriate area for despatch of compensation cheques. The average time from date of surrender to receipt of cheque is 21 days, however some cheques have been received within 7 days. A firearm not identified in the Price List is placed in store for valuation. An independent valuer, from Sydney, travels to Canberra each month to identify and value firearms. The average turn around time is between 4-7 weeks, depending on the time the firearm was surrendered in the cycle. These firearms account for approximately 20% of all firearms surrendered. New South Wales Payment for firearms surrendered at Police stations is received in approximately 21 days. Firearms owners surrendering firearms at mobile centres receive payment on the spot for firearms identified in the Price List. If a firearm is required to be identified and valued, payment is received in approximately 21 days. Northern Territory All payments in Darwin and Alice Springs are made at the time of surrender. At other centres, payment is made by mail within five days from the receipt of the valuation in Darwin. Queensland At collection centres: Firearm owners surrendering firearms identified in the Price List receive a cheque at the time of surrender. A firearm owner surrendering a firearm not identified in the Price List, but who is able to produce a valuation from a licensed dealer at that time, will receive a cheque on the spot if the Valuation Panel agrees to the dealer's valuation. If the owner does not have a dealer valuation, the gun is valued by the Valuation Panel and a cheque is issued within 21 days. At Police Stations: Firearm owners handing in firearms to a Police Station in Queensland may wait a maximum of 6 weeks for payment. South Australia Buyback scheme ceased on 28 February 1997. Tasmania At urban centres, owners surrendering firearms identified in the Price List receive a cheque at the time of surrender. At regional centres, firearms owners receive a cheque within 14 days. Firearms owners surrendering firearms that are require to be identified and valued will receive a cheque within 21 days. Victoria Firearm owners surrendering firearms identified in the Price List receive a cheque at the time of surrender. If a firearm is required to be identified and valued by the Valuation Panel, the individual attends the valuation and if price is agreed, receives a cheque at that time. Western Australia Compensation payments in Western Australia are forwarded to gun owners within six weeks. The average is approximately 28 days. Employment Placement Enterprises (Question No. 1790) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 3 June 1997: (1) What funding will be available to service successful Employment Placement Enterprises (EPEs) in the Blacktown City Council local government area. (2) When will successful EPE tenderers in the Blacktown local government area be announced. (3) Will more than one EPE be approved in the Blacktown area. (4) Will financial assistance be offered to EPEs in the form of advances to help with startup costs; if so, will the assistance be comparable to that provided to Public Employment Placement Enterprises (PEPEs). (5) How many clients were handled by the Blacktown Commonwealth Employment Service in (a) 1995-96 and (b) 1996-97. (6) Will residents of the electoral division of Greenway be disadvantaged financially if they use the services of an EPE rather than a PEPE; if not, why not. (7) Will the dual system disadvantage residents of the electoral division of Greenway; if not, why not. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) Services to be provided under the new employment services market are subject to competitive public tender. The levels of funding available to particular regions will not be known until the tendering process is completed and business levels allocated to successful tenderers. The following principles have been established to assist in allocatEmployment ing contract levels to providers: competition, client choice and diversity; value for money; and coverage for as many job seekers in the market as possible, and full regional coverage for all apprenticeships and traineeships. (2) It is expected that successful tenderers will be formally notified of the outcomes of the employment services tender in January 1998. (3) One of the aims of the employment services market is to provide client choice. Wherever possible, therefore, the Department will contract at least five providers in each region with the tion of numbers in excess of this in metropolitan centres. (4) Advance payments will not be offered to employment services providers. The Government announced in the 1996-97 Budget that approximately $180 million will be provided to the Public Employment Placement Enterprise (PEPE) Limited as a capital injection to establish the PEPE and enable it to tender as the public provider of employment placement services. In part, these funds will pay for the staff liabilities that the PEPE will inherit upon its establishment. These funds will also balance the PEPE's beginning Balance Sheet which is necessary for any commercial entity. These funds are not available to be used as operating subsidies. (5) The number of clients registered with the Blacktown Commonwealth Employment Service was 24,253 in 1995-96 and 21,978 in 1996-97. The number represents the sum of the number of clients registered at the start of each year and the numbers of new registrations during the year. (6) No. All contracted providers-public, private or community based-will be subject to the same contractual conditions with respect to client servicing and clients will be able to choose which provider they wish to be assisted by (where feasible). (7) No. The Government is not establishing a dual system for employment services. It is establishing a more effective delivery of employment services which will be client driven. Clients will benefit from higher standards of service, more flexible and tailored assistance and ultimately better and more lasting employment outcomes. Eligible job seekers will be able to nominate their preferred service provider from those under contract and with available capacity in the locality. If the client is dissatisfied with the employment services being provided to them, the person will be able to lodge a complaint with the Employment Secretary. A complaint may be investigated by the Secretary or, if more appropriate, it may be referred for investigation by the CEO of the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, the Ombudsman, the Privacy Commissioner or the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Australian Defence Force: Grievance Procedures (Question No. 1813) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (l) How many redress of grievance matters are expecta- pending in the Australian Defence Force. (2) How many matters referred to in part (1) have been under consideration for more than (a) 3 months, (b) 6 months, (c) 9 months and (d) a year. (3) What was the average time for completion of cases launched in (a) 1995 and (b) the first 6 months of 1996. Mrs Bishop-In accordance with advice to me the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Data on the number of redresses of grievance pending throughout the Australian Defence Force is not maintained. However, data is maintained on the number of redresses of grievance which have been referred to the Chiefs of the Navy, Army, Air Force, the Chief of the Defence Force, or their delegates, for resolution. On 1 August 1997 there were 132 redresses being investigated, or awaiting investigation on behalf of a Chief of Service or the Chief of the Defence Force. (2) Of the above redresses of grievance: (a) 22 have been under consideration for more than 3 months, (b) 21 have been under consideration for more than 6 months, (c) 22 have been under consideration for more than 9 months, and (d) 21 have been under consideration for more than a year. (3) It would be misleading to place an average time on the completion of redresses of grievance. Each case is an individual case with its own particular set of circumstances. Data on the length of time each case took to be completed is held on each individual case file and is not kept separately. To retrieve this data would require a physical search of all redress files and I am not prepared to commit further resources for this task. Commercial Television: Cricket Coverage (Question No. 1823) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the situation where the commercial television network which has the exclusive television rights to the 1997 Ashes Test series in England will not televise the match live during certain peak viewing hours in some States. (2) Is it a fact that no other free to air or pay television provider has rights to televise the matchUK es when the network concerned will not televise the matches. (3) Are Western Australian viewers effectively denied access to almost half of each day's play. (4) Is the network involved paying for the right not to have the match televised during peak times in Western Australia; if so, is the practice anticompetitive. (5) Do Australian sports followers have expectations that they should be able to view events like the Ashes series one way or another; if so, is the action of the network inconsistent with those expectations. (6) Will the Minister approach the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission or another responsible authority to investigate the matter. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am aware that the Nine Network, which has the exclusive free-to-air rights to the Ashes Tour, is not routinely providing live coverage of the first session of the test series in any State, and is providing a shorter coverage in Western Australia on some nights. Nine has announced that, in the event of a likely result during the first session of play, it will make every effort to arrange live coverage of that session. (2) No. The Nine Network has offered the ABC and the SBS free-to-air rights to the first session of each test match in the Ashes series, but both broadcasters declined the offer. Due to the clash with the Wimbledon Tennis finals, Nine assigned to the ABC the rights to the Third Test. The ABC televised the second and third sessions of each day's play, except for the final day, on which it televised the first session because of the likely conclusion of the match during that session which, in fact, occurred. Nine has sold pay TV rights to Optus Vision, which is providing live coverage of the first sessions of the test matches and 'delayed' coverage of the second and third sessions on its pay TV service. (3) The Nine Network has advised that, in Perth, it is showing the third session of the test matches on Thursday, Sunday and Monday, and on Friday and Saturday, it is showing the second and third sessions of the matches. (4--6) The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has ongoing responsibility for monitoring business behaviour to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, including in relation to any anti-competitive practices. The coverage of the current Ashes series in the points to deficiencies in the operation of the anti-siphoning provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The rules as they stand do not focus on maximising free-to-air coverage of events covered by the anti-siphoning regime. The Government is reviewing the current antisiphoning arrangements with a view to ensuring that live rights to listed events continue to be available to free-to-air broadcasters. At the same time, possible measures are being examined to provide an incentive for free-to-air broadcasters to exercise rights acquired, and hence maximise television coverage of listed events available free to the general public. Reforms being examined include the possibility of separating free-to-air and pay TV rights to listed events, and providing for free-to-air rights not exercised to be offered to other free-to-air broadcasters. The interests of viewers, sporting groups and broadcasters are being taken into account. It is anticipated that the amending legislation will be introduced in the 1997 Spring Sittings of Parliament, and is expected to win the support of all major parties. Charter of Budget Honesty (Question No. 1825) Mr MCClelland asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 June 1997: Will the Charter of Budget Honesty have (a) a connection between the Government's fiscal standing and the delivery of election promises and (b) provisions for it to be judicially enforceable; if not, why not. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Charter will make governments more accountable for the conduct of fiscal policy by increasing Parliamentary and public awareness of the Government's fiscal objectives and fiscal performance. Therefore, the focus of the Charter is on all policies that impact on fiscal policy, not only policies formulated prior to an election. (b) No. It would not be a very sensible idea. Attorney-General's Department: Reconciliation Convention (Question No. 1892) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 23 June 1997: Did the Minister's Department or agencies within the Minister's responsibility provide assistance for persons to attend the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne in May 1997; if so, what. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised by my Department and agencies within the portfolio of the following details in relation to attendance at the Convention and the associated costs: Attorney-General's Department Two staff members attended the Convention. Costs paid: Registration fees; Airfares; Travelling Allowance-$1,888.20 Administrative Appeals Tribunal One staff member attended the Convention. Costs paid: Registration fee-$350.oo National Native Title Tribunal The President, seven Members and four staff of the Tribunal attended the Convention. The President and two members were invited as guest speakers and had their registration, airfares and sitting fees paid by the Convention organisers. Where possible, staff utilised Frequent flyer/Global Rewards points to minimise costs to the Tribunal. Costs paid: Registration; Airfares; Travel Allowance; Sitting fees-$17,076.20 Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission The President, three Commissioners and five staff members attended the Convention as speakers, session leaders and in support roles. Costs paid: Airfares; Travel Allowance$8,746.40 The President paid his own registration fee. Registration fees for the rest of the group were waived by the Convention organisers. A further two staff members attended the Convention as participants. Costs paid: Registration; Airfares; Travel Allowance-$2,553.75 The Commission paid $916.00 towards the cost of the airfare for the Co-Commissioner, Professor Marcia Langton, to return from the Convention via Canberra for a formal Inquiry-related event at Government House, in recognition of her work on the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families. Five officers travelled to the Convention venue to assist with the launch of the ""Bringing Them Home"" Report. Costs paid: Airfares; Travel Allowance$5,306.10 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Portfolio: Boards, Councils, Committees and Advisory Bodies (Question No. 1948) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 24 June 1997: (1) What boards, councils, committees, and advisory bodies fall within the Minister's ministerial responsibilities.

Employment Assistance Programs (Question No. 2003) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: What sums were provided to employment assistance programs in (a) Victoria, (b) the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) area Melbourne East and (c) the Commonwealth Employment Service's (i) Greensborough and (ii) Epping regions in (A) 1996 and (B) the period 1 January to 26 June 1997. Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Department's computer systems were updated to reflect the new Area structure and since that time information is only available according to the current Area structure. Due to the rationalisation of the Area office structure of the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in August 1996, it is not possible to provide the information on expenditure in the specified Area and Regions for the time periods requested. Following an Area Office restructure in August 1996, Melbourne East Area ceased to exist. The Melbourne East regions which were situated north of the Yarra river (including Epping and Greensborough) were merged with the then Area Melbourne City West to create Area Melbourne North West and the remaining regions of Melbourne East were transferred to Area South East Victoria. The Department's computer systems were updated to reflect the new Area structure and since that time information is only available according to the current Area structure.

This resulted in the then Greensborough region being absorbed into the Epping region. Therefore expenditure information is only available for the combined region and not for Epping and Greensborough separately. Furthermore labour market program (LMP) expenditure data at the regional level does not include all LMP expenditure. Many LMP projects (in particular Special Employer Support, New Work Opportunities, JobSkills and LEAP programs) are administered at Area office level and are therefore not recorded at regional level on the computer system. The following table, therefore, contains information on LMP expenditure in all Areas in Victoria for each of the three six-month periods from January 1996 to 30 June 1997. A list of regions covered by Area Melbourne East together with details of the programs involved are also included.

Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Under s 122 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the Act), the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) must, by notice in writing, determine standards for commercial television broadcasting licensees in relation to the Australian content of programs. In 1995 the ABA determined a new Australian Content Standard for commercial television (the Australian Content Standard) effective from 1 1anuary 1996. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's (ABT-predecessor to the ABA) Children's Television Standards (CfS)-(1990) and the Advertising Standard (Television Program StandardfTPS23)-(1992) remain in force. There are two main mechanisms in the Australian Content Standard: - an Australian transmission quota setting the Content annual overall minimum level of Australian programming between 6:00 am. and 12:00 midnight that includes first run and repeat programs (currently 50% of total programming between these hours); and - first release quotas for minimum amounts of drama, children's programs (including 28 hours of first release Australian children's drama per year, rising to 32 hours in 1998) and 10 hours of first release Australian documentary programs of at least 30 minutes duration each year. Further provision for children's programs is made in the CTS. This requires that commercial television licensees must broadcast at least 390 hours of children's programs per year. Fifty per cent of C (Children's) programs (classified by the ABA) must be first release Australian programs (at least 260 hours of C required each year). All P (Preschool) classified programs must be Australian (130 hours of P required each year). Under the Australian Content in Advertising Standard, commercial television licensees must ensure that at least 80% of the total advertising time broadcast in a year by the licensee between 6:00 am. and midnight, is occupied by Australian produced advertisements. (2) Under the Australian transmission quota, Australian programs must constitute at least 50% of all programming broadcast between 6.00 am. and midnight over a given year (ie. channels are not required to meet the quota on a daily basis). The quota will rise to 55% from the beginning of 1998.

The code allows for an average 6.00 pm. and midnight. Non-program refers to matter The code allows some flexibility, allowing up to be scheduled in any four of the six hours. (iv) Australian content (other than Channel (a) Seven (b) Nine (c) Ten Programs made with financial assistance from the television production fund do not qualify under the transmission quota. The drama scores for all first release Australian drama programs broadcast between 5:00 pm. and midnight in any year must total at least 225 points and must total at least 775 in each succeeding period of 3 years. The drama score is calculated by multiplying a format factor for the program by its duration, using the formula 'drama score = format factor x duration'. The values awarded to each format represent a bias towards encouraging short form, higher cost drama, rather than lower cost long form drama (eg. the format factor for an Australian telemovie of less than 90 minutes duration is 3.2 whereas the format factor for a serial or series produced a the rate of more than 1 hour per week is 1).

Department of Defence Industry, Science and Personnel: Staff (Question No. 2056) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How many persons were employed on a (a) full time, (b) part time permanent and (c) casual basis in the Minister's Department at 30 June 1997. (2) What is the Minister's Department estimated recruitment intake for 1997-98. (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Full Time-18,214. (b) Part Time-320. (c) Short Term Temporary Employment-927. (2) The Government's Defence Reform Program will require a reduction in the number of civilians in the Department. To maximise the redeployment opportunities of displaced staff, recruitment constrained. However, because the number of staff who might be seeking redeployment is not known, it is not possible to set a clear estimate of civilian recruitment for 1997/98 at this stage. (3) To ensure an appropriate skills base is maintained, the Department intends to recruit a significant number of trainees in 1997/98 via the Public Sector Recruitment Test conducted by Recruitment Services Australia. A specific trainee recruitment target has not been set at this time for the same reasons outlined in (2) above.

(2) What is the Minister's Department estimated recruitment intake for 1997-98. (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The number of persons employed in the Department as at 30 June 1997 was (a) full time 8623 (b) part-time permanent 630 and (c) casual basis (temporary) 1136. (2) At this stage the estimated recruitment intake for the Department in 1997/98 is approximately 50 Graduate Administrative Assistants. The need to recruit further staff will depend on the extent to which the restaffing of any vacancies which occur is being throughout the year is possible within the Department's 1997/98 Budget. (3) The number of positions available for successful candidates from the Public Service Recruitment Test will be approximately 50 to which the Graduate Administrative Assistants referred to above will be recruited. The availability of further positions for either graduates or non-graduates who passed the test will again depend on the extent to which restaffing of any vacancies which occur throughout the year is possible within the Department's 1997/98 Budget.",157
