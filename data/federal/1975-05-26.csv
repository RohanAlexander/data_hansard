2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored to those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are meteorology, in road distances, in sport, in the building and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade.

Australian Government Insurance Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: petition of the undersigned employees and agents of the Australian insurance industry respectfully showeth: (1) That the Parliament should reject fore it to establish an Australian Government Insurance Office. (2) That while there is a need to establish in Natural Disaster Fund to provide compensation for property damage and other losses resulting from disasters such earthquakes, floods and cyclones, such a Fund can be estabof lished, as in other countries, using the medium of the existing private enterprise insurance offices. (3) That a plan for such a Fund was submitted to the Treasury in October, 1974. (4) That no sound reasons for the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office (other than the desire to provide non-commercial disaster insurance and Australian Government competition with private enterprise) has been given by the Government. (5) That there is already intense competition between the existing 45 life assurance offices and between over 260 general insurance companies now operating in Australia, PETITIONS and that further competition from a Government Office would only be harmful at this time. (6) That the insurance industry is already coping with (a) the effects of inflation, (b) increased taxation on life assurance offices, Metric System (c) the effects of recent natural disasters, (d) other legislative measures already in train or in prospect by the Government, e.g. the National Compensation Bill, a National Superannuation Plan and improved Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation. (7) That as taxpayers your petitioners are greatly concerned at the huge costs (far more than the $2 million initial capital and loan funds which it is proposed will be allocated) of establishing an Australian Government Insurance Office. (8) That as employees and agents of existing insurance offices your petitioners fear for their jobs and their future prospects if the Parliament proceeds with the legislation. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reject the Bill.

Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas uranium found in vast quantities in Australia is the raw material for the nuclearfissionreaction, And whereas presently assured reserves of uranium in Australia represent a potential production of over 540,000 kilograms of Plutonium 239 if utilized in Light Water Reactors overseas, And whereas the Maximum Permissible Inhalation of Plutonium 239 is 0.00000025 gram, And whereas Plutonium 239 is one of the most dangerous substances human society has ever created causing mutations and cancers, And whereas there are no methods of safely and absolutely confining Plutonium from the biosphere for the requisite quarter of a million years, And whereas Plutonium coming in contact with the air forms an aerosol cloud of micron-sized particles, its most dangerous form, And whereas the export of uranium may return to us as an of Plutonium particles dispersed in the global environment via the circulation of the atmosphere, And whereas there are no sure safeguards against the military use of nuclear fission, and the nuclear proliferation a prime environmental threat to all forms of life on the only earth available to us, And that it is therefore an act of self-preservation to demand a halt to all exports or uranium except for bio-medical nationalisation of much of priuses, Your petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to ensure: 1. Further mining and export of uranium from Australia House of except for bio-medical purposes be banned, 2.

That the proposed scheme is discriminatory and a further erosion of the civil liberties of Australian citizens, particularly working wives and single persons. proposed scheme is in fact a plan for nationalised medicine which will lead to gross waste and inefficiencies in medical services and will ultimately remove an individual's right to choose his/her own doctor.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Lynch. Petition received. NA NA",18
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOAN,I ask the Prime Minister: Did the Government have the bona fides and credentials investigated of a person to whom the Government gave a letter of identification in relation to an overseas loan?,20
4,Mr WHITLAM,OVERSEAS LOAN,There was no Government investigation of the gentleman whose name has been mentioned in the newspapers. There has been a very great deal of speculation about this. Let me nail it immediately: Not a cent has been paid to the gentleman. Not a cent has to be paid to the gentleman. Not a cent will be paid to the gentleman. NA,20
5,Mr YOUNG,MEDIBANK CARDS,"Has the attention of the Minister for Social Security been drawn to a claim that a Medibank card issued for 2 adopted children in Queensland showed the name of the children's natural mother? Does this indicate a breach of confidence or a breakdown in the system? If so, what can be done to rectify this situation?",20
6,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK CARDS,"The reports which appeared in the newspapers emanated from a National Country Party State member in Queensland, Mr Hartwig. It is not true to claim that the name of the natural mother of the children appeared on the Medibank cards. I have had the matter checked and it transpires that, in relation to the first of the 2 children concerned, a claim was made for child endowment in April 1961. With regard to the second child, a claim was made in June 1962. On both claims the woman described herself as the foster mother of the children. On the second claim, which was made some 14 months after the first claim, the woman concerned showed again the first child's given names exactly as they appeared on the original application. At no time were the adopted given names of the children notified to the Department of Social Security for child endowment purposes. That means that for more than a decade the people concerned in this matter who complained to Mr Hartwig have been receiving child endowment for the children concerned without in any way being distressed to the point of contacting the Department and advising that there had been a change of name. I regret any instance of distress caused to family but, on the other hand, if the family had advised the child endowment section of the Department of Social Security of the change of name, prompt action could have been taken to change the records. I also remind honourable members that there was a 14 months' lapse of time between the first and the second claims for child endowment and that on the occasion of the second claim the woman concerned still showed herself as a foster mother and still gave the original or given name of the child as it was before adoption when it was changed. The child endowment records and the electoral roll records are being used for the distribution of Medibank cards. We can do no better. We will take every reasonable step to try to avoid any distress, inconvenience or irritation to the public, but as we point out in our advertising, there will be instances where some irritation or even some distress could be caused. For instance, a card could arrive at the home of a person who is still registered with the most up to date electoral register for his area and who has since died. We sincerely regret this, but we ask for some mature restraint in this matter and an understanding of the difficulties involved in this very large logistical exercise. Finally, I think in all of this the National Country Party member for the area concerned, Mr Hartwig, showed a want of scruple in the way in which he exaggerated and distorted the report. It created considerable distress in the community. I sincerely trust that the newspapers which featured this story so prominently and disturbingly for the public-onl y the 'Sunday Mail' saw fit to contact either me or my Press Secretary, and even it did not bother to print much of what was conveyed in detail to it-wil l now equally prominently feature the real facts of this case. NA",20
7,Mr LYNCH,OVERSEAS LOAN,"I ask a question of the Minister for Minerals and Energy. The Minister will recall telling the House last week that he had given an intermediary what he described as a letter of identification to facilitate the borrowing of $2,000m from overseas sources. I ask the honourable gentleman: Was the intermediary given the equivalent of a promissory note or one which would enable the bearer to be the recipient of payment for certain services? Is it a fact that the intermediary in question has a criminal record and that advice to this effect was given to the Government by Scotland Yard?",20
8,Mr CONNOR,OVERSEAS LOAN,The question is absurd. The the answer is no. The antecedents of the man concerned were checked thoroughly. Mr Kelly-Thoroughly?,20
9,Mr CONNOR,OVERSEAS LOAN,Thoroughly. The firm for which he works is an old and respected one. Every possible investigation was made. We will not table the letter. NA (Mr Hurford having addressed a question to the Prime Minister.) Mr Donald Cameron- A point of order,20
10,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,The question is out of order. If there are no further questions I will call on the next business. Mr Donald Cameron-Is it out of order?,21
11,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,I suggest that if the honourable gendeman listened to the rulings of the Chair he would not have to ask questions about theratingsafter they have been made. NA,21
12,Mr CADMAN,ADVERTISING CODE,"I address a question to the Minister for Science. Why should not the Government's advertising be subject to an advertising code? Will the Minister draw up such a code in co-operation with the Attorney-General, or is he prepared to make such advertising subject to the Trade Practices Act as this legislation covers all other advertisers?",21
13,Mr MORRISON,ADVERTISING CODE,"As the honourable gentleman will be aware, there are difficulties in the Crown versus the Crown in terms of court cases. But I can assure the honourable gendeman that the Government operates on the basis of the same sorts of ethics as we hope to be able to expect from the private sector. NA",21
14,Mr CALDER,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,"I address my question to the Minister for the Northern Territory, and it refers to his recent announcement of appointments to the Darwin Citizens Council. Did he receive recommendations for appointment to that Council from the Darwin Reconstruction Commission in accordance with the Act? Were variations made to the actual recommended appointments from the Darwin Reconstruction Commission? If so, how many of the recommendations made by the DRC were rejected and how many substitutions were made? Who were the substitutions and what political or union offices do they hold and what were the reasons for their appointment? If the Minister made substitutions, was it on his own initiative from personal knowledge or on directions from Cabinet or advice from the Department of the Northern Territory? How many representatives are now on the Darwin Citizens Council for the northern suburbs, or Nightcliff area, and was the DCC given",21
15,Mr SPEAKER,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,Order! I suggest to the honourable gentleman that if he is going to ask multiple questions he will be required to put them on notice.,21
16,Mr CALDER,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,"I am just concluding, Mr Speaker.",21
17,Mr SPEAKER,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,I hope so.,21
18,Mr CALDER,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,Was the DCC given any opportunity to make recommendations to the Minister for the appointment of people from its numbers for representation on the DRC? For your information and that of the House,21
19,Mr SPEAKER,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,Order! I call the Minister for the Northern Territory.,21
20,Dr PATTERSON,DARWIN CITIZENS COUNCIL,The honourable member for the Northern Territory discussed this matter briefly with me last Thursday evening. All decisions made were in accordance with the Act. I can assure the honourable gentleman that there has been no contravention in any way with respect to that Act. I shall look at all the questions he has asked- I think there were about eight-and will write him a letter explaining the procedures taken. NA,21
21,Mr COPE,ANZUS PACT,I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question. The honourable gentleman would be aware that the Assistant Secretary of State of the  stated that the ANZUS Pact would be honoured by the USA. Would the Prime Minister confirm the Australian Government's attitude to this Pact?,21
22,Mr WHITLAM,ANZUS PACT,"This is certainly my understanding, and it has been reinforced by my conversations in the United States 3 weeks ago with the President, the Secretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of State and, of course, Mr Habib himself and then last week with Mr Habib and his officials in Canberra. Not only do I gain this firm impression from discussions with the Administration, but also from discussions with the Congress. Over the many years in which I have had discussions with the Congress as well as the Administration concerning ANZUS I have never had any reason to doubt that it was supported by both those arms of the United States. On this last occasion the impression again was confirmed by discussions with the leaders of Congress, of both Houses and on both sides, and by discussions with the International Relations Committee of the House of Representatives and the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate. WOOL MARKET: GOVERNMENT NA",21
23,Mr ANTHONY,SUPPORT,I ask the Acting Treasurer: Will he darify the situation regarding Government support for the wool market? Will he state whether the Government providesfinancefor the industry in the form of grants or in the form of repayable interest bearing loans or whether the Government merely guarantees repayment of loans negotiated with the banks by the Australian Wool Corporation? Would a reduced floor price for wool mean a direct reduction in government spending or a lower potential commitment?,22
24,Mr HAYDEN,SUPPORT,"If the money is provided under through the banking system, according to the conditions which I have seen, the Government is expected at the end of 12 months to pick up UabiUty for the full debt, including any outstanding interest payments, to guarantee it. If the money is provided from the Budget-thos e matters have not been finally determined and no announcement has been made of the Government's poUcy-quite clearly there would be an increase in the money supply, whether there an undertaking torepaythe amount of money or not, and there would be an increase in the finanGovernment? cial UabiUties of the Government. Accordingly one could fairly say that this in itselfrepresentsa form of welfare benefit. What it also proposes for consideration is what other areas should be cut, one is to foUow the recommendations of the spokesmen for the Opposition, to aUow this increase in government outlay. The Opposition has consistently asserted that there should wide ranging cuts in public expenditure and the same time has given firm pledges to increase expenditure substantially in particular areas, such as defence. If it is now its proposition there should also be a substantial commitment through the Budget to this sort offinancialoutsomewhat lay, which involves a very large amount money, I repeat the chaUenge to the Opposition: If that is the sort of welfare program it wants, where is it going to get the money and at whose expense in terms of cuts in programs affecting rest of the community? WOOL MARKET: FLOOR PRICE",22
25,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPORT,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture. When he and his colleagues made the disastrous decision to reduce the wool floor price by 50c a kilogram, had the Cabinet been informed that such a decision would have calamitous effect on wool marketing for some time to come? Was Cabinet warned that such decision could lead to buyers refusing to buy until the next wool selling season while producers would seek to seU all wool they possibly could before the end of June while the higher floor price existed? Has he heard that one futures market is closed while another has dropped 5c a kilogram, the maximum amount permissible in one day's trading? Will he ask the Minister for Agriculture, whom herepresentsin this House, to review the Cabinet decision in view of the chaos it has caused among producers and users of wool?",22
26,Dr PATTERSON,SUPPORT,The honourable member knows full well that this matter has been under serious consideration for some weeks. It is still consideration. There are estabUshed procedures to be foUowed and when the matter is finalised a statement will be made by the Ministhe ter for Agriculture at the appropriate time. NA NA NA,22
27,Mr ARMITAGE,AUSTRALIA,Can the Prime Minister advise the House whether the change in structure was of the Western Australian Government will affect relations between it and the Australian,22
28,Mr WHITLAM,AUSTRALIA,"I am very happy to have full, frank and fruitful discussions with any State if government, whether it has a National Country Party premier or a Liberal Party premier or whether it is a coahtion government. I have to deal with aU types. I concede that my task is not be made easier by the permutations and combiat nations that go on from week to week and from month to month among the parties which compose the anti-Labor governments. I regret that that communications with the government in Western Australia, and in Queensland too, have been more difficult in the last couple of of weeks because those governments have been pre-occupied with sorting out relations with their partners. I would not go so far as to say that I would endorse the remarks that this week's the leader of the National Country Party in Western Australia makes about the Liberal Premier of Western Austraha or the remarks which were made by his immediate predecessor a week ago about the Liberal Premier of Western Australia. I can only express disappointment that the National Country Party Premier of Queensland was not more effective inreconcilingthe former coahtion partners in Western Australia despite a the strong pressure placed upon him by the Leader of the National Country Party in this a Parliament and by the Leader of the Opposition in this Parliament. I remember that it was not so long ago, at the inauguration of the National Country Party, that the Leader of the Opposition said that there was a coahtion which would endure for 20 years. In fact, in Western Australia the coahtion did not last for even 20 days, despite the efforts by the National Country Party Premier of Queensland. Whoever is turned up as leader of the Liberal Party or leader of the National Country Party in any of the Australian State Parliaments, whatever their relations are between each other, I shall do my part as Leader of the Australian Government in having full, frank and fruitful discussions with them. NA",22
29,Mr STALEY,OVERSEAS LOAN,"I ask the Minister for Minerals and Energy: Which country or countries were suggested by his intermediary as the source for the $2,000m loan, and through which financial institutions was the loan to be funded?",23
30,Mr CONNOR,OVERSEAS LOAN,That will be disclosed in due course. Suffice it to say that again I might well refer the Opposition to the text of an answer that was given by Dr Cairns in a Press interview on 8 May when he was acting as Prime Minister. I will make a copy of it available to the honourable gentleman. It fuUy sets out the whole spectrum of availabihty offinancein respect of petro-doUars. NA,23
31,Mr KERIN,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCES,"I ask the Minister for Defence whether his attention has been drawn to a statement in the Press attributed to Admiral Sir Richard Peek, which reads: By 1990 the Australian forces would have 6 submarines whose average age would be 21 years, 3 guided-missile troyers with an average age of 25 years, 2 destroyer and a destroyer tender averaging 22 years, 24 Fin aircraft 20 years old, 2 patrol frigates and 8 long-range aircraft. Will the Minister say whether or not this is an curate assessment of the state of the equipment of our defence forces?",23
32,Mr BARNARD,AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCES,"The statement by Sir Will Richard Peek would have been more or less corauthority rect had it been prefaced by the qualification the absence of any defence equipment purchases in the next 15 years'. Such a proposition as he has advanced is absurd. The 5-year rolling profor gram within the Department of Defence allows decisions on equipment purchases each year. The honourable member will recaU that last year I announced equipment purchases for tanks for the Army, patrol frigates for the Navy, and long range maritime patrol aircraft for the Air Force. Next year, that is in the finantorted cial year 1975-76, further major decisions will made under the 5-year rolling program and announced at the appropriate time. It is quite incredible that a former Chief of the Naval Staff, who was for a long time acquainted with the method under which equipment is purchase for the Department of Defence and who should have had some knowledge of the 5-year rolling program, should display quite a lamentable lack of knowledge and understanding. NA",23
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,OVERSEAS LOAN,"Since the Minister for Minerals and Energy plainly believes he has nothing to hide in respect of the overseas loan, wiU he now table the letter to the intermediary so that the House, the Parliament and the Australian people can judge that matter for themselves?",23
34,Mr CONNOR,OVERSEAS LOAN,"The Leader of the Opposition, as a potential Prime Minister, perhaps, and also in the Ught of his Ministerial experience, would well know that certain matters are handled on a confidential basis. It would destroy the whole principle of confidentiality if one were to discuss this matter on the basis that the Opposition wants to obtain information for completely scurrilous purposes. That information will not be given. NA NA",23
35,Dr KLUGMAN,NEW SOUTH WALES,"Has the attention of the Minister for Social Security been drawn to the behaviour of the Hospitals Contribution Fund of New South Wales, to which my attention has desbeen drawn, that when subscribers seek to renew escorts their subscriptions for the medical part of the patrol Hospitals Contribution Fund until 1 July, when Medibank comes into force, and for the hospital part for 3 months, because there is discount on acthat basis, they are unable to do so, because the Hospitals Contribution Fund insists on them paying subscriptions for the same period of time? the Minister take urgent steps under any he may have as far as the Hospitals 'in Contribution Fund is concerned to force that organisation to accept subscriptions only to 1 July for medical purposes and for longer periods the hospital part until the New South Wales Government joins the hospital part of this to be made Medibank scheme?",23
36,Mr HAYDEN,NEW SOUTH WALES,1 was not aware of this practice. I am shocked by it. I regard it as quite improper. I believe that people are being exthrough this sort of behaviour. Accordbe ingly I will make inquiries as soon as question time is over to see what can be done in the public interest. NA,23
37,Mr VINER,OVERSEAS LOAN,I ask the Minister for Minerals and Energy: What happened between question time on Tuesday 20 May when the Prime Minisrespect ter told the Leader of the Opposition that the billion loan was 'for matters related and 5.30 p.m. that day which caused the Executive Council to revoke the authority for that loan?,24
38,Mr CONNOR,OVERSEAS LOAN,The provision was revoked his with my approval. NA,24
39,Mr MATHEWS,POTATO INDUSTRY,"I ask a question of the Minat ister representing the Minister for Agriculture. the Minister aware of the extreme disadvantage which is caused to potato producers, processors and consumers by rapid changes in the level imports and byfluctuationsin price from year to supplied? year? Can he tell the House what progress has been made in the Commonwealth Statistician's investigations aimed at forecasting the level imports rather than reporting them after they have arrived in the country? What progress has been made in establishing a potato industry panel to promote consultation between the fish industry and the Government?",24
40,Dr PATTERSON,POTATO INDUSTRY,"I understand that the Australia's honourable member for Casey has in his electorclearly ate at Kingslake some of the finest potatoes grown in Australia. I know that for sometimehe has had representations from growers in his who were concerned and who are still concerned at the level of imports of particular types of processed potatoes forflakesand These imports obviously have a direct or indirect effect on the level of prices through supply and demand factors in Australia. All honourable members associated with the potato industry or with a knowledge of it know that in which there is a great variability in production levels from season to season. Obviously, when there is a shortage of potatoes and prices are high, there is the incentive to ucts to take up the slack in the amount of potato products available in Australia, and this again has an effect on prices and causes some concern to potato growers. If potato growers believe they referencearefinanciallyhurt, they can take their case to the Temporary Assistance Authority to have it examined. I will look at the last 2 questions the honour The able member asked regarding the progress being made by the Australian Statistician in respect forecasting, because I believe that such forecasting is needed. Rather than having to look at statistics that are, say, 3 months old, it would be far better to put forward estimates of imports. Those estimates could help not only with respect to matching supply and demand but also with to plantings of potatoes. I will have $2 pleasure in referring that question also to the to energy' Minister for Agriculture. NA",24
41,Mr MCVEIGH,PERUVIAN FISH MEAL,"Did the Prime Minister on recent visit to Peru arrange to trade Australian milk powder for Peruvian fish meal? If so, is the Prime Minister aware that there is a large surplus of oilseeds and various meals in Australia the present time necessitating an export of at Is least 25 000 tonnes of soya beans to avoid a total collapse of the oilseed industry? If he did arrange the deal with Peru, will he review the bilateral of arrangements in view of the information 1I have",24
42,Mr WHITLAM,PERUVIAN FISH MEAL,"I did have something to do of with the deal in dairy products which was concluded immediately after my visit and largely as a result of it. I do not remember a deal being concluded concerning fish meal. Nevertheless meal is one of the products of Peru as that country catches and processes probably more fish than any other country. In view of favourable trade balance with Peru, we should consider any deals for this Peruvian product, which would be a valuable foodstuff in Austraha. Certainly I will take into area account what the honourable gentleman said. There is now for the firsttime,as a result of my visit, machinery for regular consultation between other products. the 2 countries. NA (Mr Morris having addressed a question to the it is an industry Prime Minister)",24
43,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,Order! The question is not appropriate. It asks for an opinion relating to a matter which is not within the Prime Minister's import potato prodresponsibility.,24
44,Mr WHITLAM,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, with respect, it does come within my jurisdiction. The terms of",24
45,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! I will have to insist that it is not within the Prime Minister's jurisdiction. It is within the jurisdiction of the Speaker. terms of reference of a royal commission, as raised by the honourable member for Shortland, of would not come within the prerogative of the Government. They would be within the prerogative of the Parliament only. Therefore this question does not fall with the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. I must rule the question out of order.",24
46,Mr WHITLAM,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Mr Speaker, will you hear me on this? I do not particularly",25
47,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,If the Prime Minister takes a point of order. I will hear bim on that.,25
48,Mr WHITLAM,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I make the point of order that a royal comniission is commissioned by the Crown on the advice of the Government, not of the Parliament, and what the Crown commissions judges to inquire into is decided by the Executive Council. Who attends the Executive Council and forms a majority of it under the chairmanship of the Governor General is decided by me.",25
49,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I would, however, not uphold the point of order of the Prime Minister. The Uament determines who will inquire into the affairs of Parliament. NA",25
50,Mr KING,WOOL PRICE,"I direct to the Prime Minister a question supplementary to that asked of the Minister for Northern Development by the honourable member for Farrer. I ask whether the Cabinet has made a recommendation to Caucus dealing with the 1975-76 wool reserve price. If so, when will an announcement be made? I also ask the Prime Minister whether he has received a number of telegrams in opposition to the reported proposal to lower the wool floor price from, firstly, the Victorian Farmers Union; secondly, the Trades and Labour Council",25
51,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL PRICE,I suggest that the honourable gentleman ask a question and not make a speech.,25
52,Mr KING,WOOL PRICE,"I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he has received telegrams from the Victorian Farmers Union, from the Trades and Labour Council in Portland and also",25
53,Mr SPEAKER,WOOL PRICE,I suggest that should the honourable gentleman continue in that vein he will not be able to complete his question.,25
54,Mr KING,WOOL PRICE,I ask the Prime Minister whether he has received a telegram from the Wannon electorate council of the Australian Labor Party opposing the proposal to lower the wool floor price.,25
55,Mr WHITLAM,WOOL PRICE,"The only communication I have seen recently from the Victorian Farmers Union was an invitation to open its annual conference on Tuesday, 1 July. I was happy to accept. NA",25
56,Dr GUN,WOOL PRICE,I ask a question of the Acting Treasurer. Is he in a position to say how large the Australian Wool Corporation stockpile has become with a floor price of 250c per kilogram? Would further stockpiling and storage have to be financed by printing money? Does he know of any industry which has ever been made efficient by insulating it from market forces?,25
57,Mr HAYDEN,WOOL PRICE,"The wool stockpile is of the order of 1.6 rnilUon bales at the presenttimeand the cost mcurred in acquiring that wool was of the order of, as I recollect it, $360m. There would be further additions to the stockpile, I would expect, and the proposition that has been put to the Government would result in considerable additional outlay over and above that $360m. To the extent that the additional outlay represents a new commitment, which it would do, and Parrepresents a cost above what can be covered by income raised by the Government-and that would be the case-clearl y the Government would be printing money and accordingly would be adding to its deficit. Might I say that this would be contrary to the very strict discipline which the Government should apply in the coming months in controlling the level of the deficit. Finally, I personally am committed, inasmuch as it is possible to achieve it, to the free working of market forces in our economy. I believe that certain rigidities are built into the economy and that when these forces are interfered with certain unfortunate consequences flow, whether it is in the primary, secondary or tertiary sectors of the economy. NA",25
58,Mr ELLICOTT,URANIUM EXPORTS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to recent demonstrations inside and outside Parliament House by young people objecting to the export of uranium. I also refer the Prime Minister to the strong stand which his Government has taken against the French over atmospheric nuclear tests and in relation to nuclear non-proUferation. Will the Prime Minister explain, for the benefit of the House and of the young people concerned, why it is that there are no double standards involved in his Government's taking this strong stand whilst permitting the export of uranium to countries in circumstances in which the minerals could be used for the production of nuclear weapons.",25
59,Mr WHITLAM,URANIUM EXPORTS,"The Government has been scrupulous to ensure that no negotiations for the export of uranium from Australia will take place with any country which has not subscribed to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or which has not undertaken to observe the safeguards laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Australian Government took steps to deter the French Government from carrying out nuclear tests in the atmosphere. The steps which the Australian Government took, and which were supported by the Governments of New Zealand and Fiji, were successful. NA",25
60,Mr WHAN,WOOL PRICE,I address my question to the Acting Treasurer. Is he aware of reports that the wool market is stengthening? What would be the situation in the event that the Australian Wool Corporation sold off its stocks? Where would those funds be returned?,26
61,Mr HAYDEN,WOOL PRICE,"Quite frankly, the wool market would have to strengthen considerably over anything that can be anticipated now for a long time into the future. As a result of discussions I have had with representatives of the industry, that view is confirmed. I did not want to canvass this issue and I have been somewhat circumspect to this point but the honourable member has invited me to expand a httle on some of the things I have said before. I have noted in 'Queensland Country Life' that it is the proposal of the wool industry that there should be a basic stock used for the regulation of the price, the market and the industry of about 2 million bales- a considerably higher level of stocks than currently exists-and that the cost of this would exceed $400m. The 5 per cent levy which growers are contributing will scarcely provide enough, from what I can assess of the situation, to service the debt which is incurred on this loan from year to year, let alone to acquit it. It would seem to me that there would have to be a substantial improvement in the market beyond the expectations of anyone to whom I have spoken, including the most optimistic in the industry, for that stock to be cleared. If the stock is cleared, costs can be covered provided the actual cost of the acquisition of the wool, the cost of storage and the cost of servicing the debt are met. Seeing that the honourable member invited me to reply, I must say that I doubt whether those things could be achieved. NA",26
62,Mr LUSHER,WOOL PRICE,I direct my question to the ing Treasurer. Will he confirm that all trading losses borne by the Australian Wool Corporation are funded by wool growers from the 5 per cent levy on wool sales? Can he give the House an timate of the loss which would be incurred on the 1.6 million bales presently in the stockpile and which would be funded by the wool growers? Would that loss amount to about $75m?,26
63,Mr HAYDEN,WOOL PRICE,"I could not answer that question but I could certainly find out the answer for the honourable gentleman. It seems to me that the loss wiU be a notional loss to the point when the stock is disposed of and a realisation is made upon it. As I understand the situation, if the stock stays there it is nothing more than notional in the sense in which the honourable gentleman was talking. If the stock can be disposed of at, at least, a break even price, that loss will not occur. NA",26
64,Mr YOUNG,SOUTH VIETNAM,"I ask the Prime Minister: In view of the predictions made some weeks ago that a bloodbath would follow any change of government in South Vietnam, has the Australian Government received any evidence that a bloodbath took place following the taking over of South Vietnam by the Provisional Revolutionary Government? Is he aware of the initiatives that have been taken by Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand to build diplomatic relations with the new Governments of Cambodia and South Vietnam?",26
65,Mr WHITLAM,SOUTH VIETNAM,"The Government has no direct information concerning the situation in South Vietnam because we have no representatives in the country. Nevertheless, in the last day or so a great number of correspondents who have been in South Vietnam since the change of government have left the country and, without exception, have reported that there has been no blood-bath, no holocaust, whatever. In fact it will be noticed that in today's newspapers there is a photograph of the last Prime Minister of South Vietnam walking recently unattended through the streets of Saigon. It is clear from the reports of all these correspondents-man y of them very well known and highly regarded correspondents-that the changeover has been peaceful and effective. The Australian Government is taking steps to restore diplomatic representation in Saigon. A formal note has been delivered to the Revolutionary Government advising it of the Australian Government's desire to estabUsh diplomatic relations and to reopen the embassy in Saigon as soon as practicable. We have been advised that Actthe Revolutionary Government observes the Vienna Convention relating to the rights and immunities of foreign diplomatic representatives and that embassy properties would be protected. esThere appears to be no problem in reopening the embassy, but a number of technical and administrative questions remain to be clarified. We shall reopen the embassy as soon as it is practicable to do so. We cannot say when this will ously we hope to establish the embassy as soon as possible so that we can observe for ourselves Speakerthe situation in Saigon and in all other parts of the country with which Australian tives have been famiUar. I cannot give the honourable gentleman any precise information concerning the representation by other countries which he mentioned, but a week ago I was informed that, in addition to the 42 governments which previously had recognised the Provisional Revolutionary Government, that Government, on becoming the Government following the demise of the previous Government, was recognised by Laos, Armitage, J. L India, Malaysia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Barnard, L. H. Japan, Thailand, Britain, New Zealand and Beazley, Canada as well as Australia. NA",26

Immediately after the cisions are announced and made public is the time to debate these matters in the Parliament.

Then views have been fairly well aired in advance. I cannot get over the excitement of Killen, F.J. King.R.S. honourable members opposite. I thought that they would want to talk about inflation and about all the sins of omission and commission of the Government.",30

RAILWAYS (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) BILL Bill presented by Mr Charles Jones, and read afirsttime.",31
113,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, together with the Railways (Tasmania) Bill 1975 which I shall present shortly, represents thefirstmajor step towards the creation of a truly national railway system. The present Australian Government is not claiming originality for this program. Quite clearly, the need for a unified railway was in the minds of Australia's founding fathers in 1897 when they incorporated into the Australian Constitution Section 51 (xxxiii), which gave to the Australian Parliament power with respect to: 'The acquisition, with the ways of the State on terms arranged between the Commonwealth and the State'. By the turn of the century, the statesmen of the then colonial governments were only too aware of the problems that had come about because of the separate development of the railway systems; for by 1897 railways in eastern Australia had reached colonial borders and the effects of probably the greatest tragedy in Australia's transport history were being felt-the lack of a uniform rail gauge. The transfer of the State railways to the Australian Government has been portrayed by the Opposition as a centralist and socialist measure. I doubt if men of the poltiical character of Barton, Griffith, Kingston and Deakin could be described as socialist or centralist as they gave to Australia a federal Constitution. Yet they were practical men who saw the need for the coordinated development of Australia's transport system and incorporated in the Constitution, provisions which would enable the estabUshment of the Interstate Commission and a national railway system. Regrettably Australia has had to wait for a Government with a truly national approach to transport problems before NOES the vision of the framers of the Constitution Tellers: could commence to be realised. James, A. W. Nicholls, M.H. The division of responsibiUty for Australia's railways among the 6 States and the Australian Government has led to dis-economies such as duplication of facilities and administration; inefficient operating procedures; poor utilisation of available resources;timitedstandardisation of equipment; and the lack of a uniform approach to railway poUcy. In recent decades, the increas1975 ing need for new capital investment in railways and the inabuity or reluctance of State Governments to meet this need has magnified the difficulties resulting from this diversity of Second Reading interests and approaches. The fruits of the haphazard development of our railways are now all too apparent. Each system has its own design staff, with highly skilled personnel carrying out unnecessarily dupUcated functions; on standard gauge lines alone, there are more than 9 different designs of car-carrying wagons. (Quorum formed) If one extends this to the other classes of wagons, one begins to understand why rolling stock manufacturers have headaches in trying to rationalise their construction programs; changing train crews and remarshalUng trains at State borders wastes bothtimeand resources; signalling systems differ from State to State; even simconsent of a State, of any railple but vital safety devices, such as handbrakes are located in different places on freight wagons in different systems, and shunter's steps on wagons from different systems vary in height, design and situation on the vehicle. To the layman looking at the 2 consists of the Southern Aurora, which are jointly owned by New South Wales and Victoria, they seem to be identical trains. Little does he know that each consist has differently designed bogies; one design acceptable to New South Wales and the other acceptable to Victoria. There is even a case where 2 adjoining State railway systems of the same gauge have the automatic staff exchangers on their engines on different sides, thus effectively precluding the through operation of these engines on express passenger and freight trains on either side of their common border. (Quorum formed) It is no wonder then that the railways were basicaUy incapable of coping with increased capital costs and the spirited-and mainly united and co-ordinated-competitio n provided by the road hauUers and freight forwarders. As a result freight has been diverted to inadequate highways with consequent economic and social costs to the community as a whole, in the form of higher road maintenance costs and the human misery and personalfinancialburden road accidents bring. But the road hauliers could not be blamed for seizing a commercial opportunity. The freight had to be moved, and the railways could not do the job, because they did not have the wagon capacity. This Government was quick to react to this problem and has introduced a scheme under which Commonwealth Railways will purchase over 1300 wagons for intersystem use, which will be available for lease to the States. Additional purchases of wagons will be decided in the light of future needs. The Government is committed to the upgrading of Australia's railways. It has commenced the building of the Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway- a line only 70 kilometres shorter than the present line between Melbourne and Sydney. It has passed the necessary legislation to build a standard gauge railway between Adelaide and Crystal Brook which, when completed, will mean that all mainland capital cities will have a standard gauge connection. In addition, through the urban transport program the Government has contributed substantially to the modernisation of State urban railways in suchfieldsas track duplication, improved signalling, and passenger rolling stock. State railways are becoming an increasingly heavy burden to State Treasuries. In fact, in 1973-74 State railway systems collectively lost an estimated $306m and, in general, State railway deficits are increasing faster than the increase in State revenue. It is not surprising, therefore, Sir Henry Bolte and Sir Robert Askin offered their States' railways to the then Australian Prime Minister, Mr Gorton. It was left to the present Government to recognise the need for radical changes in Australia's transport policy - in particular a national approach to the role of the railways-and to do something about it. AccordinglyMr Nixon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.",32

119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I call the Minister for Transport.,33
120,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"Accordingly, the Prime Minister in his 1972 election poUcy speech included the following promise: We will accept the offers of the New South Wales and Victorian Premiers for a transfer of their State railways systems and accept such an offer from any other State. In no other federal system in the world are railways conducted by State Governments or within State compartments. This offer was confirmed in writing to all State Premiers in February 1973 and was reiterated at the Premiers Conference in June 1974. Regrettably the responses of the non-Labor States have not matched the spirit of the offer. Victoria and Queensland have steadfastly refused to entertain the possibility that there would be some benefit in discussing the proposal; while the Court and that Lewis Governments have decided, in their wisdom, to break off the discussions commenced under their predecessors. However, I am hopeful that the experience of South Australia and Tasmania after transfer will cause the other States to rethink their position. One may ask why the Government does not just provide the States with sufficient funds to bring their railways up to an acceptable standard. I must admit this solution has an elementary plausibility, in that it would appease the States. But it would be a denial of our responsibility to the railways and the people of Australia-that awesome responsibUity that accompanies the spending of pubUc money. We cannot, and will not, divorce the responsibility for raising funds from the spending of them, because this has in the past givenriseto exaggerated claims by the States on the one hand, and an escapist attitude on the part of the Federal Government on the other. I am convinced that merely pouring additional funds into an outmoded and an inefficient system would have the effect of perpetuating, perhaps even increasing, its problems and that a new and co-ordinated approach is required for the nation as a whole to benefit. (Quorum formed) Already major transport projects undertaken by the Australian Government are subjected to rigorous cost-benefit analysis the Bureau of Transport Economics, to determine whether they are economically justified and to give them some order of priority. It is intended to apply the same strict standards to major railway investments. Railways not only represent a physical investment but they also represent a human investment. Many men and women devote their working lives to the railways and they have collectively formed some of the finest traditions in government service. Only recently in a flood waymen repaired a major washaway on the Trans-Australian Railway, and in at Mrd of the time it was expected to take; at the Finke ing on the Central Austraha fine men have often worked up to their waists in water and at personal risk to themselves to get trains through. There are many other similar examples I could cite. These traditions should be maintained as they are important to the morale and the overall efficiency of the railways. In an organisation as large as the Australian National Railways will become-wit h over an estimated 14 000 employees-individual s can feel lost. Also during a time of change, as will prevail during the amalgamation of the South Australian, Tasmanian and Commonwealth railways there is often a feeling of insecurity. For this reason, the ciples to Govern the Transfer' of the raUways, which were tabled in Parliament, contained specific provisions to guarantee the jobs of present employees and that the terms and conditions of employment would be no less favourable than those that presently appUed. Also the Bill before the House makes provision to ensure that employees' superannuation, long service leave, sick leave and other entitlements are maintained. I am also arranging for detailed discussions with the Australian Council ofTrade Unions and officers of railway unions to establish methods of consultation and Uaison which ensure all railwaymen and women are fully informed on the progress of the transfer. Already trade union officials have been involved in the official discussions which led to the agreement to transfer the SAR and TGR. These trade union officials made a significant contribution to the transfer discussions through their detailed knowledge of industrial matters. (Quorum formed) The South Australian Railways at present operate extensive urban rail services in the Adelaide metropolitan area. These railways have in the past been integrated into the total operations of the South Australian Railways and in many cases metropolitan fines provide the means for country and by freight trains to enter the urban area. The staff that man these lines are SAR employees. The South Australian Government has decided to retain the SAR metropolitan railways, because it sees a need to co-ordinate all urban passenger transport under one authority. The metropolitan lines South Australia will retain are described in Schedule One to the Agreement. Obviously, as a result of the South Australian decision arrangements will have to be made for ANR trains any to work in and out of the metropoUtan area, and railspecific arrangements are made in the Agreement to cover such operational areas as running and servicing. However, the staff to man the Cross- metropoUtan system wiU be ANR employeesMr Nixon- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. This is getting awfully monotonous.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.",35
128,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS,"However, the staff shops to man the metropolitan system will be ANR employees who will work under the general digeneral rection of the State Transport Authority. This means that all SAR employees will be transferhaving red to the ANR. This arrangement offers advanas tages for both the Australian National Railways and the State Transport Authority as it prevents duplication of manpower resources, personnel and training facilities. It also enables the ployees of the ANR to continue to enjoy the Agreement. social advantages of living in a large city as well as leaving the present career patterns of many railway employees unchanged. The unions concerned were involved in the discussion on this matter, and have agreed with the proposal. I now turn to the more important provisions the Bill. To assist honourable members in sidering the Bill, I am having circulated explanasocial tory notes which briefly discuss the purpose of each of its clauses and the paragraphs of the Agreement which accompany it. The Bill prothe vides the legislation necessary for the Agreement signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the Premier of South Austraha to come into eration, on the basis of the 'Principles to Govern the Transfer of the non-metropolitan South AusIt tralian Railway system to the Australian Government', which papers were tabled in Parwe liament on 9 April 1975. The Agreement itself contained in the Schedule to the Bill. At present the South Australian Railways staff is over 8300 strong. Obviously it will taketimeto transfer these employees to Australian Government employment. Consequently it is planned have an mterim period of about one year comlished mencing on 1 July 1975 when aU assets-land property, rights and interests-and liabilities of the non-metropoUtan railways will be vested in the Australian National Railways Commission, as provided for in clause 5. During this interim period the State authorities-that is, the Transport Authority and the SAR Commisrelating sioner-wi U operate the railways subject to the direction of the Australian National Railways, and this arrangement is provided for in clause of the Agreement. It was recognised at a very early stage of negotiations on the transfer that because of the imporservices tant role the railways play in the State's economy there would need to be provision in any agreemetropolitan ment for the State to have some influence over the future operations of the railways. This need is met directly by clause 9, which requires the agreement of the State Minister to any proposed closure of lines or reduction in services. A similar arrangement has been made in relation to workwhere the approval of the State Minister for Transport is required to any reduction in the level of staff by reason of redundancy. Indirectly, the State is provided with a means of its voice heard in operations of the ANR, South Australia has the right to nominate a part-time Commissioner to the ANR Commission for two 5-year terms. The appointment will be subject to the approval of the Minister for emTransport and is provided for in clause 10 of the Obviously, even with the best will in the world, differences of opinion may arise relating to the operation of the railways. Clause 23 of the Agreement provides for arbitration in relation to of specific areas of railway operations. (Quorum conformed) Tbis provision recognises the unique role railways play in not only the lives of people but also those of communities, for in his deliberations the arbitrator can take into account social and community as well as the economic factors affecting a particular disagreement. States have always looked upon their railways as opa means of influencing State development, the main tool used being concessional railway rates. would be irresponsible on the part of both the Australian and South Australian Governments if were to reach an agreement which failed to is take into account the position of railway users who had made commercial investments and business decisions based on existing freight rates. To meet this situation clause 8(1) provides that 'where, in general, fares, freight rates and other to charges at the commencement date have estaba relative advantage to the users, that , advantage shaU not be diminished'. Honourable members will remember that in the debate on the Australian National Railways Bill I accepted an amendment proposed by the State honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Nixon) to the ancillary services that the Commission can engage in. The definition of 'services' contained in clause 1 of the Agreement has 6 been drawn with the honourable member's amendment in mind for it defines 'services' as 'services including passenger and freight road that are incidental or supplementary to, or are operated in association with the nonrailways'. I draw this to the attention of honourable members particularly when they come to consider clause 13 of the Agreement which covers services associated with nonmetropolitan railways. The financial aspects of the Agreement are dealt with in Part IV of the Agreement, in clauses 18, 19, 20 and 21. Clause 18 provides for a payment to South Australia of $10m prior to the commencement date of the Agreement. Clause 19 provides for the taking over by the Australian Government of an agreed portion of the State's debt. Clause 20 arises out of the interim period when the State authorities will operate the nonmetropolitan railways on behalf of the Australian Government. In effect the clause provides that any losses on operations will be funded by the Australian Government and similarly any profits will be paid to the Australian Government. Clause 21 sets out the principles to be observed in respect of the transfer of investments from the State to the Australian Superannuation Fund. FinaUy I would Uke to stress the importance of co-operation to the success of the transcessions fer program on the part of governments, unions and railway management. Problems will arise, and they are to be expected in a program as large as this, but they can be resolved if a spirit of understanding prevails. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Street) adjourned. RAILWAYS (TASMANIA) BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Charles Jones, and read afirsttime.",36
129,Mr CHARLES JONES,PAIRS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I present the Railways (Tasmania) Bill 1975 which is to approve the Agreement for the transfer of the Tasmanian Government Railways to the Australian Government. The Agreement is based on the 'Principles to Govern the Transfer of the Tasmanian Government Railway System to the Australian Government' which were tabled in the Australian Parliament on 23 April 1975 and in the Tasmanian Parliament on 1 May 1975.1I have already outlined in my speech on the Railways (South Australia) Bill the reasons behind the Government's rail transfer program, and the Agreement contained in the present Bill is basically along similar Unes to the South Australian Agreement. I am having circulated to honourable members explanatory notes to assist them in consideration of this Bill. The Agreement which is embodied in the Schedule to the Bill provides for an interim period commencing on 1 July when the Australian Government acceptsfinancialresponsibility for the Tasmanian Railways and has the assets of the rattways vested in it. The interim period will terrninate with the transfer of the raUway staff to the Australian National Railways Commission. During this period the Tasmanian Transport Commission will administer the raUway on behalf of the Australian National Railways, but subject to the direction and control of the ANR. The Agreement also provides for the Australian National RaUways to operate ancillary services in Tasmania and extend its raUways where necessary. Provision is also made for the continuation of concessions presently available on the railways if the State so requests, provided the State meets the same proportion of their cost as it provided before the transfer. In the case of a dispute arising between the Australian and Tasmanian Governments on payments for conand cessation of services on the railway, provision has been made for settlement by arbitration. However, there are a number of provisions in the Bill which are directly related to Tasmania's circumstances. Because of the importance of sea trade to Tasmania and the Government's declared intention to see greater co-ordination between the ANR and the Australian National Line, provision has been made for Tasmanian nominees to join both the Australian Shipping Commission and the Australian National Railways Commission. Both these appointments will Second Reading be subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport and are provided for in clause 9 of the Agreement. At present the Tasmanian Transport Commission operates the Precision Tool Annexe at Launceston. Although its buildings are situated on railway land the Annexe is not part of the railway's operations. Consequently, it has been decided that the Annexe will remain with the Tasmanian Government. Clause 19 provides for this and for the eventual removal of the Annexe from railway land, possibly within 10 years. Obviously thefinancialaspects of the transfer Agreement with Tasmania differ from those agreed to with South Australia as the Tasmanian railways are much smaUer. The number of railway employees to be transferred to ANR employment are correspondingly fewer. South Australia as distinct from Tasmania is a 'claimant State' and the debt structures of the 2 raUways differ considerably. Thefinancialaspects of the Tasmanian Agreement are dealt with in clauses 14,15,16 and 17. Clause 14 provides for a payment to Tasmania of $5m in consideration for land, minerals and other assets when both the Australian and Tasmanian parliaments ratify the necessary legislation to approve the Agreement. (Quorum formed) Clause 15 provides for the taking over by the Australian Government of a specified portion of the railways debt. Clause 16 refers to the mterirn period, during which any losses on the railways will be borne by the Australian Commission and any profits will be paid to the Australian Commission. Clause 17 is intended to ensure continuity of superannuation to any transferred employees. I commend the Bill to honourable members.  adjourned. TASMANIA GRANT (ASSOCIATED PULP AND PAPER MILLS LIMITED) BILL Bill presented by Mr Enderby, and read a first time.",37
130,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS,"Canberra-Attorney General and Minister for Police and Customs)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to seek the approval the Parliament to pay to Tasmania, in accordbe ance with the provisions of section 96 of the traUan Constitution, a sum not exceeding $650,000. Such payments are to be made in return for Tasmania providingfinancialassistpany ance to Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd, subject to that company in turn mattaining emaccumulation ployment at agreed levels. Briefly, the background to this matter is as lows: Last year concern was expressed regarding a possible shortage of printing papers. As a consequence, considerable quantities imported, whilst at the same time Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd-the only Australian manufacturer of fine papers for printing and writing purposes-wa s also experiencing a high level of demand. Towards the end of 1974 it came apparent that very high levels of stocks were held by merchants and users offinepaper, and as a result orders for further suppUes from the local suppUer feU away dramatically. quently, APPM Ltd found its inventories of paper rising sharply. An inquiry by the Temporextreme ary Assistance Authority found that the company was not at present being threatened by imports, and the Government accepted the recommendafinancial tion of the Authority that emergency protection against imports should not be applied. Orders on the company have continued at very low leveis throughout 1975, and orders have been at a level considerably below the company's production. The company found that it was impossible to continue to amass stocks and was faced with the necessity of closing down large sections of its plant, which would have had particularly sudden and serious consequences in employment and social terms in the areas in which these plants are located, both for the families directly concerned and the many others indirectly dependent upon the company and its employees. Alternative employment opportunities in the areas concerned are very limited, and the particular areas which would be affected are heavily dependent on the company's operations. The Government considered it desirable that all steps 1975 reasonably possible to avoid such a serious situation should be taken. Because of thefindingsin the report of the Temporary Assistance Authority it was clear that assistance through the tariff Second Reading was not appropriate. Because of the very high level of stocks held by the company, it has reduced operations in the coating plant of one mill from a 7-day to a 5-day week, and at other locations is working 3 weeks of in every four. This has enabled retrenchments to kept to a minimum, but still results in proAusduction in excess of demand. To permit a reasonable level of operations to continue, it is proposed that Tasmania will reimburse the comfor interest actually paid, up to a maximum of $650,000, on a loan necessary tofinancethe of additional stocks. Tasmania will then be reimbursed by the Australian Government. These payments will only be made if the folMinister for Manufacturing Industry is satisfied as to the reasonable maintenance of employment levels and other conditions, such as the provision were of necessary information. I draw the attention of honourable members to clause 5 of the Bill. Apart from retrenchments resulting directly from the reduction in throughbeput I have mentioned, the company cannot, in terms of the agreement, undertake further retrenchment of employees before 31 December 1975 without the express agreement in writing of Consethe Australian and Tasmanian Governments. Such agreement would only be contemplated in circumstances, such as if stocks continue to rise and reach a level beyond which further stock accumulation would be untenable. The assistance proposed by this Bill is exceptional in nature to meet exceptional circumstances. It is not intended to be a generalised form of assistance. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Edwards) adjourned. NA NA AGREEMENT BILL 1975",38
131,Mr MORRISON,COMMUNICATION STATION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to an exchange of notes concluded on 21 March 1974 between the Prime Minister (Mr Whidam), as Acting Foreign Minister, and Mr Marshall Green, the United States Ambassador, acting on behalf of our respective Governments. The exchange of notes was tabled on 20 November last. It amends the Agreement of 9 May 1963 between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America relating to the establishment of a United States naval communication station in Australia. The exchange of notes followed discussions which the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) had in Washington in January 1974 with the United States Secretary of Defence, Mr Schlesinger. As they stated at the time, they agreed that the exchange of letters of 7 May 1963 between the United States Ambassador, Mr Battle, and the Australian Minister for External Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick, relating to this subject was no longer necessary. The new exchange of notes provides for 3 amendments to the 1963 Agreement. An amendment to article 1 of the Agreement provides that the station at North West Cape shall be operated jointly while amendment to article 2 limits United States Navy exclusive occupation to a national room and provides for a similar Australian national room. The land use arrangement under the 1963 Agreement is amended to reflect the changed conditions of use and occupancy. An amendment of Article 14 of the Agreement provides that the Australian Government will meet only the costs directly associated with the location of the Royal Australian Navy at the station, such as salaries, allowances and accommodation. An Australian Deputy Commander took up duty at North West Cape on 19 July 1974 whUe a Royal Australian Navy contingent of 47 officers and men will be posted to the station before the end of next month. Fourteen of these wiU man the Australian communications centre. I commend the Bill to honourable members.  adjourned. NA 1974 [No. 2] Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.

132,Mr DALY,AUSTRALIA," I move: That (he amendments be disagreed to. This is the third time this Bill, the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, has been before this House. The Bill was first passed by this House on 25 November 1974 and was unceremoniously rejected by the Senate on 28 November 1974. It seemed that this Bill was to suffer the same fate as so many other Government Bills, the enactment of which has been frustrated by the Liberal-National Country Party dominated Senate. However, we were offered a new ray of hope in our efforts to reform the Australian electoral system. The Opposition parties, clothed in the security of their new Leader, decided to adopt a more constructive approach. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) explained to the Australian pubUc that the Opposition would accept 'nearly two-thirds of the 76 clauses in the Bill'. However, when debate on this Bill resumed in the House of Representatives on 10 April of this year the Opposition presented, at the eleventh hour, a list of 47 amendments which if approved would have the effect of deleting virtually every significant reform which the Government proposed to enact. (Quorum major formed) Provisions in the Bill to provide for the introduction of optional preferential voting, registration of political parties, the printing Party affiliations on baUot papers, the drawing for positions on the House of Representatives ballot paper, reforms to postal voting propose cedures, the closing of the poU at 6 p.m. to tate speed in counting would have been all deallows leted by the Opposition's proposed amendments. Of course many of the trivial provisions were proudly sponsored. When this Government any came to power on 2 December 1972 it immeditunately, ately set about a long overdue reform of the traUan electoral laws-law s that had helped one government to stay in power for the previous years and which had helped to keep the Ausprehend. traUan Labor Party out of power for a total of years of the previous 70-odd years since FederSenate ation. It was widely known that this situation come about as a result of manipulation of elecThe toral boundaries drawn so as to over-represent areas where the present Opposition parties just received their support, as a result of skilful ploitation of the preferential voting system, and abuses of postal voting procedures, and as a result of the ineffective representation of Territions tories in this Parliament. It is hardly necessary for me to point out that every attempted reform of the electoral system that this Government has sought to introduce has been frustrated at every turn by the Opposition Parties. They are bent on the continuation of features of the electoral system which are well known to work in their favour. It was even necessary to appeal to the people at a double dissolution to achieve the passage of a Bill to get some semblance of equality in the numerical strength of the electoral divisions. Over the past few weeks, redistribution proposals based on this simple democratic principle have been laid before this House. The Opposition Parties' attitudes to those proposals are quite predictable. These same proposals have been described in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 4 March 1975, by Mr Malcolm Mackerras, the Opposition's own adviser on electoral matters, as 'a fair redistribution ' which was destined to be' torpedoed' in the interests of the Opposition Parties. In an article in the 'Bulletin' of 26 April 1975 entitled 'Sweet reason kills the electoral bill' that same gentleman described the Opposition's current attitude to the electoral laws amendment Bill as 'phoney' and described the Opposition amendments as 'a massive emasculation of the Bill'. Let us consider in more detail some of the provisions of the Bill which the Opposition has deleted in the Senate. Firstly, the most significant reform proposed of the Australian electoral system since 1949 is the Government's prothe posal to introduce optional preferential voting of for Federal elections. It is well known that the full preferental voting procedure was introduced in 1918 for Federal elections for the specific purof frustrating the electoral successes of the faciliAustraUan Labor Party. It is a system which the Tory parties in Australian politics to subdivide into numerous factions, as they have done so many times in the past, without suffering penalty for their disunity at the polls. Unforthe complexity of the full preferential Ausvoting procedure, particularly when it is combined with proportional representation in Senate 23 elections, is too much for many people to comThe result is an inevitably high level of 55 informal voting in Senate elections. At the last elections on 18 May 1974, the informal had vote, Austraha-wide, averaged 10.77 per cent. significance of thisfigurecan be appreciated when it is realised that any candidate receiving over 9 per cent of the vote in any particular exState would have been elected to the Senate. Of course we know that various right wing facin Australian politics did their utmost to frustrate the clear expression of the people's voice at those elections. By encouraging a proliferation of the number of candidates they sought to confuse electors and so increase the number of informal votes. The Opposition Parties know full well the superiority of the optional preferential voting procedure over the present system. They themselves introduced that procedure for Advisory Council elections in the Australian Capital Territory and they themselves selected the optional preferential procedure for the people of Papua New Guinea. Why is it that the optional preferential procedure is suitable for the people of the Australian Capital Territory and Papua New Guinea but it is not suitable for the Australian electorate? Let us consider some of the advantages that would flow from the introduction of optional preferential voting in Australian elections. It would allow a significant extension of the choices available to the voters. This would occur because optional preferential voting is perhaps the only electoral procedure in the world which allows electors to express indifference between candidates. It maintains all of the choices open to electors under the full preferential system but expands this range of choice by not forcing electors to vote for candidates about whom they know nothing, or towards whom they are positively hostile. It would simplify the act of voting, and would reduce substantially the informal vote, particularly in Senate elections. In my own Division of Grayndler, an informal vote of 16.1 per cent was recorded at the Senate elections last year and that figures was even higher in some other divisions. The time is overdue for change - a change to a more democratic electoral system which would not disfranchise such a large number of voters. There were more than three-quarters of a million informal votes at the May 1974 Senate elections-79 8 126 to be precise. Is that democracy? The Opposition has claimed that the introducpresent tion of optional preferential voting would virdrawing tually amount to a reversion to a first-past-theof post system. This is an irresponsible and misleadcurrently ing claim. At the recent election for the ACT Legislative Assembly, for example, only 2.63 cent of the ballot-papers in the Division of Cansition berra and 6.19 per cent of the ballot-papers in the Division of Fraser, were excluded from the count as exhausted. At the recent election for Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, only 4.50 per cent of the ballot papers were excluded from the count as being exhausted. The Oppoexample, sition is well aware of these facts, yet it continues to attempt to mislead the Australian people by false claims. The Opposition has also told us the optional preferential procedure will help the Australian Labor Party stay in power for the next 100 years. The elections for the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory Legislative Assemblies have amply demonstrated that this procedure does not favour the Australian Labor Party. It is a fair system. That is why honourable members opposite oppose it. Let us now consider another major provision of the Bill which the Opposition Parties have deleted in the Senate-the registration of political parties for the purposes of identification and the printing of affiliations on ballot papers. This provision was inserted in the Bill essentially for the purpose of clarifying the choices open to electors when they cast their votes. The Opposition's deletion of this provision is the most blatant example of the totally cynical attitude with which the Liberal and Country Parties approach this important legislation. They know that in general it is the underprivileged sections of the community who are more prone to confusion when asked to fill out a complicated ballot paper. They know that such people have always supported the policies of the Australian Labor Party because it believes in an egalitarian society. That is the cynical reason why the Liberal and Country Parties oppose any attempt to simplify and clarify the act of voting. It would seem that the candidates sponsored by the Liberal and Country Parties are ashamed of their political affiliations and do not want them printed on the ballot paper alongside their names. Perhaps they would regard this as a severe handicap! I am quite sure that no candidate sponsored by the great Australian Labor Party would be ashamed to have the name of the Australian Labor Party listed on the ballot paper beside his or her name. Further conclusive proof, if it were needed, of the Opposition's cynical attitude towards the Bill is provided by its opposition to the for positions on ballot papers at House Representatives elections. This is the method used for Senate elections. Logically it should be extended to cover House of Represenper tatives elections as well. However, the OppoParties have exploited the present alphabetical principle so as to ensure that their candidates are placed on the ballot papers ahead of the the Australian Labor Party's candidates so that they may obtain the benefit of what is often called the 'donkey' vote. At the 1974 election, for the Opposition Parties chose their candidates so as to gain maximum benefit from the exploitation of the alphabetical system in those that divisions in which the result was likely to be close. At the 1974 House of Representatives election in 26 out of 37 of those divisions which could be said to be marginal-that is, where the winning margin, after allowing for either actual or notional distribution of preferences, was under 5 per cent-the candidates sponsored by the Opposition Parties were placed higher on the ballot paper than candidates sponsored by the Australian Labor Party. At the 1972 House of Representatives election, candidates sponsored by the Opposition Parties were ranked ahead of the Australian Labor Party's candidates on the ORDER OF CANDIDATES ON BALLOT-PAPERS Divisions where LP, CP, or DLP Candidate was listed ahead of ALP Candidates COOKDobie, James Donald Mathieson Dunphy, Milo Kanangra Gallagher, Ronald James Thorburn, Ray William EDEN-MONAROBell, Jonathan Albin Brewer, Ronald Alfred St Clair Hughes, Keith Daniel Whan, Robert Bruce EVANSAbel, John Arthur Flottmann, Paul Vernon MCGarity, John Ernest Mulder, Allan William HUMEGedye, John Maxwell Lusher, Stephen Augustus Olley, Frank Thomson, Grayham James LOWEDouglass, Bronte Norman MCMahon, William Poulsen, Bent Erik Sutherland, Douglas William LYNEHaig, David Addison Lucock, Philip Ernest Reed, Kenneth Warren PARRAMATTABarker, Derek Leslie Mackenzie, Robert Ian Ruddock, Philip Maxwell Wilde, Barry Charles PATTERSON Fowler, Robert William Morris 0 'Keefe, Frank Lionel Unicomb, Noel Victor PHILLIPCunningham, John William Riordan, Joseph Martin Taylor, David Anthony Walker, Virginia Clare baUot paper in 26 out of 32 such divisions.

134,Mr DALY,CDGS,"I thank the Committee. Obviously, thosefiguresare not the result of chance, but rather of a policy of deliberate exploitation of the alphabetical listing system. Naturally, the Opposition Parties would not like to see that system replaced by one that is fair to all candidates. The Opposition's cynical approach to this Bill is again demonstrated by its rejection of the provisions in the Bill for the reform of the postal ing procedures. It is well known that the present procedures are open to abuse by party workers. A common form of abuse is for party workers to compile lists of electors who voted by post at the previous election and then forward to all such people semi-completed postal vote application forms in the hope of influencing voters to support a particular party. One has only to look at the percentage of postal votes which favour the Liberal and Country Parties to realise which parties are responsible for most of these abuses. The Government has proposed to inhibit such malpractices by preventing party workers from examining the lists of names of postal voters, except when this is absolutely necessary for an inquiry into an alleged or suspected contravention of the Act or for a petition to a Court of Disputed Returns. We have proposed to give the Chief Australian Electoral Officer power to vary the form of postal vote applications at each election to prevent the dubious practice of stockpiling partially completed forms. The Opposition has opposed or amended both of those proposals. The Australian pubUc was somewhat indignant, and rightly so, at the time taken to finalise the results of the House of Representatives and Senate elections held in May 1974. The Government therefore proposed to alter the provisions of the Act in relation to postal voting with a view to earUer finaUsation of election results. We aimed at an eartier deadline for receipt of applications for postal votes and an earUer deadline for the receipt of completed postal votes by the appropriate returning officer. Taken together, these proposals would have reduced the time taken for the processing of election results by some weeks. Once again, the Opposition has cynically rejected these proposals in the interests of narrow Party advantage. The same sad comment must also be made on the Opposition's attitude to the Government's proposal to close the poll at 6 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. This measure would have enabled an earUer posting of progressive figures on polling night and would have increased the probability that, by the end of counting on that night, the result of the election would be fairly clear. We proposed only an arrangement that was already practised by the well known radical, Mr Joh BjelkePetersen, in the Queensland State elections. I have already made reference to the deliberate attempt to confuse electors at the 1974 elections by means of a nomination of a very large number of candidates. The results of this campaign were particularly noticeable on the New votSouth Wales Senate ballot papers where voters were required to rank up to 73 candidates. The Government proposed to raise the deposit necessary for candidates at Senate elections to $1,000. This would have effectively reduced the number of frivolous candidates, without affecting the candidates of the major political parties, and enabled more electors to register a formal vote. The Opposition parties rejected this proposal, thereby leaving the deposit for Senate candidates at $250.I am sure that everyone will be able to draw their own conclusions from these tactics. There are other examples which I could quote to demonstrate the degree to which the Opposition's amendments have effectively nullified virtuaUy aU the major reform proposals contained in the Bill. However it would be just one long, sad story, further detaUing the cynical approach which the Opposition parties take to this important Bill- a Bill aimed at reducing malpractices, simplifying and clarifying the act of voting, and a speedierfinaUsationof election results. The Government is dedicated to a just and equitable electoral system. It is basic to our democratic society. The Liberal Party and the National Country Party, by their opposition to all proposals for electoral reform, clearly indicate to the Australian public that they believe in 'gerrymandering', 'loaded' electorates, and outdated and unjust electoral procedures. By their actions and their votes in this House and in the Senate, they stand convicted on this charge. The Government will not accept such Opposition emasculation of this piece of major legislation and it is now inevitable that the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill 1974 will join the long list of BUls providing the Government with grounds for another double dissolution.",51
135,Mr GARLAND,CDGS,"The speech just deUvered by the Minister in charge of electoral laws, the Minister for Services and Property (Mr Daly), was not, as listeners would know, a dispassionate, rational view of electoral laws and the amendments proposed by the Government in the Bill. It was a very partisan speech. I think he displayed, by his demeanour and tone, the partisan attitude which he takes on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to this Bill and to the amendments made by the Senate. He spoke of the unceremonious defeat of the original Bill in 1974, without explaining that it was rammed through this House, that little time was given to the Senate to consider its far reaching provisions and that it was one of a number of far reaching Bills which had to be considered in that week. So the Opposition had to deal with it in short order. He did not explain that we went into the amendments which we proposed to the Bill in great detail both in this House and subsequently in the Senate when the Bill was re-presented. He said that I produced, on behalf of the Opposition, at the eleventh hour, as he put it, 47 amendments to the Bill. What a misrepresentation that was, and it was only one of many. Those 47 amendments were put to the Government in the same way as amendments are put to this House by the Government and the Opposition each time that amendments are proposed - namely , when the Committee stage of the Bill is reached. I invite the Leader of the House to adjourn debate of the Bill until there istimefor the amendments to be considered by bim. I had hoped that he might take a reasonable approach to some of the amendments-if not all of themand that he might agree to some of them. But he went on implacably. The reason he went on implacably was that, taken as a whole, the Bill without the amendments is highly favourable to one Party in this Parliament-the Australian Labor Party. It is a partisan Bill, in the main, and of course the Opposition will contest it. A number of amendments to which the Opponot sition agreed were referred to somewhat briefly by the Minister. I invite him to introduce a Bill containing only those amendments so that we improvements in the law which are agreed to by both sides of the Parliament. After all, surely there is something to be said, the electoral laws, of an endeavour to get all parties to agree to amendments and not have this confrontation and these arguments backwards and forwards in which the Minister indulges. He takes the attitude 'take it or leave it; this we want'. I should like to examine quickly some of the points involved. Although the Minister had unlimited time in which to canvass these matters I have very timited time. The Minister said that the existing laws helped to keep the Australian Labor Party out of office. Of course, it was elected under those laws in the 1972 election and again in the 1974 election so the laws cannot be so very biased. In his speech the referred to reform. That is a matter of definition. It is apparently reform if it heips the Australian Labor Party, and regression and reaction if it helps the other parties. He talked about abuse of the postal vote system. If the Minister wishes, I wiU give him the names of some Labor Party candidates who have indulged in just that abuse which he claims to find so abhorrent. Let me just point outMr Riordan-Who are they?",51
136,Mr GARLAND,CDGS,I will tell the honourable member if he presses me hard enough but I do not think that it is proper to do so without warning. Mr Riordan-Why do you not elaborate on it?,52
137,Mr GARLAND,CDGS,"If the honourable member will move that I be granted an extension of time when it runs out in 6 minutes, I will be happy to elaborate on it. In the last election the Australian Labor Party received 49 per cent of the vote and a small majority of five in this House. That is close enough. Why do we need to have such large scale changes as are suggested here? Why do we need changes in boundaries which, of course, would give the Australian Labor Party in most of the States a potential proportion of seats greatly in excess of the Party's potential proportion of votes, if we base that on thefiguresat the last 2 elections in 1972 and 1974. The Minister employed a very basic debating trick which I must immediately demolish. He referred to Mr Mackerras and said he was the adviser of the Opposition. I want to tell the Minister that Mr Mackerras is not an adviser to me. Mr Mackerras knows full well that usually I do agree with him but he is, of course, entitled to his own views. To try to say that somehow or other we take notice of the views put forward by get Mr Mackerras and then in the next breath to read an article in which he criticised the arguments I used, is surely stretching that debating in matters affecting trick too far. The Minister talked about the very high informal votes in the Senate. Of course, the Labor Party introduced that system. Surely to heaven, it is what would be a brave man who would try to claim that a change in the system will really reduce very much the number of informal votes. It sounds a great number the way the Minister put it but actually it is a rather moderate percentage. Although he talked about right wing candidates and all that sort of emotive stuff, the fact of the matter is that the informal vote percentage on the last election was not greatly different from Minister that in previous elections. He talked about the election result in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in respect of the optional preference system which, of course, is the Labor Party's first step towards a first past the post system. The Australian Labor Party has long wanted that. It has changed its policy between the 2 of these alternatives. It does not like the full preference system that we have. Why does not the Government like it? What is unfair about the system which we have had for so long and which so many countries regard as highly desirable? It gives each voter a final choice between the 2 most favoured candidates. That is what the full preferential voting system does. The optional preference system certainly will give the Labor Party a small edge-no t big enough to win in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, where it went down so badly. In a close election it would mean a few per cent in the Labor Party's favour, and that is aU it is interested in. I said that there are a number of far-reaching proposals in this legislation. They have been debated. The Minister reviewed them. In the few moments left to me I want just to refer to them so that those who are listening and those who are interested may understand that the Opposition has well based objections to these matters. They are based on the reasons I have given. The Labor Party seeks what it calls reform in order to help itself at election time. It seeks to prevent the counting of postal votes after the polls close on polUng night-no t in the least in order to get a quick result, but because it is sure on past records that those votes will not favour the Labor Party. Is that so bad? Those votes are from Australian citizens. Surely those who are in isolated regions, or those who are sick or for some other reason cannot get to a polling booth, should have a reasonable opportunity to have their votes counted. Many of their votes would not be counted under this system because there would not be time, particularly with the mail service run by this Government, for the votes to get to the appropriate polling booths so that they could be checked and counted in the usual way. The Government wants to have the names of poltiical parties on the baUot papers to help itself. It has set up a structure in which the deterCass, M.H. mination of this matter is to be done not by the courts or by an independent body but by an electoral officer, a servant of the Government. Mr Riordan-How do you know this?",52
138,Mr GARLAND,CDGS,"I said aU this when the matter was last debated in this chamber. If the . honourable member was listening-and I think he was-h e would have heard. I want it to be clear that this is a bad system. In the past we have had the experience of seeing our Party's name very nearly copied. Honourable members opposite know of that experience. They know that a lot of confusion can come about in this way. That is what is sought. It is a Labor Party attempt to create difficulties for the other parties. I pointed out in the previous debate on this matter that there is much to be said for a member coming to this place as an individual, no matter how much parties are involved. Surely it is important for a candidate, when he presents himself to his electorate, to have some personal attachments. I close my remarks by saying that the attempt in these proposed changes is to create a confrontation. If the Minister wishes to make those changes on which all sides are agreed, let him bring in a Bill containing those and split this Bill. To adopt some of his words, this is not a just and equitable Bill; it is a biased one in favour of the Labor Party. It would not result in reformdedicated to reform, though he claims to be; it would result in advantage to the Labor Party. I rest my case on the point that the present law allowed this Government to be elected twice; so it cannot be so bad.",53

NA 59 COMPENSATION BILL 1975 53 Second Reading 6 Debate resumed from 15 May on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",55
148,Mr CALDER,DARWIN CYCLONE DAMAGE,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. We seek to assist the citizens of Darwin who Cadman, A. G. Caims, Kevin have been battling to re-establish their homes and businesses and to get themselves back on their feet in their city. Speed has really always been essential. While speaking on this subject, I would like to thank the people of Australia and the Government for their early support for Darwin and its citizens. However, I want to refer to Mr Ron Withnall, an independent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly whom the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) referred to as the 'Northern Territory galah'. I spring to Mr Withnall's defence by saying that the Minister was most unfair in his criticism. Mr Withnall is a former Crown law officer. Mr Withnall was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Council for many years and is now a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. He did some very constructive work on the Darwin Reconstruction Commission Bill. I think the Minister for the Northern Territory was carried away when he made his remark. I hope he was because it is quite incorrect and completely wrong to call Mr Ron Withnall, M.L.A. a 'galah'. Mr Withnall did say that something had gone wrong with Darwin since the cyclone. The cyclone was a tragedy, but many people are now mclined to believe that the greater tragedy is following in the wake of that cyclone. To a great extent the present situation is result of Government mishandUng and politicking. Mr Withnall said that there is frustration despair in Darwin at the slowness of the Governamended, ment in its actions to get the business of the reconstruction of Darwin under way. Since the time when Mr Withnall wrote this letter, conadvising tracts have been let for the construction of houses. But confusion surrounds the situation in Darwin with respect to ownership of premises, and the people of Darwin have been denied real information as to building standards and the building code. Mr Withnall is quite right, as is the new mayor, Alderman Ella Stack, when they say that many people will leave Darwin and the morale there is low. Morale is low, but I the actions that have been taken and what will result from the passage of this Bill will give people of Darwin heart. I hope that the passage of this Bill will and the writing of the contracts will have that result. In the present situation shortages exist. Strikes have occurred. Tremento dous frustration is felt by the people throughout the city at this time. In my opinion, undue influence has been exerted by some Government servants, some Government supporters and by the Minister for the Northern Territory. I turn to clause 4 of the Bill, which really thrust of the measure. An amendment which I ister propose to move during the Committee stage is being circulated to honourable members. Clause 4, as it now stands, gives a tremendous power to the Minister. That power was vague as defined in this Bill when introduced in the Senate. Clause 4 provides that the Minister may authorise the payment by Australia-the Commonwealth Government, I imagine-in accordance with directions given by him, of compensation in respect of loss of, or damage to, property arising out of the cyclone. I might add that although many of the appropriate notices to this effect have appeared to the Press many, many people have not been able to get anywhere with regard to compensation for loss of or damage to property arising out of the cyclone. Nothing has happened. On occasions people have asked me to try to clarify the matter. I do not know that it has been clarified. Many people have said: 'We imagine that we have suffered from the cyclone but nothing has happened.' It was said by Senator Wheeldon, when he introduced the Bill into the Senate, that the Minister's powers will be delegated to persons acting on his behalf to determine to whom compensation may be paid, the amount of the compensation and how it will be assessed. In all those instances the decision is unexaminable by anybody and is without the appeal. This is why proposed new sub-clause and 4 (c) is worded as it is. If the proposal is not it gives very dangerous power, which I tliink is far too great, to the people who will advise the Minister. We do not know who will be the Minister. They could be members of 1300 his Department or members of a committee that has been set up or will be set up. Unless there is some form of appeal one does not know how the ordinary sufferer from the cyclone will get on. A similar situation has been instanced by the that recent announcement of the Minister for the think Northern Territory of the members of the Darwin Citizens Council, which was originally the the Darwin Citizens Advisory Council. It was notified in the Darwin Reconstruction Bill that there would be a Darwin Citizens Council to advise the Minister. I did not receive an answer the question I asked the Minister on this matter this morning despite the fact that I showed him a question I was unable to ask last Thursday and despite the fact that I was not able to speak to the amendment. In the case of the Darwin Citizens Council, 15 people have been appointed is the out of twenty who could be appointed. The Minhas thefinalsay just as the people appointed by him under the provisions of this Bill have the final say and the appointments cannot be changed. Of the 15 appointments to the Darwin Citizens Council four are interesting. One is President of the Northern Territory branch of the Labor Party in the in the Northern Territory, another is the Secretary of that body, another was a defeated Labor candidate at the elections of 19 October for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and another was a Labor organiser in the May elections last year. When the Darwin Reconstruction Bill was before the House the Minister mentioned the stacking of committees. This is very relevant because the Minister for the Northern Territory then said: There are plenty of reasons why a member of the Darwin Citizens' Council should be appointed by the Governor General in the same way as are other members of the mission. If one looks at the situation Commission could be stacked. In speaking to the same proposal I said: We believe that if members are appointed by the Governor General the Commission, to use the Minister's own words, could be stacked. So we are eagerly waiting to see what will happen. We have seen already that the Minister has stacked the Darwin Citizens Council. That is a Eioint which I wish to raise in relation to this egislation. I have spoken about it strongly. I believe that it could happen under this legislation. I think it is very unfortunate that just at the time when this legislation is going through the Parliament we learn about what has happened in relation to the Darwin Citizens Council. No explanation or reason has been given for it. Perhaps the reason is that those appointed to the Council happens to be members of the same poltiical party as the Minister. I do not think any members of the Majority Party are on it. I hope that what happened with the Darwin Citizens Council will not happen under the legislation we are now considering, and I hope that the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is in charge of this Bill, will assure me that this sort of thing will not happen. To ensure that it does not happen, on behalf of the people of Darwin, I am to move an amendment in the Committee stage. We feel that the people of Darwin must have a right of appeal. On the form of the Minister for the Northern Territory, it does not look as though they wiU have any right of appeal. I urge the Special Minister of State to consider seriously the amendment which has been circulated in my name and to give the people of Darwin thatrightof appeal. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (5.47)-The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) referred to some vagueness on the part of the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) when he was introducing this Bill. It appears to me that the honourable member snowed a good deal of vagueness himself when he was putting forward some reasons for his amendment. He made a lot of statements but produced very little evidence to support them. He said that there would be little right of appeal because of the form of the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson). It appears to me that the Minister for the Northern Territory has been bending over backwards to meet the requirements of the people of the Northern Territory. I think that on close examination the honourable member will find that the Minister, just to suit the wishes of the people in the NorthComern Territory, has altered many of the things he one can see that the intended to do. I am in support of the Darwin Cyclone Damage Compensation Bill. Together with the other measures that have been taken by the Australian Government, it proves the Government's sincere compassion and concern for the tragedy and the pUght of the Darwin people following Cyclone Tracy, which passed through Darwin on 25 December 1974. There can be no doubt that because of the extent of the damage, the loss of property, the suffering, personal injury and death, the compensation has been generous. Some people compare it with the assistance given in the tragic bushfireswhich were raging in New South Wales during the same period. I think this is a very unjust comparison, because it must be remembered that, whereas the Australian Government was able to give funds directly to the Northern Territory, funds appropriated in respect of the bushfireshad to be channelled through the States. In this regard the Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS) has already stated that at the time of the last Premiers Conference all thefinancethat the States had asked for had been given to them, and that they have not asked for anything further since. I believe there is another reason why there should not be any hold up in the passing of this Bill. I believe that the people of Australia themselves showed by their spontaneous action what they expected of the national Government. The donations they made indicated that it was expected that there would be some prompt action by the Australian Government. I think it is a tribute to the Australian people that they did respond so swiftly and generously to the plight of Darwin citizens. I am very pleased to be able to state that during that period in my electorate, when the whole of the western division of New South Wales was on fire with probably one of the worse bushfires in Australia's history, I was asked in 3 areas to open appeals for the people of Darwin. I think that was a mighty effort on the part of the people in those areas. I am particularly pleased about this legislation because as a member of the Joint the Northern Territory, which was set up to investigate and to report back to this Parliament on the forms of government for the Northern Territory, I visited Darwin both before and after cyclone Tracy. Even the most hard-hearted percyclone son would be shocked at the change in Darwin and the devastation which almost wiped out this great city. I can well understand the gigantic which the Department of Repatriation and ComJust pensation has in collecting information that necessary to enable it to estimate the number households, organisations and businesses which were in Darwin on Christmas Day. There is still confhcting evidence about the number of people who lost their lives. I think the work involved the assessment of property damage and the vision of compensation after such a short period reflects great credit on the Department. Neverthat the less a survey taken so soon after the disaster cannot be expected to be completely accurate. But I should not think this ought to hold up passage of the Bill because the main thing is get some assistance to these people. Cyclone Tracy had httle respect for private ownership. Anyone who inspected the area would have that household contents and whole houses had been lifted and dumped some kilometres away from their original location. The debris was twisted and tangled mess. Some of the debris had been carted away but there were still piles debris ready to be taken away when we were Darwin. In most instances all that one could see was rows and rows of cement piers with cement floors perched on top of them. There were no houses all. Some of the people had made temporary shelters underneath these floors. In other areas Darwin we could see small rusty houses with no apparent damage, other than perhaps some flying debris had knocked down a fence or caused damage of that kind. The people of Darwin to whom I spoke were full of praise for advertising campaign that the honourable memresettlement ber for the Northern Territory mentioned, and the assistance given by departmental officials was highly praised by people who were respondcongratulate ing to the survey. I found that they were very preciative of the additional investigation which was carried out in the States and in the provincial centres. There is no doubt that most of the affected by the cyclone will get the compensation to which they are entitled. Of course one will always hear stories that some people are taking advantage of the situation. There were some terrible stories circulating in Darwin, as always happens in a situation of this kind, but one could obtain litde evidence to support the claims that Committee on were being made. I feel that it is very important that the Bill should have a speedy passage through this House. Already in the little over 4 months since Tracy struck a good deal has been done to rehabilitate the city of Darwin and its people, and one must admire the great sense of co-operatask tion and self-help among the people themselves. visualise the number of sheets of new iron is and the number of nails which were required to of provide temporary protection. No doubt this was an outstanding effort. One could say that almost every man, woman and child at some stage must have been driving roofing nails into the roofs of in houses in Darwin. Of course, some of these prorepairs are only temporary; some of them are permanent. One lady to whom I spoke told me a gang of fettlers had put the roof back on her house and they did not even match the flutes. I must say that I could not see any work of that the nature although on many roofs the iron was not to trimmed off and was left overhanging. There is no doubt that a good bit of the work is temporary. It may not have to be done again but some seen adjustment will have to be made to it. There is much more to be done. The situation could be classed only as temporary. The real job a of rebuilding Darwin has hardly started. It is essential for this Bill to be passed as quickly as of possible because many Darwin people have had into leave their homes and their usual employment. Many families have left Darwin. Some of them say that they are not sure whether they will ever return. However, the vast majority of people whom I have contacted are very anxious to at return to Darwin and to resume normal family Ufe. It is obvious that they have undergone much in suffering and are still in very difficult circumstances. Without going too far, one could say that where they face a very uncertain future. The proposal before the House is not aimed at the the reconstruction of Darwin, nor at the of those who were resident there on 25 December 1974, but to a large degree it will recompense partially for what they have lost. I the Australian Government for its apprompt and meaningful action to compensate the people of Darwin and to rebuild that great city. I hope that the measure will not be delayed people unduly while we wrangle over some amendments which the Opposition always seems to want to move when we want to do something speedily for the people in Darwin to ease their great suffering. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Clauses 1 to 3-by leave-take n together, agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to.",55

151,The CHAIRMAN,DARWIN CYCLONE DAMAGE,"Is leave Minister granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",59
152,Mr CALDER,DARWIN CYCLONE DAMAGE,"I move: After clause 4, insert the following new clauses: '4A. Compensation shall be payable only to persons who(a) have suffered loss or damage to property as the cyclone; (b) make application in writing for compensation, and (c) give proof of possession, entitlement and loss age suffered. '4B. (1) Compensation shall be assessed on the basis market value of the property as at 24 December 1974. (2) Subject to the succeeding sub-sections, compensation in respect of any property (whether insured or not) one-half of so much of the loss or damage as is not by insurance. (3) The maximum amount of compensation in respect loss of, or damage to, a private dwelling (including a caravan used as a primary private property used for primary production is $25,000. (4) Compensation is not payable in respect of a private aircraft or in respect of a boat, other than a boat used as a primary dwelling. (5) Compensation in respect of personal possessions, including motor vehicles, caravans not used as primary dwellings, furniture and fittings, shall be determined on the basis of the possessions of members of a household and shall be subject to a maximum amount of $5,000 in respect of a household. (6) The maximum amount of compensation in respect of the business premises of a person is $25,000. (7) The maximum amount of compensation in respect of business plant, equipment and stock of a person (including crops and livestock in a business of primary production) is $50,000. '4c. A person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Minister or of a person authorized by the Minister in respect of a claim for compensation under this Act made by the person may appeal to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, which shall review the decision and either confirm, reverse or vary it.'. Proposed new clause 4c represents the thrust of my remarks in this debate. In the Bill there is no right for any citizen to appeal. As I said in the second reading debate, we consider that a citizen, whether in Darwin or anywhere else, has a right to appeal to someone. I point out to the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) that In Committee this is a similar amendment in thought to the and amendment which was accepted to the Darwin Reconstruction Bill. We managed to have a sensible amendment passed in relation to that Bill whereby the citizens could inspect the reconstruction plans which were to be on view for a month, and they were, and to which they could lodge objections. I think that the Government could be commended on the actions it took in I those circumstances. This is a very similar I would hope that the Government, including the honourable member for Wills and for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant), who visits Darwin from time to time for some reason or other, would support me in what I am saying. I suggest that there could be such a series of insurance claims that the Supreme Court could be overrun or flooded with litigation. I suggest a result of that what the amendment proposes would be only a temporary measure and that upon the or damimplementation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, it would take over from the Supreme of the Court. I emphasise that the citizen should have some right of appeal. I see that in another place the argument was used that such appeals could shall be be made to an ombudsman, but I point out that covered in the Ombudsman Bill it is stated that the ombudsman is not authorised to investigate of action taken by a Minister. So again, the deboat or cisions are made by the Minister, as is virtually dwelling) or premises on a every decision in relation to Darwin reconstruction. I ask that the Government take this amendment seriously. The people of Darwin are in a state of depression. They are worried about their future and need continuing consideration from this Government. I put it to the Government very seriously that it consider the insertion of clause 4c Of course, the rest of the amendments are virtually in line with thefiguresthat were cited by the Minister when he presented the original Darwin Reconstruction Bill.",59
153,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DARWIN CYCLONE DAMAGE,"The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment for the simple reason that what is not required, particularly in dealing with matters of this nature which require compassion, understanding and a certain amount of flexibility, is putting down in legal terms what will be the strict limitations person'srights.This matter has been the subject of debate already in the Senate where a similar amendment to this was not carried. It was proposed in the Senate by the insertion of one new clause to limit the amount of compensation to $25,000 in respect of business premises. me draw attention to some of the problems in the amendment proposed by the honourable mema ber for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder). He says that it would be much more satisfactory for the people of Darwin if these rules which he proare poses in his amendment were applied. Let us take one example of what could happen formed) if there were to be a strict interpretation of those rules. A fisherman who was using a boat for his livelihood would not receive compensation. Surely to goodness the honourable member for the Northern Territory does not want to put fisherman in a position in which he could compensated. That would be the result of his proposed sub-clause 4 (B) (4). It would also mean that the Minister could not give any than $25,000 as compensation. As I understand it, this is a problem in Darwin. While we will not debate this argument now, I understand that an insurance company has failed and a number of people who had insurance will not be receiving any money. We want to have someflexibilityin that situation for people who were prepared to insure. What we are proposing here is to accept the responsibility for half of the balance of loss in relation to uninsured property. We ought also to adopt some reasonable attitude of mind towards the people who did attempt to insure themselves and who, because their insurance their companies failed, are not able to get any comI pensation. The Government of its own volition and with understanding of the problems has already carlarly ried out a survey which indicates that 60 per cent of the people in Darwin were not insured. This Bill will give at least $58m to people who would otherwise have got nothing. The Minister for Repatriation and Compensation (Senator limited. Wheeldon) has indicated that already he has awaiting settlement about 1000 claims which could come within the provisions of this legislation. Surely no honourable member for the Northern Territory would want to say that these people should not be compensated quickly and efficiently. The honourable member for the Northern Territory was anxious to emphasise the point that the Minister might make a wrong decision will and that therefore there ought to be the right of of a appeal to the Supreme Court. But the honourable member did not put forward any guidelines as to the basis on which such an appeal would be made. The lawyers would have a feast if appeals were to be lodged on the basis suggested by the honourable member. For instance, what is meant Let by 'property' or 'household'? A particular interpretation might result in only one person in household getting compensation. Of course, two or three people could be occupying and sharing the personal effects in one household. There all sorts of difficulties that could arise in the settlement of these claims. For that reason, clause 4 gives the Minister a discretion. (Quorum I just emphasise this point: The same amendments, with the exception of the amendments that increases the maximum amount of compena sation and brings it into line with the $50,000 not be proposed by the Minister, were moved and rejected in the Senate. When the amendments were before the Senate the Opposition proposed more that the maximum amount of compensation be $25,000. For the reasons that I have mentioned",59
154,Mr CALDER,DARWIN CYCLONE DAMAGE,It was a typographical error.,60
155,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DARWIN CYCLONE DAMAGE,"It was not a typographical error. It is a problem of trying to put words into print. The honourable member has got himself into a situation in which many people will not get the compensation that the Minister the will now be able to give to them because of the legal interpretation that could be placed on the words of his amendment. This will apply particularly to people who did take out insurance but insurance companies failed; particularly, as mentioned, to people in the fishing industry who rely on boats for their livelihood and who, under the honourable member's amendment, would receive no compensation at all; particuwhere there is more than one person occupying a household because under this legislation they would not be so limited; and particularly in respect of a person who had an interest in more than one business and who also would not be so There are an infinite number of propositions that are not covered by the amendment. Let us come to the basic concept. The Government is prepared to give at least $58m to the people of Darwin who have no insurance cover. The Opposition should not restrict this offer. The Minister under clause 6 has to report to the Parliament and it is pretty obvious that if there is any complaint about what should be done the honourable member for the Northern Territory be the first to raise it in this House. Therefore matters relating to this legislation will be under surveillance. It is with compassionate understanding that we are anxious to get this legislation passed. It has already passed the Senate. There is no reason why the Opposition should obstruct it any further. Any obstruction will only delay consideration of the merits of the claims. For that reason we are most anxious that the Bill be passed this evening. Accordingly, the Government rejects the amendments.

156,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order ! The honourable 54 member for Deakin must not enter the House. 56 He was out of the House during the division. He must remain out while it is being counted. Question so resolved in the negative. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.,61
157,Mr CALDER,PAIRS," I refer to clause 6, which states that the Minister shall report to the House. We have already had Cass, M.H. Child, G. J.L. doubts expressed as to whether the Minister should have reported to the House concerning the affairs of the Darwin Cyclone Relief Trust Fund. To my way of thinking he should have presented a report to this House by now. Once again I have likened the occurrences in Darwin to the provisions of this Bill. If the form of the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Pattersson) is indicative of what will be the form of the Minister in this case-the only thing that we have to go on is the way in which he has behaved-on e has grounds for beginning to wonder whether in actual fact we will be getting the sort of reports Hurford.C.J. Innes, U. E that should be tabled in this House. The Opposition's amendment, which was not accepted by the Committee, was moved on behalf of the citizenry of the Northern Territory. It is also on behalf of the citizenry of the Northern Territory that I have brought this matter to the notice of the Committee.",61
158,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS," I want to make the point that the Minister about whom we are Mathews, C R. T. Morris, P. F. talking in this respect is not the Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson). The whole speech of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) seemed to have been devoted to the venting of some sort of spleen that Scholes, G. G.D. Stewart, F.E. he wanted to vent on a personal basis. I want to make the point that most of the honourable member's speech was out of order. We tolerated it for the people of the Northern Territory. We did not have to tolerate it because the honourable member was completely out of order in talking about those matters. As has been said time and time again the Minister referred to in the Bill is the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation (Senator Wheeldon). So let us get the debate in order. I think that the matter has been completely",61
159,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,My point is that we cannot rely upon it being done by the Minister who is in charge up there.,62
160,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I do not know whether the honourable member is aware of what he is saying, but the point is that clause 6 says that the Minister, which means the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation, shall make a report. That will be done. It is as simple as that. Remainder of Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen)-by leave-rea d a third time. HEALTH INSURANCE BILL 1975 Debate resumed from 13 May on motion by Mr Hayden: That the Bill be now read a second time.",62
161,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"The purpose of the Health Insurance Bill 1975 is to provide benefits for services by optometrists and to provide that these benefits be available under Medibank from 1 July 1975. The Opposition supports the Bill, although Opposition policy varies slightly from Government policy. I will point out the slight variations a little later in my speech. The Opposition does not seek to amend this Bill. Firstly I wish to make some general comments on Liberal-National Country Party policy and approach to the nation's health. There were a great number of initiatives in the 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government. One would not realise this fact if one listened to Government members in this House, particularly during the 12 months that I have been a member. One would think that all the initiatives in the health and welfare field had come in actual fact from the Australian Labor Party Government. Let me assure the people of this country that the Liberal-Country parties in government for 23 years initiated a great deal in this field. I refer the national health scheme, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and other schemes which were improved, amended and upgraded as the nation could afford them. So these social welfare benefits-pension s to the aged, the disabled, deserted mothers and their dependants, unemployment benefits and sickness benefits-were increased in proportion to what the nation could actually afford. The aim of the Liberal and Country parties, which is contrary to what this Government would lead the people of the nation to believe, is to provide for those in need. I want to stress this point: The Opposition in government has intentions to provide for those people who are in need not to create a giant welfare state. I think it is an important point. The Liberal-Country parties in government want to provide incentives for people in this country, to encourage free enterprise, to encourage the people of this nation to be industrious, to encourage a high rate of productivity and to seek full employment. Contrary to the views that are Third Reading expressed by a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) who is in the House at the moment and who so frequently says that the policy of the Opposition would be to retain a large percentage of unemployment, let me assure the Government and the Minister that it is not the policy of the Opposition to have unemployment. Second Reading I submit that the nation must look after those who are less fortunate than many of us-the unemployed, the sick, the accident victims, the aged, the disabled, the deserted mothers and their children-and not encourage the creation of more 'less fortunates' as appears to be the case with this Government. One of the dangers of the massive welfare programs that are, as I see them, the aims of the Labor Government, is that they will tend to create in this nation people who do not care or who do not have any incentive. There is a tendency as well for people to become lazy or to lose then purpose in life. The approach of this Government seems to be that it will think for people and that it will care for people. This attitude surely must be deplored. The result is that a person's brain tends to become inactive, his body tends to become inactive, and in turn the nation becomes inactive.",62
162,Mr COHEN,PAIRS,Liste n to Don Athaldo.,62
163,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Robertson interjects. He is rather inactive at the moment. I am sure that many of the electors in his electorate realise this fact. Serious repercussions could result. The nation could lose its standing in the world. It could lose business conto fidence. Business investment will slump. Risk capital will no longer flow. We have seen this particular situation arise in the last few weeks when the Government unsuccessfully tried to raise a $2,000m loan. This story will be repeated as far as Australia is concerned while we retain a Labor Government. The lenders in this world will not look favourably upon Australia when it comes to lending money. So, the nation wiU stagnate. This Government frequently claims that the Liberal-Country Party CoaUtion did very httle in the 23 years it was in Government.",62
164,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I suggest the honourfor able gentleman might relate his remarks to the Health Insurance Bill which is a fairly narrow measure.,63
165,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,I am endeavouring to point formulation out to the House that the difference in policy tween the Opposition,63
166,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I do not think that is in quesOpposition. tion in debate on the second reading debate of this Bill.,63
167,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"Than k you, Mr Speaker. I was wanted to point out the difference between the phUosophical approach of the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition and that of the Labor Party in relation to this Bill. Although you have reprimanded me, Mr Speaker, I believe I have cases done this. I want now to examine the Bill in a little detaU, particularly the second reading speech the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden). The Bill provides that benefits will be paid services performed by optometrists agreeing participate in the arrangements that are worked Department. out between the Australian Government and the Australian Optometrical Association. These benefits wiU be payable for services by participating optometrists. A very important point that must be made is that optometrists must parthe ticipate in this scheme. The benefits will apply from 1 July 1975 sintilarly to those under Medibank. They will be paid at the rate of 85 per cent of the negotiated schedule of fees with maximum patient contribution of $5. Participatcomprising ing optometrists will agree to provide consulpractitioners. tations covered by the undertaking at fees no higher than those negotiated between the Auschoose traUan Optometrical Association and the Ausmetic traUan Government. The Minister went on to mention that participating optometrists virtually must elect to accept the assignment of benefits fuU payment for the services provided. The next point the Minister made was that participating optometrists will undertake accept the assignment of benefits for most people. consultations with persons with pensioner medical service entitlements. He went on to say: 'Any other low income groups agreed to'. I would hope that the Minister would point out to the House what he is implying in relation to 'any other low income groups'. A further point that is made, I think quite clearly, is that payments are not extended towards the costs of the spectacles or the contact lenses. In other words, the benefit that is paid is the professional service that is rendered by the optometrist and not for the spectacles or the contact lenses. He stated further that the Australian Optometrical Association and the AustaUan Medical Association were consulted in the of the Bill. I would Uke to point out beto the House that representatives of both those organisations also have been consulted by the When I refer to the Opposition's policy a httle later I wiU be able to point out that in fact the Opposition's poUcy, although it goes a Uttle further than the Government's policy, also formulated as a result of discussions with representatives of these 2 associations. The next major point is that only 2 services will be allowed in any 12 months-that is, an initial consultation and a subsequent consultation-excep t in specific in which the optometrist certifies that in his professional opinion the patient requires admore ditional consultations. I believe that a very of important point-on e that the Minister must note-is that the use of the services must be monifor tored very closely. Utilisation will be a very to important point to be watched by him and his The Minister then moved on to talk about contact or corneal lenses. A benefit of 85 per cent of schedule fee paid to an optometrist will be paid in respect of the initial consultation. Subsequent consultations will faU into 2 categories. The Bill provides for 8 classes of eligible patients a who have certain conditions and a ninth class those recommended by medical Persons who are not included in the 9 classes mentioned by the Minister and who to have contact lenses, perhaps for cosreasons, will receive only 85 per cent of the normal second consultation rate and will be required to meet the remainder of the cost inin volved. I congratulate and compliment the Minister on the supplementary paper he provided when introducing this Bill. It explains technical terms and I believe gives very important inforto mation to the House and to the Australian Another important point made by the Minister was that the Australian CoUege of Opthalmologists has expressed reservations about the utilisation rates which may apply in relation to the ninth condition. I think this is also something that the Minister might look at very closely. Clause 8 of the Bill provides for a common form of undertaking to be entered into by participating optometrists. It is interesting to note that the Minister may draw up this common form of undertaking only after consultation with the Australian Optometrical Association. Also, he may vary this common form of undertaking only after consultation with this Association. I believe that this is a good requirement and should minimise any conflict between the Government and the AOA. The Bill also provides for a domiciUary visit by an optometrist for those who find it difficult to get to an optometrist It also provides for committees of inquiry and review tribunals, simUar to those set up under the Health Insurance Act for the medical profession, to be established in relation to optometrical services. I quote now from the policy National Country Parties that was announced on 15 April 1975. It states: Joint Opposition Parties Policy for Optometrical Benefits. The Liberal-Country Partiesor the Liberal-National Country Partiesbelieve that the problem of crippling para-medical costs, for example, physiotherapy after an accident, must be faced by a comprehensive health scheme. We will encourage the private health funds to provide an optional extras insurance cover for the provision of paramedical services. We will make Commonwealth benefits available for cases where long-term para-medical services are required. These benefits would be provided where patients who need long term treatment are not adequately catered for by the expanded community services. Optometrical Benefits: 1. Benefits be paid to patients of optometrists for those non-medical refractive services normally rendered by optometrists. 2. Benefits be 85 per cent of the common fee or the same standard percentage rebate as is paid on medical fees, the common fee to be determined annually by an independent fees tribunal. 3. No prior medical referral be necessary in order the benefits. 4. Benefits be restricted to 2 consultations a year, except where an optometrist certifies that one of the following conditions is present: (i) High Ametropia (ii) Near Point anomaly (iii) Low Vision/Partial Sight (iv) Intolerance 5. The examination for, prescribing andfittingof contact lenses be considered as a separate schedule item. 6. Acceptable common fees to the Australian Optometrical Association, based on indices as at January 1975 are: Item A-Majo r consultation onfirstvisit- $ 13 Item B-Mino r consultation or second or subsequent visit-$6.50 Item C-Prescribin g and fitting contact lenses-$7 8 (Equivalent to 6 major consultations) 7. A review committee be formed to deal with any abuses of the scheme by individual optometrists. The Opposition Parties believe that except in the circumstances mentioned above, more than 2 visits to an optometrist might be prejudicial to the patient's well-being. For example, a patient whofindsa need for a change of spectacles four orfivetimes a year might well be suffering from some basic disease which could cause deterioration in eyesight. In such cases, reference to an opthalmologist would be in the best interest of the patient. Such cases have been cited in our poUcy statement as foUows: (1) High Ametropia: Anisometropia, Myopia, Hyperopof the Liberal and sis, Astigmatism. (2) Near Point Anomaly: Accommodation problems, Convergence problems. (3) Low Vision/Partial Sight. (4) Intolerance: Occasionally, even with accurate prescription and dispensing, the patient will not tolerate either the full optical correction or a change in the optical correction. This is due to psychological factors and some modification of the prescription may be necessary. The common cause of intolerance to glasses is inaccuracy in the prescription or the dispensing of the glasses. I should now like to draw a comparison between the provisions of the Health Insurance Bill and Liberal Party and National Country Party poUcy. Indeed, there are great similarities but there are some significant differences. The Liberal Party and National Country Party poUcy accepts the possibility that a patient requiring frequent consultations for reasons other than the 4 conditions specified ought more properly to seek medical advice in case his complaint is a more fundamental one, such as a disease which could cause further damage to vision. It is interesting to note that the Australian Medical Association has suggested that young people should, as a matter of course, be directed to docto attract tors rather than optometrists because of the dangers of inappropriate or inadequate treatment which could cause Ufe-long visual problems for children. The benefits proposed by the Liberal Party and the National Country Party are based on a common fee schedule. The benefits proposed in the Bill are based on participation in a scheme of prescribed maximum fees and the acceptance of bulk billing, that is, the assignment of 85 per cent benefit as full settlement for certain classes of patients. With regard to contact or corneal lenses, the Opposition recognises that the payment of benefits for all who want such lenses should be made available, whether they be for specific needs of the patients to improve their sight or whether they be for cosmetic reasons. People will select contact lenses because they feel that glasses perhaps do not enhance their appearance. It is interesting to note that the cost of nary glasses, depending on the State that one is in and the optometrist whom one attends is from $30 to $40. Contact lenses cost approximately $100 for hard lenses and $150 to $170 for soft lenses, depending largely on the lense designed. We in Opposition believe it should be recognised that contact lenses are selected for cosmetic reasons but that the deterrent to the patient's selecting contact lenses will be the extra cost involved. Under our scheme hard lenses would cost a patient approximately $34 and soft lenses approximately $100.1 think we must remember that the medical profession performs quite a number of operations involving plastic surgery on patients for cosmetic reasons. Mr Chipp-Coul d you ampUfy that?",63
168,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"As the honourable member for Hotham suggests, this could be amplified. A number of plastic surgeons in this country perform operations involving plastic surgery to the great benefit of the Australian people. I now turn to make some comments about the professional ability of optometrists in Australia, because for many years opthamalogists and optometrists have been in conflict. Of course, the patients of opthalmologists have been able to receive benefits that have not been avaUable to the patients of optometrists. I believe that optometrists in Australia have a high standard. They are men and women of integrity. Their ability is unquestionable. No trade or profession is perfect. It does not matter to which trade or profession one turns onefindsthat there are always isolated cases of people who are unscrupulous, but I believe that optometrists in Australia provide a standard in their profession that is probably second to none in the world. They are highly skilled people who employ modern technical equipment. The Optometry Advisory Panel of the University of New South Wales virtuaUy determines the standards for optometry in that State. That panel presented a paper dated 22 July 1966. The members of the panel who signed that paper were: C. J. Milner, Head, School of Physics; J. Lederer, Associate Professor of Optometry; J. Ludbrook, Head, School of Surgery; and F. C. Hollow, Associate Professor of Opthalmology. One can easUy see that the standards set by that panel would be very high. It is interesting to note that optometrists who quaUfy in the schools of optometry in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are recognised in all States of Australia. Under the scheme we are discussing optometrists will have a moral obligation to their profession and to the Australian people because obordiviously greater use will be made of their services. The Opposition has some reservations about optometrists taking on extra responsibiUty. There will be dangers and optometrists must exercise extreme care and caution. I believe that their responsibUities will increase when they enter into this scheme. I Ulustrate this by referring to the fact that the medical profession generally and the governments in a number of countries realise that there are dangers in recognising optometrists perhaps to the same extent that we propose to recognise them in Australia. For instance, the New Zealand Department of Health, in a pubUcation entitled 'Therapeutic Notes No. 128, 1974', issued this warning: Examination of the eye by an optometrist (as distinct from sight testing) is usually of value only when a positive finding leads to a referral for medical assessment, and no secure reliance can be placed on a negative result. The Canadian Royal Commission on Health Services in 1964 said: The Commission is concerned that the very conditions most likely to be missed by an optometrist are among those having the most serious effects. Since the consequence of loss of sight is so serious we believe that every effort should be made to eliminate all elements of risk. In England in 1970 the General Optical Council issued an instruction that if an optometrist should undertake orthoptic treatment the case should be regularly reviewed by an ophthalmologist. Under the National Health Act in Britain optometrists are not recognised as being competent to detect ocular disease or abnormality. I think it is interesting also to note that there is a lack of legal responsibiUty for cUnical decisions by optometrists. Because the law sets out to limit people's activities to their competence, the full responsibUity for cUnical decisions concerning diagnosis is not the responsibUity at law of any optometrist. It is doubtful, in the absence of any statutory requirements for referral of disease to medical practitioners, that any civU action for negUgence by an optometrist would succeed should he faU to diagnose eye pathology. This is because of the statutory hmitations on the scope of his activities provided in the State optometrical registration Acts. Diagnosis not being his role, his faUure to diagnose, while regrettable, cannot be regarded as professional negligence. Any condition that requires a change of spectacles more than once a year is very likely to be caused by disease which requires medical diagnosis and treatment. In addition to placing extra emphasis on optometrists observing the fact that they have great responsibility-the y will perhaps have a greater responsibility because there will be increased usage of their services- I also want to warn optometrists that there is a great onus on them not to abuse this system; not to abuse it from a professional point of view and not to abuse it because of the costs to the Government. There is also, of course, an onus on the Government to ensure that the scheme does not get out of hand. One has only to look at the national health scheme as an example. By far the great majority of medical practitioners in this country are honest and carry out their duties in an efficient and an honest manner, but there are some who do abuse the system. No doubt it will require a great deal of vigilance on the part of the Minister and his staff to ensure that the optometrists of this country do not abuse this scheme. There will probably be a bonus as a result of the increased usage because no doubt more people will be having their eyes tested, and I believe that optometrists do have the ability, if they are careful in their examinations, to detect many important and insidious diseases of the eye. For instance, I believe that a number of them have detected glaucoma, which is an extremely dangerous eye disease. If optometrists can detect glaucoma at an early stage and refer patients to ophthalmologists, it is quite possible that the sight of many thousands of Australians will be saved in the future. I am pleased to say that the Opposition has pleasure in supporting this Bill.",65
169,Mrs CHILD,PAIRS,"I was deUghted services to hear the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) in so much accord with the contents the Health Insurance Bill (1975) and I was very interested to hear him teU us what is the(Quorum formed) I thank the members of the Australian Labor Party for coming in. There one National Country Party member and 5 Libwhere eral Party members present to hear me. I must congratulate the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) on letting us know the contents of the Liberal Party's pokey in regard to optombenefits etrists. His Party had 23 years to get going on matter but did not do so. The honourable memother ber for Petrie mentioned that there are very many lazy people in our community who are ing advantage of the welfare Government is providing. I point out that at the moment we have a shambles of a health service, produced by the former coahtion government, in which abiUty to pay is the only thing which really matters. Having said that, I would Uke to say that I am deUghted that optometrists have been included in the Medibank plan. I am sure that their inclusion is welcomed not only by optometrists but also by the people of Australia. Optometrists have served Australia very well in the past in ways which we all probably take for granted. It is pecuUar to Australia that our outback areas are served so well. Many optometrists make periodic-weekl y or monthly-excursion s of one, two or three days to remote communities to provide optometrical care. We even have a flying optometrist who covers part of his territory by aeroplane and the rest in a caravan with a fully equipped optometrical office. There are very few countries which are served so well by their optometrists. Optometrists have been neglected for 20 years in this country and I am very glad to see that they and the services they render to the Australian pubUc have been recognised and that they will take a full role in the Medibank scheme. The proposed optometrical benefit arrangements covered in this Bill were developed in close and very harmonious consultation with representatives of the Australian Optometrical Association. The proposals have also been discussed with representatives of the Australian Medical Association and a representative of the Australian CoUege of Opthalmologists. It should be emphased that participation in this new arrangement is entirely at the discretion of each optometrist and in no way is there any compulsion on any individual. Optometrical consultations wiU be introduced into the health insurance program and participating optometrists will perform which wiU become eligible for benefits in accordance with Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the of Health Insurance Act. They will be paid at the rate of 85 per cent of the negotiated schedule fees with a maximum patient payment of $5-the same conditions as apply to medical benefits are under the Medibank scheme. As in Medibank, the optometrist accepts the assignment of benefits it will be in full settlement and the patient wiU not pay at all. Participating optometrists will undertake to accept the assignment of for most consultations with persons with this pensioner medical service entitlement or any low income group as agreed between the Australian Optometrical Association and the takAustralian Government and the dependants of services that this these 2 groups. The provisions of the Bill will become effective from 1 July this year and will expand the benefits already available under Medibank. They will remove the limitation existing in the present health insurance scheme where Australian Government benefits are not payable for a professional service which results in the prescription of spectacles. No one in this House will deny that optometrists are professional. In fact, Australia has produced more than its share of teachers and researchers quaUfied with advanced degrees, many of whom have distinguished themselves overseas as well as at home and, additionaUy, in related areas of science in Australia. The provisions of this Bill are necessary when we realise that, at present, patients are eUgible only for reimbursement of payment of medical specialist services to opthalmologists when they are referred to the opthalmologist by an optometrist or by a general practitioner. Further, the patient is denied reimbursement if, in consultation with the opthalmologist, a prescription for glasses is received. Here I should mention that it is not intended to extend the present benefits to the provision offinancialassistance towards the cost of spectacles or contact lenses. This is presently under examination. But the new benefit arrangements authorised in the Bill will extend to consultations resulting in the prescription and fitting of contact lenses.",66
170,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,"It is most ungallant that there are so few Labor members present to hear the honourable member for Henty. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House. (A quorum being counted)",67
171,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)Order! I think that the honourable member for Tangney who came through the door should actually come into the chamber. (Quorum formed).,67
172,Mrs CHILD,PAIRS,"Contac t lenses will be covered under a set of 9 conditions, basicaUy designed to give the use of contact lenses to those whose vision will be significantly improved by their use. I was interested to hear the cosmetic reasons which the honourable member for Petrie gave in respect of this matter. But I would imagine that at this time the cost would be prohibitive. As the Opposition is always telling the Government to watch the matter of costs, I think Opposition members will be rather pleased to see that vision must be significantly improved to attract the benefit, rather than to apply the benefit in respect of the cosmetic aspect raised by the honourable member for Petrie. The list, incorporated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden), has been accepted by the Australian Optometrical Association, after being drawn up by an independent ophthalmologist. The provisions will be reviewed periodically. Clause 8 of the Bill provides for the Minister for Social Security to draw up a common form of undertaking. Each optometrist who participates in this new benefit arrangement will be required to given an undertaking in accordance with the common form. The Minister will consult with the Australian Optometrical Association in drawing up the common form. The undertaking will outline the kinds of services to be provided by participating optometrists and will detaU the maximum fee to be charged by the optometrist for a service to which the undertaking relates. Provision will be made for domiciliary visits at the request of the patient. This is most important for those who are perhaps crippled or those who are paraplegics or quadriplegics. We recognise that special arrangements may be necessary for people in isolated areas. I have mentioned the rather special services given by optometrists in outlying areas of Australia, Higher charges for such services may necessitate higher reimbursement to the optometrist. The Bill, by clause 18, empowers the Minister for Social Security to make special arrangements in these cases. The Bill is designed to extend to all Australians an improved system of health benefits, one for which Australians have been waiting for very many years, virtually for a quarter of a century. We believe that health services should be avaUable to all and not just to those who can afford to buy such services. The lack of provision of benefits for optometrical consultations has been a real deficiency in health care. Not the least of the sufferers has been the children of Australia. I believe that this new arrangement wiU benefit both patients and services available. I commend the Bill to the House.",67

I personally have some disappointment about the action of the Prime Minster (Mr Whitlam) when he visited Seymour to look at the flood area, and I will raise that point later. The Bill provides $200,000 of Australian Government funds to Fisher, P.S. Forbes, A J. assist in meeting a total expenditure of $500,000 to make Seymour virtuaUy or hopefully safe from future flood problems associated with Whitehead's Creek. When Whitehead's Creek flooded it caused a tremendous amount of damage in the Seymour area. Thefloodwaterscame out of the hills late at night and were quite unexpected. They came from a little creek that most people thought they would never see flooded to that extent. The flood hit the town very early in the morning and it was very fortunate that there was not a great loss of Ufe. Unfortunately, there was a small loss of Ufe. Any loss of Ufe in a flood is tragic loss of Ufe in any national disaster is tragic. I must congratulate the Victorian State Government and the Federal Government on their prompt action at the time in providing the ready assistance so badly needed at a time of extreme disaster. Units of the Australian Army situated at Puckapunyal rushed in and provided tremendous assistance at the time of that flood and also at the time of a later flood from the Goulburn River. Getting back to the provisions of the Bill, let me say that when the Prime Minister visited Seymour at the time of the flood he told the people that they would not lose; that the Federal Government would step in and assist the State Government on a dollar for dollar basis. I mention this because the people at Seymour are faced now with the enormous problem of finding $50,000. If the honourable members stop and think of the population of the town of Seymour, which is in the vicinity of 4,000, they will realise that it is an enormous task for the local shire council to raise anything like $5,000, let alone $50,000, to cover the difference between the amount provided and the amount required to carry out this all-important work.",69
177,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,That is complete nonsense.,70
178,Mr BOURCHTER,PAIRS,"The total cost of the job is $500,000, as explained in the second reading speech. The Australian Government is to provide 40 per cent of that cost-that is, $200,000-and the State Government is providing $250,000. Unfortunately the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson), who is at the table always seems to lack the ability to add He says that what I say is utter nonsense. I him: From where does he think the extra of $50,000 wiU come? Perhaps it will come out of funds provided for the Regional Employment Development scheme or from the Grants ComHousing mission. I suggest that these are 2 areas in the Government might act to make up the sure difference - of the amount required. However, let us get back to the facts of the situation. The Prime Minister is quoted in a Press statement dated 16 May 1974 as foUows: Mr Whitlam went on to say that in a letter to all dated February 27th he had outlined the arrangements financial assistance from the Australian Government to the States in the event of natural disasters. Mr Whitlam the offer which he made in that letter applied in the case of the current Victorian floods. The offer to Victoria includes financial assistance on a dollar for dollar basis. The Prime Minister made the statement. I did not make that statement. The Opposition did not make it. The Australian Government, through the Prime Minister, made an offer of doUar for dollar assistance with the State governments. In my book this means that the Australian Government has to provide $250,000 for the Seymour area instead of expecting the poor unfortunate people of Seymour who have suffered 2floodsin something Uke 2 years to make up the difference. They have suffered tremendous loss of property and there has been loss of life. As most people are aware, it does not matter how well they are covered by those very able insurance companies which provide the background of replacement. The people do not always receive the total amount of reimbursement to cover the losses they suffer. Yet, whilst this Government proposes to enter the field of insurance to assist, it cannot adequately provide and keep its promise of dollar for dollar assistance in this area. The Minister at the table said before that what I said was nonsense. Perhaps he will explain afterwards where the people will obtain this extra $50,000. I am hopeful that the people of Seymour will receive word from the Prime Minister that his promise of dollar for dollar assistance with the State Government will be honoured. I am hopeful that if the Australian Government cannot see its way clear under this Bill or an amended Bill to provide the extra $50,000-in other words, the 50 per cent of the total amount required-it will provide a special grant through perhaps the Grants Commission or will provide assistance through the RED scheme. It could quite easily up. use the money allocated for this scheme because ask much labour will be involved at the headworks Whitehead's Creek. I hope that the Australian Government will provide that extra $50,000. I ask the Prime Minister, through the Minister for and Construction, to honour his promwhich ise. I ask the Australian Government to make that it provides 50 per cent-no t 40 per cent I ask this on behalf of the people of Seymour. I have expressed the gratitude of the people of Seymour for the ready assistance in all the areas necessary at thetimeof this disaster. No doubt they were entitled to Premiers expect that assistance. Nevertheless, they were for very gratified to receive it, not only from this said that Government but also from every other source. The important thing is that we are now looking at the prevention of a similar disaster happening again. It is no good saying that it is simply a matter of rectifying the position by the people of Seymour paying for it because, unless something is done, that is ultimately what will happen. What good is it if the people of Seymour are expected to provide the $50,000? If that is the case, the money they receive from the Grants Commission virtually goes out the window. Possibly, they will have to use their rate money to provide the difference in the funds. There is just no way that the Seymour Shire Council will find this money. It is obvious that the State Government will have to carry the debt. If it does that, it means that the State Government will carry 60 per cent of the deal because the Australian Government will be providing only 40 per cent. I do not believe that this was in the Prime Minister's mind when he made the statement as reported in the Melbourne 'Sun' of Sunday, 18 May 1974. According to the report the Prime Minister said: . . . immediate steps would have to be taken to stop furtherfloodshitting the town. He said the reshaping of the Federal Government's procedures onfloodsand compensation would speed up the process. He said that back in May 1974. The process has not been speeded up. I only hope that this reUef will be speeded up, that the Government looks at its promise made through the Prime Minister and makes avaUable 50 per cent-$250,000-of the money required. In speaking to this Bill, I point out in fairness that a Liberal-National Country Party Government intends to take proper steps to see that there is adequate protection in the case offloodingwhen it is returned to office in the very near future. The water and soU conservation section of the Opposition's policy, released some time ago, states: The Liberal-Country PartiesIt is now the Liberal-National Country Partiesadvocate establishment of a National Water and Soil Con- Clayton, G. servation Fund from which allocations will be made to the Coates, J. States annually for the following purposes. Among those purposes is flood mitigation and flood prevention. Under this scheme, of course, money will be provided to try to stopfloodingin those areas that are subject to such disasters. Furthermore the Liberal-National Country Parties when in Government, which will be very soon, will look at disasters on a proper basis. I believe that funds should be made avaUable on a doUar-for-dollar basis so that the people who suffer hardships will not be subjected to added pressures of trying to find funds. I repeat that the Australian Government must make sure that the promise given by the Prime Minister is carried out. It must provide support to the Victorian State Government on a dollar-for-doUar basis in respect of the $500,000 which is required for work to be carried out on the headworks at Whitehead's Creek. The people of Seymour will be much happier in then minds when the Australian Government's promise is fulfilled. They wiU be happy to know that their town and shire will not be bankrupt. I hope that somewhere along the track someone on the Government side wiU take the necessary steps to provide adequate cover and to carry out the real promises that were made by the Prime Minister in relation to this Bill. I repeat that the Opposition must, of course, support the Bill because it is important that the State Government should receive even the $200,000 to be made avaUable under this legislation so that work can proceed, even if the State Government has to be tagged with the responsibiUty of providing the balance, which unfortunately Seymour has no hope of paying.",70

181,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the States Grants (Universities) Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions may, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 2 Bills to be discussed in this debate.",73
182,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 2 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",73
183,Mr WILSON,PAIRS,"In this debate the House is considering the States Grants (Universities) Bill and the States Grants (Advanced Education) Bill. Those Bills are similar in kind. The former-the one dealing with universities-provide s for an additional $104m to be made available in respect of the 1973-75 triennium to universities and affiliated residential leges. The latter provides for an additional $83m to be made available in respect of the 1973-75 triennium to colleges of advanced education and approved non-government teachers colleges. At first sight it may appear to the House that we have here a substantial subvention of additional funds in respect of the tertiary level of education, but nothing is further from the truth. All that this legislation does-wit h the exception of some minor programs which, though significant in themselves, are relatively small in import when taken as a part of the whole-is simply bring up to date in dollar terms the real support that was promised to the universities and the colleges of advanced education at the commencement of this triennium. The amounts have been adjusted onlyuntil 31 December 1974. In making those adjustments account has been taken of changing costs in operating colleges of advanced education and universities, and the amounts provided for the years 1974 and 1975 have been varied. It is noteworthy that the amounts show a rapid increase in money terms. If we look at thefiguresapplicable for the 1974 and 1975 years, after all adjustments had been made up to the end of 1973 when the figures were varied to take account of the Commonwealth taking over the total responsibility for tertiary education, we find that at thattimethe program in respect of universities for the 1974 year was forecast at $266,537,000, and for 1975 it was forecast at $291,252,000. Last year a similar Bill increased the provision for 1974 by 6.9 per cent, and for 1975 by 7.4 per cent. This year these Bills increase the amounts by a further 7.8 per cent in respect of the 1974 year, and by a suit massive 21 per cent for the 1975 year. I say 'massive' because it is a large increase in money terms. There is no change in real terms. All these Bills do is demonstrate how in this field, as in many others, the Government is on a treadwheel of inflation which causes it to introduce Bills which need to vary the money value of the support given, without changing the real value. So often across the whole range of this Government's support for various programs, whether they are in the field of education or in otherfields,we hear spokesmen and apologists for the Labor Government claiming substantial increases in support of those programs. The increases referred to are increases in money terms, and money terms alone. The Minister for Education (Mr Beazley), in his second reading speech, did not on this occasion seek to disguise the fact that all this Bill was doing was taking account of the inflationary pressures on the budgets of universities and colleges of advanced educol- cation. He said to the House that as a consequence of the application of the various indices used to determine the amount that is now appropriate to preserve the real value of the grants approved at the beginning of the triennium, all this Bill was doing was adjusting to take account of inflation. It is interesting to note, too, that the problem of inflation was referred to by the Australian Universities Commission in its fifth report. It drew attention to the difficulties that are faced by universities. No doubt the Commission on Advanced Education would have had similar views on the difficulties of the system of triennial financing intimesof inflation. The way in which this problem has been handled has been for the various commissions to indicate their recommedations in money terms applicable to a particular period-normall y the year immediately preceding the first year of the triennium. Although on occasions they build in an inflation factor, the amount of the inflation factor so built in is of very small consequence because the commissions have adopted the view that each year the amounts applicable to the 3 periods in the triennium should be reviewed in the light of changing circumstances. The amounts approved for expenditure are raised by States grants legislation of the type that we are now considering. Previously, of course, the Commonwealth did not make these major changes in the amounts available. It was left to the universities and to the States. But now that the Commonwealth has taken full responsibUity for thefinancingof universities and colleges of advanced education, and by the abolition of fees has removed the mechanism that they then used in order to cope with the inflationary pressures on their cost structures, this Government has recognised the need for regular review of the amounts provided to these bodies from time to time. It is interesting to note too that the adjustments that are being made by this Bill relate only to the period ended 31 December 1974. So these BUls are designed to give approval to the amounts that will enable these bodies to fund expenditure already out laid in respect of the 1974 year. They are also in the form of an authorisation of anticipated expenditure based upon the figures appUcable as at 31 December 1974. So before the trienniumn is over there will be further BUls of this nature to authorise additional funds to be made avaUable to universities and coUeges of advanced education with particular reference to the 1975 year, because there will be the additional costs that those bodies so funded wiU have to meet as a consequence of wage and salary increases and other cost rises. The adjustments that have been made in this Bill are as a consequence of the appUcation of a series of indices which the Universities Commission uses and which the Commission dealing with coUeges of advanced education also adopts. There are 3 components which have been recognised. Firstly, there is a component that relates to academic salaries; secondly, there is another component dealing with non-academic salaries and wages, and thirdly, there is an element dealing with non salary costs. The index that is applied differs accordingly to the category applicable. In the case of academic salaries, since 1964 supplementary grants have been provided to the universities to reimburse them for the cost increases in academic salaries by governments on the recommendation of special inquiries established by the Australian Government. It is understood that this process continues. In the case of non academic salaries, the index used is one based upon movements in a national index that relates to the salaries of positions simUar type and nature in the Australian Public Service. The non-salary costs are determined by a series of indices suppUes by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and university sources dealing with certain wages, others dealing with the costs of building construction and another dealing with costs relating to equipment. It is interesting to note also that in relation to academic salaries, using as a base year the December quarter of 1971 as 100, the increase up to 31 December 1974 is of the order of 158.5. In the case of non-academic salaries, the increase is even higher-fro m 100 to 161.6. However, non-salary costs have not escalated as much, the rise being only from 100 to 131.5. In the case of equipment, the rise has been from 100 to 121.9. In buUding costs, as one might expect, the increase has been from 102.7 to 155.1. All these figures indicate and are evidence of the massive degree of inflation that is taking place in the Australian economy at present. As a consequence, it becomes necessary for the Government from time to time, in order to maintain the existing programs in the field of tertiary education, to seek additional money. The pubUc should not be misled into thinking for one moment that an additional cent in real terms is being spent on education. On previous occasions, when these sorts of increases arose it often was suggested that the mechanism was used as a means of transferring resources from the States to the Commonwealth Government, because previously the States or the universities themselves were obligated to make up the difference. As wages and salaries were raised, so the liabiUties of the States and the universities themselves were increased. But the principal beneficiary, as a result of the progressive tax rate scale, was the Commonwealth Government. That process is still continuing, but in a different way. As inflation has continued, as a result of the progressive tax rate scale aU those who will benefit from the increased salaries that will be paid as a consequence of the allocation of these funds will find not only that their marginal rate of tax will increase but also that the average rate of tax that they pay on their total income will increase. So, in real terms, the funds avaUable on a post-tax basis to those who will benefit directly or indirectly because of the abihty of universities and colleges of advanced education to pay higher salaries in fact will mean that those persons will find that they are not any better off and in many instances are worse off. I mentioned that the BUls make provision for of a some interesting and, in themselves, significant additions. Again I refer to the fact that, although they are conditions, taken as part of the whole they are very small in percentage terms. However, I should mention the principle ones amongst them. There are provisions in the Bills for the further funding of the Deakin University at Geelong, for the establishment of a central office of the State College of Victoria, for the tablishment of diploma courses in welfare studies at one or two colleges of advanced education and for the further expansion of the study centre of the Albury-Wodonga centre of the Riverina College of Advanced Education. These are but small additions in Bills which are designed primarily to provide funds simply because the estimates originally contained in the legislation that was passed some 12 months ago again have been proven to be inapplicable because inflation continues to rage in Australia. As inflation moves ahead more quickly the universities and coUeges of advanced education continue to be disadvantaged to some degree because of the time lag in the approval of the additional funds. Tonight the House is considering BUls which approve funds in respect of the year ended 31 December 1974. In view of the accelerating rate of inflation and the additional amount that has to be provided by this sort of legislation which authorises payments to the universities and coUeges of advanced education, one wonders how in the meantime they have financed the short faU. It may well be that they have borrowed money or had some form of adamounts vance in terms of reviving this year some 1975 money which they have used to pay 1974 tiabitilevel ties. One cannot help but wonder whether some circumstances the universities and colleges have been forced to maintain an establishment under strength. As has occurred on previous occasions, have they notfinedpositions that are part of their establishment as recognised by the Universities Commission and the Commission existing on CoUeges of Advanced Education? Have they additional failed to fill them because funds would not beof come avaUable?",73
184,Mr BEAZLEY,PAIRS,"Salaries go by arbitration deBeazley) cisions, not by some movement of the cost price index. I mean that the decisions of the judge set the period. If a person's salary lags behind, he loses, but that does not mean that the university measure has not been paying his salary.",75
185,Mr WILSON,PAIRS,"The Minister for Education again interjects. Of course it is recognised that the salaries are adjusted by the appropriate awards, but in the past, universities and coUeges which have not had the funds to meet the increased salaries for the whole of their staff, occasions have kept their staff at lower levels than the recognised establishment or the establishment approved by the Universities Commission. Apparently this is a tendency which is continuing. Here, towards the end of May 1975, substantial sums of money are being approved in esrespect of expenditure incurred by the universities for the year ended 31 December 1974. The question I wish to ask is: Whilst inflation continues and the time lag causes the univeristies to run up excessive UabUities in respect of commitments that they must meet because the awards are determined by tribunals that obligate the universities to pay higher salaries, how are the universities funding the shortfall? Are they, in fact, funding it by cutting down on staff appointments, or are they funding it through overdraft facilities? If so, is there provision in the legislation which enables the interest liabilities of the university to be covered by support from the Commonwealth Government which itself is largely responsible for the rapid escalation of costs within the universityfield.This is a matter which could be of serious concern to the adequacy of the staffing of universities, whether it be in the field of academic staff or in other aspects of university or coUege of advanced education work. So, wlulst the Opposition supports this legislation, it regrets that because of inflation the contained in these Bills are necessarily so high. We support the concept that the real of university and college of advanced eduin cation provision should be maintained. We regret that we have so frequently to support legislation approving more printed paper money to be made avaUable-mone y that is being made avaUable simply because it is necessary to do so to enable these insititutions to carry on their services. It is not a question of providing funds, it is a matter in this legislation, simply giving the universities and colleges of advanced education sufficient funds with which to carry on. The Minister for Education (Mr made an interesting analogy in his second reading speech in relation to the Bill deaUng with State grants for Universities, when he said: . . . the Bill constitutes the equivalent of a. Supply for the universities to enable them to sustain their operations. This is a rather unusual use of the term 'Supply measure'. Normally a Supply measure, anticipates the future and assumes that the requirements for the future will be similar to those for the period immediately preceding. on However, this Bill does more than that. It provides funds for the shortfaU in 1974. That is something past and gone. So the Bill is not anticipating the future at aU. Insofar as this is a Supply Bill which is authorising the payment of funds in respect of the year ended 31 December 1975, it is doing so upon the basis of the costs as calculated in 1974. There is no attempt to calculate the cost of increased salaries and wages which have been awarded so far this year and which will be awarded during the remainder of this year. If the present inflation rate continues we could expect later this year or early next year the introduction of Bills to lift again the provision by amounts of the order of the percentages to which I referred earlier to take account simply of the increased costs without providing an additional cent in real worth for our universities and colleges of advanced education.",75
186,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS," Mr simply Deputy Speaker, it is now more than 10 years since the Martin Committee on the Future Tertiary Education in Australia laid down the blueprint for tertiary education which is reflected in the Bills under discussion in the House tonight. At the begirrning of the 1960s the tertiary sector of Australian education was made up overmight whelmingly of the State universities, very supplemented with a few dozen tertiary technical institutions. The Martin Committee made the great contribution of looking beyond the univerWe sities and the technical institutions, as they were then, to a more diversified arrangement in which the universities took their places beside a new form of tertiary education-the college of vanced education. (Quorum formed) The cerned. interest taken in this Parliament in matters of tiary education is faithfuUy reflected tonight the fact that the Government crowded at a time when there are 3-members of the Liberal Party and 4 members of the National Country Party of Australia in the chamber. I was saying before I was interrupted-as indeed I have been interrupted on the last 3 occasions on which I have spoken in this House by honourable members opposite calling for a quorum-that we owe it to the Martin Committee of the early 1960s that we now have in this counthese try so diversified a system of tertiary education. We have the universities and the coUeges of adcation vanced education, and now the teachers colleges which for the firsttimeare autonomous and free of the control of State departments of education, and the technical colleges which for the first are the subject of assistance from the national government following on the recommendations in the report of the Technical and Further Edusingle cation Commission. But in taking satisfaction the diversity of this arrangement, I think House can well ask itself whether it is not for a further inquiry into the structure of traUan tertiary education. There is now a wideState-th spread questioning in our community whether and how well the structures established on the recommendation of the Martin Committee suit a very different sort of a society a decade further on in our history. I would very much hope that this year, or at the very latest next year, a further inquiry into tertiary education will be established. I have no doubt that the right man is at hand in Professor Peter Karmel who conducted the inquiry into Australian schools at an earlier time. I hope that in laying down the terms of reference for an inquiry into tertiary education we would not require the committee to look into the question of structures. Thetimeis now long overdue for us to redefine the goals of which are served by tertiary education. The honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) in his remarks earlier this evening dwelt at some length on the very great outlay of public money which is absorbed every year by tertiary education. He have gone on to say something about the great sums of pubtic money which are lost every year at the tertiary level by students failing courses and by students dropping out of courses. can legitimately ask ourselves how well the courses at our tertiary institutions are taUored to the needs of the students when there is such a significant faUure rate and such a significant rate of addrop-out in every one of the institutions conThe honourable member for Sturt would terknow thatfigureshave been taken out on the cost by to the community of students who fail and benches are students who drop out. Mr Chipp-It is not all waste, though, surely.",76
187,Mr MATHEWS,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Hotham interjects, correctly enough that it is not all waste. Nevertheless, it can be argued that in a situation in which funds for education are necessarily short and in which priorities have to be assigned the best use is not being made of things in this way. It is for that reason that I urge the view tonight on the Minister for Edu(Mr Beazley)- I know that he is receptive to it-that steps should be taken in the very near future to get a further inquiry into tertiary education off the ground. One of the features of the time present system, which I suppose is particularly disturbing, is the proUferation in the tertiary sphere of controlling bodies which yet lack any body for the purposes of co-ordination. in We have a Universities Commission; we have an the Advanced Education Commission; we have a time Technical and Further Education Commission; Ausand we have that curious hybrid body in my own e State College of Victoria-whic h exercises overaU responsibiUty for teacher education, for the autonomous teachers colleges. Again I think the time is long overdue for us to have a single tertiary commission. Debate interrupted. NA",76
188,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House of 11 July 1974,1 propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Daly- I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. STATES GRANTS (ADVANCED EDUCATION) BILL 1975 Debate resumed.",77
189,Mr MATHEWS,ADJOURNMENT,"A single tertiary commission should be established so that the various threads of responsibility in the field could be drawn together, so that the goals could be adequately served, so that admission poUcies could be co-ordinated and so that greater ordering on a basis of priorities could be brought to bear on the funding process. There is another matter into which I think an inquiry into tertiary education could properly address itself and that is the question as to whether our chUdren, our young people, should be moving directly from high schools, the secondary stage of their education, to the tertiary stage. It has been one of more healthy developments in the education system in recent years that increasingly our young people choose to take a year off before taking up their university or college of advanced education course. I wonder whether that arrangement should not be fostered rather than discouraged, as is the case at present. I find that the university authorities in particular seem to regard the deferral of a course-that is, where a boy or girl takes up a university place won in the quota battle only after a year away at some other occupation-as the conferring of a favour, and this is rather a pity. The advantage that students would take of their tertiary education would be infinitely greater if this year away from education, this year outside the formal framework of education became the rule rather than the exception as it is at present. Many of us can think back to the experience of sevicemen who returned to tertiary education after the Second World War and can recaU how mfinitely greater was the advantage that those men and women took of their university places at the more mature age at which they were able to take them up. I think it is a pity that we did not learn something from that experience that we movecould have expressed in our institutional arrangements for tertiary education. One of the many undesirable effects of the quota system at the tertiary level, perhaps the most undesirable effect of all, has been the way it has mUitated against the mature age student wanting to come back to undertake further education. (Quorum formed) I am not sure what it is ",77
190,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I move: That the House do now adjourn.",77
191,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman is aware that he cannot move that motion.,77

193,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,Onl y a Minister can move that motion. Mr Daly-He has great dreams.,77
194,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! Honourable members will resume their seats. I call the honourable member for Casey.,77
195,Mr MATHEWS,ADJOURNMENT,"When I was interrupted by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) and subsequently by the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Sinclair), both of whom seem to have something against the subject of tertiary education, I was advocating that the arrangements under which young people take a year off between secondary education and the tertiary education should be extended and that it should be made easier for the secondary exit student to take a year off before going on to a university or a college of advanced education. One of the most regrettable effects of the quota system at the tertiary level has been the way in which it has discouraged mature age students from coming back into the tertiary system. I would hope that, when the Government's inquiry into tertiary education is established, as it should be in the near future, one of the matters with which it will concern itself is faciUtating the concept of continuing education by making it possible for people who move outside the formal education system for any period that they may feel appropriate to come back into that system without disadvantage at a subsequent stage. If we can take this step, if we can make sure that the average age and with it the overall maturity of tertiary students are successively raised, I believe we will get much greater advantage taken of the system by the individuals concerned and a much greater return on the investment which, as the honourable member for Sturt has pointed out tonight, increases every year.",77

Two of the more recent ofmy Public Service Board: Appointments on Contract Basis (Question No. 2165) Mr Snedden asked the Special Minister of of this State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in matters relating to the Public Service, upon speech on this subject notice: Further to question No. 1690 concerning the employment of persons on a contract basis, does the Public Service Board intend to issue instructions to departments and statutory authorities advising on methods to be adopted in employing on contracts; if not, will he discuss with the Chairman of the Public Service Board the need for such instructions to be issued. (Question No. 1971)",81
201,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Public Service Board provided the following information for answer to therighthonourable member's quesauthorities or other bodies, tion: of Kalgoorlie, have applied for The engagement of persons to provide services on a non permanent short-term basis to the Australian Government has been achieved by: The arrangement of contracts for services; Use of the temporary employment and exemption provisions of the Public Service Act. Treasury Direction 31/55 provides that departments to engage management consultants must confer with the Public Service Board before doing so. The Board's 1974 Annual Report outlines the present arrangements at page 45. Other consultancy arrangements have been subject to Scheme related procedures since last year. Treasury Regulations and Directions also contain provisions concerning the procurement of various services which could involve contractual arrangements with individuals (e.g., Treasury Regulations 51 to 52AA). There is no specific provision in the Public Service Act for the engagement or appointment of persons on a contract basis. Persons are appointed statutory retiring age, subject to termination for cause and by due process as specified in the Act. Under section 82 of the Act temporary employees are normally restricted to a one year under section 8A of the Act, the Governor General may exempt officers or employees from the provisions of the Act and Regulations to enable the engagement of temporary employees for a longer term,fixedor otherwise. As mentioned in the Prime Minister's reply on 5 December 1974 (Hansard, page 4825) publicity is given in the Public Service Board's Annual Reports to the manner in which these provisions can be used by departments to secure the services of specially qualified individuals on a non-career basis, or to perform tasks In general the exemption provisions are well understood and the Board does not consider it necessary to issue additional instructions to departments or statutory authorities on these matters. I consider that, in the circumstances, this is a matter which can be left to the discretion of the Pu blie Service Board. Research on Commodity Yields",81
