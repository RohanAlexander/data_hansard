3,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I wish to draw the attention of honourable members printer's error in today's notic^paper. it occurs in Order of the Day, No. 2, vernment business. I was considerably astonished and perturbed, on reading the notice-paper this morning, to fcnet at - set down, as an Order of the Day, the resumption of a debate on a motion beginning "" That this House a # proves of the exeoution of the Prime Minister."" But, - when I had recovered my normal equanimity, and had read further, I saw that the motion was for the approval of the execution "" by the Prime Minister "" of an agreement relating to wireless communication. Were the Order of the Day called on in the form in which it stands on the notice-paper, it might occur to some honourable member to move, as an amendment, the omission of all the words after the words "" Prime Minister,"" and, should the House carry - m-Hnt TnViTinnn^ that ^ amendment, c ^ ^ ^ and^agree to the ^ Order^ rf position of the right honourable gentleman might be extremely uncomfortable.",20

Is it not a fact that this vessel has been overhauled upon several occasions at Brisbane, with results entirely satisfactbry in every way?",22
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH LINE OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is inadvisable to have the KaruaK overhauled at Brisbane, as she has to undergo her number three special survey to comply, with the British corporation survey, and i i is* essential that the Department take advantage of the Commonwealth dry dock JOT docking: purposes. 2. The first annual overhaul of the Karuah-. was made at Brisbane in the year 1918, and? it was then determined that it would be preferable to conduct future annual overhauls at"". Cockatoo Dockyard, as by this means advan*tage is taken of the technical staff at the dockyard, and no docking fees are incurred. RETURNED SOLDIERS: SOUTH AUSTRALIA. NA CASES.",22

(6) Permission is granted, provided evidence is produced that suitable accommodation will be available in the Territory. NA HOSPITAL.",23
21,Mr FRANCIS,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice Whether it is a fact that the Department has offered to dispose of the Caulfield Military Hospital at Kooyong-road, Caulfield, to the Victorian State Government; if so, is it a fact that the soldiers now receiving' treatment at the hospital will, be distributed among the several public hospitals?",23
22,Mr RODGERS,CAULFIELD MILITARY,"During the period that Caulfield Hospital was controlled by the Department of Defence, the property was offered to the State Government; but, so far, the State has not indicated whether it is likely to acquire the property. The transfer of the control of the hospital from Defence to the Repatriation Department has in no way cancelled this offer. There is no intention of clos-. ing the Caulfield Hospital as long as it is necessary for the number of soldier patients requiring treatment. In the event of this number diminishing suffiister, upon noticeciently, treatment on the existing lines will be provided, under an agreement perty with the Alfred Hospital, in absolutely separate wards, and in complete segregation, the Department paying a per capita rate per diem for maintenance. NA FILMS'.",23
23,Mr BAYLEY,CENSORSHIP OF PICTURE,"the Prime MinWhether he has considered the advisability of appointing a woman, or women, to the Censorship of Pictures Board; if so, what has been the result of his consideration?",23
24,Mr HUGHES,CENSORSHIP OF PICTURE,"Yes ; the result being that it has been decided that there is no necessity to appoint women to this Board. It may be mentioned that some time ago State censorships were instituted in South Australia and Tasmania for the express purpose of checking the work of the Federal censorship. Two married ladies were appointed to each Board. These Boards, in order to justify their existence, were particularly careful in the scrutiny of films passed by the Commonwealth film censorship. Yet, out of over 10,000 films passed by the censorship, the South Australian Board only condemned two, and the Tasmanian Board only condemned the same number out of a total of 4,500. This proves conclusively that the censorship's work is satisfactory when tested from a woman's stand-point. INCOME TAX . HOLDING UP OF REFUNDS.",23
25,Mr FLEMING,CENSORSHIP OF PICTURE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Income Tax Department is holding up refunds due under the Ramaciotti decision; if so, why is this being done? 2. Is it the intention of the Government to pass legislation affecting these refunds?",23
26,Mr HUGHES,CENSORSHIP OF PICTURE,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. The refunds are being held up by the Commission of Taxation pending the decision of the Government. 2. The matter is under consideration. INVALIDAND OLD-AGE PENSIONS.,23
27,Dr MALONEY,CENSORSHIP OF PICTURE,"the Prime MinIs it fair, in calculating the vahic of proand income in estimating invalid and old-age pensions, that, where the property concerned is not the home of the applicant, the net income should be deducted after value of the property has also been deducted, making two deductions in respect of the same property? . Mr HUGHES - It has always been one of the principles of old-age pensions, under State and under Commonwealth laws, that there shall be deductions from pensions both in respect of the capital value of property and in respect of the income. If the deductions were made in relation only to capital, or to income, would probably be necessary that the of deduction be increased so-as to make equal to the combined rates of deduction under the present law.

CONOILIATION"" AND ARBITRATION BILL (No. 2). Order of the Day for second reading discharged; Bill withdrawn. NA ARBITRATION BILL (No. 3). Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed, by leave, and agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a Bill an Act to amend sections 14, 18A, 24, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitrabeen tion Act 1904-20. (Bill presented by Mr HUGHES, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",24
30,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and AttorneynGeneral) [11.22] (By leave.)- I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to relieve certain conditions existing for some time 1 past in the Arbitration Court, and which have been the subject of considerable disi t cussion in this House and elsewhere. The rate Act provides for the appointment of it Deputies to assist the President, but the provision in the Act in practice has been found to present such difficulties as to make it, in effect, inoperative. The Bill remedies this by substituting an alternative which it is confidently expected will enable the Court to overcome the congestion that now exists. At present Deputies may be appointed to assist the the President of the Arbitration Court, but, like the President, they must be Justices of the High Court or Judges of a Supreme Diligent effort has Sailbeen made by the Government to obtain the services of Justices of the High Court or Judges of a Supreme Court of a State, 12th but without success, and, as a result, Mr. transJustice Powers, the President of the Court, has been left without assistance. Business has become so congested that the President has declared that it is impossible for him to carry out his duties properly unless he has that assistance. Early in the year he had cleared the list of cases before him, and he the anticipated having no difficulty whatit ever in dealing with the work that was likely to come forward, but this has proved to have been too optimistic a view. The President must have assistance; Deputies cannot be obtained as the law stands. Under the Bill there will, it is anticipated, he no difficulty. Clause 2 of the Bill now provides that the Government may appoint as Deputies gentlemen who are barristers or solicitors, and the term of their appointment is to be whatever term is expressed in the instrument of appointment or, if no term is set out, then a term which coincides with for the unexpired portion of the term for 29 of which the President of the Court has appointed, which in - this case is about six and a half years. This provision will enable the Government to appoint gentlemen who are uot Judges, but who must be - barristers or solicitors, as Deputies to assist Mr Justice Powers to clear oft"" the business before the Arbitration Court, and relieve a congestion which has, to those who believe in the legal settlement of industrial disputes, created a position full of danger to the community. If I am asked why the selection is confined to barristers .and solicitors, my answer is that, as originally draf ted, the clause made the field of selection wider, hut the President of the Arbitration Court expressed the view that as points of law continually arise during the liearing of cases before the Court, the limitation as now provided in the Bill was necessary. It has been therefore amended accordingly. The Government must pay regard to the wishes of the President of the Court, for whom these men will act as Deputies. Two of the other clauses of the Bill have heen inserted as the result of representations made iby the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton). Clauses 3 and 4 amend section 18A of the principal Act in such a way as to provide that where an award is made, and a party to that award assigns his business, or it passes in some way to another, then that other shall be hound by the award in exactly the same <way as if it had been made against him. 'But this applies only in cases where an award is made before the assignment takes place, or the business passes; it does not apply in cases where, although a plaint is filed, the award has not been made. I have only to add that this is a provision which is doubtful constitutionally, although the Court the other day declined to express an opinion on its validity. It is an amendment to which, in its very nature, no one can take, exception; it is an eminently proper thing to do in the interests of the preservation of industrial peace. But I wish to make itperfectly clear that we do not say that it is constitutionally valid; ou the other hand, the Court, as I say, has expressly declined to declare it invalid.",24
31,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,What about clause 3 work in hand. in reference to standard hours?,25
32,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"That is a suggestion made by the President himself. The present provision necessitating three Judges defined ? in the first instance delays the Court unduly. It is still thought necessary not to place the vital question of hours in the absolute discretion of any one individual; but it is proposed to effect this by giving a right of appeal toi three Judges. That certainly will enable the business of the Court to be carried out more speedily. The definition of standard hours is one that has been suggested by the Judge himself to remove any amjbiguity; and I do not think honourable members can take any exception to that. It is now set out quite clearly what the standard hours of work in any industry really mean. The amendment clears up a doubt which was in the mind of the Court, and of many people; and for that reason I think it is quite unobjectionable. The two important points are-first , the appointment of Deputies, and, second, the substitution for the present provision that all applications involving a change of hours shall he determined by three Judges, the procedure under the Bill whereby one Judge may hear them, subject to appeal.",25
33,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) [11.35] I do not desire to speak at any length on the Bill, because I concur largely with what the Prime Minister has said as to the necessity for the amendment of the Act. There is a good deal of congestion in the Arbitration Court, due to an insufficient numlber of Judges. The Prime Minister stated that the difficulty in this regard is due to the fact that he has not been able to get Judges of the High Court to occupy the position of Deputy; consequently it is proposed to amend the Act so that barristers or solicitors may be eligible. When the Prime Minister is making appointments it will be well for him to take into consideration the experience of men who have practised at the Bar in connection with arbitraTtioin, or who have, in any other capacity, acquired a knowledge of arbitration work. It is not every man, whether barrister or otherwise, who is suitahle for a position of the kind; he requires experience of the particular",25
34,Mr FOLEY,CONCILIATION AND,The hoHorable member would not have those eligible absolutely,25
35,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"No , I am merely making a suggestion. I am not quite sure that there should not he some permanence in the appointment of these Judges. What I mean is that, if additional Judges are to he appointed-and there are now some sixty cases listed-the y should have some definite tenure of office. We cannot make such appointments for a month or two. - Mr HUGHES - I thought I . indicated that the Judges can be appointed for the unexpired balance of the present term of the President-si x and a half years, or thereabouts. Mr 'CHARLTON - I had not gathered that from the Prime Minister's remarks. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman will fall in with the idea, but I desire to make a suggestion for what it is worth. In view of the congested state of 'the business, if any parties to a dispute awaiting decision desire to have a special tribunal under the Industrial Peace Act, will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to any application to that effect ? This matter, is not embraced in the Bill, hut I thought I would mention it.",26
36,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Mr Justice Powers, when he accepted ofiice, asked me particularly whether it was the intention to extend the functions exercised under the Industrial Peace Act.",26
37,Mr OHAEJJTON,CONCILIATION AND,"W it h the amendments of the Act as set forth in clauses 4 and 5 I am in hearty accord; they are absolutely necessary if arbitration is to succeed. The very fact that, when a party to a dispute transfers his business to somebody else, the business does not come under an award, weakens, and may, indeed, nullify altogether the effect of arbitration. When a man purchases a business he seeks all particulars in regard to it, and if he knows that there is an award of the Court affecting it , he takes that fact into consideration. As the law now stands, unions may not get the benefit of an award, and the position, is also unsatisfactory to other employers in an industry affected. The samel remarks apply to clause 5. and both clauses refer only to awards that have been given, not to plaints awaiting hearing. I wish to refer to clause 3, which I regard as the only objectionable one in the measure. It is true, perhaps, as the Prime Minister states, that the Court has recommended this provision, hut I do not think that it will facilitate the speedy hearing of cases.",26
38,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Surely it will be better than the present system.,26
39,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not think it will. Section 18 of the Act 'provides that the hours of . labour must be determined by three Judges. We, on this side of the House, were very strongly opposed to that, - and sought to defeat the clause. The amendment now proposed in clause 3 seeks to obviate the necessity for having the hours determined by three Judges, in the first place, by allowing them to be decided by one Judge. But it gives power to either party to the dispute to appeal to a Court consisting of three Judges. One can hardly imagine a case in which one party will not appeal, au 1 this provision must lead to considerable dissatisfaction and delay. The Prime Minister would be acting wisely if he were to agree to eliminate section 18, altogether and allow one Judge to deal with the question of hours. Clause 3 will not do what the Prime Minister desires it to do, because either party will be able to appeal . against the decision of the one Judge, and, consequently, an industry will remain unsettled pending the result of that appeal. This must have the effect of continuing the congestion that exists today. It would be far better to allow this question of hours to be decided by one Judges as it was prior to the last amendment of the Act. Clause 3 will surely lead to two hearings of the case, and that must involve delay instead of giving expedition. I personally desire to help in the passing of any proposal that is for the benefit of the process of industrial arbitration, but I say frankly that if I had to choose between the present law, which requires hours of labour to be determined by three Judges, and this proposed amendment, which provides for an appeal, much as I dislike the existing law, I would prefer it to the amendment, which rajast lead to two hearings of almost every case.",26
40,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Mr Justice Powers has had some experience, and he says that the present system, leads to congestion, and that this amendment will help him materially. We must have some regard to the opinion of the man who does the work.",26
41,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"I do not wish, to lightly brush aside the opinion .of the Judge. But this is a matter in regard to which we must use our own judgment. I , like the Prime Minister, have had a good deal of experience of industrial arbitration, and I say that in almost every case' one"" side or the other will appeal. That cannot lead to,expedition. No doubt it will help Mr Justice Powers if one Judge can deal with the question of hours in the initial stage, but under this power to appeal every case will be re-opened and heard a second time. I ask the Prime Minister to carefully consider this matter. I think he has endeavoured to provide a remedy for the present congestion in the Court, although it is, perhaps, a little belated. The Eill is necessary, and, excepting clause 3,I am heartily in accord with it.",27
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"Cowper) [11.45]. - I think every honourable member must agree as to the necessity for some amendment of the existing Act that will relieve the congestion in the Arbitration Court. But we should be very careful that in amending the law we do not make confusion worse confounded and get so deeply into the bog that we shall not be able to extricate ourselves very quickly. I was pleased to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) 6ay that he does not like clause 3. I expressed my view in regard to the fixation of hours last year. I think the hours to be worked in an industry are not a matter that can be decided very satisfactorily by a mere hearing in Court under existing conditions ; they should be dealt with in a scientific manner and on physiological grounds. But the danger that is to be apprehended from clause 3 is that the award of the one Judge will operate pending an appeal to the three Judges. For instance, one Judge may decide that Forty-four hours shall be the working week in an industry; that award will become operative; three months later the three Judges may decide on appeal that fortyeight hours per week shall be worked, and we shall then have great difficulty in curing the observance of that award by reason of the fact that for three months the employees have been already working the shorter week. In those circumstances, I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the working hours should be settled at one hearing, and we should adhere to the principle of having this matter decided by three Judges. The fact that this Bill will give power to the Government to appoint Deputy Presidents will, to a large extent, obviate the delay which has occurred in the past. If no other endeavour is made to amend clause 3, I shall propose certain amendments to provide that the award in regard to hours, like the judgment of any other Court, shall not be operative while an appeal is pending.",27
43,Mr FOLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Kalgoorlie) [11.49] - I am pleased that the Prime Minister has introduced this Bill. He told us that the first clause had been inserted at the request of the President of the Court (Mr. Justice Powers), and he advanced reasons as to why the appointments to the oflices of Deputy Presidents should be restricted to barristers and solicitors. T should like the Prime Minister, if he can do so, to tell us what were the reasons given by the President of the Court for limiting the choice to these professional gentlemen? I do not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the granting of the right to appeal will appreciably prolong the settlement of cases. There will be appeals in some cases, but not in all. There may be appeals on the question of hours. I do not know why a man should have the right to appeal from the decision of all other tribunals but those of an Arbitration Court.",27
44,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,Appeal s from Arbit tration decisions have not hitherto been allowed.,27
45,Mr FOLEY,CONCILIATION AND,It is a good thing that the Billgives the right of appeal from such decisions.,27
46,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"The workers of New South Wales have, from the beginning, been opposed to the granting of the right of appeal.",27
47,Mr FOLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I have had some experience of Arbitration proceedings, and I se- have had experience as a worker, and I think that the giving of the right of appeal is a step in advance. When an appeal is made, the shorthand notes of the evidence taken at the original hearing will be available, so that very little additional evidence need be called, and the questions in dispute can be settled very quickly. When a question has been dealt with on appeal, the settlement will he more permanent than some settlements are now.",27
48,Mr MARRS,CONCILIATION AND,Withi n what time may an appeal be lodged ?,28
49,Mr FOLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I think that the Government, after consulting the employers and the employees, will be able to fix by lation the time within which an appeal should be lodged - If there is any weakness in the proposal, I should like to have it pointed out, because I am very desirous that our legislation shall tend to the procuring of industrial peace.",28
50,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"Batman) [11.57] The Bill adds one more measure to the long list of amendments of the conciliation and arbitration law. In its main purpose it will be welcomed by the members of the Labour party, and by those outside who are interested in industrial activities, especially the workers in those activities. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), myself, and others have spoken in this Chamber quite recently of the unfortunate congestion of work in the Arbitration Court. That the Court is not staffed to an extent that approaches adequacy has been the cause of grave unrest and dissatisfaction among wage-earners. It has been a public scandal that a high Judicial Tribunal, such as the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, should be so ridiculously understaffed as to be unable to discharge the functions for which it was created. I ventured to say in thisplace, not very long ago, that there was strong evidence for the supposition that the Government had determined, rather than destroy the Court deliberately, Ministers - being pledged to support arbitration, to allow its business to drift into confusion and chaos, and that things were rapidly tending to that unhappy climax. The Minister for Works and Railways i(Mr. Groom), in replying to my complaint, did not, by arguments or figures, endeavour to answer my contention; he merely denied, indignantly, the facts that I had put before honourable members. 'He said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hugbes)i had already sufficiently answered the contention that there was any desire on the part of the Government to destroy the Court. It would have been much more becoming of the Minister had he made some explanation of the fact that the President of the Court (Mr Justice Powers) had recently declared it to be impossible for him to carry on the work of the Court unaided. It would have been more fitting - had the Minister made some answer to my allegation that regu- the cases now awaiting hearing are twice as many as when Mr Justice Higgins was forced to retire from the position of President. Instead oV doing that, the honourable gentleman by a general denial endeavoured to convey the impression that I had spoken loosely, and without regard to my responsibilities, or the facts of the case - If there were wanted any further proof that I was entirely right in the matter, it is afforded by the Bill, whose terms are an acknowledgement that what I and other members have said lis accurate. The Bill empowers the Government to appoint a number of Deputy Presidents, who for' all practical purposes will have the same powers and duties as the President, in order to cope with the rush of work in the Court. I think that that provision is on right lines. The choice of Deputy even Presidents will no longer be limited to the Justices of the High Court, which is well, because the feeling of those Justices towards the Government in this matter is quite apparent, and none of them would accept the position of President or Deputy President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration.",28
51,Mr BOWDEN,CONCILIATION AND,The seat is not an easy one. The other Justices of the High Court have much pleasanter seats.,28
52,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"The seat is a most uncomfortable one, and the work is most difficult and trying. Eor a number of years I had the deepest sympathy with Mr Justice Higgins, who has given much of the best period of his life to the perfecting of a system of arbitration. Whatever bias some persons may have against him, I think that no one would deny that he brought to bear on the questions with which he has had to deal distinguished talents and extraordinary skill and patience. The proposed Deputy Presidents need not be members of the High Court Bench, but they must be barristers or solicitors, or barristers and solicitors, of the High Court or of the Supreme Court of a State. That provision leaves a fairly wide field of choice, and at that I do not cavil. But it is curious, and worthy of comment, that while we have taken all sorts' of care to prevent barristers and solicitors from appearing in the Court, we take equal care to prevent the position of Judge from being filled by any others than those of the legal profession. There is some point in certain of the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) when viewed in the light of historic facts. We exclude more or less learned gentlemen from appearing in the Court, though, as I have suggested, very often their presence might expedite and simplify procedure; but we say that no others shall be eligible to preside over it . The next matter of principle in this Bill is the provision for an Appeal Court and the abolition of the requirement now existing that a full Bench of three Justices shall deal with an application for an increase or reduction in hours. The Bill , it is true, abolishes that requirement, but curiously enough it reinstates it , in another and more vicious form , by creating a Court of Appeal. Although one Judge may decide the question of an increase or reduction of hours, his decision is subject to an appeal to the President, sitting with two Deputy Presidents. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has rightly pointed out that if there is one thing more than 'another on which industrialists and those who sympathize with them have insisted it is that in matters of arbitration there should be no righ t of appeal from the direct and simple decision of one Judge. As I pointed out on 'another occasion, no person was more in sistent in his objection to a Court of A p peal than was the Prime Minister himself at one time. His objection was well justified, because the existence of such .a Court is an invitation to appeal, and such an invitation will be accepted in nearly every case. Thus we have not got r i d of the objectionable feature which Labour so strenuously opposed when this matter was last before us, namely, the necessity of having a cumbrous Court of three Justices to deal with the question of a decrease or increase of hours. Instead of getting r i d of it this Bill makes the avenue to that cumbrous Court longer and more difficult. When we go into Committee I shall be found in opposition to that provision. Another matter worth mentioning this stage is the proposal to make awards resultant from agreements Mr Bretman. to successors in and transmittees of any particular business which has been bound by the Court, if a business can be bound hy it . The Prime Minister, in moving the second reading of the Bill , said that the clause in question was of doubtful constitutionality. Whatever may be its relation to the Constitution it is of very doubtful practicability. The intention, however, is wholly wise, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is to be congratulated upon bringing the matter forward and having such a provision for what it , was worth inserted in the Bill . This is by no means the first time that we have considered the principle in this Chamber. It is already law so far as regards the ordinary award. It is now proposed to make it law in the special case. There is, however, the very old principle that no person can be bound by the decision of a Court in respect of proceedings to which he was not a party, and although the Deputy Leader of the Opposition rightly points out that the transmi'ttee or assignee of a business takes over that business at his peril in so far as the obligations relating to it are concerned, I think that the principle that a man may not be bound by a decision given in proceedings to which he was not a party is likely to create difficulty and to make it impossible to apply our good in tentions in this regard. It would he difficult even if a business were transferred and assigned in good f a it h , but where an assignee takes over a business, as he w i ll do, with the special purpose of evading his obligations under an award, it is more than likely that he will be able to do so in such a way as to successfully evade such obligations. It is not for me to suggest the ways and means by which he will possibly do so. I understood the Prime M in ister to say that this provision would not apply to businesses that had changed hands after a plaint had been filed but before the award relating to it had been made; but that it would apply to businesses that had changed hands after the award was made. I suggest to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) that that curious statement is worthy of explanation. A f t e r a plaint is filed, and before the award is made, an assignee or transmittee has some chance to come in and be a party to the proceedings. A f t e r the award is made he has no such opporat tunity. I am therefore at a loss to understand why we should expressly exapplicable elude those who have an opportunity to come in before an award is completed, whereas we intend to apply the provision with certainty to those who afterwards take over a business. I shall not further delay the seconu reading of this Bill . I record, with some satisfaction, that .the Bill , ' so far as it goes, is an answer to our repeated complaints. It is a very tardy and, apparently, reluctant concession of what we have asked for : but we are'grateful for it. I think that the Government, although somewhat late in the day, has acted, tinder pressure, with very great wisdom in not allowing Parliament to go into recess leaving industrial conditions as they are at the present time.",28
53,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATION AND,This action on the part of the Government proves the foresight of honourable members of the Labour party.,30
54,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,"It does. I congratulate the Government upon its eleventh-hour repentance. I quite see that the appointment of these new judicial officers-no t necessarily High Court Justices, but able, competent men of training and experience-wil l have an exceedingly good effect on the minds of the people generally, and, in particular, on the minds of those who are striving to get the benefits of this Court. One commentary may well be made. Over and over again we have been charged with disloyalty to the determinations of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Over and over again men, both outside and inside this Parliament, have been charged with flouting the Court and having a desire to uproot it . My position is quite clear. I am not an enthusiastic believer in the Court. The Prime Minister seems to think I am, and has suggested that mv interest in it is professional rather than political. I leave the taunt with no further comment, because it is hardly worth more. A p a r t altogether from that, I am not au enthusiastic believer ih the principle. I rather believe that in these later days men can do, by organization, co-operation, and loyalty to each other, everything that we tions of hours. thought it was necessary to have an Act of Parliament to accomplish. All Ihey want is a proper spirit of comradeship i order that they may get justice in the bargains that they make with their emthe ployers. That being so, I am not slavishly devoted to the policy of conciliation arbitration. But, the Court being in existence, and the workers showing an even extraordinary readiness to come under its jurisdiction, I can only repeat that it was, an act of gross political in decency on the part of the Government to prevent the Court from discharging its functions. This, the latest amendment of the Act, coming although it does at the close of the session, is to be entirely welcomed, and I think it will be fraught with very good results.",30
55,Mr BOWDEN,CONCILIATION AND,"Nepean) [12.16] There are three principles embodied in this Bill , and in regard to two of them there is apparently very little dispute. I confess, however, that clause 3 causes me some concern. The original provision that any plaint involving the question of an increase or decrease of hours should be heard by a Court of three Justices is a fair one. I recognise the force of the objection, raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that by making this amendment of the Act and providing for a Court of Appeal we shall not expedite, but rather delay, the giving of decisions in such cases. In stead of having in each case one application to one Court, we shall have two applications to two Courts. The objection raised by the Leader of the Country party must also be borne in mind. He has pointed out that in tihe interval between the making of an award relating to hours of employment and the hearing of an appeal in respect of it , that award will operate, and that if the appeal should result in the award being set aside a great "" deal of difficulty may be encountered in enforcing the Appeal Court's decision. On the other hand, I understand that in quite a number of cases that go before the Court the question of hours is only a minor consideration, but that the whole of the remaining questions involved in the plaint have to be held up until a Court of three Justices can deal with that minor matter of hours.",30
56,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,That is not so now. ' They have recently been dissecting claims regarding rates and condition's from ques,30
57,Mr BOWDEN,CONCILIATION AND,If that is so-if the n decision in regard to other and more i m portant matters is not delayed because of necessity to first of all get the judgment of three Judges on the question of and hours-the arguments advanced by theDeputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) will still need to be answered before I can agree to the provision.,30
58,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Darling) [12.20] I am in accord with the provisions of the Bill, except clause 3, whioh, although it purports not to limit the operations of the Arbitration Court, will permit of their being delayed in a manner that will uot provide facilities to the parties who are asking for awards. The last amending Bill provided for the appointment of two Deputies to sit with the President of the Arbitration Court and deal with the question of hours. The Labour party strongly opposed the measure, because, from the beginning of arbitration, one Judge had always dealt with this matter, and dealt with it satisfactorily. It was only when pressure was brought to bear cn the Government by the employers' organizations that the Governmeut consented to make provision for three Judges to deal with this question; but, after having passed an amending Bil l through Parliament in order to absolutely prevent the Court from dealing with the matter, Cabinet refused to appoint the two additional Judges. As a consequence, the question of hours could not be considered for nine months. The Bill provides a further amendment of section 18A, which will enable an appeal to be lodged from an award delivered by one of the Deputies. The difficulty in this regard will be this: No appeal can be heard until at least some time has elapsed-it may be' three months-and in the meantime employers and employees will become accustomed to the new conditions provided in the award, and if the employees are satisfied with the hours it fixes, they are not likely to accept a varied award as made by the Appeal Court. I u any case, there is no power to compel them to do so. This 'provision for appeals from the awards of Deputies will prove not onlycostly to the parties, but also cumbersome. The Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) suggests that no award should come into operation until three weeks or a mouth after delivery, during which time an appeal may be lodged. But that would simply make the process more cumbersome and unwieldy.  member's view of the suggestion of the Leader of the Country party that the question of hours should be removed from the Court and decided scientifically?",31
59,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I am in agreement with any method that will investigate, from a scientific or social stand-point, the question of the hours of the workers; but the trouble is that, although our Government may investigate such a question, they will not go any further in the matter. For instance, they have already declined to carry out the recommendation made by a Commission, comprising representatives of the employers and employees, which was appointed to investigate the question of the basic wage. If a Commission were appointed to deal with the question of hours from a health point of view, or to consider how long men can work, what speed they can attain, and what their productive power may be under varying conditions of work, I am afraid that the Government would not carry out any conclusion arrived at. Similar investigations have heen made in America and Great Britain, in the latter country notably by Lord Leverhulme, who is of opinion that, after a man works for six hours, his productive power declines so that it does not pay the employer to work him any longer.  ployees work for eight hours a day.",31
60,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"I believe that they do in some instances. I would welcome the appointment of any tribunal to settle the question of hours, hut if it recommended that the working week should be forty-four hours, I am sure that the Government would not accept the finding. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was amended in order to provide for the appointment of two Deputies to deal with hours of work, the Government displayed extraordinary reluctance in respect to making the appointments, and I hope that if the Bill before us is agreed to the Government will not similarly hang up the appointment of further Deputies, at any rate, not for another nine months until another deputation of employers' organizations waits upon them. Tf the Government would appoint two Deputies for the unexpired term of the President of the Arbitration Court, namely, six and a half years, and another two Deputies for at least three years, the congestion now existing in Court would be very quickly overcome. But it would be a fatal mistake to take Justices from the High Court or a Supreme Court, and ask them to arbitrate in respect to a couple of cases only. I hope that care will be exercised in the type of men selected to fill the positions. There are many men in the Commonwealth with long experience of arbitration matters who could do the work with conspicuous ability, and I have not the slightest doubt that if such men are chosen the present congestion will be considerably lessened. I opposed the passage of the Industrial Peace Bill, but I believe that the provisions of that measure which enable the parties to disputes to come together in councils and local committees could be applied with advantage to the arbitration system. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not bring employers and employees together under an independent chairman for the purpose of settling a dispute.",31
61,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,I think it does.,32
62,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,There is provision for compulsory conferences at which the representation need not be equal.,32
63,Mr BOWDEN,CONCILIATION AND,But they can only be called wliere disputes have arisen.,32
64,Mr BLAKELEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes . A compulsory conference can be called upon the application of one of the parties, but that is about the only provision in the Act which meets the position that I am putting forward, that employers and employees ought to be able to come together, as they can under the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act. I am sure that if similar provision was made in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act there would not be the congestion which now exists in the Arbitration Court, and that a great number of the cases which now occupy the time of the President of the Court would be disposed of by the parties themselves.",32
65,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,"Dampier) [12.24] [ regret that this Bill has been brought a in at such a late hour of the session, and that it is not possible for us to deal the principal Act. We have had a lot of work this session, and possibly the Government have not been able to give the matter sufficient consideration, but it is time that we came to some definite conclusion in regard to the powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The expense to which the community is put in connection with the hearing of claims before this Court is preposterous. The Constitution states clearly that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court can deal only with disputes of an Inter-State character, hut there is hardly a calling of any description in the Commonwealth whose employees are not endeavouring to bring it within the purview of this Court. We have the anomaly of State Courts dealing with certain industries, and having their awards - overridden by those delivered by the President of the Commonwealth Court. Some persons are constantly demanding the amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution to enable the trouble in this regard to be overcome, but I am sure that it can be done more easily in this Chamber by clearly defining the industries that are to come within the purview of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court.",32
66,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,The Courts have been defining that ever since they have been in existence.,32
67,Mr GREGORY,CONCILIATION AND,We ought to do it ourselves.,32
68,Mr BRENNAN,CONCILIATION AND,There «has been the widest definition.,32

75,Mr CHARITON,CONCILIATION AND,"Hunter) [12.40] In the second-reading debate reasons were given why this clause should not be included in the Bill . As I explained, I and others on this side are really opposed to this clause, and to section. IS of the principal Act, and I think it would be as well if I the Prime Minister would, as he has power to do-, propose that that section be eliminated, thus leaving the matter of the standard hours to one Judge. This, I think, would meet - with the wishes of all who are interested. A f t e r all, prior to the last amendment of the Act, which was made when the times were considered to be abnormal, one Judge performed this duty, and I see no reason why we should not revert to that plan. If we agree to the amendment of the Act now submitted it will result in prolonging the. hearing of cases, because there will always be an appeal from one side or the other.",33
76,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,Of all the cases that have been heard before the Court very few have come before three Judges on appeal.,33
77,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"That is the very argument I used in support of my view on a former occasion; there have been very few cases determined in that way, but there may be more in the future . Possibly out of the sixty cases now pending some twenty or t h i r t y may have reference to hours, and if these cases are heard before one Judge, with the right of appeal, that righ t will surely be availed of, thus involving a rehearing and additional expense.",33
78,Mr MAXWELL,CONCILIATION AND,And it may work out that the ultimate determination is am expression of opinion by two Judges out of four.,33
79,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,"As the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) pointed out, it is possible that a decision by one Judge to reduce the hours to forty-four may on appeal be reversed, and forty-eight hours made the rule. Such a reversal cannot fail to give rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction, because men are not likely to be willing to return to forty-eight hours after having worked for some time on a basis of forty-four. Altogether, I think the Prime Minister would be acting wisely if he deleted this clause and allowed one Judge to settle the matter; otherwise, this Bill is 'badly required, and will have my support.",34
80,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.45] - I shall be very glad to meet the honourable member (Mr Charlton) in any way, because I am certain that his desire is to attain the very object the Government has in view, namely, the smooth working of the industrial machine. It is undeniable, of course, that two questions stand out as the main causes of industrial disputesone is the question of hours, and the other the question of wages, though, of course, there are others. But ihe honourable member is wrong in supposing that the great number of cases heard before the Court now have reference to hours. While wages are ever, as it were, trying to adjust themselves to a hew level, hours, until quite recently, seemed to have found a settled and permanent basis. For many years in this country, after the principle of the eight-hour day had ibeen established, things apparently were on a satisfactory footing. If ten cases come into Court, it is quite wrong to say that all have relation to hours, though there may be six or eight of them, and these might be settled by arrangement between employer and employed. However, the best answer to the honourable member's argument is the fact that the President of the Court, with all his experience, says that if we insist on maintaining three Judges, as now, he cannot go on; and the remedy he suggests is that now before the Committee",34
81,Mr CHARLTON,CONCILIATION AND,Did the President say it was necessary to have three Judges for such cases?,34
82,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"What I understood was that the President was of the opinion that if three Judges were required in order to settle hours, then he could not carry on unless these Deputies were appointed. I admit that I had not seen the President to speak to since last January, but we then discussed the position of the Court generally. He wished to know whether it was our intention to create any more Tribunals under the In dustrial Peace Act. On that point the Judge desired certain assurances, which I gave him. Now we have his assurance that the proposed amendment will be of very great benefit, and the Court will work more smoothly and expeditiously. The hours of labour ought not to be continually in a state of flux, so that no one. knows from one day to the other what is going to he the standard in Australia. It would he a very good thing if some Court laid down, once and for all, what are to be the standard hours for a period of two or three years at least, and thus put. an end to this uncertainty and confusion. No one man can settle all industrial details in Australia; indeed, I do not think that one manshould have the right to do so. No one is a more stalwart supporter of the privileges or rights of the people than I am, but I do not admit that forty-eight hours is too much for men. In all but a few industries, which can he counted on the fingers of my right hand, it is not too much. As to mining, I do not offer any opinion, but I can say that in some mines forty hours may be far too much, in others not enough. But the great bulk of the workers of the country are engaged in work that I myself could do in a forty-eight hour week without fatigue; and what I can do others can do, and probably better. For men engaged in rock chopping, sewer mining, mining at great depths or under bad conditions, and some other strenuous occupations a working week of forty-eight hours may be too long, but by and large it is not too much. The honourable member for Hunter has suggested that after one Judge has awarded a week of forty-four hours there will be weeping - and gnashing of teeth if , as a result of appeal to the three Judges, the .workers have to revert to a forty-eight hours' week. That would be only natural. But the point I wish to make is that if I , as one of the - Deputy Judges, awarded forty-eight hours per week, and an appeal were lodged, I would suspend the operation of the award until the appeal had been heard cases out of 100 that will be done.",34
83,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,rWh y not make ib mandatory ?,35
84,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND,"If the honourable member can get such an .amendment carried through this Committee I shall have no objection. I think any Judge will decide that while his award is the subject of an appeal its operation should be suspended. Whilst I desire to meet the wishes of the honourable member for Hunter, I reluctantly have to refuse his request that this clause should be struck out.",35
85,Mr MAXWEL L,CONCILIATION AND,"Suppose that the primary Judge fixes forty-four hours, and an appeal is made to an appellate Court consisting of the President and two Deputies.

94,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"Cowper) [2.30] I urge the Committee to hasten slowly, or the title of the Bill may become a - misnomer, because effect of the measure may be, not to And in 99 conciliate and settle industrial disputes, but to create continual strikes. The Minister may suggest that what I desire might be done by regulation, but I think it would be better to deal definitely in the Bill with the subject of appeals. Personally I am opposed to the giving of the right of appeal in arbitration matters. An arbitration finding should be 'final in regard to the case that is dealt with . Generally an arbitration award is a compromise, and that compromise having been arrived at, effect should be given to it. If the right of appeal is given, there will be no end to the decisions; a case will be taken from Court to Court, u n t i l ultimately it is won by the party having the longer purse. While it may be possible to arrange for appeals from decisions regarding rates of wages, I am satisfied that no system providing for appeals from findings on questions of hours would be satisfactory. If one Judge decided that the hours worked by a set of employees should be forty-four per week, and on appeal, four months later, it were held that forty-six or forty-eight hours should be worked, there would be a strike against the enforcement of the judgment of the higher Court. In ho case, moreover, could a finding in respect of hours be made retrospective. I would prefer to allow to stand the provision to which we agr- - d last year rather than have it provides altered in the way suggested, unless an award be made inoperative if appealed against u n t il the appeal has been heard.",35
95,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,CONCILIATION AND,That would provide an inducement for appealing.,35
96,Dr EARLE PAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"Yes , and therefore I would prefer the law to stand as it is. The question of hours is so i m portant that if we are to continue our present unscientific way of determining it , there should be three Judges to hear any case in which it arises. If , however, we dealt with it in the way in which it is beginning to he dealt with in all large manufacturing countries, that is, on a scientific physiological basis, the evidence that would be brought should be sufficient to enable one Judge to give a satisfactory decision; one that would satisfy not . merely those immediately concerned, but also the public.",35
97,Mr FOLEY,CONCILIATION AND,"Would you apply that the method to every industry? Conciliation and [8 DECEMBER, 1921.] Arbitration Bill (No. 3).",35
98,Dr EAELEPAGE,CONCILIATION AND,"I would apply it to the basic industries. In certain outdoor occupations it matters little whether a man works a couple of hours more or less in a week, but in indoor industries, especially in certain trades and manufactures, employment for more than a certain number of hours per week has beeu proved by the experience of the last seven years to affect detrimentally, not merely the output of the workers, but their general health and civic fitness. This Parliament has for months been considering a Tariff to encourage manufactures, and it is therefore the more important that means should be provided for properly determining questions of hours and conditions. We know what is being done in this direction in Great Britain , in Germany, and in the TJnited States. During the war there was appointed i u Great Brit a in the Health of Munition Workers Commission, whose work has since been taken over by the Industrial Fatigue Research Boardj whose function it is to do what .we in Australia are asking Judges to do, namely, to determine facts which are ascertainable only by scientific investigation. Fatigue is uot to be judged merely by the sensation of tiredness. As has been proved during the past seven or years, it manifests itself by a diminished output. That is the first sign of overwork. Several big manufacturing concerns, in Great B r it a in are employing tinuously at big salaries scientific investigators, whose work it is to determine the number of hours for which each particular employee can best be kept at his job. In this way it is being found possible in many cases largely to reduce running costs by not working men after their output begins to decline. In rural occupations the health of the workers is not affected detrimentally by a slight extension of hours, but in big city workshops, where men 'are attending to machines, fatigue develops more quickly. In such occupations the application of some scientific method is desirable for determining the number of hours than can best be worked. At the present' time the question of hours is settled on the mere ipse dixit of a Court before which little scientific evidence has been placed. The proper settlement of the questions of hours and conditions will have a decided effect on the national 14115 health. For the present I should like to see the settlement of these matters in trusted to a Court of three Judges, without appeal; but I hope that in the near future methods closely analogous to those which are being employed in other parts of the world, particularly in connection with big manufacturing industries, may be adopted. The Commission of which I have just spoken says in its report that It is certain that unless our industrial life is to be guided in the future by the application of physiological science to the details of its management, it cannot hope to retain its position hereafter among some of its foreign rivals, who already in that respect have gained a present advantage. I move That the following new paragraphs be added to sub-section 4:""(c) Every such appeal shall be instituted by notice of appeal, which shall he served and filed are prescribed, and no otlier formal proceeding other than the notice of appeal shall be necessary. [d) When notice of such appeal has been duly instituted, the enforcement of that portion of the award appealed from shall be stayed pending the decision of the Court, constituted by the President and by two or more Deputy Presidents, on the hearing of the appeal."" eight Mr BLUNDELL (Adelaide) [ 2 . 4 1 ] - I hope that the Committee will reject the clause. One reason for voting against it is the fact that the learned legal lumi con- naries in the Chamber have expressed greatly differing opinions as to its effect. To my mind, the last explanation of the Prime Minister in regard to it was as clear as mud. I have had experience of industrial litigation, and I have always found it to be the general feeling of employers and employees that there should be no right of appeal, because what is needed is finality. Parliament has already referred to three Judges the decision of the question of hours. To that I do not object. What is now proposed is to allow one Judge to determine an application respecting the number of hours to be worked and to give a right of appeal fro m his finding. That will mean the trying of the same case twice over, when there is already the machinery by which it can be settled in the first instance. The Prime Minister says that the provision has been put before Parliament because the President of the Arbitration Court thinks that the method proposed will expedite business. I realise that that gentleman was appointed to the position he holds because of his special fitness and ability, and I have the greatest respect for him; - but even Judges are not infallible; and I think that he suggests a course which would mean two hearings of a case instead of one, and would create great dissatisfaction, because, as a general rule, the loser of the first hearing, whether employer or employee, would be sure to appeal. It would be better to let both sides know that if there is a question of hours to be settled there is a Court of three Judges available to determine it . Let us not provide for an appeal which is unnecessary, and which should be avoided in the settlement of industrial disputes.

101,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [ 3 . 5 ] move That this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is to amend section 7 and to repeal section 19 of the W a r Precautions Act Repeal Act 1920. Section 7 provides that the War Precautions Regulations controlling the registration and activities of companies and - firms operating within the Commonwealth shall continue until the end of the present year. This Bill will extend their operation until 31st December, 1922, but not in their entirety, because it is proposed to l i m it their applicacation so far as they affect firms, a matter which can easily be dealt with by the various State laws dealing with the registration of firms, and to continue the regulations for the extended period so far as they relate to foreign corporations and or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth.",38
102,Mr FLEMING,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,You still wish to keep an control over financial corporations within,38
103,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The regulations will apply, so far as they relate, to foreign corporations, and trading or financial corpon - rations formed within the Commony wealth. During the war, and for some time afterwards, there was a suspension of the registration of foreign corporations desiring to carry' on business in Australia, but latterly about thirty have been registered. Dealing with this Comsubject, the Treasurer in his Budget Foreign capital. Under the War 'Precautions Act 1920, it is an offence to register in Australia any company with capital partly or wholly subscribed outside the Britisli Kinpire, Deexcept with the consent of the Treasurer. the beginning of the current year, authority has been issued for the registration in the Commonwealth of twenty-seven foreign companies with a total subscribed capital of, approximately, £13,500.000 sterling. The bulk of this capital has been found in the United * - - States of America. Seven of the companies, with a subscribed capital of about £3,500,000 sterling, have been established to carry on industrial and productive operations in the Commonwealth, two to conduct fire and marine insurance business, and eighteen to carry ontrading operations. We are dropping altogether the necessity for the registration of firms as distinct BILL. fro m corporations. Mr Charlton,-You are reverting to the position that existed prior to the war ? - I Mr GROOM - Yes , we are leaving the registration of firms to be dealt with by State laws. All we propose to do now is to continue the regulations so far as they relate to foreign companies and trading or financial corporations formed within the ^limits of Commonwealth. The . Treasury and the Crown Law Department have for some time had under consideration the question of submitting to the Commonwealth Parliament a comprehensive measure dealing with company law under the present constitutional powers. But at this stage it would be impossible to bring such a big Bill before the House. We are now simply asking for an extension for twelve months of the Commonwealth control over these corporations. In the meantime the matter of exercising more complete control over them can be taken into consideration. The other part of the Bill deals with the repeal of section 19 of the War Precautions Act Repeal Act , which requires the agents in Australia of all overseas companies and firms to furnish particulars regarding the business of their principals to the Collector of Customs in the State in which their chief place of business is situated. These particulars in clude the name, address, capital, and balance-sheet of the company or firm. But under the Companies and Firms Acts of the States' all companies and firms carrying on business in Australia in tiheir own names are required to be registered, irrespective of whether their head offices are established in Australia or abroad. The effect of section 19 has, therefore, been to require companies and firms already registered in .Australia to be practically re-registered with the Department of Trade and Customs. This obligation has imposed a great deal of trouble on firms, and strong objection has been taken by British companies, especially to * the provision requiring them to furnish particulars of their financial position to tiheir agents in Australia for submission to the Department of Trade and Customs. Having given consideration to these representations, the Department found it practically necessary to suspend the provisions of the section, and in. the circumstances they have come to the conclusion that it would be better to repeal it. The Bill provides for its repeal. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended and Bill read a third time: Mr Groom. ELECTOR AL BILL . SECOND READING.  Home and Territories) [3.13] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I do not think that a long speech will be required from me to impress on honourable members the necessity for .this simple little measure. AB ill was passed by the Tasmanian Parliament in 1907 enabling a member of the State Legislature to resign his seat and contest a Fede- . ral election. Provision was made that, on a request from the member so resigning his seat, the issue of a w r it to fill the vacancy should be delayed u n t i l after the declaration of the poll of the election he was contesting. It was not provided that if he did not succeed in winning the Federal election his seat in the State Legislature should be kept for him , but that defect was remedied in 1917, when the State law was amended by the following provision: If the member so resigning his seat, and notifying the Governor as aforesaid(i) fails to secure election in Tasmania for the Parliament of the Commonwealth; and (ii) is nominated;as a candidate for the vacancy occurring through his own resignation, as aforesaidthe Returning Officer to whom the writ is directed shall forthwith, without holding a poll, publicly declare him to be duly elected to fill the said vacancy, and the writ shall be so returned, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act. Following on that, every State in the Commonwealth has passed similar legislation.",38
104,Mr JACKSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"And a number of people in Tasmania are ashamed of it .  two States in which the Bills have been reserved for His Majesty's Assent, presumably on some constitutional ground. t)ur Electoral Act made the provision that a State member desiring to be a candidate for the Federal' Parliament must resign his State seat fourteen days before the nomination; and the Bill before us maintains that position. I should like to draw attention toi one or two anomalies that may arise under the legislation of the States; and here I may say that I am satisfied that this Parliament has the constitutional right to make any electoral law it desires.",39
105,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Does this Bill in crease the disqualification in any way ?  cation is exactly the same as before. Howeiver, let ua suppose there is an election for the Federal Parliament, and that there are three candidates, one, the State member who has resigned his State seat, the retiring Federal member, and another candidate nominated' from outside. Let us further, assume that the outsider wins, which, of course, is quite probable; and then what is the position? If there happens then to be a vacancy in the Parliament of the State, the Federal member is not eligible to contest it because it is given back to the man who had resigned to contest the Federal seat,"" and did not succeed. Let us take another case. We have heard a great deal of talk about parliamentary salaries, but I venture to say that £875 a year in New South Wales, the allowance of State member, is infinitely better than£1,000, the allowance of a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. Let us assume that certain , members of the New South Wales Parliament decline to contest a seat in a Parliament which meets in Melbourne, against which city there is much complaint because of the climate, and so for t h , and because they regard £875 as a member of the New South Wales Parliament as preferable. One State member, however, may favour Melbourne, said decide to contest a Federal seat. He may win it , but if he is defeated, his State seat remains to him. The whole position, is ridiculous. However, I shall not ""stone-wall'"" my own Bill , but simply move the second reading.",39

When I was a member of the State Parliament in New South Wales, I had no desire to become a. Federal member, but my constituents requested me to do so, and, thereupon, I resigned my seat, throwing all into the melting pot. H ad I been a member of a State Legislature I should have opposed such legislation as they have passed in this connection, but, at the same time, I submit that we are not justified in retaliating with a drastic measure of this kind.",40

I hope I shall never be a party to restricting the right of any individual to come here. I do not propose to examine the motives of the State-legislators, and I do not intend to vote for a Bill which, apparently in a paltry spirit of retaliation very unbecoming the Australian Parliament, intends to r i d members of this Parliament of any competition.

116,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Hlawarra) [3.27],- I point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. (Mr Oharlton) and the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) that the law of the Commonwealth since its inception, or, at any rate, for the past fifteen years, has been that a member of a State Legislature who wishes to offer himself for election to the Commonwealth Parliament should resign his seat fourteen days before nomination. There has been a concerted move on the part of the State Parliaments to undermine by covert means that legislation. The Commonwealth 'Parliament now proposes to assert its undoubted right to prescribe the qualifications of those who seekentrance to it , and to preserve the conditions which have existed until now, without question, so far as I have ever heard, by the electors of the Commonwealth or of the States. I have taken part in many political campaigns, in some as a principal, and I have never been questioned by an elector as to the power which the Commonwealth has maintained almost from the beginning in this matter. The arguments which led to that provision being placed in the Commonwealth Electoral Act are as sound now as they were the day they were passed by this Parliament. What we are asked to do today is not to make a new law, a "" r e t a l i at o r y "" or a "" mean and paltry ' ' law, as the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) described - it, but to preserve the law a& it has prevailed throughout the history of the Commonwealth. There is one phase of the question, to which attention may be called. When the electors send a man into the State Parliament, it is to do State work. How can any one justify the contention that a .man so elected to discharge State dutiesmay throw over the State electors and contest a seat in the Federal Parliament, thus depriving the State electors who originally elected him of the right of pronouncing judgment on his conduct ? It i& our duty to preserve the rights of the electors rather than the rights of State members-. If the Commonwealth Parliament thinksthat that restriction should be removed, it is the authority to remove it . But .we should resist, with all the power we have-, any attempt on the part of State Earlia ments toprescribe the qualifications of candidates for this Parliament. That, undoubtedly, is the right solely of this Parliament.",41

143,Mr BELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Darwin) [ 3 . 5 2 ] - I am not in favour of restricting the choice of the people in the election of representatives to this Parliament, and, therefore, I shall vote against the Bill , even though the State Parliaments may have found a way of circumventing the intention of the Federal authorities that a State legislator should not be a candidate for Federal honours. As a sportsman, I wish the field to be as wide as possible, because the greater the competition the more valuable the victory. If I am de' feated by an opponent who is a member of the State Legislature, - obviously my servioes have not been altogether satisfactory to the electors, and I must bow to their decision without complaint. But if I am chosen against the competition of a State legislator, my victory is the more meritorious. In Tasmania, when a vacancy occurs in the State Parliament, a by-election is not held, but a recount is made of the votes cast at the last general election, and the next man on the list is chosen to f ill the vacancy. We have there group electorates, each returning six members, elected by preferential voting on a system of proportional representation, and the seventh man is chosen without a contest to fill any vacancy arising through the resignation or death of any of: the elected members of a group. Therefore, it seems to me that the proposed legislation will not do what it is intended to do, because, if a State member stands for a Federal constituency and is defeated, he will have the right, although he has resigned his State seat, to take it again, being preferred before the candidate next below him on the poll at the previous State election. But, in any case, I desire, as I have already said, that the' people shall have as wide a choice as possible. The proposed legislation seems to me retaliatory, and likely to be resented by the States. It may create a feeling between the members of the State and Federal Parliaments which we do not wish to create.",43
144,Mr ATKINSON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Wilmot ) [ 3 . 5 7 ] do not think that we can afford to pass legislation of the kind now proposed. The people should have the widest choice in the selection of representatives to this Parliament. I am not in favour of curtailing their choice.  pose any restriction other than has existed since the inception of Federation.. - Mr ATKINSON - If we say that a State legislator is ineligible for a Federal seat, we impose a restriction on the choice of the people, and whatever the State 'Parliaments may have done, we should not follow a bad example. In Tasmania, under the proportional system, members are elected in groups, six for each division. At one time, when a* State member resigned his seat to contest a Federal constituency, he accompanied his letter of resignation with a request to the Governor in Council that the State by-election which the resignation would render necessary should not be held until after the Federal election. Then, if he lost the Federal contest, he had a chance of regaining his State seat. But as it was found that the frequent holding of byelections tended to upset the balance of representation secured at the general election, it was decided not to hold by-elections, ancl to fill any vacancy with the didate next on the poll after the six which had been chosen for any group. In no circumstances, therefore, is the retiring Federal member given a chance' to contest the State seat. We are not here, however, to serve our own personal interests. We have to take a broader view of these matters. It might be very convenient for us personally to render it impossible for A , B, and C, who have seats in the State Parliament, to run against us. A State member certainly has a great advantage over, a Federal member if he chooses to take'*opportunity by the hand. Those of us who represent distant States have to be away from our electorates for mouths at a time while the Federal Parliament is in session. On the other hand, a member of the State Parliament is constantly moving amongst the people, and it is very easy to put forward the suggestion that the Federal member is rarely in his division. The fact that the Federal member is attending to his duties in this Legislature is often overlooked. I have - I no reason to complain, because I have notsuffered in that direction; but I know that the seats of many Federal members have been undermined in their absence. Having regard to all the facts, however, we cannot properly cut into the broad, general p r in i m - ciple that the people should have the widest choice in the selection of their representatives,- and for that reason I cannot support this Bill .",44
145,Mr LAVELLE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Calare) [4.3] - Be fore setting out briefly the grounds on. which I oppose this Bill , I wish to congratulate the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter) on the excellent case he has put up on behalf of those who support it . I cannot say that I agree with the statement made by him, that this is really an attempt on the part of the Government - to safeguard the rights of the people, and to observe the spirit of the Constitution. In my view it is a deliberate attempt to debar members of State Parliaments from entering this House, and would, therefore, restrict the choice of the people. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Making has said, this might well be called "" A Save Our Seats Bill , "" and I hope that it will be rejected. I am not going to cast a vote to restrict the choice of the people canor to impose any obstacle in the way of a member of a State Parliament who desires to offer himself for election to this Legislature. There are a great many excellent men serving the people in the smaller sphere of State politics. If they desire to enter the Commonwealth. Legislature, or if the electors desire that they should represent them here, those men should have the right to submit themselvesto the will of the people withouthaving to resign their State seats. If that were not allowed, then the people might be deprived of the services of such men in both State and Federal politics. I regret that it .should have been considered necessary for the State Parliaments to pass an Act requiring, any of their members who proposes to stand for a Federal seat to put in a "" make-believe resignation."" It should be unnecessary even to ""make-believe."" The Commonwealth Electoral Act should be so wide as to enable State members to contest Federal seats without resigning or pretending to resign their membership of the State Parliaments. A member of a State Legislature could not be returned to this House unless a majority of the electors in the division for which he stood determined that he should represent them.  the second reading of this Bill, said that members of the New South House of Assembly were £875 a year, and were a better position than are of the Commonwealth Parliament, receive £1,000 a year. I recognise that from a financial point of view they are better of f ; and, while I admit that £1,000 a year is an insufficient allowance for a member of this Legislature, I do not think that any member of Parliament sought election merely because of the allowance attaching to membership. convinced that the majority of the members of the State and Federal have sought election only because of a sincere desire to serve the people. may not all look at political from the one stand-point; but I do not think the members of either the Federal or any State Parliament have been moved to seek election merely to secure the allowance attaching to membership. honourable member has said that it might be advisable to provide for members of this Parliament contesting seats in the Legislatures of the States without to resign. I do not think, however, that any member of the National would willingly retire from Federal poliMr La/velle. tics for the sake of entering a State Legislature. If there are any who would do so, no obstacle, such as resignation from this Parliament before seeking such election, should be placed in their way. An important point was touched upon by the honourable member for Riverina, when he pointed out that State members contesting a Federal seat receive their parliamentary allowance up to the date of election, whereas as soon as this House is dissolved, Federal members cease to draw their allowance, although their Federal duties continue up to the very day of election. That is not an argument in favour of this Bill ; but it is certainly an argument in favour of a further amendment of the principal Act, so that Federal members shall be paid up to the date on which they go out of politics, either voluntarily or by the will of the people. I feel sure that the good sense of the House will prevail, and that this Bill will be rejected. I am convinced that its sole aim is to prevent members of State Parliaments from standing for election to the Commonwealth - Parliament without running the risk of losing their State seats. This is not, as has been urged, a Bill designed to carry out the spirit of the ConWales stitution or. to protect Commonwealth receiving rights. It springs from a spirit of retaliareally in tion, and its object is only to safeguard members the privileges of members of the Federal who Parliament by restricting those of members of the State Legislatures.",44
146,Mr FOLEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Kalgoorlie) [4.10] - T propose to offer a few observations with regard to this Bill , which gives rise to a question with which we shall be faced whenhas ever the next general election takes place. A man who enters into competition with I am others, whether it be in business or in sport, should be satisfied with a fair hanParliaments dicap. If a man, in his desire to represent the electors, would impose an undue We handicap on his competitors, he is not fit questions - to hold a seat in Parliament. ""Under the State law any person holding an office of profit under the Crown is not eligible for election. For instance, a member of the Public Service must resign in order to One contest a seat. Honourable members talk of 'the honour and glory attaching to membership of a State Parliament; but it seems to me that the recent State legishaving lation, under which a State member may seek election to the Federal Parliament Parliament without resigning his seat, is about the most ""one-eyed "" and 'hungry law of which. I have heard. If a member of. a State Parliament desires to enter the Commonwealth Legislature, or the Parliament of any other State, he should be prepared to give his opponent an equal opportunity. Both sliould start off the one mark. The State member should resign, just as a public servant is required to resign his position before he can be returned to a State Legislature. It is just as well that we should analyze the so-called "" broadness of m in d ' ' which some honourable members have said is displayed in the State legislation bearing on this question. No one can honestly say that it has been' passed because of a desire on the part of the State Parliaments to widen the choice ' of the people. It s sole object is to give State members an advantage over others seeking election to this Parliament, and at the same time to make a close corporation of the State Parliaments. I can well understand the Opposition being almost unanimously in favour of such legislation, because months before a general election they have a pre-election ballot, and know who is to be their candidate in each electorate.",45
147,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,So do the party. Already a Nationalist candidate has been selected to run against me at the next general election. He is a State M in ister.,46
148,Mr FOLEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Then , in fairness to the honourable member, he should not be entitled to oppose him without resigning his seat in the State Parliament. The honourable member might vote tomorrow to bring about the defeat of the Government, and if he were successful, with the result that a dissolution took place a fortnight hence, surely having taken that action in all good f a it h , honestly desiring to do the best for the people, he should not be opposed by a member of a State Parliament who has done nothing to risk his seat, and who, if defeated, would continue to sit in the State House. My opinion is that if a thing is worth having it is worth fighting for, and that a State member who wishes to stand for a Federal division should be compelled, first of all , to resign his membership of the State Parliament. Under the pre-selection system adopted by the Labour party they know in every case who is to be their candidate, and are thus able to direct all their forces against his opponent. That, however, is not the position of every party. We might have a case in which the retiring Federal member was opposed by a State member and a man not^n politics. If the outside man were elected, the State member would continue to sit in the State House, and the retiring Federal member would be the only person disadvantaged. Thus it is clear that the State Parliaments are not willing to give Federal members a chance to fight on equal terms with them. A State member seeking election to the Federal Parliament should have the courage to resign. I am not supporting the Bill because I wish to restrict the choice of candidates for Federal seats, but because I wish to put all candidates on an equal footing. When I was fighting the Kalgoorlie by-election twelve months ago, there would have been a dozen members of the State Parliament willin g to contest the seat, except that they did not have the courage to resign their State seats. If a man has not the courage to resign a seat in the State Parliament to contest an election for the Federal Parliament, he is not fit to occupy a place in this Parliament. All my l if e I have been preaching equality of opportunity, and I propose to vote for it, now by according my support to this Bill . Nationalist",46
149,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Angas) [ 4 . 1 6 ] - I oppose the Bill . I know that, looking at it from a personal - stand-point, I should support it ; but I have good reasons for my attitude. One reason that is uppermost in my mind is that the action taken by the State Legislatures-and in the Bill before us-is , as it were, the - scum that comes to the surface in the political copper, revealing some of the inner selfishness which is so manifest in political circles. W hy should we do wrong because the States do so? The other day the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) was blaming the press for bringing politics into disrepute, aud there was a certain amount of truth in what the honourable member said. But such spectacles as we have confronting us to day certainly do more than anything else to bring politics into disrepute. On the one hand, members of State Parliaments are engaged in an endeavour to make bettor jobs possible for themselves while risking nothing; and on the other hand we, who are holding fair l y good positions in this Parliament, are seeking to do exactly what the honourable member for K a l goorlie (Mr Foley) said just now the State Parliaments were attempting to do, namely, to make their Legislatures a close corporation. Such, spectacles also tend to make the electors become more and more apathetic, because of the all too-evident selfishness displayed by those they send hero to represent them. ""We often hear people say, "" You are only there to get* what you can make out of your position "" ; and if we seek to make our positions safer by preventing the fullest competition we shall always expose ourselves to such an accusation. It is said that if this Bill is not passed, the action taken by State Legislatures Avill make it easier for members of State Parliaments to he elected to the Federal Parliament. But I am rather inclined to support the Bill for that very reason, although my personal opinion is that we do not want in this House new members who. have been in politics for a considerable time, and that it is an advantage to have fresh men coming in who are not adepts at camouflaging their real opinions and steeped in political cunning. - Mr MATHEWS - If I said that I would like to have fresh blood next time instead of the honourable member, what would my"" party think of mc?",46

I would forgive the honourable member for saying it ; but I would remind him that if I have not given evidence of the advantage of having fresh blood in this House I , at least, have shown that I am able to stand up as one man against the rest of my party, both in the House and in the party room. I have had sufficient courage to do so, and I believe that we want men here who are prepared to show that they have the courage of .their convictions.",47

155,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I withdraw it .,47
156,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I wish to set before honourable members my main reason for opposing the Bill . The Labour party can never hope to control the South Australian Parliament while the franchise for the' Upper House remains as it is. The Commonwealth Parliament is the only Legislature in which the Labour party can hope to secure the power it desires.,47
157,Mr LAVELLE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Labour party has secured power in the New South Wales and Queensland Parliaments.,47
158,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"That is so; and I am pleased to see that the Queensland Government has tackled the question of the Upper House. I hope that the New South Wales Government will follow suit. I am looking at the matter, however, from the point of view of a South Australian. The Commonwealth Parliament is the National Parliament. Neither the Queensland nor New South Wales Legislatures can be so regarded. It is an expensive and difficult matter to fight a Federal election, particularly a3 I had to do on the last occasion; pushing m y '' b i k e ' ' through a huge electorate. I oppose the Bill because I can see that it prevents Labour men winning the smaller districts represented in the State Parliament, and ultimately using their gold passes to enable them to fight the larger Federal seats. I can see more Labour men coming into this House by this means. Honourable members opposite have the money to enable them, to fight elections; Labour men have not the money to> enable them, to do so. Here will be their opportunity to fight Federal seats. Across the chamber the Minister  Minister of the Crown in South Australia has been chosen to oppose me at the next election, the suggestion, of course, being that this gentleman will continue to draw his Ministerial salary whilst he, is contesting the seat. I do not claim that this would be fair, especially as during the two months' campaigning I will receive no parliamentary allowance. In any case, it would be but further evidence of the selfishness of the. State Parliaments. But I have already had to fight, two Ministers of the Crown, and I do not mind fighting a third. At any rate, I do not propose to do' anything to l i m it the choice of candidates for the Commonwealth Parliament.",47
159,Mr FOWLER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Perth) [4.251 - I do not wish to approach the proposition submitted by the Government in any personal spirit, and I think I shall be free Electoral [S DECEMBER, 1921.] from the charge of doing so, because f t is a very weak argument to .put forward that a. member of the State House is in a. better position than is a member of the Federal Parliament in fighting a seat for this House. If a member of the State Parliament has the right to come forward and fight an election against a sitting member of. a Federal House, I do not think he is likely to .commend himself to the electors by hanging on to his State seat while undertaking to win a Federal seat also. A State member with any spark of honour or fairness in him would resign his seat if he wished to fight fairly and squarely a Federal election, for one reason as much as another, because he would feel that the electors would resent his coming forward as a candidate for a Federal seat while he was still a member of a State Parliament. I do not think that any member of the Commonwealth Parliament would be in the slightest danger of being beaten by a candidate who, being a member of the State House, could fight the election without first ha.ving to resign his State seat. However, I want to try to find the principle underlying the Bill . The Electoral Act states that certain persons may not sit as members of the Federal Parliament, and are nob even eligible to nominate as candidates. It is proposed that a. member of a State Parliament shall be allowed to nominate for election as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, but no one suggests for a moment that any member of a, State Parliament, while still holding that position, should be allowed to enter the Federal Parliament. It would be preposterous to suggest that a member of a State Parliament could also', while holding that position, come into this Parliament. My principle, therefore, is - simply this: that if a person is not eligible to take a seat in this Parliament, he is not eligible to contest a.n election for this Parliament. It is a, piece of hypocrisy to say that a person disqualified from taking a seat in the Commonwealth Parliament should be allowed to contest an election for this Parliament, or even to nominate as a candidate for such an election. The position is so obvious that there is no getting away from it , and to pretend that our existing Act limits the choice of the public is sheer nonsense. John Smith, member of the State Legislature, is as free any one else to contest a Federal BilL 14127 seat if he resigns a position, which makes it impossible for him to get into the Federal Parliament, even if he is elected, u n t i l he does resign. It is undoubtedly a self-imposed restriction. If a man chooses to hang on to a position which makes him ineligible, why on eartii should this Parliament be asked to open a door to him that Ave do not open in every direction 1 There are certain persons who are not eligible to sit in the Federal Parliament. For instance, a bankrupt or a criminal is not allowed to nominate. If we desire to be consistent we certainly ought to give such persons the right to nominate.",47
160,Mr MAKIN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"S u r e l y , the honourable member does not put bankrupts aud criminals on the same level as State members ?",48
161,Mr FOWLER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I put them in the category of persons who are excluded under the Act. I am arguing on principle; and if the electors of a constituency desire to put a man in Parliament who happens to have been unfortunate enough to be a bankrupt, we ought to consider whether we should not allow such a person the right to nominate.",48
162,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,It does not follow that bankruptcy is the man's own fault .,48
163,Mr FOWLER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Quite so; I concede that there are good and worthy men who become bankrupt through no f a u lt of their own, and whose membership would probably be an advantage to any Parliament. But we exclude : bankrupts, not only from Parliament, but from contesting a seat. If we allow a person any special privilege, simply because he is a member of a State Parliament, we have no right to refuse to any constituency the right to select, if they chose, a bankrupt, for instance. There is only one way of deciding this matter, and that is to say that a person v/ho is not eligible to sit in this Parliament shall not be eligible to contest a seat. But it is proposed to say to a man, "" No, you are not eligible, under certain conditions, to sit in this House, but you are still eligible to nominate and contest a constituency""; and that is an absurd and impossible position. We must do one thiug or the other. The present law is sometimes evaded in practice. as I know of cases in which a State member, holding a secure position, has 14128 Electoral resigned, a dummy taking his seat u n t i l after the Federal contest. If that candidate happens to he defeated, he takes his old State seat; the dummy, who is "" under the Whip,"" has no alternative but to do what he is told, sliding out. It will be seen that there are ways of evading the Electoral Act'as it stands.",48

169,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Barrier) [ 4 . 3 5 ] understand that in some of the States, if not in most, while State members propose to safeguard themselves in contesting Federal seats, they do not extend the same safeguard to their own State public servants in the case of State elections. A State public servant must resign his position if he wishes to become a candidate. Before this Parliament accedes to a proposal to allow State parliamentarians to hang on to their seats while contesting Federal seats, those State members should E.t least put their own house in order, and extend similar facilities to their public servants. As to the value of a State member as against a Federal member, when it is a question of selection by the people for a Federal constituency, I have not yet seen the State member against whom I should be afraid to take m y chance. But it does not much matter what are our views as to the relative i m portance of State and Federal memberstbat is a matter for the people to decide.

Honourable members are aware that a Royal Commission was appointed to in quire into and report upon the taxation systems of the Commonwealth and States, and to recommend such amendments of the law as are necessary to remove anomalies and place taxation on a served, more equitable basis. This Bill is introtoralists ° duced to give effect to such recommendasales tions of the Royal Commission as it has stock. so far made modified in such manner as I shall indicate, and to make such other amendments as "" this opportunity offers and the circumstances warrant. The definition of "" absentee"" has altered so as to exclude a resident Papua. This is one of the alterations quired to exempt the residents, of the Territory from the taxation of derived from sources therein, and it considered that this relief should be granted in order to encourage settlement in Papua, and leave the income fully available for taxation by the governing authority of the Territory. The Royal Commission made no recommendation upon this point. Another matter in regard to which Royal Commission made no recommendaa tion arises out of a case recently brought before the High Court in connection State income taxation. The Court deCook), cided that there is no assessable income arising from the sale of a business as going concern. In order to prevent application of that decision to Federal come taxation, an amendment has been drafted which provides that such income shall be assessable. I come now to a matter of considerable importance upon which many representain tions have been made inside and outside this House, and in regard to which Royal Commission has not yet reported. report it saysI refer to the demands made by members of co-operative societies' that they should be free from taxation in respect of rebates paid to them by the societies on the . separable amounts* of their purchases. Provision has been made as desired, the Bill ing any rebate received by a member a co-operative society, based on purmetliod . chases from that company, when it is one that usually sells goods only to its own members. Clause 2 provides a new definition trading assets, and is inserted in order to make it clear that such assets do not clude live stock used as working animals or for breeding purposes. This definition is in favour of the owners of working mals or stock used for breeding-purposes, because the profits from the sale of will not be taxable. It is to be that, whilst the present practice - of the Department in regard to what are known as walk-in and walk-out sales is prethe amendment will place the pasi n a better position in regard to of working animals and breeding The method of assessing income on the basis of previous years has given rise to more criticism than, perhaps, any other feature of income taxation. It has been been argued in this House, and outside, that of this method is unfair, especially to the reprimary producer. It has been pointed out that a primary producer who, in the incomes year 1917, had a taxable income of is £8,000, in 1918 an income of £3,000, and in 1919 an income of £1,000, and is taxed in each year on the amount he received in the previous year, pays in the year in which he had an income of £1,000 taxation on the previous year's income of £3,000, and in the year in which he had an income of £3,000 is taxed on an in the come of £8,000. It was suggested that fairer basis would be to average his"" i ncome over a period of years. My late with right honourable colleague (Sir Joseph when delivering his Budget speech, announced the intention of the Governa ment to introduce legislation providing for the such a system. That the Bill does. I in - direct the attention of honourable members to the principle that is laid down. The Royal Commission on Taxation dealt with this matter very exhaustively. It considered the system that has been in. vogue Great Britain for a considerable time, and the objections to it that have been the raised. On page 10 of the Commission's Our inquiry has led us. to the conclusion that harsh and inequitable incidence in the case of widely fluctuating incomes, when each year is strictly segregated from its neighbours, is infrom any system of income tax in which steep graduation is a feature, and that exempescape from the inequity of such a tax can of best be secured by a breaking down of the wall of partition between the years, by some of merging or averaging, which substantially mitigates-if it does not wholly remove-the cause, viz. :-the unsound assump' tion that each year's income or loss standing alone must determine taxable capacity, whereof as the circumstances require that the longest period practically possible be brought into aci n - count. When as many years and as many vicissitudes as is practically possible are brought into line through merging or averaging the annual incomes, the true taxability of the anisubject-that is, his taxable capacity-ca n be fairly determined. them. It must be noted that the British system, noted which adopts the average income over a period of three years, has given rise to considerable criticism, not because of the adoption of the averaging system, but because the basis of liability is assumed to be identical with the measure of taxable capacity, which it is not. Therefore, in order that the inequity of the present system shall be removed, whilst at the same time having regard to those practical requirements which are inseparable from any taxation system, the Commission has recommended - for adoption the following principles:- A quinquennial period is taken, and it determines the rate of tax; but the amount of tax is determined by the actual income received in the year previous to the assessment. I may explain what I mean by taking for convenience, because the calculation is easier, a triennial instead of a quinquennial period. In the year 1917 a man had, say, an income of £S,000; in the year 1918, au income of £3,000; and in the year 1919, an income of £1,000, or an average in come for the period of £4,000 per annum. If he were taxed on his average income, he would be taxed on £4,000, although in the last year of the period his income was only £1,000. Therefore, the Commissioners recommend that, in . order to treat the taxpayer equitably, and to have due regard for the circumstances of the State, the rate of tax shall be determined in accordance with the average income over a period of five years. Reverting to my illustration of an income during a triennial period, the taxpayer would be charged for the year 1919 on an income of £1,000, at the rate per £ 1 fixed for an income of £4,000. Let us suppose, for the sake of example, that the rate of tax on an income of £4,000 is 5s. in the . £ 1, and that the rate of tax on an income of £1,000 is 2s. in the £ 1 : m the case which I have given as aiv'illustration, the taxpayer, whose income in the year 1919 was '£1,000. would pay tax on that amount, not at the rate of 2s. in the £ 1 , but at the rate of 5s. in the £ 1 . He would pay 5s. in the £ 1 , but would pay only on his actual income for that year, viz., £1,000. The average income for a quinquennial period determines the rate of tax, but the number of pounds on which that rate is paid is the amount of the actual income received during the year for which the taxpayer is assessed. I come now to another matter of first importance, that of double taxation. Mr Hughes. Until recently, persons in Great B r it a in whose income is drawn both from sources in the United Kingdom and from sources in Australia, paid taxation on the whole amount; but as the result of a conference in London, at which Mr Knibbs was o u r ° representative and put the case with admirable lucidity and force/' the British law has been amended, and a rebate equal to half of the tax is now granted. A man in Great B r it a in who has an income from Australia receives a rebate on an amount equal to the sum of the Australian taxes, Federal and State, where that is not more that half of the British income rates, but where it is greater than half, the Government of the United Kingdom rebates half of its tax. On the otlier hand, a man domiciled in Australia who receives in come from Great B r it a in and also from sources in Australia, gets a rebate from the British Government, but receives none from us. We wish, however, to make an arrangement which will materially lighten the taxation of those thus circumstanced. The provisions by which it is done are set out in clause 5, and are as follow:(1) Any person who has an amount of income which is liable to income tax for any year of assessment(a) under this Act and in the United Kingdom; or (b) under this Act and in the United Kingdom and in a State of the Commonwealth of Australia, and who satisfies the Commissioner as to(c) the amount of the income which is so liable; and (d) the amounts of taxes to whioh the in- come is so liahle, together with the rate or rates of those taxes, shall be entitled to a rebate of tax upon that amount of income at a rate which shall be ascertained as follows :(i) In the case where the amount of income is liable to tax under this Act and in the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth rate is greater than one-half of the British rate(a) Where the Commonwealth rate is greater than the British rate, the rate of rebate shall be one-half of the British, rate; (!>) Where the Commonwealth rate is not greater than the British rate, the rate of rebate shall be the excess of the Commonwealth rate over one-half of the British rate : Provided that no rebate shall be claimable under tins paragraph with respect to any amount of income to which the next following paragraph is applicable; (ii) In the case where the amount of is liable to tax under this Act State and in the United Kingdom, and the sum of the Commonwealth and State rates is greater than one-half of the British rate, the proportion which the Commonwealth rate bears to the sum of the Commonwealth State rates shall be ascertained, the rate of rebate shall be that portion of the following rates:i (a) Where the sum of the (6) where the sum of the The long and short of that. arrangement is that where the British tax is greater than the Commonwealth and State rates in honour bound' to reciprocate. combined, the taxpayer will pay in aggregate only the British raite, but where the combined rates exceed the hitherto British rate he will pay only at the comonly bined rates. The higher rate always be' charged, and the lower tax will be wholly rebated. There will no adjustment between The Commonwealth will not have make an adjustment with the States ,with the United Kingdom, nor the would United Kingdom with the Australian, authorities. The whole matter will be arranged by the Taxing Commissioners. The assessment in the case of the United Kingdom will take note, of the liability to taxation under Commonwealth laws, and, in the case of the Commonwealth, liability to taxation under the British law, and the rate of tax will be fixed accordingly. What the effect of the ar-. rangement will be may be shown by an taxes. actual case. A taxpayer residing in the United Kingdom, who has a taxable in come in the United Kingdom of £44,436, siderable importance. and draws from the Commonwearth a B taxable income of the same amount, p« v Britisli taxation at the rate of l is . £ 1 , which would come to £24,440, and Commonwealth taxation at the rate of 7s. 7d. in the £ 1 , which comes £16,849- a total of £41,289. But he given a rebate of £12,220, on one-half the British tax.",49
171,Mr BRUCE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Are you sure that , he gets that rebate? I understand that . the United Kingdom the rebate in th case of double taxation is only in conwhere income nexion with the ordinary income tax. and in a not the super-tax, and that the ordinary income tax does not exceed 6s. in Jthe £ 1 . ?",52
172,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I am informed that the rebate is allowed in the United Kingand dom in connection with the super-tax. At and the present time the taxpayer whose case proI am citing gets a rebate of £12,220, and, Comtherefore, pays taxation in the United monwealth and State rates Kingdom amounting to £12,220, and is greater than the British £16,849 in the Commonwealth, wherehe rate-one-hal f of the ' British gets - no rebate, the total tax paid by him rate; being £29,069. Under this Bill , however, Comhe will receive from, the Commonwealth a monwealth and State rates is not greater than the British rebate of £4,629, so that, instead of payrate-the excess of the sum ing £29,069, he will pay £24,440. That of the Commonwealth and would be the effect of the application of State rates over one-half of this rebate to a concrete case where the the British rate. taxpayer at present gets the rebate in tht United Kingdom under the arrangement which was made, and under which we art Tht the arrangement was on a reciprocal basis but owing to the fact that we have not provided for it , the taxpayer has had the benefit of a rebate in England, will but not here. This will p u i him in a better position, and require him to pay be £4,629 less by way of taxation than he Governments. now does. The Royal Commission recomto mended that the Commonwealth Goor vernment should grant such relief as avoid double taxation, but did not indicate how that relief should bt granted. It may be said, however, that the proposals which I have just .outlined are generally in accordance with its recommendations. This Bill , of course, provides only for relief to be given b j of the Federal Department of Taxation. A full adjustment of the matter i H not be effected until the State Legislatures also w arrange to rebate a portion of their cwn I come now to another matter of conClause 6 of thci l l which amends section 14 of the principal Act provides for the exemption of in the a shareholder in a company from incomt tax in relation to any profit which is not the result of the ordinary trading of the to company-for example, profit on the sak is of a fixed capital asset, or the amount of by which the value of a fixed capital asset may be written up. Another important provision in th« in clause is that which exempts profit aris= ing from the sale of a mining property, it is sold by a bond fide prospector or by a person who does not make a business of buying and selling properties. Where such a person purchases a property froai a bond fide prospector, and works the property in a proper and efficient manner, that property will be exempt from the tax. The Government hope that this will prove beneficial to the country, and that it will be an encouragement not only to prospectors, but to 1 mining ventures in the early stages of their development. It may be mentioned that this amendment follows the lines of one recently introduced* by the Government in the Legislature of Western Australia in relation to its own income tax. That Bill has not yet become law. The last portion of clause 6 deals with a matter of considerable importance, and protects the revenue in cases -.where it needs protection. It provides that where any trading asset passes, by gift, the income of the donor shall include the market value of the asset. That is to say, where in any statement of accountsa trading asset appears, and' is transferred by gift, then the income of the donor shall be liable for the market value of the asset. The amendment will check what appears to be a growing practice. Under the law asi t stands at present, a. Ibioainess owner who makes a gift of itrading assets would not; of course, show --the value of the assets in his trading count as stock on hand at the end of the - trading period, nor would he show it .amongst his sales. He would, nevertheless, show it among his purchases. Such action would operate to reduce the profit on the sales of the year, and so result in .avoidance of tax. There is no hardship iin the .course proposed, because it is in:temded merely that where money is in-cluded in the accounts for the purchase of goods, their value should be shown proper contra entry when the goods mil. by gift. Clause 1 of the Bill arranges merely the transposition of certain words ordeT to make the meaning ef the. prinHonorable cipal Act clearer than it is at present. Under a recent judgment of the High „ Court, it appears that a taxpayer could - deduct from his income all losses and goings incurred outside Australia. That was not intended when the Act was passed, - and has not been the practice of the tion Department. The amendment makes Mr Hughes. it clear that the losses and outgoings must have been actually incurred in Australia. Sub-paragraph c repeals a provision of the law which exempted gifts made, during the continuance of the war, to patriotic funds. The law in this. direction has ceased to operate, and the portion of the Act referring to it might now well be deleted. The last part of the clause provides for an increase of the deduction for children from £26 to £30. Clause 8 effects, as recommended by the Royal Commission, an increase from £100 to £104 of the general exemption applicable to persons having no dependants. I come now to another important clause. I refer to clause 9, which is to inrpose income tax upon profits derived hy exAustralian principals from the sale of their goods in Australia. Honourable members perhaps have had their attention drawn to a practice which is becoming common, and is notorious in the case of one particular company where an Australian branch house is believed to be debited by the foreign house for goods at 1 a price which leaves little margin for profit on the sale of such goods in Australia. These allegations have been made from time to time in this House. It has been said that one company in particular has resorted to some such method in order ac- to escapethe Australian tax. The pro-posed new section will give the Commissioner power to assess and charge taxupon what appear to be the real profits. Honourable members canfollow that provision quite clearly. Further comment by me is unnecessary.. Dr EARLE. PAGE - Is the provision to be retrospective? Mr HUGHE'S - The Court always hy assumes that a section is not retrospective pass unless it is clearly stated to be so. The matter of Appeal Boards,- which for will interest honourable members, is the in next subject with which I have to deal. members are aware that one of the questions that engaged the attention of the Royal Commission on Taxation was that of creating Tribunals, other outthan a Court, to deal with numerous cases under the Income Tax Act in which taxpayers dissent from the decisions of the TaxaCommissioner, but for various reasons are unable or unwilling to assert in a superior Court what they believe to be their rights. The Commission said it was satisfied1. That with the present heavy burden direct taxation it is imperative that some action be taken to allay existing discontent by giving taxpayers access to an independent bunal (with a simple and inexpensive proand cedure) for the determination of disputes ths Department. 2. That the expense of maintaining a Tribunal to meet the clamant requirements of taxpayers is abundantly justifiable. 3. That there is no justification for mediate creation of a number of Boards, of which might become redundant. We are, therefore, making provision for the appointment of Boards, and, as sugwe gested by the Commission, we shall start by appointing only one. As many more can be created as the circumstances deI mand. It is estimated that each Board will cost £10,000 per annum. It may be gatherer. necessary, ultimately, to have as many as ten Boards, so that in that event the expenditure in respect of them would amount to £100,000 per annum. Let me now point out the relief that is provided for under this Bill, and in the Act itself. Where questions of law arise, the taxpayer has the option of appealing to Court or to the Supreme Court of a State. Where a question of fact is volved, he can appeal to one of these Appeal Boards. When it is a question of law and of fact, he can appeal to the Board in regard to the fact and to the Court as to the law. But he has the option of appealing to the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State on questions of law, and he can go to the Court questions of law and of fact; but he go to the Tribunal only on questions of fact. There is one class of cases neither the Tribunal nor the Court can deal ""-with. I refer to cases of hardship, which are specially provided for> and mission are included in this Bill. which will be heard, as now, before Tribunal composed of the Taxation Comcluded its work. missioner, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Comptroller-General of Customs. I do not know that there are any other elauses to which I need specially direct the attention of honourable members. When we go into Committee, we can does not go far enough. discuss such points as are of importance, and I shall then supply honourable memsocieties bers with any further information they require. This measure has been introto duced to give effect to the promises made by the ex-Treasurer. (Sir Joseph Cook), and follows the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation. Where of it deals with matters not yet reported on by the Commission, it follows the generally Triexpressed desire of honourable members taxpayers. It is hoped that the Bill with will improve our taxation machinery, although it must necessarily continue to fall short of what we desire, since much of the trouble arises from the clashing the imand overlapping of State and FederaL some Tribunals or taxation schemes. But that is a matter for which the Commonwealth can hardly he held responsible, because have always been ready to come to any arrangement that will enable the taxpayer to have one taxation form. Personally, think it would be a good thing for this country if there was only one tax",52
173,Mr GREGORY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Will a special effort be made during the next twelve months to try to get the States together in an endeavour to obtain the desired uniformity ?,54
174,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Yes . Some States are showing much more readiness than. the High others to fall into line.,54
175,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Hunter) [5.32] - I inunderstand that the amendments contained in this Bill are in accordance with the promise made to Parliament by the ex-Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), namely, that these amendments would deal with certain phases of the taxation question only, and that at a later period, when the. on Government received the final report can from the Taxation Commission, and had time to examine it, other amendments, if which necessary, would be made.",54
176,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Practicall y all the amendments recommended by the ComOf a course, the Commission has not yet con",54
177,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The amendments outlined by the Prime Minister will effect improvements in several directions, par- ticularly the amendment which deals with co-operative societies, which, however,, The trouble; * which exists today in regard to these, is that we ask their members who, already pay income tax on their earnings also pay income tax on the periodical rebates made to them by their societies. The Rochdale co-operative system, .which was inaugurated in England, and subseco-operative quently establislied in New .South Wales, provides methods by which bodies workmen may band together and business for themselves. It is true operation. The members who hold shares in a society buy the commodities they require from the society, hut, instead of the lowest possible price being charged for those commodities, the members are called upon to pay for them a price which is equivalent to the current rates elsewhere. It'is necessary to do this order to enable the business to have ficient money in hand to meet any gency. In a large business one never knows what may happen. However, at the end of every three or six months, as ing of the Act. the case may be, whatever surplus is left over after running the business is disbeen tributed among the shareholders form of rebates, and an amendment in this Bill provides that in future these rebates shall not be taxed. My regret is that the Government have not seen fit to make the provision retrospective. In fact, several of these amendments could easily have been made retrospective. I am sure that Parliament never intended that body of men who band together should retrospective. be obliged to pay tax on what they may receive tlirough the distribution, of surplus made in their co-operative ment, particularly when they have already paid individually income tax on their earnings. If I. go - to Anthony Horis dern's, in Sydney, and get a rebate on a it big purchase, the allowance made to in that way is not subject to income taxahard on them. tion, but if I happen to be a member of a co-operative society and get a rebate the way I have' described at the end six months, I am taxed upon has recently been made by the Commissioner of Taxation to collect income tax cn all rebates distributed from as far back as 1916. As a matter of fact, the ter has. been held in suspense, and the has not been actually collected, because recently a deputation waited on the Treasurer to place the position before him, and he came to the conclusion that it was wrong to tax these rebates, and therefore asked the Commissioner to reequity frain from collecting taxation upon them. The Deputy Commissioner in New South see Wales"" had been pushing the members Mr Charlton. societies to pay tax on rebates received for the previous five years, of and this amending Bill, while it will run exempt these rebates from taxation in cofuture, still leaves it open to the Taxation Department to collect tax on these past rebates, although we declare by this Bill that it is wrong in principle to do so. The shareholders of these co-operative societies, being ignorant of the fact that they were liable to pay tax on these charged rebates, had not included them in the in returns of their income, but ""quite resufcently the Deputy Commissioner in New emerSouth Wales informed them that they would be obliged to furnish returns of all rebates received by them since the pass",54
178,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If the tax has not yet paid, we can easily make the proin the vision retrospective.",55
179,Mr CHAELTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"That is why I say it should be made retrospective. The ex-Treasurer said that he would ask the Commissioner not to collect this tax until Parliament had dealt with an amendment to the Act, showing clearly that, in his a opinion, the provision should be made. If it is not made retrospective the tax gatherer will he pesterany ing men to pay taxation at a time when movethey are least able to pay it. The coal trade, in which many of the members of these societies are employed, providing less employment today than was when these rebates were distributed, and any endeavour to collect the me tax from these people now will be very",55
180,Mr MABKS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Seeing that the Governin ment have not collected anything, they of will lose nothing by making the amendit. An effort ment retrospective.",55
181,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"To illustrate the. absurdity of the position, these members of the co-operative societies whose shares matare in the names of their wives will tax escape taxation, whilethose men whose wives happen to have put the shares in exhusbands' names will find that the rebates they have received will be regarded as incoane upon which they will be rehe quired to pay income tax. There is no in this, and I ask the Government to give careful consideration to the aspect of the question I have put forward, and if they cannot make this amendment of retrospective in its application. Many co-operative' societies have increased their reserves for the purpose of adding to their businesses or in order to provide additional accommodation. The money so utilized ought not to be taxed. It belongs to the members who have already paid tax on their earnings. These societies are not earning income out of this expenditure.",55
182,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,But would not the same arguments apply to any company ?,56
183,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"No . A company, being a speculative concern, is on quite a different footing from a Rochdale cooperative society. It is provided in the amendment to which I have just referred that the societies who are to benefit by the exemption must confine their operations to their own members. There are very few of these societies which sell to non-members, and in order to get the benefit of the provision they will be obliged to got rid of their non-member customers but I cannot see why they ) sliould be compelled to pay tax on the money they use in extending their businesses. The shareholders have already paid individually income tax on whatever they have paid into the societies. It is always, claimed that it is the duty of a Legislature to encourage co-operative principle, and in all walks of life a great improvement would be effected if cooperation were to come into general use ; but here we hamper the movement. If a society, instead of giving back £1,000 to its shareholders out of the surplus it has earned after paying working expenses, devotes the money to the erection of additional accommodation, the Taxation Commissioner claims income tax upon it , whereas if the £1,000 were distributed in the shape of rebates to the members it would not be taxed under the amendment included in this Bill. When we come to the question of the averaging system, it appears to me from what the Prime Minister has said that we take the average of three years in order to fix the rate of tax. A man with an income of £5,000 in one year, £3,000 in the second year, and £1,000 in the third will be taxed on the average yearly income of £3,000. In the last' year, of course, considering his low income, the tax will be comparatively heavier, but a good year may follow, for v/hich he will pay less in proportion. Whether this method will prove of any great benefit is questionable.",56
184,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,It depends on whether it is operated honestly.,56
185,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If it is operated honestly, I do not know that it will make much difference; over a number of years, I think, the '.average taxation wiill be found to be much the same as today. As to double taxation, I do not consider it to be fair. If this proposed amendment is applied equitably, as between taxpayers in the United Kingdom and taxpayers here, there will .not be much fault to find. I now.wish to refer to a matter with which the Prime. Minister did not deal. It is proposed by this Bill to raise the exemption in the case of single persons from £100 to £104, representing exactly £2 a week. At present, for every £5 over £100, the exemption, in the case of single persons, is reduced by £ 1 , and under the Bill for every £ 3 over £104 the exemption is reduced by £ 1 . It will be seen that by the time £130 is reached the taxpayer is in exactly the same position that he is today, whereas, with an income over £130, a single person becomes very much worse off from a taxation point of view, because, instead of getting any relief, his taxation is increased.",56
186,Mr GABB,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,It is a sort of a bachelor tax.,56
187,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes; and I have always complained of the taxation imposed on single persons. The exemption, is far too low, and the proposed amendment does not at all meet the case, but rather makes the position worse. A single person may earn from £150 io £200, and all income over £130 will be more heavily taxed than now. I was under the^impression that it was proposed to give relief to single persons, but that is not so. Personally, I believe that the exemption should, be largely extended; at any rate, in view of the high cost of living we ought to considerably increase it. When the Income Tax Assessment Act was passed in 1914-1915, the purchasing value of the sovereign was much higher than today, and we then made the exemption £156 in the case of single ' persons. The Act was amended 1 during the war, when we were endeavouring to get as much revenue as possible, and the exemption was made £100. In my opinion, it would be only a fair thing to make the exemption at least £200.",56
188,Mr MAXWELL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Would it not be better to reduce the rate than exemption ?,57
189,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not it is better to fix the exemption at such a figure as to leave sufficient to persons to live in a respectable way, put by a little in view ,of marriage. Single men cannot now get board and lodging under 30s. a week, and, allowing for washing, purchase of clothing, other expenses, an exemption of £200 not too high. When we ""reach the mittee stage I shall give honourable mempluses, bers an opportunity of expressing opinion on this and other points. In the case of married men, who have the care and burden of a family, the exemption is £156; but can it be claimed that this is not now far too which to start taxation? I often wonder how a married man with a wife and four or five children manages to get along, especially in those cases where the is entirely dependent on the husband's earnings.",57
190,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"There is an exemption for children. (Mr Charlton-Yes ; there is an exemption of £26 for each child under sixteen, years of age; but in New South Wales the exemption is £250, with an allowance of £50 for each child. Taking into consideration the purchasing power of money today, I suggest that an exempgard tion of £300, with an allowance of £60 for each child, would be a fair thing; and., in Committee I intend to move cordingly.",57
191,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Bill proposes to make the allowance of £30 for each child.,57
192,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"That is infinitesiprimary mal-a n extra £4 for each child. _ All theso matters ought to receive consideravides tion at the hands of honourable members; and it is no use our waiting for any ther reports. The ex-Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) stated that we would the final report of the Taxation Commission before we finally dealt with this B i but the Prime Minister has now told that almost every recommendation of the Commission has been adopted in this measure. That conveys to me that, ever legislation we pass now will probably stand for two years or more; and as the people outside are clamouring for a siderable increase in the exemption, are not justified in accepting the Bill into increase the its present form.",57
193,Mr MARR,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The allowance for a child think so; should be at least £39.,57
194,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I propose to fix it enable much higher.

198,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,You mean that this Bill l l ; will result in the reduction of income tax us in the case of the primary producers?,57
199,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I say that the Bill will be the means of doing somewhatthing like justice to a body of men - who have to face uncertainties, and fight the elements in a way unknown to ordiconnary business men. If we care to read we through the report presented by the Royal Commission, we may see numerous instances of the inequalities that have obtained in the past. On page 5 of the report there is a table giving striking figures in connection with the grazing, in dustry. In one case, a man who, in seven years, made a net profit of £56,000, paid in Eederal tax £60,000, or £4,000 more than the income. This was quite apart fro m State income tax. In the case of a city man, however, whose income over that period had been a steady £8,064 per annum, the Federal income tax amounted to only £13,299. ' Similar inequalities are shown throughout the report. I am prepared to abide by the decision which the majority report recommends, namely, that the system of averaging the rate of ineome tax, as explained ,by the Prime Minister and outlined in the Bill , shall be adopted. I realise that it cannot affect steady, regular incomes, such as salaries, nor w i ll it be nearly so equitable or just as the averaging method, with an allowance for suspense credits. M i ' . BOWDEN - It comes to about the same thing.",57
200,Dr EAELEPAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It comes to much more; hut the inequalities will be nothing compared with those in the past. The Commission explained that if this method were adopted it would inevitably lead to a great increase in. the expenses of the Taxation Department. As we are in fair l y desperate straits financially, the primary producers, although not exactly satisfied, will be very much more pleased with what is proposed by the Government than they are with* the present system of taxation. The Taxation Commission recommended that two canons-certainl y as to what the taxpayers wil l be called upon to p.ay, and economy in administrationwill be better fulfilled by this method than by any other that has been suggested. In those circumstances, we are prepared to support this measure in the main. I think the definition of "" primary producer "" should be more explicit, so that there may be no possibility of an actual primary producer being excluded from the benefits to be conferred by the proposed amendment. In regard to double tax&r tion, T welcome the relief that this Bill will bring ; I think it will have a very beneficial effect in promoting an influx of - capital to assist in Australian development. W it h regard to the amendment dealing with companies trading outside the Commonwealth, who, by reasou of various devices, have been able in the past to escape the payment of income taxation - as , for instance, the various oil companies to which reference has been previously made- I am glad that at last the Government are taking steps to stop this leakage. All I regret is that this proposed amendment is not to be made retrospective, as, apparently, some other provisions in the Bill are to be, so that some of the money that has been lost'might be recovered. I agree with the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) that the exemption per child is not sufficiently high. I would like it to be raised to approximately the allowance made in the New South Wales Income Tax Assessment Act. If the Department has any statistics regarding the amount of taxation that would be lost by the adoption of, say, £ 5 0 per child, such information would enable honourable members to better judge whether the finances of the country will permit of such relief being given to income-tax payers.",58
201,Mr FOLEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Kalgoorlie) [ 6 . 5 ] - I in tend to confine my remarks mainly to the mining industry as affected by this Bill . In passing, I express my pleasure that the Government are proposing to liberalize the law in regard to co-operative societies, and the exemption for children. I think the general exemption of £156 is too low at the present time; but if the Government cannot see their way clear this session to raise it to £200, I trust that in the near future they will introduce a proposal to that effect. An exemption of £50 per child would be only a fair consideration to extend to married people. I am pleased that at last something is to be done to give more encouragement to the mining industry. The taxation of the proceeds of the sale of mining leases is no doubt legal, but it is none the less unjust. There is no resemblance between the sale of a mining lease, and the sale of an agricultural or city lease. In the two last-named cases the lessor receives his property at the expiration of - the lease in substantially the same form as it was in when he leased it ; often it is 'improved. But with a mining lease the case is the reverse. A mining lease is, in fact, only a licence to deplete the resources of a property by removing its mineral contents. The vendor of a mining lease parts with it outright in exactly the same manner as does the owner of a city property or a farmer who parts with his land. But the incidence of taxation affects those three classes of persons quite differently. The Government have taken note of the existing discrimination, and the proposal which they are submitting to the House will give a great deal of relief. I desire to remind the House of how the incidence of taxation has retarded mining operations during the last two years. After our soldiers returned from Europe there was a period of deep depression. But in Western Australia, there soon occurred one of those bursts of sunshine that are incidental to the mining industry, and people invested money in mining property very freely. Unfortunately, a period of boom followed, which did more harm - to mining generally than anything else could have done *at that time. When the boom burst, and normal conditions were restored, people started prospecting for what they could honestly win from the earth, and not for the purpose of selling ' to the public leases, many of which consisted of only four pegs in a valueless block of ground. Many of these men had been prospecting for many years, and when their efforts resulted in the discovery of lodes or reefs, as they could not work them without capital, they thought it better to take the opportunity to sell. I mentioned recently the case of a man at Lake Austin, who, for twenty-five years had prospected in Western Australia, and at last discovered gold to the value of £7,500. The taxation authorities took from him. £4,200, so that more than half of the results of twenty-five years' industry was lost. Another case is that of. Mr Thompson, M.L.A., of Western Australia. Being an enterprising man, he thought that the iron deposits at Yampi Sound should be developed. He pegged out a lease and did developmental work. Later, he arranged to sell the deposits to the Queensland Government for £30,000, of which he was to receive £3.000 in cash, and the balance in shares. The whole of the amount of £30,000 was treated by the taxation authorities as earnings, and he was taxed to the extent of nearly £19,000. He had not handled more than £3,000, and was not in a position to pay the £19,000 that the Commonwealth and State Governments demanded of him. Mr Foley. glad that the Government have at last brought forward a proposal that will give relief in cases of this kind. The money which Mr Thompson received represented, not earnings, but conversion of capital. If a, man sell a house for £1,000, the Department regards that as a conversion of capital; but the whole proceeds of the Yampi Sound transaction were treated as taxable earnings. Another case is that of a man who for fourteen years had been prospecting, ahd at last struck a little gold at Hampton Plains. He sold his ""show"" for £6,000 in cash and shares; but, as the vendor, be had no right to trade in the shares for a period of twelve months. He discovered that the tax-gatherers intended to take from him £2.360 because he had found that mine. We want all the gold that can be won from the soil of Australia. That is why men of this type should not be discouraged; and the Government are to be commended for introducing this relief legislation. Tho man to whom I have' been referring wa3 fearful that something might happen. Therefore, he did not bank his money, but carried it about with him. He was later notified of the amount of his taxation assessment, so he packed up, let his shares go for the time being, and went to New Zealand. He still has his money, and he has evaded the payment of taxation which the Commonwealth Government rightly considered to be due. But he had taken a certain portion of his payment in shares. These were assessed at their full valuation. They were*regarded as part of his earnings; and, although they were worth, perhaps, ouly Is., the asses-mem was made at the rate of about £1 per share. Before leaving for New Zealand he mentioned that if he had collected the same amount through Tattersall's sweeps, 14 per cent, would have been deducted by way of taxation. He contended that prospecting gave him about the same chance of drawing a prize from the soil as he would have had by regularly contributing to Tattersall's. I say that these prospectors are to be in every way encouraged. Another case recently came under my notice in Western Australia. A man had been prospecting for twenty years, and the I am only bit of good luck he had had was when he struck a patch which returned him . 400 ounces of gold. That was seven years ago. H© sold the mine, in conjunction with three backers, for £4,500. But the mine was in his name, although he possessed only a one-fourth share. He was assessed by the State taxing authorities to the extent of £1,000, so that, eventually, his share was worth to him axactly £7S. The State Department had taken so much from him that there was nothing left for the Commonwealth Department, which also wanted to claim about £1,000. These instances reveal the need for affording relief. As for mining companies, I desire the Government to consider the possibility of affording still further relief. They should regard a mining lease as a diminishing asset. It should be classed as a chattel, just as are the implements on an agricultural holding.  [6.23] - The Government's proposal to 'accord relief to primary producers certainly goes a long way, hut I do not think that it entirely meets the views of honourable members, who expressed their views in this Chamber when a motion proposed by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) was debated, and agreed to, earlier in the year. The terms of that motion wereThat this House is of opinion that the fairest method of calculation for purposes of the Federal income tax, as applied to primary producers, would be upon a basis of five years' operations. I interpreted the resolution to mean that, if a person engaged in primary production is operating over a number of years, the losses sustained throughout the operations . will he taken into account. I have previously mentioned the case of a man who, in his first year, made a profit of £1,000; in his second year, a loss of £2,000; in his third, a profit of £3,000; in. the fourth, a profit of £500; and in his fifth year, a profit of £1,000. I made calculations on the basis of the theory which I had in mind. Those showed that, calculated on the ""income from property basis,"" he would be taxed, on the sum of his first year's profits, to the extent of £74 17s. 8d. In the second year, seeing that he had made a loss, he would not be required to pay anything. In the third year, there would be calculated the profits of his first and third year, making £4,000 in all; from which would be deducted the loss in his second year, namely, £2,000. That would leave a total of £2,000, which, divided by the three years of his operations, would represent a profit for that third year amounting to 'about £666. On that .he would be required to pay £34 in taxes. Calculating the other years on the same basis, he would pay a total for the whole period of £177. Against that, he will be required to pay, in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, £307. I do not know the views of members of the Country party, but I understand that they have agreed to accept the recommendations of the representatives of the primary producers upon the Royal Commission.",58
202,Mr GREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Any averaging system is bound to produce certain peculiar results.  that; but-1 desired to secure the greatest possible measure of relief for those who follow an occupation the conditions of which are so fluctuating that their position differs entirely from that of ordinary individuals.,60
203,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Althoug h the honourable member has indicated cases of hardship, there would be instances wliere persons would reap a greater advantage than under the present system.  made calculations on the basis of three different propositions. Under the scheme which I had in mind a .man in receipt of the income, from year to year, which I have just stated, and making the losses to which I have referred, would be required to pay a total of only £177, as against £307 required of him under the method of assessment set out in the Bill. If no account were taken of losses, and the annual income we.re averaged, this same individual would he required to pay £384. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) said he did not think the Bill would really effect much' of a change. In that regard he is wrong. Taxpayers will he afforded a greater measure of relief than is provided today.",60
204,Unknown,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8- p.m.  Bill does not give the full measure of the relief to which those who are engaged in primary production are entitled, but it makes some attempt to give effect to a resolution which was carried in this House some time ago. I have shown how the incomes of those on the land are subject to fluctuation. Thek handicaps are much greater than those of any other section of the community. It might be asked why should an exception be made in favour of the primary producer; why should not a concession granted to him be given also to the manufacturer, but a mere glance at the conditions under which the man on the land works will show that no comparison can be made between their respective positions. manufacturer can always guard against a decline in the demand for his commodities, but a primary producer may be afflicted with a drought in one year, hush fires in the next, and a plague of caterpillars, or some other form of pestilence, a little later. He is affected by conditions which he cannot alter' or guard himself against, and consideration should be given to this circumstance. I have referred to the case of a constituent of mine whose total income over a period of five years amounted to £3,500. income tax amounted to £722, although his average income was only £700 a year, but a man in receipt of a steady income of that amount, as many a professional man is, pays only £140 in five years. Under the Bill the primary producer of whom I speak will pay £307 a year, which, of course, means that he will get some relief, hut he will still pay more than twice as much as the man who gets as much as he does in five years, but draws it in equal annual amounts. I would like the Government, in dealing with «ases of this kind, to make proper allowance for losses. In the case to which I am referring, the first year's income was £1,000, but in the next year a loss of £2,000 was incurred. ' In the third year there was a profit of £3,000 made. What should be done in a case like that, I think, is to add the profits of the first and third year and subtract the loss of the second year. The average income for the three years was £666, and it is on that amount that income tax should be levied. Had the man whose case I am citing been dealt with in that way he would have had to pay only £177 in five years. It may be conIjended that my proposal mean a serious diminution of revenue.  Indeed, I am inclined to think that the Taxation Department does not wish the primary producers to have even that measure of relief which is granted to them by the Bill. But it must be remembered that those who are in the back blocks are without the comforts and conveniences that city folk enjoy, and never know from year to year what their income will be. Therefore, I think that to agree to what I propose would not be to do too much for them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition A (Mr Charlton) intends to move an amendment to increase the exemption, and I think it should be increased. He wishes to raise it to £300. Considering how conditions have altered since the present exemption was fixed, I do not think that an unfair proposal.",60
205,Mr FENTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Eve n when originally fixed, the exemption was unfair.  so; and now that the cost of living is so high, a man should have at least £300 His free of income taxation. I hope that members generally will support the honourable member's proposal, and that another proposal which he intends to bring forward-a n amendment for increasing the allowance for each child to £60-wil l also receive sufficient support to carry it . The amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments is a reform long overdue. The system under which taxation is now collected is a wasteful one, and the Government should arrange with the State authorities to put an end to it, It is an old saying that what is every one's business is no one's business; but the Federal Government should move in this matter, and I * believe that if they set about things in the right way an amalgamation would be agreed to by the State authorities which would save much of the expense of collecting the taxes. Economy is much talked of, but seems honoured more in the breach than in the observance. I know, of course, that an amendment could not be moved on this Bill which would effect the amalgamation that I suggest, because nothing can be done without an arrangement with the State authorities; but I hope that this amalgamation will soon take place. would Mr Watt (Balaclava) [8.12] - I am very sorry that the Government has introduced this important Bill so late in the session. A number of honourable members would welcome the opportunity to study the technical phases of a measure of this k in d ; but when one glimpses these clauses and compares the principal Act with the amendments that are proposed, it is plainly hard to understand not merely the verbiage of the measure, but its object and the motives of those who are responsible for it . As one who has had something to do with the later Commonwealth tax at i o n Acts and the earlier State Income Tax Acts, I confess my inability to grasp the full meaning of these proposals at such short notice; and I think that unless the measure is urgent-cer tainly not all of it is urgent-it would be safer to lay it aside so that we may study it at our leisure and in conjunction with the propos'as for amendment made during the debate.",61
206,Mr RICHAHD FOSTEB,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The adoption of the averaging system is urgent.,62
207,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It is certainly an important matter, not an urgent one, and whatever settlement be arrived at it could not take effect upon the assessment for the present year.",62
208,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Not if the were passed at once?,62
209,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not think so. I do not think that the assessments for this year, based on the income of last year, would be altered, and that being so, the Bill is not urgent, even so far as the matter referred to by the honourable member is concerned. I_do not know whether the mover of the second reading stated that the Bill is an urgent one.",62
210,Mr GREGORY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,That was the impression his speech conveyed.,62
211,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"An impression is one thing, but the facts may .quite otherwise. I do not think it can be said with confidence that the Bill will affect this year's assessments, but it contains important provisions, and honourable members should have an opportunity to study them. I have endeavoured in the brief time that has elapsed since the Bill was laid on the table to arrive at an understanding of some of its provisions, and these I wish to discuss. I do not at all believe in the averaging of the income of primary producers, although T know that that is an unfashionable statement to make at the present time. The idea appears to be abroad that if the incomes of primary producers were"" averaged in accordance with some of the many methods which are possible, all the difficulties of the man on the land would be solved. I do not believe that, but in providing for the principle the Government are making, or are liable to make, two"" very important mistakes. The first of these is that they will remit a substantial amount of taxation. I do not know how much it will be. It is possible only for the expert officers of the Taxation Department to inform us, aud the Minister should give the Committee tiheir calculations before the clauses dealing with the average principle are disposed of. I think the effect on the revenue of the year in which the provision operates will be substantial, and I do not believe in this attempt to make remissions to one particular class of people. My own impression is that if this community can stand less taxation, and I believe we shall have to face that condition shortly, the taxation should be remitted, not to one section of the community, but broadly and equitably according to the circumstances of all taxpayers. In saying that, I do not admit that all taxpayers are .subBill jected today to equality of sacrifice. On examination it may be found that some deserve a heavier rate of remission than others; but certainly one section should not be relieved while all the rest continue to pay as they have been doing. I speak now as the representative of a metropolitan electorate, but as one in whose constituency there are substantial rural interests, perhaps .as heavy as those in the divisions represented by honourable members who speak for the actual primary producers.",62
212,Dr MALONEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Whfr e are those in be terests ?,62
213,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The honourable member will know that in the electorate I represent there reside large squatters who are interested in rural concessions. They are just as much interested in them as the farmers who live up-country, because remissions of this kind will affect them in the same way. I urge, first of all , ' that the. question of the remission and the amount ought to be a matter for careful study by the House. The second mistake is, I think, that this is an invidious distinction between classes of taxpayers, and cannot be justified on any ground of principle. The honourable member for Hume (Mr . - Parker Moloney) just now assumed, rather than explained, that the primary producer on the land was subjected to more vicissitudes than any other class of die community.  tioned those vicissitudes.",62
214,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes . The statement perfectly true, particularly in respect those who are struggling in the low rainwhich belt areas of Australia. Not so much in Victoria-althoug h the north-west would show the same relationship-bu t in South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia, and, possibly, i tions of Queensland, there are areas where men are struggling under condirain. tions that sometimes strike with overwhelming force and cripple them. would go so far as to say, with regard those carrying on operations in. the rainfall belts of Australia, that there should be some special arrangement for averaging their income. No such rangement, however, should be made in respect of the whole of the farming territory of the Commonwealth. Let me take an example to illustrate what mean. We have in Australia a number of irrigators. The number, hapthe pily, is increasing year by year as water conservation and storage become more general, and are more full y appreciated. These men are not subjected to the vicisforces situdes of drought that the cultivators the back parts of the States I have tioned have to fight against.",63
215,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,It was really the position of those in the dry areas that excited the first demand for this cession.,63
216,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Quite so. But the conthe ditions vary. The Western District New South Wales, for instance, is difTake ferent from the Western District of toria, where the variability of the rainwe f all is slight, and the conditions of duction are more uniform, and it would lie absurd, out of a sense of consideration for the men who have to meet the of time and chance, to give these other highly favoured cultivators and pastoralists the same consideration that we give those who are struggling in the low f all areas.",63
217,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,How would the hongood' orable member define such areas 1,63
218,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"We could specify certain areas or r a in f a ll belts, because the f all figures of recent years, as Dr Tayremission. lor's map shows, indicate that portions of Australia with a low rainfall have a larger proportion of failure of actual rainf all than, the high r a in f a ll districts. It. be perfectly safe, therefore, to take given belts with a r a in f a ll pf S, 9, or is 10 inches and up to 12 inches, and give of to the men in those belts a concession we would not grant to ithe favoured people of the coastal belts, who do not need the same treatment.",63
219,Mr HILL,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Q u it e a number of failures n poron the part of men on the land can be attributed to other causes than want of,63
220,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I was going to mention I that fact. At present I am dealing only to with the position of those who are enlow deavouring to continue ""primary production in districts liable to drought. There may be other causes of failure such as arrabbits, wild dogs, bush-fires",63
221,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Caterpillars .,63
222,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Caterpillars, locusts, I and so on. There are quite a number of great forces working against the farmer and producer on the land, but they do not work equally against all classes of them. There are a great number of other people in the Commonwealth who are subject to which they cannot control. The in honourable member for Hume suggested menthat the manufacturer, when met by a declining demand, can restrict his incomings and output. It is all very well for the honourable member to make that stateconment; but very many manufacturers and traders in this country have been h it by re-active effects of drought and deof pression, over which they have no control. the country storekeeper in one of Victhese drought-ridden districts of which have been speaking. We find him asprosisting the land-holder, who is to enjoy this remission of taxation, whereas he, in his Own turn , is to get no such remission. shocks Surely, that is not fair .",63
223,Mr LAZZARINI,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"There are not many country 'storekeepers who "" go broke."" rainThey all get their money eventually.",63
224,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"r l suppose they do; but meantime, they pay heavy taxation in years and get no remission in the lean years. As to their "" g o i ng broke,"" I do not know of the failure of many big rainpastoralists, but they are to enjoy this  member will admit that the position of the man on the land who, in a given year, gets no return, because his holding has been devastated by drought, is worse than that of the country storekeeper, who will, sooner or later, get his money.",63
225,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If that were ""the exact position, I should agree with the honourable member, but he must not imagine that the ""primary producer,"" as denned in this Bill-and there is a very narrow definition of the term-is the only man who can claim consideration at the hands of the tax-gatherer through the operation of forces over which he has no control. * - I say, therefore, that this is an invidious distinction in favour of one class of taxpayers, and is not equitable as between sections of that same class. It is also a premium on speculation. Yet no premium of a similar kind is given to speculators in other lines. Take the man who has a grazing area, freehold or leasehold, and engages in dealings in sheep or cattle. Under this Bill he'is to get a remission of taxation; but his losses may be due to speculations in live stock. If a trader speculates-if , exercising exactly the same ambition and desire to get rich as the grazier who has been speculating in live stock, he overstocks and losesbe is not to get any remission of taxation.  do not speculate on the land. If r . WATT - The honorablo member's interjections are seldom illuminating, although they are more frequent than those of any other honourable member.",64
226,Mr ROBEKT COOK,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Hi s interjection in this case is true, even if it is not illuminating.",64
227,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It may he; but, if .so, Lt is a rare exception. I point out that, by this class of remission, we shall open the door to speculative results, so far as certain classes of people are concerned, whereas no other section of the community is to enjoy a similar consideration. I ask the House not to imagine, that this Bill is going to bring about the millennium, or that it establishes a perfect system of taxation. It does nothing of the kind, and after it has been given a trial for a few years, either this or some succeeding Q-overnment will be endeavouring to patch up the mistakes that have clearly occurred through remissions of this kind which have been made. Another matter dealt with in this Bill is the taxation of bonus shares. I understand that a distinction is 'being made with respect to two different classes of bonus shares. Bonus shares, that are given in lieu of dividends out of accumulated profits are to be taxed; the others are not. There is a significant feature associated with this proposal. A dispute on grounds of principle has occurred between distributers of bonus shares and the Taxation Department, under the existing Act, and a test case has been listed for consideration iby the Oourt. - Sir ROBERT BEST -{Severa l such cases bave been listed.",64
228,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"There may be others; but I have in mind one particular case, that of the Broken Hill South Company. It was deemed advisable that those interested in this kind of operation should combine to have a test case brought before 'the Court. The effect of this provision, I take it-and the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) will say whether' I am right or not-is to determine,' as the Taxation Department would have them determined, all those issues except with regard 'to the case which is sub judice.",64
229,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The clause in question also covers cases that are sub judice. Mr Watt. 1 do not know whether it can do that. The Acting Attorney General will probably enlighten us on that point. I do not believe in legislating in regard to cases that are actually ' before the Court.,64
230,Mr RILEY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,This is going to save the country hundreds of thousands of pounds.,64
231,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It is not a question of saving the country hundreds of thousands of pounds, but, rather, of interpreting the law. If the Court says that the resisting taxpayer's interpretation of the Act is right, it is then for the Government to say that it will ask for an amendment of the law; but while the existing law - is being tested, I regard it as an evil principle for the Government to come down to Parliament with a. Bill to settle all these issues before the Judge has a chance of considering them.",64
232,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Does not the honourable member think that the intention of the. Act ought to be considered, and any defect remedied? Mi\ WATT - The intention of the Act must be determined by the wording of it. In deciding such a question, we cannot have regard to what, for example, the responsible Minister said when introducing it, or to what was said by honourable members when debating it. The Court endeavours to read, into the verbiage of an Act the motive and intentions which appear from its wording. Legal members of the House have explained that fact on many occasions.",65
233,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The cases affected by this measure are those where bonus shares are issued in respect of accretions of capital.,65
234,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The honourable member refers to the provision, which simply says that where bonus shares are issued because of an increase in the value of the assets of a company,, they are not to be taxed.",65
235,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,That is right.,65
236,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"But I am not dealing with that now. I am dealing with the cases where bonus shares are not issued in respect of an increase in the value of the assets, but because of profits not distributed, and for which shares are written off. This Bil l says that shares issued in such circumstances are liable for taxation. That is the issue now before the Court, and therefore this House is being asked to determine something which has been listed for consideration by the chief Tribunal of the country.",65
237,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I understand that some companies, in order to evade taxation, have taken their reserves and reconstructed. As the Government do not know them in their new form,' they are not amenable to taxation.",65
238,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"My experience leads me to say that it is not possible for any company to reconstruct'without the Government knowing all about it through its Taxation Office by means' of the balance sheets which have to be rendered to the Taxation Commissioner, and explained to the shareholders. Therefore, all the facts are ascertainable, and if certain corporations are evading the law, the law should be administered. If the law is not sufficient to cover.the emergency, it should be strengthened. The only remedy a citizen of this country has against the demand of the taxing officer is to go to the Court, whether he is rich or poor. Certain demands have been made on certain classes of interests in respect to bonus shares. These interests dispute the interpretation placed on the Act by the Commissioner for Taxation. They say, "" We will take it to the Law Court; .that is the proper place to. decide it . "" And that is what I say. This anticipatory legislation, as I think it is, is, therefore, objectionable.",65
239,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not know that the honourable member is correct in saying that this legislation will affect the right of any particular person* . Mr Watt - I think that the Minister will find that it does. so. Mr GROOM.:-There , may be several cases before the Court; but the point is. whether their rights will be affected by this legislation.",65
240,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I have just been arguing, tthat this legislation determines a case that has been listed for issue before the Court.",65
241,Mr CHARLTON,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If this legislation is not retrospective, it will, not affect any matter before the Court.",65
242,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not know that it is not retrospective. One of my first complaints on rising to speak was that it was difficult for a layman, and even for a student of income taxation, to grasp in a few minutes the very many technical provisions of a Bill like this, and that it was reprehensible that we should be asked to deal, in the closing hours of the session, with a matter that might detrimentally affect large interests throughout this country. May I give one illustration of this, and ask for an interpretation of clause 7 ? In the opening words of the clause, there is a change in the form of the wording of the principal Act. In comparing this clause with section 18, paragraph a, subsection 1 of the principal Act, honourable members will see a wonderful similarity in the actual language employed, but a difference in the order of the words. Already in Melbourne there is a large number of men who think that the alteration has been made designedly by the Taxation Commissioner in. order to get very much heavier taxation from certaininterests than the Act has hitherto entitled him to collect. In calculating the taxable income of a taxpayer, the Act effect provides that the total income derived from all sources in Australia shall taken as a basis, and that from it there shall be deducted(a) All losses and outgoings (not the nature of losses and outgoings of capital) including commission, count, travelling expenses, interest, and expenses actually incurred in Australia in gaining or producing gross income. In other words, everything that is spent as an outgoing in the legitimate production of income is deductible.",65
243,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Eve n if the expenditure occurs outside Australia.,66
244,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Yes ; but the proposed substituted provision allows as deducthe tions(a) All losses and outgoings (not being the nature of losses and outgoings have referred. of capital) actually incurred tralia in gaining or producing assessable income, including commission, discount, travelling expenses, see any reason for the amendment. interest, ancl other expenses. The words that have been transposed are "" actually incurred in Australia."" They have been put earlier in the proposed new concerned. paragraph, and it is feared by the mercantile interests that a number of deductions formerly permitted will no longer be allowed. Take, for instance, the question of debenture interest. I do not dogmato tize to the Minister in charge rather do I submit this matter for consideration by the Commissioner of TaxaAustralia tion and the'officers of the Treasury see exactly what will be the effect' of the land. transposition. There are a large number of big companies in Australia, some in the pastoral business and some i cantile business, who have, raised dehonorable members. benture money in England, and the question, is whether the interest on those debentures is to be treated as a deduction in future, under the' wording of this posed new paragraph, as it has beer i the past.. These people claim that if i is not, the difference in the effect on taxation will be as from about 8d. f 1 to 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 , and this w i l in the aggregate, a considerable amount on the vast sums involved, because, broadly speaking, millions of pounds have been advanced by Britishers as loans to porations operating in Australia. I ask the Minister to carefully consider what the new provision will have on debenture interest, or any of the other outbe goings formerly allowed as deductions?",66
245,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If the 'assumption of these people is sound, it will be a being in very serious matter for them.",66
246,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I am not saying that it disis sound; except that I say the mercantile interests likely to be affected are already the experiencing considerable apprehension * and concern as to the likely effect of this amendment. The Bill was submitted so late this afternoon that I have not had more than a casual opportunity of conferring with them. I do not think that wo should enact legislation in a hurry and repent it at leisure. It is not a scientific way of doing things. In any case, I ask Minister to explain the object of the amendment, apart from the effect of the in transposition of the words to which I I think I understand in Aussomething of the operation of the old dethe duction provision, and I confess I cannot At any rate, we should be clear, before we assent to the clause in Committee, as to its object and effect upon the interests",66
247,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Probably it is the outcome of the report of the Taxation Commission in Great B r it a in upon double taxation.,66
248,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It has nothing whatever - do with that phase of the question, so of the Bill ; far as I can see.,",66
249,Mr WEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The debenture-holders in might be called upon to pay to taxation on the interest earned in Eng,66
250,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Althoug h that may be a phase of the question,'it is not the one to n merwhich I have invited the attention of I was about to deal with the matter of double taxation. I have not the report of the British Commission in which the proCommonwealth Statistician participated, n hut from memory it appears to me that t the wording of the clause in this TRill which deals with that aspect of taxation adopts in the the recommendation of that Commission. l mean,"" I assume that the Minister has satisfied himself upon that point, and. if so, I say that this is a decided step in advance in Empire taxation relationship that will do corfar more than we, perhaps, at the present time understand to increase the trading and financial interchanges of all parts of the Empire.",66
251,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,This framed in pursuance of the. arrangement with the Imperial Government.,67
252,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"A Commission was appointed by the British Government, and the Dominions who had been complaining about this double taxation were asked to send representatives to it . Mr Knibbs was sent on behalf of Australia, and after - weeks of argument, because it was a knqtty question-w e saw enough of it from our end to know that-whe n men got'together from every part of the Empire, and began to see the complications and ramifications of the problem, to their surprise and pleasure they got to a settlement which was adopted with characteristic promptness by the British Government, and only needs this confirmation from us to become reciprocally operative. It appears to me that the wording of this clause adopts and renders immediately operative the remission system as between the Old Country and ourselves.",67
253,Mr RICHARD POSTEE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Minister has said so.,67
254,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I did not hear him on that point, and no doubt it is the intenhe tion of the clause, but we need to be finition quite sure-becaus e it is a tangled blem-that the recommendations of the Commission are given effect to in this sents ? clause. Those traders who either spread abroad from Australia, to the Mothermember, land, as many of our enterprises have done, or spread from the Motherland to Australia, will welcome this provision an act of statecraft that will be beneficial to every one concerned. Of course, will mean a loss of revenue to a certain extent to. both countries, and more so Great Britain than to us, because of Great Britain's generosity in connection with the arrangement; but still it w i ll be beneficial to the Motherland, and directly the taxing officers of both countries will eventually get more money f their Treasurers with less harm than they would create by continuing the system that has unfortunately run ever since income taxation was first adopted in Australia. I do not wish to detain the Committee further than to say that I hope proposals for relief, such as that which the honour the able member for' Hunter (Mr Charlton) has voiced, by increasing the exemption, will not be pressed on this Bill . rather have seen this matter, the averagwealth. ing provision and all other matters clause is cept the double taxation clause, which is not a class one, postponed until we can get a chance of understanding more full y the preliminary and final reports of the Taxation Commission. We have apparently lifted one recommendation out of that report for sentimental and political reasons, and are attempting to give it a hasty passage through this Parliament. But the best thing to do with the report is to have it sent in its final form to honourable members, and let it be deliberated on by them, and to let any reorganization of taxatiou that must be attempted in the near future follow the evidence submitted to the Commission.",67
255,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,What does the honourable member suggest is the political reason ?,67
256,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I am not suggesting anything more than the remark, but the honourable member's fertile and imaginative mind will at once see how useful this B i ll would prove in binding the rural in Prime terests of Australia.

257,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Like the honourable I have to plead guilty to not having had time to look into the matter.,67
258,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I advise my honourable as friend to see whether the miner is in cluded. Why should he not be included it with the primary producers? Mr . CONSIDINE - Do you mean the to mining director or the working miner ?,67

260,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The mining^ director in - is well able to look after himself!,67
261,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Is that why the honoro r able member is not attempting the job ?,67
262,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,No ; it is because you duplicate have already taken it on.,67
263,Mr WATT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Putting this persiflage aside, it is worthwhile to note.; that the mining interests, although essentially primary, are not included in the definition. I urg""e the Minister (Mr Groom), when Government come together after the session closes, to impress on his colleagues the necessity - of taking a review of the I would whole taxation sytem of the CommonI am quite sure that if we were exto put the microsco23e on many of the thingsewe did in finance during war time, none of us would like to perpetuate them indefinitely, particularly the incidence of taxation. I felt it my duty a little while ago to give some illustrations of how in come and land taxation, was pressing on some of the primary interests of the country. If honourable members have time in recess to study the figures of the five I gave in the hurry of the moment, they will be astounded at the amount we take out of some incomes, to the jeopardy and eventual ruin of some of the abiding in terests of the country. I urge that direct taxation shall be dealt with in a general way, and not piece-meal. Let us study again the principles that are operating in our system, and see whether we cannot find one more equitable to the Treasury and to the individual taxpayer, and more particularly to the producing, manufacturing, and exchanging interests of this country.  to support the .Bill, notwithstanding that I feel it is inadequate as an instrument for fairly collecting taxation from the people of Australia. I found it somewhat difficult to follow the Prime Minister (Hughes) when he was introducing this Bill ; indeed, I do not think he had a thorough grasp of the situation himself. He referred to a person receiving an in come of £8,000 in the first, £3,000 in the next, aud £1,000 in the third year, Of course, if the incidence provided by this Bill were,to commence operation in the third year, and go to the first year its £8,000, honourable members would recognise that such a taxpayer would be sorry that there had ever been an amendment of the Act ; because, on the £8,000 he would pay the tax applicable to £8,000, or .53d. in the £ 1 , and on the £3,000 year he would pay on £5,600, while on the £1,000 he would pay at the rate of £4,000. Honourable members will see, therefore, why I say such a taxpayer would be exceedingly sorry that such a Bill had ever been passed. I repeat that the measure is altogether an incomplete instrument for the purposes desired and which it was hoped it would accomplish. All that the primary ducer expects is mere justice. follow the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt.) when he says that this law of average should apply to every taxpayer. In justice I concede that that is only reasonable.",67
264,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The trouble about the argument is that the honourable member did not say that.  orable member for Balaclava to say that this average method applied to only one section, and I think I am quite right in what I say. But there is certainly much cases more ground for applying this method to the primary producer than to auy other section. The operations of the primary producer may be described as speculative, but I regard them as a neoessary hazardous business that is in no way a gamble except to the person engaged i u it. It is. an occupation that is highly in the interests of the country; all our revenue is obtained from primary production, even the wages of the boy who sweeps our streets. An y man who goes out to develop the natural resources of the country and increase its fertility runs tremendous risks. However, I contend that £ 1 is £ 1 no'matter who receives it , and we have taxation on one year's income. To one that receives the same income every year that does not matter; but a primary producer runs risks fro m Mr drought and in many other ways. He may lose on some years, and when he eventually strikes a prosperous period with good prices he is unreasonably taxed, taking into consideration his previous low: returns. The same remarks apply to the miner and the prospector. The latter may spend £2,000 or £3,000 in searching for gold, and when he has with found it to perhaps the same value after years of work he is full y taxed on it without any regard to his previous expenditure. Such a system is not in the interests of the development of the country. When a system of graduated income taxation came into force, the Socialistic idea was met, and there is no desire on the part of the primary producer to set it aside; the whole cause of the trouble of the primary producers arises from the graduated tax and the irregular income. If there were a flat rate the primary producer would have no ground for complaint. Whatever income he received he would pay proon that flat rate: but, as it is, if I after some bad years he strikes a prosperous year, the graduated scale results in 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, of his income going in taxation, although he badly needs the money to make up his losses. If we devised a flat rate, that would solve the whole problem; but I take it that honourable members opposite would not agree to that. I appeal to them, however, on the grounds of equity and justice.",68
265,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It was grounds that the graduated income tax was introduced.  system that will act fairly all round. However, this Bill is not an equitable instrument, but far from it . It is possible for two persons, each receiving £10,000 over five years to pay in one case £1,146 in taxation, and in the other £520, a difference of £ 6 2 6 . Can it be an equitable system under which such a thing is possible? This, of course, may be an extreme case; but the fact remains that in the five years each of the taxpayers had an income of £10,000, and £10,000 is as valuable to one man as to the other, aud, therefore, both should bear the burden equally. In the case I have cited the income for the first year is £4,000, the next year £3,000, and the third year £2,000, the fourth year £1,000, and the next year nothing, or £10,000 in the five years, and the. result is what I have said, viz., £ 1 , 1 4 6 ; but reverse the figures so that a rising revenue will be shown, when a tax of only £ 5 2 0 would be paid. No one can call the present one a complete instrument of taxation. I regret very much that such an important measure as this has to be dealt, with at this stage of the session. for a mind of equity to devise a scheme equitable to all citizens who are equally able toi contribute to the revenue? should like the Government to pass this Bill-though,-afte r all, it is not entirely on the lines of the recommendation of the Commission-bu t in such cases as I have cited, where obvious hardship and injustice are inflicted, let us give the Commissioner power at the end of five year periods to make an adjustment with the taxpayer.",69
266,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Would you leave it with the Coimmissioner to bargain with the taxpayer without laying down any prin ,ciple ? /.  £2,000 a. year for five years receives the same amount of £10,000, and he is on the £2,000 scale all through. Mir. CONSIDTNE - Do you mean a with a, salary, or what?  a salary or a steady income from investment or any other source, and I say that such a man gets off as cheaply as is possible under the present system, for he only pays £736-. If the primary proon those ducer, who receives £10,000 in five years, pays more than that, not only he, but the country, suffers an injustice.",69

268,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The honourable member suggests that it should be left to the Commissioner to adjust the taxation after five years ou such a basis as he thinks equitable. We could not do that.  tend that any instrument for the assessment of taxation which requires the primary producer to pay more than a man on a steady income paysjis fair ?,69
269,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I am suggesting that the remedy is to devise some equitable basis, and not to leave the taxation to be adjusted at the Commissioner's discretion.  should be the standard amount of taxation to be collected from persons with an income of £10,000 over a period of five years.",69
270,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The honourable member It is forgets that a man receiving a regular salary has no chance of increasing it . The primary producer is speculating, and in I one year he might make £1,000 or £20,000.  salary does get increases, and if he has merit he will have an excellent chance of increasing that income without any risk; but whether income is derived from salary or from pumpkins, a pound is a pound; but because of the uncertainty of the in come of the producer, he is h it by the taxgatherer extremely hard.",69
271,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The man with a fixed salary cannot pass on the taxation; the other man does.  orable member approve of the principle of carrying on a man's losses ?  man the most scandalous features of the taxation system of this country that a man who loses £1,000 in one year, and makes £1,000 in the next year, is taxed upon the income of £1,000 although when the two years are reckoned together he has not made one penny. I repeat that I am sorry that the House is forced to deal with this Bill to-night. A h amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Ac t was promised nearly eighteen months ago and we should have received it earlier; but I accept the instalment of reform contained in the Bill , and hope that the Government, at a later stage, when the operation of these amendments has proved them to' be inadequate, will bring down a more complete proposal. I have before me the particulars of a case in which something like £35,000 was invested. The profit over a period of seven years was £12,330-a n average of £1,761 per annum, or less than 5 per cent., on the outlay. Had that income been' received in annual, amounts of £ 1 , 7 6 1 , the taxation paid in the seven years would have amounted to £ 8 4 1 , but because it ' was received, spasmodically, in amounts varying from £250 upwards, the taxation actually paid was £2,150. Qan that be considered to be even in the region of fair play? One-man receiving £1,761 per annum regularly, but producing no wealth, would pay only £ 8 4 1 in taxation over the seven years, but the man who invests his capital in the development of the country, and takes all the hazards, has to pay £2,150. I know of no injustice in connection with our legislation that is greater or does more to retard the progress of the country. This Bill is an admission of the necessity for some remedy, and as such I accept it . It is clumsy and inadequate^ but it is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the Government will offer an early opportunity to honourable members to consider a revised instrument for the assessment of taxation which will be equitable all round, and not continue the heart-burning that is now caused to citizens by the unjust and cruel incidence of taxation.",69
272,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Nepean) [9.6] - The time and manner of the introduction of this Bill are certainly most unfair to honourable members. It is a most important measure, with a very wide scope, and we should have had it earlier.",70
273,Mr GREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The honourable member will admit that the Government had to await the report of the Taxation Commission.,70
274,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"We have not yet received the final report of the Commission, although the first report has been before us for a considerable time. The motion for leave to introduce this Bill has been on the notice-paper for some time; but as it was only advanced to the first reading today, honourable members did not earlier receive copies of it .",70
275,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The ex-Treasurer, in his Budget speech, announced many of the alterations which are contained in the Bill.",70
276,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"But a good many other alterations that were not announced are included. If we could have had a short Bill to deal with the reciprocal arrangements between the Mother Country and the Commonwealth for the avoidance of double, taxation, to give relief to primary producers, it might have passed through the House in a very short time, but apparently the Government and the Commissioner, knowing that the House wanted those amendments, have dragged into the Bill other thingswhich honourable members should have ample time to consider before being asked to finally decide upon them. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , said that the proposed relief for the primary producer should not have been proposed at this. time, and in any case should be wider i u its scope and different in its outlook; but I think that at tihe earliest possible moment some relief should be given to those taxpayers. One has only to read the report of the Taxation Commission, and the numerous cases cited therein, to realise that a very grave in justice has been done, not only to the big grazier, but also to the small man on the land. One of the most striking cases that it is possible to imagine is cited in the Commission's report. Over a period of seven years a grazier made a net profit of £56,447 , the result of his transactions in each year being-Firs t year, a profit of £ 2 4 , 0 1 5; second year, a profit of £ 2 8 , 8 0 4; third year, a loss of £34,645; fourth year, a loss of £ 6 7 , 2 5 5 ; fifth year, a profit of £ 4 , 1 6 2 ; sixth year, a profit of £ 5 5 , 5 3 1 ; and seventh year, a profit of £45,835. Although the net result of seven years' transactions was only £56,447 , he was asked to pay in Federal income taxation alone £ 6 0 , 1 6 1, to say nothing of State income taxationI f that man had invested his money in city property or in war loans, or in something else that produced a regular annual income of £8,064, he would have paid in taxation only £13,299 in the seven years, and he would have taken no risks and no responsibility. He would have sat down quietly and reaped £8,000 per annum from gilt-edged securities, and would have paid in the seven years £13,299 m taxation, whilst the man who took all the risks-and that there is a risk in the pastoral industry is shown by the fact that in one year he lost £67,255 - wa s required to pay in taxation more than he actually received. That is not the way in which to encourage primary production, or induce people to leave the cities and go upon the land.",70
277,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Has that man gone out of business?,71
278,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I do not know; his name is not given; hut in any case the incidence of the taxation is most unfair. Another pastoralist had a net income in five years of £4,802 , equal to £96 0 per annum. He was required to pay in Federal income taxation £2,285 , and in State income taxation £ 7 1 6 . Thus out of his total income of £4,802 he paid out £3,001 in taxation to the Federal and State authorities. Had he been in receipt of a regular annual income of £960, he would have paid in taxation over the five years only £ 4 4 0 . About 130 of these cases were examined by the Commission, and I think that that body is justified in its conclusionsThese examples exhibit a state of affairs which cannot be regarded with complacence, and even if they stood alone as special and peculiar, they call for some remedial measure. But they are, unfortunately, typical of a large number. The total taxpayers who are primary producers cannot be ascertained from the latest departmental statistics available, but they number, probably, 100,000. The first of these three examples is admittedly an extreme case, but it ""is an actual case."" A system under which such a result is even possible is faulty in both conception and incidence. These cases show that there is ground for some relief. The system of suspense credits would have been better than that which is proposed; but a certain measure of relief will certainly be afforded. W it h respect to bonus shares, another phase is opened up in regard to which relief should be given.",71
279,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Why do not companies pay in profits and not in bonus shares ?,71
280,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,There may be several reasons.,71
281,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Evasio n is the reasor.,71
282,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Not necessarily. Take the case of a small company, which would be known in. this State as a proprietary company. I am referring to a Sydney firm, which has a share capital of £10,000. It became necessary ""for the company to approach a bank in order to borrow money to carry on. It had been running for about twenty years, and, in that time, it had accumulated about £15,000 of reserves, which had been turned into stock. A sum of £10,000 was required. . The bank authorities said, "" You want as - much as the whole of your capital "" ; but the representatives of the company replied, "" We have reserves,"" and they mentioned the amount. The objection of the bank was that there was nothing to prevent the company from distributing those reserves; which, if that were done, would materially affect the asset against which it was desired to borrow. The bank officials added, "" If you convert your reserve into shares ° and make your capital £25,000, we will lend you the money you need."" The firm converted the capital into shares.",71
283,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,But those people never paid any taxes.,71
284,Mr BQWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"They had been paying taxes, on the 2s. 8d. rate, upon the whole of their reserves, which had been earned since the taxation was i m posed. The effect is that the whole of the £15,000 has been brought into the ambit of taxation in one year. The rate has been "" skied,"" although there has been no change in the company. The amount of money invested in the company is the same; its assets are the same. All that is different is a bit of paper, the scrip. I emphasize that the income is the same, whether one speaks of reserve and capital or describes it all as capital. But the important fact is that there is brought into taxation, in one year,, twenty years' accumulation of reserves; so that this company, which was in need of money to assist it to carry on its activities, would be called upon to pay thousands of pounds by way of taxation simply because it had capitalized its reserves.",71
285,Mr MATHEWS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Why did those people want to borrow money from the bank if they had £15,000 in reserve?",71
286,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It was all in stock. They wanted cash to enable them to carry on their business. Another consideration is - that shareholders have practically no option in New South Wales. In , Victoria, however, when reserves are proposed to be capitalized, the shareholders are given an option of taking proposed capitalized reserves in cash.",71
287,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"If a person is taxed on his income and he turns part of it into capital, upon which he derives in terest, he is taxed upon that interest. Why should not the New South Wales firm be taxed upon the income derived from, the £15,000 ?",72
288,Mr BOWDE N,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"They would be taxed on the incomebut what I am complaining of is that they are taxed upon the £15,000 capital as though it were income. I invite the honourable member to suppose that I have 500 shares in a company which pays 10 per cent. I get £ 5 0 ; that is my income. If the company doubles the capital out of reserves, the reserves are still in the company, and are bringing money into the company. Suppose that it capitalizes its reserves, and I get 1,000 shares, upon which I receive 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per oent. on 500 shares, my income fro m the shares is still £ 5 0 . But the Taxation Commissioner holds that my in come is not £ 5 0 , but £ 5 5 0 , which is absolutely absurd. I desire to emphasize the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) , who pointed out that the matter of interpretation of the A ct is at present before the Court. The proposal in the Bill is, in effect, that where the Commissioner has a doubtful case before the Court",72
289,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,No ; that is not the position at all.,72
290,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It is. The intention is to alter the interpretation of ' ' in come"" in order to make it clear that bonus shares shall be made taxable, and this measure w i ll make the new provision retrospective to 1915.",72
291,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The intention is to give relief in the direction in which relief is deemed to be merited.,72
292,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It also practically poses new taxation. Parliament has never passed retrospective legislation upon matters such as these. It is quite a new departure to introduce retrospective legislation bearing upon cases actually before the Court. Where there are cases proceeding which come within the ambit of a measure before Parliament, there is always a slaving clause specifically exempting those cases. [561]",72
293,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,But no decision has been arrived at in the present instance.,72
294,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The position is that Parliament passes a taxation measure in which it is set out that certain things shall become taxable. The Court is appealed to to say whether or not a person is liable to taxation thereunder. It is fair that the Court should be approached and asked, "" A m I liable or not?""",72
295,Mr GROOM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,This Bill will not affect the case of any particular person before the Court. His right will be recognised.,72
296,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"It will , unless express reservation is made.",72
297,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The section of the Act which defines ' ' income"" is to be altered. In clause 12 of the Bill it is provided that the amendments of the principal Act made by certain specific paragraphs, and including so much of those which embrace in the definition of "" in c o m e "" the amount for which trading assets have been sold, shall be deemed to have„ come into' operation from the date of the commencement of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915. The effect will be to make the legislation retrospective so far as bonus shares and having assets are concerned.",72
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,What is the honourable member's objection to profits which are distributed in the form of bonus shares being made liable for taxation?,72
299,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The profits are not distributed in the first instance. They are capitalized-sometime s against the wishes of the shareholders.,72
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Tak e the case of a primary'producer who derives his additional capital in the form of additional stock. He is taxed upon that. Why should not another man be taxed on his bonus shares, which are accumulated profits?",72
301,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"For the reason that he never receives it as income. There is an increase shown on a b it of paper, but the income is not in any way increased; bonus shares are still capital. There is not, im - and has not been, any opportunity of spending it . I have known cases in which poor women, who have received boVnus shares, have been assessed, and have had to sell those shares in order to pay the taxation. The very unfair point is that there will be brought into one year's sphere 'of taxation profits accumulated over a period, perhaps, of twenty years, and by that means the rates are ""skied.""",72
302,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The receivers of these bonus shares have been paying less income tax because of the putting of profits to reserves.,73
303,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Not necessarily, because the extent to which any particular shareholder is interested might be very small, and the company has already paid income tax at the flat rate. A great many things have been dragged in by this Bill which might have been left over for another occasion. A gift of assets is made taxable as income. If a man goes out of business, leaving it to his son to carry on the concern, which happens occasionally, the whole of the stockin-trade, good-will, and everything else is treated as income for the year in which the gift is made, and the.taxation upon it may ruin the business. Then, when a business is sold, good-will is treated come, although it takes many years to buila up a good-will that has any considerable value. When a man dies, however, good-will is treated"" not as interest, but as capital.",73
304,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I think the honourable member is in error in that matter.,73
305,Mr BOWDEN,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I have accepted what the Prime Minister told us. Minister's interjection shows that more time is needed for a careful analysis of the provisions of the measure. I would rather the Bill stood over until next session, so that we might deal with it as it should be dealt with.",73
306,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Gwydir) [9.32]. - I join with those who have protested against the introduction of the Bill in the dying hours of the session. measure has, so to speak, been thrown at us with the threat that if we try to amend it the Government will not proceed with it. I hope that the House will resent that threat, and let Ministers carry the odium of withdrawing the measure because members have seen fit to exercise their rights of discussion and amendment. Members have told me that they would move amendments if they were not afraid of the withdrawal of the Bill, so that evidently the threat of the Government is preventing Parliament from functioning as it should do. No private member would like to have attached to him responsibility for the loss of a Bill which affords some small measure of relief to the taxpayers. But no threat will prevent me from doing what I consider to be necessary in the interests of those who sent me here. It is an insult to Parliament to bring down a Bill of ten pages the day before it is proposed to enter upon a recess of five or six months, more especially a Bill bristling with intricate technicalities. Every business man knows how difficult it is to prepare income tax returns which will not involve trouble with the Commissioner. More time should be given for the discussion of the Bill, even if we have to sit longer. Those who now suffer a great injustice by the operation of the income tax law should be given relief by the removal of anomalies. I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) intends to move to increase the exemption. At the present time persons who have an inas income of only £100 a year are taxed, although the Courts have fixed £4 5s. per week as the living wage. Many men, taking into consideration the time when they are not working, do not make more than £3 or £3 10s. per week, yet though not in receipt of the living wage, they are expected to furnish income tax returns, and to pay taxation on their inThe come. I .am surprised that no notice has been takenof the protests which have been raised repeatedly against-the unfair operation of the income tax in the assessment of live stock. A struggling man with 1,000 breeding ewes may lose half the number in a drought, but from the remaining half he may get 400 lambs, so that at the end of the year he has 900 sheep where previously he had 1,000. The present method of assessment takes The no account of his losses, but regards the natural increase of 400 as so much income, and this method of assessment has been in operation for years. It may happen that the lambs which are born within the year for which they are assessed as income die before anything can be got for them. Hundreds of cases of that kind have occurred in my electorate during the past few years.",73
307,Mr JOWETT,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The Bill gives relief in such cases.,73
308,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"No ; it does not amend the section under which this live stock is assessed as income. It must not he forgotten that the breeder of sheep is taxed on the money that he gets for their wool or their carcasses. The Government should have granted relief in this matter long ago. The honourable member for Nepean has shown how harshly the law operates at times towards persons interested in companies, and we who represent country constituencies, and are not so familiar as he is with the kind of case of which he has spoken, are indebted to him for the remarkably clear - manner in which he has exposed the anomalies of the law. Members should have time to weigh speeches such as his. Presumably, it is intended that there shall be an all-night sitting, in which the Bill may be forced through.",73
309,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I never knew a Government to intend an all-night sitting.,74
310,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,Surely it is not expected that a Bill of ten pages will be put through in an hour or an hour and a half!,74
311,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,I have seen a Bill of that length put through in ten minutes.,74
312,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Some of the Government measures work so badly that they might seem to have been put through in that time. Ministers are not acting fairly towards members in bringing forward a Bill like this so late in the session. I hope that the House will not be influenced hy the threat that the Bill v. ill not be proceeded with if attempts are made to amend it. It would be better to let the measure go over to next session than to place it hurriedly on the statutehook. If we pass it to-night, and, later, attempt to get the anomalies which it will create remedied, the Government will say, ""Why did you not have these matters dealt with when the Bill was before Parliament V The Government has had two years in which to bring down amending income tax legislation.",74
313,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,The honourable member has done his share in occupying with talk time that could have been used in the consideration of clauses.,74
314,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"The way in which Government measures are presented to Parliament provokes criticism. Convention Bill was introduced in a form in which it was not in the least acceptable to the Houses-in a form., indeed, that was not acceptable to any one. I do not think the Prime Minister himself thought very much, of it . This Bill follows on very much the same lines. It has been hastily thrown together, and honourable members [561]- 2 are now asked to pass it in the course of a couple of hours, leaving the Taxation Commissioner to do the rest. The Bill having become law, the Commissioner will interpret it , and if a dispute occurs between him and a taxpayer, the latter, in order to get justice, will have to appeal to the Court. It is not every man who cares about incurring the cost of law pro-ceedings.",74
315,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,It would be cheaper to pay the tax.,74
316,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"I agree with my honourable friend. Many men would prefer to suffer an injustice rather than incur the expense of going to law. I would pay the taxation demanded by the Commissioner, even if I considered it to be unfair, rather than suffer the risks of going to law; because the Commissioner has behind him. the whole of the resources of the Commonwealth. The late Mr. Ryan, K . C , used to say that the only Court {hat was right was the last one to which a man could appeal, and that it was right only because it was the final Court of appeal. The Opposition will assist the Government to so amend this Bill, that it may be more acceptable to the people. That, however, cannot be done properly in the time at our disposal. As it is, we are asked to agree to the Bill being rushed through Parliament, with the result that it will not receive the consideration which its importance demands. Many honourable members are not prepared to remain here all night, and even if they were, we know that by 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., honourable members become so mentally as well as physically fatigued that they are unable to properly analyze the provisions of a measure of this kind. The Bill has many anomalies, and it will only be after it has been passed and the people are suffering under it thab honourable members will realise how foolish they were in allowing legislation of suck a character to be rushed through Parliament in the dying hours of the session.",74
317,Mr GREGORY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Dampier) [9.40] The While I regret that there has been some delay in introducing this Bill, I welcome it because of the most important concessions for which it provides. The necessity for' making such concessions has been proved over and over again in evidence given before the Royal Commission on Taxation, and I hope that there will be no delay in passing the Bill.",74
318,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,This is a new note.,75
319,Mr GREGORY,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Not at all. The Royal Commission on Taxation has not yet finalized its work. I hope that when its final report has been presented the ""Government will submit a measure providing for many necessary taxation reforms, and that we shall be given ample time to consider it . We are looking forward to the introduction of an amending Bill that will make for simplicity of taxation methods, and provide also for uniformity. A special effort should be made to induce the States to come into line with the Commonwealth in order that we may secure uniformity of taxation, and thus reduce the cost of collection, and at the same time lessen the troubles of taxpayers, who now have to prepare so many varying returns. The report which has been presented by the Commission shows how essential it is that we should have amending legislation to give relief to primary producers, who have for long been most inequitably treated. I should have been better pleased had the Bill provided for the payment of taxation on actual cash profits as far as primary producers are concerned, and not on increases of stock. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr Cunningham.) has referred to the losses of stock that have been suffered by graziers aud others who have been taxed on increases in stock, but I am glad that the Government are now giving us a portion, at least, of the concessions for which we have so long been asking. They are giving us the average system which we have been demanding for some years, and while the provisions of the Bill do. not go as far as we would like them to go in that direction, they will , at least, grant some relief to a class of the community which has been very harshly treated. I thank the Government for this Bill , and I hope that when the final report of the Commission has been received those who. go into the back country and help to develop Australia will be granted greater concessions than are extended to those who carry on business in our cities. I was more than surprised at the speech made to-night by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) . The primary producers might well have expected a little sympathy from him. His speech displayed a lack of consistency on his part. When he held office as Treasurer and the war-times profits tax was before this House, I pleaded with him for some consideration to be extended to those who for years before the war had started in the pastoral industry, but who, up to the outbreak of war, had shown no profit whatever on their operations. 1 quoted, among other instances, the case of a man who had invested £20,000 in the pastoral in dustry and who, for some years before the outbreak of war, instead of making any profit, had suffered big losses. That man, however, in one year of the war made a profit of £4,500, and was called upon to pay £2,25 0 in respect of the war-times profits tax in addition to the ordinary State and Federal taxation. The honourable member, however, as Treasurer, specially exempted from war-times profits taxAny agency (in which little or no capital expenditure is required) to the extent to which the Commissioner is satisfied that the profits arise from commissions in resptct of purchases, sales, leases, loans, insurances, or collections of money made on behalf of any other person. . . . Thus a city man who during the war made a profit of £10,000, £15,000, or £20,000, not by investing any capital, but by ""jobb in g ,"" and so making things dearer for the people, was absolutely exempt from the war-times profits tax, whereas men who nad been battling for years in the bush had to mortgage their holdings in some cases in order to pay that tax. The pro1 vision in this Bill in regard to average income is a concession in a small way, and is - badly needed. Those who read the report of the Commission will realise how necessary such an amendment of the law is. I also hail with satisfaction the provisions of the Bill in regard to the mining industry. We are all familiar with the difficulties attending the opening up of a new field. I know of men who, after battling in the ' ' never-never country "" for fen or fifteen years, made a "" f in d , "" which they were able to dispose of, receiving payment partly in cash and partly in shares, and were compelled to file their schedule because of the taxation demanded in respect of those shares. I thank the Government very heartily for this cancession to the mining industry. A prospector makes a l it t l e profit, perhaps only once in a life-time, and hitherto the In come Tax Department has been taking a very great proportion of such profit. I do not desire to delay the House further, except to express the hope that when we go into Committee the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) will explain why clause 12 has been made retrospective, because it seems to me to be so far-reaching that it may be unjust in its incidence.",75
320,Mr CORSER,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Wide Bay) [9.55] While this Bill may do much good it is also calculated to work much injustice, aud I enter my protest against its introduction at this late stage of the session, unless we can. secure considerable alterations from the Minister <when we go into Committee. It is impossible, in the' circumstances, for it to receive due consideration. If it be carried, large business firms in Queensland, who realized the necessity of putting aside reserves-in respect of which fthey had already paid the war-times profits tax and income tax-in order to meet losses that must inevitably occur when the slump comes, ancl their stocks are consequently reduced in value, will find themselves, so to speak, between the devil and the deep blue sea. The State Taxation Department has collected income tax not only on the profits that have been distributed in the shape of bonus shares, but also on such reserves. Take a company with a. capital of £200,000 in 200,000 shares of £ 1 each, which had reserves amounting to £25,000. No deduction was allowed the company in respect to its earnings on that £25,000. The tax was based on the smaller amount, and, consequently, was much heavier than it should have been. The legal advisers of various firms told them that the best course for them to adopt would be to distribute their reserves in the form of bonus shares. That was done. A f t e r these bonus shares were distributed, in order to avoid being unjustly taxed by forcing the State Taxation Department to distribute the earnings on the whole of the capital, and not on a portion of it only, we have had the Commonwealth Taxation Department saying, "" The shareholders must a.t once pay heavy taxation on the whole of the bonus shares allotted."" To comply with this demand would have meant almost ruination to some firms, ancl I am told on good authority that there are cases now pending in the Courts concerning the matter. When I know that many facts would have been supplied to me, if time had permitted, by people in Queensland, I feel that I am not justified, as a. representative of a Queensland constituency, in voting for this Bill to-night unless we secure amendments. Honourable members should have tim'e to consider every clause of the measure and its probable effect on every part of the Commonwealth, and not on oue State alone. We have not time to communicate with Chambers of Commerce or people who are largely interested in such a Bill . One honourable member has pointed out that if bonus shares are distributed, the recipient gets a larger income, but such is not the case. A company which distributes bonus shares is losing it's reserves upon which it has been earning-money with which to pay"" dividends to its shareholders, and the receipt of bonus shares does not mean a larger dividend. The distribution of bonus shares in Queensland was undertaken because the State taxing officers collected the tax on the basis of the paidup capital of a. company, and did not distribute the earnings on paid-up capital and reserve funds. We are not given the opportunity of discussing this Bill on itsmerits as we should. 1 appeal to the Goverument to lay it aside u n t i l honourable members have sufficient time to get in touch with those who are affected by it , so that we may see what action it is advisable to take, or agree to make amendments.

Mr BowDE Sir - Wit h the permission of the Committee I desire to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",80
382,Mr CUNNINGHAM,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Gwydir) [10.41]. - I move That the following paragraph be inserted before paragraph (a) '-' {aa) by inserting in paragraph (a) thereof after the words ' live stock' the words ' existing at the time of furnishing his income tax returns.'"" That is to provide for cases such as I mentioned to-night. A man who has, say, 1,000 breeding ewes loses 500 of them, through drought, such as was experienced for a couple of years preceding last year in the northern district of New South Wales, and is frequently experienced in other parts of Australia. From the 500 remaining he may get a natural increase of 400, bringing his total to 900. Even then he is 100 short of his original stock, but the present method of assessment allows him nothing for the 500 he has lost; he has to pay on the natural increase of 400 as though the increase were income. In reality, his original capital shows a loss, because his live stock are his capital, and he has 100 less than he started with. I contend that he should not be assessed on thatnatural increase as though it were income. Another case has to do with a man owning 1,000 head of breeders. His natural increase may be said to be 600. Drought supervenes; and the lambs may die. He cannot realise upon that lost stock; yet he will be required to pay as though it were income. If those sheep continued tolive the breeder would shear wool off their backs; and on such income as he derived from the sale of the wool he would be required to pay income taxation. If he should dispose of that stock the returns would be shown in his schedule as income, and he would pay accordingly. But, I repeat, if that stock dies, he stall has to pay upon the natural increase as if it were income. That is grossly unfair, and it entails great hardship upon struggling men in the back country which"" n periodically visited by drought, fire, and flood. The Government should uot levy upon the natural increase until the taxpayer has realized upon it . As sales are made from the produce of the natural increase the person concerned pays upon his income as it is derived. There are many men today who are in a most unfortunate position. Almost the whole of their stock have been lost, what with the drought of twoi years ago and recent floods, which have wiped out practically all survivors among the natural increase.",80
383,Mr HUGHES,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [1C.481The point raised by the honourable member is very important. This matter was among those referred to the Taxation Royal Commission. Ifc is on© to which th© Commissioners are at present giving particular attention. It is well known that they have presented a report covering a portion of the matters referred to them; but, upon this subject, they have not yet reported. The Commissioner for Taxation says that, in his opinion, the matter is very complicated, notwithstanding that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr . Cunningham) has expressed the opposite view. I hope the Committee will accept the assurance of the Government that the subject is receiving from the Taxation Royal Commission the most careful in vestigation; and that the Government, directly the Commission has presented its report-eve n if it should ignore the matter, or put forward no satisfactory or practical method of relief-wil l afford Parliament the earliest possible opportunity for the discussion of the problem upon its merits. I cannot accept the amendment, but not because I am not desirous of helping the man on the land. I quite appreciate that there must be very many taxpayers who find themselves in precarious and unenviable positions such \ as have been described. The Royal Commission has done excellent work, and the Government have taken the earliest opportunifcy to embody its recommendations, to date, in a Bill which, without further delay, should be a law of the land.",80
384,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"F r a n k l in ) [10.51], - I look upon the amendment being of considerable importanceso far as stock-owners are concerned. The incidence of the tax is simply brutal. The 'specific case has been recently brought under my notice of a man who branded more than 4,000 calves. He lost all in a draught, togetlier with 62 per cent, of their mothers, but he had to pay income tax on the calves that had died. The position is. not complicated, as the Prime Minister alleges. To compel a man to pay income tax upon capital which has gone cannot be justified.",81

387,Dr EARLE PAGE,WAR PRECAUTIONS ACT REPEAL,"Cowper) [10.54]. - There can be no two* opinions concerning the unfairness and injustice of the present system of taxing upon the natural increase, especially in times such as the present, when stock is practically unsaleable. There are men in my . electorate who live by breeding, and who have been required to pay £400 or £500 by way of income tax, although they have not been able to sell a hoof in the past two years. And the situation becomes' only the more aggravated as the stock grows older and bigger. One of my constituents offered to forward to the Taxation Commissioner the equivalent of his income tax assessment in kind. The Royal Commission has investigated the whole question. I differ from those honourable members who have said that this matter is not complicated. Primary producers are represented upon the Commission by men whoi are trying to grapple with the position as fairly and squarely 7 as possible. I do not think good will come of hasty legislation at this stage; it mighto result in more trouble for p r i mary producers.",81

Taxpayers are given their choice as to whether they will come in thereunder-jus t dealing with purchases and sales-o r whether they prefer to act as an ordinary business man does-that is to say, by taking a full stock at the beginning and at the end of the. year. Many graziers are at present working under the provision to which I have just alluded.

For the past eleven years I have been doing nothing else but working along tliese lines for graziers and farmers.

Every grazier does not carry on the same class of business.

SECOND READING.",85
418,Mr GROOM,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [11.59] I move That this Bill 'be now read a second time. This is a short Bill for the purpose of amending section 48 of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1918. In the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915, exemption as regards income from personal exertion was given to any person "" who is on active service during the present war with the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, part of ths King's Dominions, or of an Ally of Great Britain."" That was intended to apply only to soldiers who were on active service overseas, stud not to home servioe men, and. was so interpreted and applied. In 1918, an of the Act expressly set forth that Act was to apply to soldiers overseas, and should date as from 1918. was brought against the by a soldier who was engaged on home service, and the case of versus The Federal Commissioner PAIRS. Taxation is thus reported in the Commonwealth Law ReportsSection 13 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1915-1916 provides that ""This Act shall not apply to any person who is on active service during the present war with the Military or Naval Forces of the Commonwealth. - . so far as regards income derived from personal exertion and earned prior to the commencement of this Act or during the present state of war."" Held that the words "" active service"" in that section have the same meaning as they are given by section 4 of the Defence Act 1903-1915, namely, "" service in or with a Force which is engaged in operations against the enemy, and includes any naval or military service in time of war"". Held therefore that an officer of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth who had been mobilized for duty in 1915, and during the year ending on 30th June, 1917, was District Commandant of the 2nd Military District and Inspector-General of Administration, was on active service during that period, and was entitled to the benefit of section 13 in respect of income tax for that year, although his service was performed within Australia. The object of this Bill is to make it perfectly clear that the law gives exemption only to the soldiers who did actual service overseas. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended. Bill read a third time. NEW BUSINESS'.

419,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.11 a.m.] - I move That the duties of Customs which shall be imposed upon any goods which are imported into the Commonwealth from the Dominion of New Zealand, and are th» produce or manufacture of that Dominion, and which are specified by the Governor General by proclamation, shall be the duties respectively specified in the column headed "" British Preferential Tariff "" of the schedule to the Customs Tariff 1921. Owing to the provisions of the Customs Act, we are obliged to submit to the Tariff Board any proposal for reciprocal Tariff relations between the Commonwealth and other parts of the British Dominions. During the last few weeks we have been conducting negotiations by cable with the New Zealand Government in regard to reciprocal Tariff relations, and we have practically come toan agreement on the basis that New Zealand shall concede to the Commonwealth British preferential rates, and we shall concede to New Zealand British preferential rates. As we shall get from New Zealand a much greater advantage than New Zealand will get from us, the Commonwealth's trade with the Dominion being £2.500,000 per annum, and the Dominion's trade with us amounting to about £7,500,00 0 per annum, it is eminently desirable that at the first possible opportunity the agreement with New Zealand should be ratified. We propose in the Bill which will follow the resolution of this Committee to take power by proclamation to give New Zealand British preferential rates as soon as the agreement has been ratified. I assure the Committjee that u n t i l /We are satisfied that New Zealand will extend to us the same treatment as we are extending to it , we shall not issue that proclamation. I feel quite satisfiedt h at the projected arrangement will be entirely advantageous to the Commonwealth, and that we shall run no risk, from a Protectionist point of view, by its ratification.",87
420,Mr FENTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,New Zealand brought you to heel.,87
421,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,I regard it as the first f r u i ts of the arrangement we introduced to Parliament to permit of negotiations for reciprocal Tariff arrangements with other parts of tihe world. - Mr HAY - Will this proposed arrangement be extended to F i j i and other Dependencies ?,87

Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of the following message from the Governorabout General :In accordance with section 58 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia the Governor General returns to the House of Representatives a proposed law intituled "" An Act relating to Duties of Customs "" which has been presented to him for the King's Assent, and transmits the following amendments, which he recommends to be made in the said proposed law:Page 4, clause 12, leave out sub-clause (3). - Page 4, clause 13, leave out sub-clause (2).

The Schedule, Tariff Iti-m Ko. 27S (A ) (2 ) , leave out "" 1st October, 1922"", insert "" 31st March, 1.922."" In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message):",87
424,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.21 a.m.] The reasons for the message of His Excellency the Governor General may he set out thus: There are quite a number of deferred duties which are to come into force automatically on the 1st January, 1922. The Customs Tariff Bill provides a means whereby those duties may be further deferred. It requires that the Tariff Board shall report, and that the Minister shall act as he thinks fit upon the report of that Board. In all probability, it will be impossible for the Tariff Board to be constituted and to inquire into all these various matters before the beginning of the new year. What the Government propose to do in this connection is to further defer those deferred duties to the 31st March, in order to permit the Board to he constituted and be in a position to present its reports to the Minister, so that the latter may take action when the 31st day of March has been reached. That is the net effect of the message in regard particularly to a large number of items indicated therein. The remaining portion of the message relates to the South African Tariff. Negotiations are being conducted ""with the Government of South Africa concerning a reciprocal Tariff, and I helieve that they will be carried to a successful conclusion.",88
425,Mr JACKSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,What is the position with regard to Canada?,88

428,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,The Government ask Parliament to place them in a position where they may be able to do SO' to carry these negotiations to a successful conclusion.

429,Mr MASSYGREENE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [12.25 a.m.] (By leave)- I move That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the Iron and Steel Bounty Act 1918. The object of this amending measure is as follows:-Some time ago Parliament passed a Bill to grant a bounty on the manufacture of black sheets and galvanized-iron sheets. The measure provided that the amount of the bounty should be conditioned by the rates of freight as between Great Britain and Australia; and it further laid down that the authority to determine what those rates of freight were, at the particular time when the bounty was payable, should be the Board of Trade, in England. That Board, has informed the Commonwealth Government, by cablegram within the past few days, that it has no official information and declines to give an official opinion concerning what the rates of freight o are. Consequently, the Government have had to fall back on another authority. In this short measure the intention is to, give to the Minister for Trade and Customs power to declare what the rate of freight is, for the purposes of the Iron and Steel Bounty Act. The point will be determined probably upon the basis of what the manager of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers declares to be the rate of freight for the class of goods concerned as between England and Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented by Mr MASSYGREENE, and passed through all its stages without amendment or debate ",88

Parliament has already passed legislation for the raising of money to carry out repatriation and similar services until the 30th June next; but it is almost certain that the fund now available will have reached a very low ebb, if it has not been entirely depleted, by that time, and it is desirable that authority shall be obtained for the putting in hand of the preparations necessary for the floating of a further loan of £10,000,000, so that advantage may be taken of a favourable opportunity to borrow. It is not' proposed to use any of this money during the present financial year, nor, indeed, to float a loan during the present year; but it takes two months to prepare the organization and machinery needed for the floating of a loan, and it is desirable that the Treasurer shall be able to select the most favourable opportunity for floating it.",90

At the same time. I remember that Sir Joseph Cook told us, when . he asked for authority for the raising of the last loan, that that I hope by the time this money is spent that cirGocumstances will be so changed that we shall he able to finance our obligations to the soldiers without going on the market to borrow, because there must come an I hope, too, that there will not be as much waste of money in the f u t u r e as in the past.

440,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCOME DERIVED PARTLY FROM PERSONAL,"Cowper) [1.10 a.m.] - Like the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), I remember Sir Joseph Cook saying that the last loan raised for repatriation purposes would be the last. In my opinion, the time has come when we should provide money for repatriation by savings out of revenue, instead of borrowing it . We must, of course, fulfil our obligations to the soldiers. That a certain number of them have been assisted does not relieve us of our obligation to the rest; but a discrimination has already been made between the earlier applicants for assistance and those who are now asking for land settlement. There' is a great difference between £1,000, the amount formerly promised, and £ 6 2 5, which is now being offered. Money has been voted for repatriation in a most liberal spirit, and Parliament looks to the Government and to the M in ister for Repatriation to see that it is not wasted. During the next few months the Minister will have an opportunity of showing whether he has profited by the lessons of the past. If he does not so profit, condign punishment awaits him. - Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. RETURNED SOLDIERS WOOLLEN started COMPANY LOANBILL . Message recommending appropriation reported.

Woollen and Worsted Co-operative Manufacturing Company Limited. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Rodgers and Mr Groom. do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr Rodgers , and read a first time. I Mr Rodgers (Wannon-Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [1.15 a.m.]. - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I would point out that it is designed to enable a trul y co-operative enterprise to commence operations. The capital of the company is £100,000, divided into 5,000 shares of £20 each, and is payable in war gratuities or cash, or both. The membership of the company is confined to holders of war gratuity bonds. In the main, the shareholders will be soldiers, but the privilege also extends to the next of k in of deceased soldiers who are holders of bonds. The advances for which this Bill provides could not be made in the ordinary way under section 48 of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act, because it does not apply to a co-operative enterprise of this description. That section was framed for the purpose of enabling assistance to be given to soldiers who, with their own capital and their own labour, engage in an enterprise, and devote the' whole of their time to it . In the case of* a co-operative company of this kind, it would be impossible for all the shareholders, who number more than 1,400, to personally engage in the industry. The enterprise has been launched in Geelong, where 'the woollen industry flourishes. It is under skilful management. It s directors, with one exception, are soldiers; and there is nothing of a wild-cat nature about it . It has been by skilful business men; it has hardheaded and shrewd directors, and is supported by many whose names will be lastingly associated with the success of Go the woollen industry in the city I have named. Honourable members may rest assured that, in making these advances, we of shall not lose sight of the principle which Bill has been laid down by the Parliament loan that genuine and practical encouragement shall be given to soldiers to invest their war gratuity bonds in enterprises carried on for their own benefit. The Bill provides for the requisite security being given. The necessary safeguards will be found in the measure, and honourable members may rest assured that the Cabinet has carefully examined the company's articles of association, and has found that in all respects they conform to the requirements of the Bill .",91

I Mr Rodgers (""Wannon-Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [1.20 a.m.] During the short period that I had the personal administration of the Act, one advance was made under it . The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) brought under my notice a genuine case where nine men who had a thorough knowledge of the timber industry had combined their capital, and had secured rights in respect of certain timber areas. were desirous of obtaining an advance, and, finding that they thoroughly understood the whole business,.we made them an advance, with the result that their dustry today is flourishing.

444,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Wannon - Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [1.25 a.m.] They I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Notwithstanding the liberal provisions of the principal Act many cases of very great in - hardship and distress which do not come within its scope have been brought under the notice of the Government. Those are cases where the death or in capacity of a member of the Forces has arisen from what are popularly known as pre-existing disabilities. This amendment of the principal Act is not lightly proposed, because the experience of other countries and former yyars has shown that a pension scheme having once been framed it is most danto interfere with it . The Governcomment have been moved to take this action only .because of the distressing condition of men who served in the recent war and for whom, at the present time, no adequate provision is made. It has endeavoured so to safeguard this extension of the principal Act as to insure that those who by their own w i l f u l act, or by remissmade ness or carelessness, have contributed to he their incapacity and are not entitled to oba pension, shall not have public money in ladled out to them. I think honourable members will appreciate the object which comthe Government have in view in submitting the measure. Under it pensions will may be payable to men whose incapacity has the arisen from a latent disease or constitutional defect which did not manifest itself before they went abroad. Even in such cases a pension will not be granted unless the soldier served in camp in Australia for at least six months or embarked for active service with the Forces overseas. Some of the most painful cases which have come under the notice of the Commission and of honourable members generally are those of men who are suffering from tuberculosis. Even after the most careful medical examination it is difficult to determine whether the disease was pre-existent or arose from war service or exposure while the men were in training in camp in Australia, undergoing preparation overseas, or actually serving at the Front. wars that through which we have recently passed has been the most productive of this dire disease, owing to the prevalence of poisonous gas fumes on the battlefield. Even after the most careful examination medical officers, in many instances, have found it most difficult to determine whether the disease was latent in the in dividual at the time of enlistment or was the result of war service.",92
445,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,-Why not give men the benefit of the doubt in such cases ?,93
446,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"This Bill is intended to remedy the position in that respect. It will involve a very considerable expenditure, but the Government have determined that no consideration of pounds, shillings, and pence should come between this country and its duty to the men whose health has broken down as a result of war service. At the same time we have provided the safeguards necessary to prevent a pension being paid in any undeser* ving case.",93
447,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Hunter ) [1.30 a.m.]. - I think that all honourable members are pleased that the Government have introduced this Bill - For a considerable time past we have been asking for such a measure, because we realized how necessary it was that something should be done to place our soldiers who have become in capacitated, permanently or partially, in a much better position than that in which they find themselves under the provisions of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act in its present form. The pensions of many partially-incapacitated soldiers have been cancelled because they are deemed not to be suffering in consequence of warlike operations. I want to know whether their cases can be reviewed under this Bill.",93
448,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yes , where it has application to them.",93
449,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I want to know, further, whether the Board referred to in the Bill is to be a special Board to deal with these cases.",93
450,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"No , it is-the Board already provided for in the Act.",93
451,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is to say, the Board that is already dealing with war pensions ?",93
452,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yes , under the machinery provided by the Act ; but it has not had the benefit of the provisions set out in this Bill . Of all Mr Charlton - I am chary about giving further power to administer pensions to the Board which is already in existence.",93
453,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Especiall y if it is one of the State Boards.',93
454,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yes , if it is a State Board, I do not see in the Bill any - hope for returned soldiers. They have been given no consideration whatever by the State Board in New South Wales. the Mr Rodgers - This measure is to be a direction to the Board to grant pensions, which, under the terms of the Act, it cannot now give.",93
455,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I would rather see the administration of war pensions placed in the hands of the Department which is administering invalid and old-age pensions, because that is the only place where the soldiers can get justice. I can have no f a it h in the people who have been administering war pensions during the last fourteen months. They have done nothing but cancel pensions. I have^been asked to address a public meeting at Abermain in connection with the case of a returned soldier who is now in"" a mental asylum as the result of the cancellation of his pension on the ground that the disability for which he was drawing the pension was not the result of warlike operations. I mention this case so that the Minister may make a note of it . Other honourable members representing New South Wales constituencies will agree with me that they have not received that satisfaction and sympathetic treatment that they are entitled to receive. How many cases have they brought up in this Chamber 1 These cases have been sent by the Minister to the Board concerned for reconsideration, and in every case the Board has returned them, simply endorsing ifs former decision.",93
456,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Yes ; it is ihe same Board OctC-fa, iyiTn© Mr Charlton"" - That is so. This Bill now proposes that these State Boards shall still continue to act in the same way. There is not the slightest chance of getting any satisfaction from them. If we submit a case to the Minister he is sympathetio, and says that he will look into it, and send it on to the Board for report; but the Board simply sends it back again to him, as I have already said, in dorsing its previous decision - ""The position is not satisfactory to honourable members, nor to the soldiers, and I think it would be well for the Minister to devise some other means by which war pensions can be dealt with.",94
457,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Cowper) [1.35 a.m.] - This Bill is a good many months overdue. In fact, I think it is three years overdue, and although the hour is very late, it behoves us to see that it is the best means of carrying into effect the ideas and sentiments expressed on the floor of this Chamber for so many months past. ""We may possibly find that it does not carry into effect these ideas, and I fear that if the administrationof the measure is left in the hands of those who have been handling war pensions so far, the desire of honourable members that liberal treatment should be bestowed upon our maimed soldiers, who are in many cases in dire need, will not be carried into effect. I cordially support the proposition put forward, on the score of economy and efficiency, and also, I may add, of intelligence, that the administration and investigation of war pensions should be in the hands of the Department which has had considerable experience in dealing with invalid and old-age pensions, aud has proved itself to be quite capable of handling - the subject. There are qualifying conditions in the Bill which may defeat the object we desire. For instance, it providesNotwithstanding that the origin of the cause of the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces, who, after enlistment with those Forces, served in camp in Australia for at least six months, or embarked for active service with those Forces overseas, existed prior to his enlistment This provision does not cover a case I have in mind, that of a soldier who went into camp, and contracted cerebro-spinal meningitis within three or four weeks. He would not have contracted that disease if he had not been put into camp. At any rate, he is now suffering from post-meningitic symptoms, which cause him to have fits, and prevent l i i m from earning a proper, livelihood. Although he applied with numerous medical certificates, which I have in my possession now, to have his pension increased, and he was ordered to report in order that the Board might see whether his application should be granted, he suddenly found that the pension he Was already drawing was stopped by reason of the fact that the Act did not ""cover his case. I Jim afraid that the Bill will not cover his case either.",94
458,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I think it will be covered by section 23. Would the honourable member give the name of the soldier?,94
459,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The case has been forwarded to the Minister. The applicant has been endeavouring for eight months to have his pension reinstated.,94
460,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The Act as it stands is quite wide enough to cover the case.,94
461,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The law is there, but th© question is whether the facts can be established.",94
462,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I do not want this man to be cut out by the provisions of this Bill . It is useless to say that the Act already covers his case, when he has been deprived of a pension because of limitations imposed by it .",94
463,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is not what the Act provides; it is what the Board decides.,94
464,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In Committee, I shall ask to have the words "" substantially contributed "" modified.",94
465,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [1.40 a.m.]. - I have listened carefully to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). I cannot help feeling that there is a good deal of truth in whab they say. I mentioned the other night that, literally, thousands of soldiers had complained to ""me, and that while - quite a number of their claims had been adjusted, there were some with good cause for complaint, for whom no remedy could be found It was because of that, and as a result of the statement. I made here the other night, that this Bill has been introduced. The criticism of the measure amounts to this: Very little objection is taken to the Bill itself, which is admittedly a step in the right direction, but it is claimed that the Board is unsympathetic.",94
466,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That is so. Mr HUGHES' - The answer is that the Board is limited by the terms of the principal Act , and cannot afford to allow its sympathies to have full play. Bill will enable it tci look at cases from quite another angle.",95
467,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Is the Prime Minister aware that the Board has cancelled pensions which were given for incapacity due to war-like operations?,95
468,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Board has felt itself constrained by reason of the wording of the Act for which this Parliament is responsible, to confine pensions to cases in which it has been clearly established the injuries have arisen as a direct result of the war. However, I ask honourable members to give the Bill at r i a l. It is impossible in the limited time at our disposal to make the far-reaching amendments which honourable members propose. Let us have an opportunity of seeing whether this amendment will enable the Board to carry out its duties, and grant relief to these special cases. If it does not do so,', we can substitute another Board when the House meets again. I think that I have shown pretty clearly where my sympathies lie. there are many soldiers who will say I am the last one to bother about red tape. At the same time, I must say that the Act seems perfectly clear, and that, in the face of the specific directions given to it by the law already in force, the Medical Board has had l it t l e or no option. Now we are giving it a direction of quite another kind. If the Board does not interpret the directions in the spirit intended, and in the face of these declarations by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Rodgers) and myself, then",95
469,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If the word "" substantially "" is allowed ""to remain in paragraph A of Clause' 2 it will be interpreted against the soldiers.",95
470,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"If the Board does that, in the face of what I am saying now, it will not be there very long!",95
471,Mr MARRS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Wentworth) [1.45 a.m.]. - I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this Bill so quickly, because I think it will cover what is breaking the hearts of many ' ' diggers"" throughout Australia today. I desire, however, to cross a lance with Senator Millen, the Minister for Repatriation, in reference to one case that I have had before him for weeks, and which was brought under my notice by the Hon. W . P. Latimer, M . L . C , of Sydney. Several communications have passed from me to The him in the last ten days, and I cannot even get an acknowledgment. . The case is one of the gravest that ever came before me. It is that of one, George Rodgers, who lives in my electorate, and who received a gun-shot wound in the face at Gallipoli. That man has been refused a pension on the ground that the wound in his face, which blinded him, is not really a war in j u r y. According to the Repatriation Department the doctor who examined ' him says that he is suffering fro m tertiary symptoms of syphilis. The reply of George Rodgers is that the doctor mentioned has never seen him or examined him . One doctor, who has examined him, says that there is not a sign of syphilis in his blood. Rodgers today is lying in a hospital in Sydney, and is in a very bad way indeed. Amongst the documents I sent in to Senator Mille n was a copy of Pictorial London, containing a picture of a soldier with bandaged face leaving, I think, Buckingham Palace, and over the picture I am' sure in big black letters are the words, ' ' What our soldiers have done for us."" That man was Rodgers, but on his behalf I can get no satisfaction from the Department. No doubt this Bill will do good, and before he "" passes o u t , "" for he is very sick, it is to be hoped he will receive a pension. I am just "" fed up "" with the treatment I have received from Senator Mille n in connection with this case. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to - ' Clause 2- ' Section twenty-three of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1920 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following subsection:"" (2.) Notwithstanding that the origin of the cause of the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces, who, after enlistment with those Forces, served in camp in Australia for at least six months or embarked for active service with those Forces overseas, existed prior to his enlistment, where, in the opinion of a Board(o) the conditions of his war service substantially contributed to the death or incapacity of the member; and (6) neither the death or incapacity, nor the origin of the cause. of the death or incapacity, was due to the default or wilful act of the member, the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Act, be liable to pay to the member or his dependants, or both, as the case may be, pensions in accordance with this Act: Provided that no pension shall be payable under this sub-section except in pursuance of ' a claim made within six months after the commencement of this sub-section.""",95
472,Mr CHAELTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Hunter) ,[1.48 a.m.]. - I had intended totanove an amendment-, but I shall refrain, providing the Government will adopt the suggestion I have made, and delete the word "" substantially "" from paragraph a. If that word is allowed to remain I am sure it will be' construed against the men.",96
473,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [1.49 a.m.], - It is extremely difficult to say whether a thing contributes to bring about a certain result; and when the Courts are called upon to deal with cashes of contributory negligence they are confronted with a position that is very hard to resolve. It may be said that taking a cup of tea may contribute to a person's death, or that the abrupt entrance into a chamber set apart for ladies in a certain state may bring about a most unfortunate result. The question of whether there is homicide, and, if so, whether it be justifiable homicide, are questions that afford opportunities to lawyers of earning an honest living. But I do not feel that I should be justified altogether in deleting this word "" substantially,"" and leaving the word "" contributed.""",96
474,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,In the first d r a the Bill the word '-' substantially not used.,96
475,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,I am rather astonor ished that honourable members cannot achis cept my assurance that if the Board .not interpret this Bill in a proper we shall have to amend the Ac t by stituting some other Board.,96

480,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In regard to the medical side, I venture to say that no medical man would say that war service had contributed except it had contributed very substantially to the diseased condition. Under the circumstances, I think that, with the medical officers the Department has at its disposal, the Government will be adequately protected if the word be deleted.",96
481,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darwin) [1.55 a.m.] - I should very much like to see the word "" substantially "" deleted for the reasons that have been adduced by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and also for the reason,- that I know how the Act has been administered by the Board in the past. We know how exacting the Board is, and when any protest is made, the members of the Board say that they have to. administer the Act as they find it ; and they do so strictly.",96
482,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,The members of the Board are soldiers.,96
483,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I do not care whether they are soldiers or not ; we are legislators, and responsible for the measures we pass. I should like to mention a case I referred to before of a man at Deloraine, Tasmania, who enlisted and went into camp, where, after about iwo months, he cosatracted disease. He was, in consequence, in hospital for six months, and was given a f t of pension, which he drew for two years. "" was Seven months ago, however, that pension was cut off, because the medical Board, whatever Board it was, decided that in ju ry was not due to military service. does Thi3 man is very ill today, and much spirit, more .in need of a pension, than he was subpreviously. He cannot do a day's work, and he has a wife and family. Senator . D . Millen, the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson), and myself have been pleading witli the Commissioner for months on behalf of this man. He has to produced letters and other evidence to show that he never suffered fro m disease of any description, or was under a medical man prior to going to camp; b ut the In view of be administration of this kind, I regret that I cannot be satisfied with the Prime Minister's promise. I have been relying on this amending Bill to afford relief to this particular man, whose case is only one of many. If we wait u n t il Parliament meets again after recess, to see how this Bill operates, this man in all probability will be dead. We have waited years for this Bill , and it would be hard to have to wait for a remedy u n t i l Parliament meets again, when the matter could be arranged by striking out the weird "" substantially."" If this man served for only one month, and, as a result, he became incapacitated, he ought fo have a pension; and nothing, less will satisfy me.",96
484,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,A man gets a pension under the Act for anything but pre-existing disability.,97
485,Mr BELL,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"This man is anxious to have an opportunity to state his case, and is prepared to submit evidenoe; but he cannot get the opportunity. His illness was due to service in camp, but the authorities will not hear him on the case. Owing to the lack of sympathy, and through the exacting manner in which the A ct has been administered, I repeat that I cannot be satisfied with the Prime Minister's assurance, sympathetic though I know him to be. Something is wrong in the administration, and it is for us to find out what.",97
486,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Gwydir) [1.57 a.m.] - I shall move that the word "" substantially,"" in paragraph a, be left out. Everybody with, experience of the Board knows that it sticks within the four corners of the Act , and that it will take no notice of any promise made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), or of any discussion in Parliament^ men enlisted and went to the war they were told that a Board would interpret such an Act as this in the strictest possible manner.",97
487,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"This Board was appointed as a result of representations by the soldiers, who insisted that it should be composed of soldiers.",97
488,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,And they are now very sorry!,97
489,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The public outside are entitled to some consideration, and at least one civilian should have been on the Board. Unfortunately every A ct of Parliament prove? in practice to be different from what was intended by the Legislature. It will really be to the political advantage of the Opposition if this Board continues, because the longer it remains in existence the greater the number of votes that will be recorded against the Government at the next election. But we are actuated to move as we ar6 doing by the severity of the rulings which have been given against the soldiers by the Board. It is most obstinate in its decisions, the reasons for some of which the Lord Himself could not explain. I know of men who have been practically hunted out of the presence of the Poard for daring to apply for a pension. Some»of them have been men with whom I have worked, and I know that they never drank and that the Prime Minister's reference to certain diseases could have no application to them. Their cases are entirely deserving, and yet over and over again they have been refused a pension. I would like to see the Board abolished and the administration of the pensions handed over to the Old-age and Invalids Pension Branch. We would then get sympathetic administration of the Act, which we do not get from the returned soldiers on the Board. Unfortunately, in many cases, when a returned soldier is placed in an official position, the first thing he does is to apply the boot to his mates.",97
490,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,That is not true.,97
491,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I am justified in making that statement in view of the complaints that are made from all parts of the Commonwealth and the statements that, emanate from even the soldier members on the Government. side of the House. The time of Parliament has been occupied repeatedly with discussions regarding the inconsiderate treatment meted out to returned soldiers by this Board, When the which takes advantage of every possible loophole in the Act and the medical reports in order to evade the payment of pensions. The Government cannot shirk their responsibility by saying that the Board is to blame, because they can supplant the Board at twenty-four hours' notice.",97
492,Mr CONSIDINE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Parliamen t can dc the same to the Government, so we cannot shirk our responsibility.",97
493,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Of course, the individual members of Parliament must shoulder their responsibilities, and we shall do so when we go before the electors. If the Government allow the present conditions to continue it will be the duty of the people to see that the promises made to our soldiers when they enlisted are carried out. Those promises are not being honoured when advantage is taken of every loophole to prevent a man getting a Atkinson, L . pension. I know of some men who were Bell, G. J. navvies before the war. They were gassed Blundell, at the Front, and although outwardly Catts, J. H . they seem all right, they go to pieces when Charlton, M. they tackle heavy work. The Board says Considine, M. P. that they are one-tenth incapacitated, and Cunningham, that they can find light employment. They Hunter, J. A. J. cannot get such employment. They are Lavelle, T. J ; told to look for clerical work, but they have not the education requisite for that Bamford, F. W. work. In fact, the avenues in which Best, Sir Robert they can be employed are limited. If a Burchell, R. J. man's occupation when he enlisted was Chapman, Austin that of a general labourer, and after his Livingston, J. war service he is incapable of resuming that occupation, his disability should be liberally provided for.",97
494,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,Shoul d such a man get as much as one who lost a leg or an arm ? proposed,98
495,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"In some cases he should get more. A clerk who left arm is not incapacitated to the same extent as a labourer who has diseased lungs through being gassed. A principle of British justice is that 100 guilty men should go free rather than that one innocent man should be punished; but that principle is being reversed, and 100 de. serving men are refused a pension because one man is a malingerer. the Committee will agree to the amendment I now move, so that the Board, death which I hope will not long continue in existence, may be deprived of one of the barriers behind which it now shelters.",98

While this country was involved in the war every conceivable promise and inducement was held out to men to go away and fight. Now, however, the Government are doing all they can contrive to evade their responsibilities. It cannot be said that this Act is being sympatheticTellers: ally administered, or is giving satisfaction to returned soldiers. Every chance of cutting down pensions is being availed of. If the word ""substantially "" is left , in the proposed new sub-section under consideration it will be practically i m possible for a large number of former soldiers, who are unquestionably entitled to pensions, to obtain any measure of assistance or relief.",98
498,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"""Wannon - Assistant Minister for Repatriation) [2.19 a.m.] The Government are anxious to comply with the wishes of Parliament, especially those expressed by former soldier representatives. But to omit the word "" substantially"" would leave widely open the question concerning whether a man's war service had in any way contributed to his death or incapacity. If the word is deleted there wil l be given to the Board, which is called upon to determine very difficult matters, no for m of direction whatever. The Government are now bringing within the scope of the pensions legislation a completely new class of former soldiers; and while there are general complaints that the Board is not sympathetically administering the Act , I am bound to point out that it has had no direction from Parliament concerning how it should proceed. I say that in fairness to men who have had a very serious and extremely heavy task to perform, in respect of almost a million beneficiaries. To date nearly £24,000,000 has been distributed. That task has imposed upon the Board far more difficult obligations than honourable members realise - There is an obligation, first, to the soldier and, secondly, to the country, which has to find the money, to show that the expenditure is justifiable. If honourable members can agree to substitute something more properly applicable than the word ' ' substantially "" the Government will be prepared _ to accept it . What is required is aword, or a phrase, which will indicate the degree to which a man's war service has contributed to his disability.",99

The probable effect would be to leave the intended participant completely at the discretion of the Board. - The Government desire to do away with the position which has been created, - namely, that the Board, while being blamed all over the country, has really had no direction from the Parliament or the Government in respect of the granting of pensions. The Government have now taken responsibilityas I have just mentioned-for in cluding within the ambit of the Act , a large new bGdy of participants; and if this question is left open many of those who had enlisted in good f a it h, b.ut whose conldi'tion of health did not enable them to participate in the war, may actually be found 'to be more materially benefiting now than those who served at the front and lost limbs.

He has mentioned also the fact of the Board having been - appointed at a time when the call upon Government funds for the payment of pensions was at its height.

Mr CHAELTOISr - Le t me suggest that there are 100 men who have returned from the war. The doctors who examined them soon after they had reached Australia, certified to their incapacity, whereupon they were given pensions. - These men were unahle to do any work, even six months later. The pensions were reviewed, and the doctors who had originally examined them again overhauled the incapacitated men, and they continued to draw their pensions. At the end of twelve months, however, a Board was appointed, and immediately pensions were cancelled right and left. The Government now desire that the word "" materially "" shall be inserted in lieu of "" substantially."" I say frankly that I have no faith in this Board.

The Assistant Minister will say, as he has said all along, "" Give me specific cases and I will undertake to have inquiries made."" The Minister has been given all the particulars of many a case, and, of course, he has sent them on to those very officials who have already dealt with the cases. Naturally, their replies endorse their own attitude. There are, perhaps, twenty or thirty returned men in my own district who can do no work, or, at best, can only take light employment. There is no hope of their return to their one-time highly remunerative work of coal getting. Some are required to support a wife and several children. Their pensions have heen cut off.",100
508,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The honourable membei is not willing to take the suggestion anybody else, but wants his own way.",100
509,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,It is not fair to word say that.,100

511,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"I can quite behave to b'e accepted. lieve that. I certainly find no fault what.the Prime Minister has done or has sought to do. But here is a word, in a proposed addition to the Act, which, i remains, will permit the Board to carry on as it has done in the past. I urge that it be left out.",100
512,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Cowper) [2.30 a.m.] - It is necessary to have some qualification of the word "" contributed,"" and I suggest, and am prepared to move when the opportunity occurs, that the words, "" in a material degree "" be substituted for the word "" substantially.""",100
513,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"That would be acceptable.  [2.32 a.m.] - I do not know why the Minister objects to the omission of the word "" substantially."" If war service has contributed to a soldier's incapacity he should be eligible for a pension.",100
514,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Every soldier, other than the men to whom this Bill relates, who is eligible for a pension has been t , dealt with, and we say, in respect of the men covered by the Bill, most of whom would not have been in action, that .it must be proved that their war service substantially contributed to their condition.  tions will be referred to the Board, and it will be for it to say to what extent war services have contributed to the applicants' condition. I have a case in which a man complains of the smallness of his pension. The Board cut it down to the minimum, and said that only one-sixth of his incapacity was due to war services. If the Board can make such a nice calculation as that, it does not matter whether we have a qualification or not. The, Board has proved itself unsympathetic enough, in all conscience, and, judged by past experience of it, will not grant a pension unless war services have substantially contributed to the condition of of the applicant. The Board will deal with each application for a pension as if the "" substantially "" were in the clause.",100
515,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"You must have some word to qualify the word "" contributed,"" because otherwise, whatever the circumstances, the claim .that the war had contributed to an applicant's condition would A man might be with knocked down hy a tram and might argue that if it had not been for the war he would have got out of its way, or, if he f it were intoxicated at the time ""of the accident, he might argue that had it not been for the war he would not have been drunk.  sonally, I do not see the need for any qualification. If war services have not contributed to a man's condition he should not get a pension, but if they have contributed to i the is entitled to one.",100
516,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We are now giving a specific direction to the Board, and the result will be much more liberal treatment. (",101
517,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [2.4'0 a.m.]. - The overwhelming bulk of the men who went to the war have been repatriated or pensioned, and there is no complaint .to be urged on their behalf, though there will always be hard cases on some border line. Under the law as it stands, when a. man applies for a pension on the ground of incapacity, the Board says to him, ""Has your incapacity resulted from any occurrence while you were a member of .#the Australian Imperial Force, or from your employment in connection with naval or military preparations or operations?"" There is no difficulty where the applicant has lost a limb, or an eye, or has been wounded, but where the complaint is a break-down in health, the case is often a difficult one to deal with. Should ill-health be established, the question is, Did the conditions of the applicant's war service contribute to it? Under the Bill a period spent in a camp will be counted as war service. In any camping, rheu- matics, or some such trouble, may be picked up. Then men may have been knocked down, or have fallen from horses. Without the word "" substantial,"" the war will have to be regarded as having contributed to a man's condition, though it might be only to the smallest extent possible. It is impossible to say I became deaf, whether it was because I got wet on one particular day or on some other day; but were I among those covered by the Bill, I eould claim that my war service had contributed to my condition, and it would be impossible to gainsay me. The doctor would be compelled to give me the benefit of the doubt, and put me on a fund from which has been expended already £23,000,000. In addition, the Government has spent £89,000,000 on returned men in various ways, and has given pensions to 222,000 persons; - so that it cannot be said that our soldiers have been treated illiberally. As a private member I have done what I could for the soldiers, and I will continue to do everything I can to help them. The qualifying words suggested by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) are acceptable to the Government, and surely the honourable member, who is a doctor and was a soldier, can speak with some degree of authority in this matter. If at the end of six months the measure is not working satisfactorily, and some persons are shut out from its benefits who ought not to be excluded, I shall have it amended, or, if necessary, put another Board in place of the existing Board.  [2.45 a.m.] - I would direct tihe special attention of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) to the wording of section 23 of the principal Act, which provides for the payment of a pension to a member of the Forces whose incapacityresults or has resulted from any occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces. In my opinion, that provision is less restrictive in its character than is the clause we are now discussing, and under which it is provided that a pension shall be payable to a soldier where, in the opinion of the Board, the conditions of his war service ""substantially"" contributed to his incapacity.",101
518,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The use of the words "" any occurrence "" in section 23 of the principal Act has given rise to much difficulty.  know how difficult it has been for returned men to secure a pension because how of the wording of that provision, but I think the difficulty will be still greater under the clause we are now discussing.",101
519,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The men will not be a bit better off.  my view. There has been great difficulty in inducing the Board to take a humane view of the provision in the principal Act, and we are not going to obtain from it any greater degree Of satisfaction' as the result of the passing of this clause.",101
520,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"But this olause deals with a totally different class of cases.  appreciate the Minister's point. It applies to men who have been seeking a pension under the principal Act, and unless the word ""substantially"" be struck out it will afford them no relief. My experience of the Board satisfies me that it will make use of the woTd "" substantially"" whenever it can do so to defeat an application for a pension.",102
521,Mr MARRS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"We have the Prime Minister's promise that if this provision proves unsatisfactory he will bring in a further amending Bill.  Prime Minister has for years been making promises to our soldiers, but the trouble is that he has not the settlement of these pension claims, and that the Board, which deals with them, takes no notice of his promises.",102
522,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"The Prime Minister has agreed to accept the suggestion of - the Leader of the Country party, that the words "" contributed in a material degree "" be substituted for the word "" substantially "".  think that would be an improvement. There are a great many men who, because of the attitude taken up by the Board, are suffering an injustice, and it is our duty to see that justice is done them. In my opinion, the Board has done enough to justify its abolition, and if honourable Charlton, M . members were to vote in accordance with their experience of it, it would be immediately abolished. This is neither more hor less than camouflage. The Government have promised to give these men relief ; let us see that they get it. If we do not strike out the word "" substantially,"" any number of men will still be denied the pension to which they are properly entitled. They ought to be able to get justice without having to call in the help of a member of Parliament. I hope thai the Committee will agree to the amendment. m . HECTOR LAMOND .(Illawarra) [2.59 a.m.] - Are we to understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) is willing to accept the suggestion made by the Leader of the Cquntry party (Dr Earle Page), that the words ""contributed in a material degree "" be substituted for the word "" substantially "" ?

In Committee (Consideration resumed from 12th October, 1920, vide page 5522) : Clause 2 (Duration).",102
524,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.13 a.m.] - Honourable members will perhaps remember - that last year we passed the Judiciary Bill, dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court in connection with indictable offences under the law of the Commonwealth. The Bill now before the Committee provides the necessary machinery to enable the High Court to exercise that jurisdiction. During the war this jurisdiction was exercised under the Judiciary Act and the High Court Procedure Act 1915, but the provisions of the measures were limited to the period of the war and six months afterwards. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 (Juries in civil cases).",103
525,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Gwydir) [3.14 a.m.] - I would like to hear the opinion of honourable members upon the method of selecting juries for civil cases heard before the High Court. It is provided in the original Act that the State laws and rules applying to the selection of juries shall apply to the selection of juries for the High Court, but this has resulted in grave dissatisfaction and complications For instance, the qualification and the method of compiling the jury lists in Victoria are entirely different from those in New. South Wales. In a democratic country such as we claim to be, it is not - fit tin j* that the juries for the High should be drawn from what I may term the privileged classes of the community. The result of this practice is that the juries aTe not representative of the people of the country, and are in many cases biased against the men of the political faith of those who sit on this side of the House. The Labour party claim that in a democratic country any man who is a reputable citizen should he eligible for any position.",103
526,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,There are not many men very eager to serve on juries.,103
527,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"It is not a question of whether meu are eager to serve; a man serves because it is demanded of him as a duty to be performed in the interests of his country. It is curious to reflect that a man, while eligible to become a member of this Parliament, and make laws, may not serve on a jury in the High Court in Victoria or New South Wales. .Such a fact is a disgrace to the community - I do not speak as a legal man, but I can say that the question has been discussed for a considerable time by the Labour party, who have been watching for an opportunity to obtain an expression of opinion from this Chamber. There is a great principle involved. Men eligible to sit in Parliament are not eligible to sit on a jury, because of the reactionary legislation by ""diehard"" Legislative Qouncils, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales.",103
528,Mr JOWETT,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Where do you find anything about this in the Bill? Mr CUNiN'INGHAM - I am complaining that the Bill does not deal with the matter, and I intend to move an amendment to insure that it shall. In Brisbane the High Court juries are selected on quite a different qualification from that in Victoria or New South Wales, and are drawn from a different class. In Victoria there is a £3,000 property qualification. I may say that the late Mr Ryan was fully seized of the importance of this question, and strongly - urged that, when a Bill of the character of that before us was called on, we should take steps to move in the direction I have indicated. Honourable members will admit that in Australia, and, perhaps, in the British Empire, there was no sounder Court lawyer than Mr Ryan, and, moreover, he'was a great Democrat. His appeal'in certain litigation is sub judice, and therefore cannot be discussed; but when it has been disposed of, and opportunity offers, there may be some revelations in this Parliament in regard to the jurymen and the attitude they adopted. As a fact, we are convinced that no Labour man has a chance of justice before the High Court in Victoria, because of the way in which the juries are constituted. Apart from that, the principle adopted in the two main States is wrong, and it is that principle we are fighting, and which Mr. Ryan fought. ""He used to point out how a man is eligible to elect another man into Parliament, and to enter Parliament himself, and make laws, but, owing to the legislation of the reactionary laws in some of the States, he is not qualified to sit on a High Oourt jury . 'Such a man may, in a Supreme Court, try a man for his life, or, at the Quarter Sessions, decide a case which may mean imprisonment for years, but he is not eligible to sit on a jury of the High Court. It is, I submit, the duty of this Parliament to register its opinion on a question so important, and it should be possible for us to so legislate that the j u r y lists are prepared without any regard whatever tn a property qualification. I move That the following, words be added to the clause:-""and the jury list for all High Court cases shall be compiled from persons qualified to vote for a representative to the Commonwealth Parliament."" I think that amendment fairly covers the Lavelle, T. J. ground. It is undemocratic to say that because a man has not £3,000 worth of property he is not fit to sit on a j u r y . Bell, G. J. The very fact that a man is worth £3,000 Blundell, R. P. worth of property may only prove that Bowden, E. K. he is narrow-minded, ungenerous, and Bruce, S. M. not humanitarian. There are many Foley, people who owe their wealth to the fact Foster, Richard that all through their lives they have Francis, F. H. thought only of themselves, because, as a Greene, W. M. rule, the good-hearted man does not posHay, A. sess £3,000. I believe that the great maHiggs, W. G. jorit y of the members of this Parliament, Hughes, W. M. if they were to leave Parliament, would Hunter, not be eligible to sit on a j u r y of the High Court in Victoria, although they may have enacted the very laws which the Anstey, F. Courts are administering. I hope that Maloney, Dr the Minister (Mr Groom) will agree to Tudor, F. G. this amendment, which has been too long Mathews, J. delayed, and make whatever other alteraWest, J. E. tions in the law are necessary to carry it Mahony, W. G. into effect, so that future juries may be drawn from the great democratic section of the community.",103
529,Mr GROOM,AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [3.28 a.m.]. - I cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham). It runs counter to the whole principle on which the judicial system ihas been built up. The idea has been to provide, as far as possible, that the practices and procedure of the various States where the High Court sits shall apply. Tho honourable member is asking us to [562] override the laws of every State in Australia, and to introduce a new qualification, which will mean setting up entirely new machinery all over Australia. If ever there was duplication of machinery, and the creation of costs and difficulties, it is found in the proposal that the honourable member has submitted.

530,Mr MASSYGREENE,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.36 a.m.] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this measure is to effect two technical alterations in the Trading with the Enemy Act. It enables certain legal proceedings arising out of the winding-up of enemy companies to be completed. The necessity for this measure bas recently become apparent as the result of the decision of the High Court upon an application made by the controller of the Australian Metal Company. The question raised in the application related to the settlement out of the assets of that company of certain claims by Australian companies and the Sydney Municipal Council. The Court dismissed the application on the ground, amongst others, of the absence of procedure applicable to the winding up of the Australian Metal Company under the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914-15. This Bill makes specific provision for the making of applications to the Court by persons claiming to be creditors of an enemy company that has been ordered to be wound up, and authorizes the High Court or a Justice of that Court to hear evidence and determine the question. Under the existing law, only the Minister can move the Court, and if the action be against the Minister he has to move the Court against himself. This amendment will enable other parties than the Minister to apply to the High Court. The other amendment in the Bill enables proceedings to be taken, notwithstanding that the time limit fixed in the Statute of Limitations had! expired, by excluding from such time the period of the war.",105
531,Mr CUNNINGHAM,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"Gwydir) [3.39 a.m.]-Honourable members, particularly those of us who have always' contended that, the war being over, we should not continue to sing a ""Hymn of Hate"" against our laAe enemies, will welcome this Bill. It is another example of the charming inconsistency of the GovernBILL. ment, who, during the war and subsequently, reiterated from every platform throughout Australia that they would never again trade with our late enemies. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that he would resign from the Government if any attempt were made to resume trading with Germany. I remind him of this fact when at last he has apparently been converted to our way of thinking.",105
532,Mr WISE,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,This Bill has nothing to do with the matter to which the honourable member is referring.,105
533,Mr CUNNINGHAM,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"It has everything to do with it. We are now about to resume trading relationships with our late enemies, the Germans, who, prior to the world war, were our friends, and some of whom were relatives of the great dignitaries of the Empire. Of course, in those days, war between Germany and Great Britain was never thought of. In my opinion, the Government are acting inconsistently when, whilst prepared to trade with Germans in Germany and to purchase their goods, the result of long hours of work and low rates of pay, and produced in competition with Australian workmen, they, at the same time, are expropriating Germans in our own territories. Make no mistake, the Germans will recapture the markets of Australia with their cheap products, to the detriment of our own people, and we are driving Germans out of British territory to Germany, where they will work in competition with our artisans. I particularly refer to the German nationals that we are expropriating from the former German Possessions in the Pacific. _ We 3hall trade with those people when they have returned to Germany, and buy their goods which are produced in competition with our own people.",105
534,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,This Bill has no more to do with what the honourable member is speaking of than it has to do with Noah in the Ark.,105
535,Mr CUNNINGHAM,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"Is the Prime Minister sure that Noah ever came out of the Ark? I appeal to the Government to do a fair thing by men, whether the product of their labour comes from Rabaul or Germany.",105
536,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"I ask your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, as to whether the matter which the honourable member is discussing is relevant to the question before the Chair.",105
537,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY," I have given the Bill as much consideration as is possible within the short time at my disposal, and I rule that the honourable member, will not be in order in discussing on this Bill the whole subject of trading with our late enemies. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed 1 through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. PATENTS BILL. Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr GROOM) read a first time. Standing Orders suspended. SECOND READING.",106
538,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"Darling Downs-Minister for ""Works and Railways) [3.46 a.m.]. - I move That this Bill bs now read a second time. Its main object is to bring the patents law of the Commonwealth into line with English law, so far as regards the duration of the original term of a patent and the extension of the term. At the present time the term of a patent is limited to fourteen years from its date. The Bill proposes to increase the original term to sixteen years. At the same time, provision will be made to reduce the period for which the term of a .patent may be extended to five years, or, in exceptional cases, ten years, instead of seven and fourteen years respectively. Thus a patentee in ordinary cases will be eligible to have the full benefit of his patent for twenty-one years,' as at present. The reduction of two years in the period of extension in exceptional cases is proposed for the reason that the period of ten years is considered quite sufficient in view particularly of the number of petitions made for extension. The number of petitions made for extension since the commencement of the 1903 Act is seven. The original term of existing patents will be extended to sixteen years, subject to the condition that any licences granted by the patentees will be extended for a like period. As regards the extension of the term of a patent, under the existing law the Court, in considering its decision, is required to have regard to the nature and merits of the invention in relation to the public, and to the profits [562]-- 2 made by the patentee as such, and to all the circumstances of the case. During the war, nowover, some patentees were, account of the existence of hostilities, prevented from successfully exploiting their inventions, and consequently suffered loss or damage. The Bill makes special provision for those cases, and proposes to enable a patentee who has so suffered loss or damage, including loss of opportunity of dealing in or developing his invention owing to his having been engaged in work of national importance connected with the hostilities, to make application to a Judge in chambers for an extension of the term of his patent. In such a case it will only be necessary for the patentee to satisfy the Court that the loss or damage suffered by him warrants an extension. This privilege, however, is not proposed ta be granted to patentees who are subjects of a country with-which Great B r it a in was at war, or which are companies carried on for the benefit of such subjects. Under the existing Act a petition for extension of the term of a patent must he made art least six months before the original term lapses, and there is no provision for the extension of the time for presenting the petition. The B i ll proposes to give power to the Court to extend the time whether the proceedings are by petition or originating summons. In connection with rights of priority of patentees under international arrangements, the Bill proposes to extend the protection, at present afforded to the patentee only, to the legal representative or assignee of the patentee, Provision is also included to validate the Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs Regulations 1920 (Statutory Rules 1920, No. 61), which relate to the revival of patents and the like, which lapsed during the war, and to extend the Act to New Guinea. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 5 agreed to. Clause 6The Patents, Trade Marks, and Designs Regulations 1920, being Statutory Rules 1920, No. 61, shall be deemed to be as valid and effectual as if they were enacted in this Act.",106
539,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"Illawarra) [3.53 a.m.] - I wish to know whether the provisions of this clause will prevent the printing, over a design or trade mark, of. another, design. Oases have come under my notice in which manufacturers in the Commonwealth have placed upon their goods a name or design to indicate their grade and quality. These goods are placed on the wholesale market. Sometimes a retailer who purchases them places oyer the original design or trade mark his own trade name or some other design which obliterates the registered design by which the goods are known. I understand that there is no provision under the laws of the Commonwealth, which constitutes this practice an offence. If the regulations mentioned in this clause cover the situation, well and good; but if not, 1 desire to move an amendment which will effect that purpose.",106
540,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITHTHE ENEMY,"I think the matter is one which should be dealt with under the Trade Marks Act. In any case, I shall undertake to have inquiries made; and, if there is no existing provision calculated to discourage this improper practice, I will introduce the necessary measure at our next sittings.
