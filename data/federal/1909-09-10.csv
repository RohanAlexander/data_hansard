1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is stated in this morning's newspapers that the Premier of New South VVales, replying last night to a question by a member of the Legislative Assembly of that State, .said that by the agreement between the Premiers and the Prime Minister, 25s. per capita is guaranteed to the States for all time; that even after the debts had been transferred to the Commonwealth, and the whole of the interest and principal paid off, the States would still be entitled to that contribution. Does the Prime Minister endorse that view ?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I have read the reports in both newspapers, and do not place upon them the interpretation of the honourable member. The Premier of New South Wales questioned in relation to a reported utterance of mine, for which there is no warrant, replied that when the debts had been taken over by the Commonwealth, the contribution of 25s. per head would be applied under the Constitution to the payment of interest, and would therefore not be paid directly to the States. The telegraphed report is abbreviated, but I do not remember any statement as to what will happen when the debts have been entirely paid off.",14
3,Mr FISHER,Unknown,May I ask the honourable member to read ihe latter part of this paragraph in the Argus of this morning ?,14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The passage which my honourable friend asks me to read is thisMr Wade said he was perfectly sure that there was no intention, and it could not be so construed, that if the debts were eventually taken over, and were extinguished, when the extinction took place and the obligation on the State to pay interest ceased, the States' right to still enjoy contribution from the Commonwealth would also cease. He was perfectly sure it could not be so.",14
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That it would not cease, but would continue.",14
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That might depend upon who paid the debts, and when.",14
7,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,This is an argument.,14
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,If honourable members do not desire an answer,14
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out lo the Prime Minister that I scarcely think that an answer is now being given, but that the matter is being debated. It would be well for the honourable member for Wide Bav to repeat his question.",14
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall be gbid to do so. I ask the Prime Minister whether he endorses the statement of the Premier of New South Wales that, after the State debts had been transferred to the Commonwealth, and under its management interest and principal had been paid off, the States would still be entitled to an annual contribution of 25s. per head of the population ?",14
11,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,"In the first place, what the States will be entitled to will always depend entirelyon the determination of the people of the Commonwealth. What is meant by the debts of the States: the liabilities incurred up to date, or debts yet to be incurred ? Is it meant that the States will have contributed to the repayment of the principal, or that the 'Commonwealth, will have discharged both interest and principal ? No one can tell from this bald report of the Premier's utterance, telegraphed from Sydney, based on a similar report of what I may have said, telegraphed from Melbourne. The position under the agreement is perfectly plain. It is provided that 25s. per head of population shall be credited to the States, and that when Iheir debts are transferred to the Commonwealth, the money shall be applied to the payment of the interest upon them. If honourable members wish to regard a future time, when the population will have so increased, without a proportionate increase in the debts, that this payment will have satisfied both interest and principal- I would not like to say how far ahead that must be-the y are then met with the difficulty that it is not known whether this newspaper reference is to future debts as well. The relation between the Commonwealth and the States",14
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister is now going beyond an answer to the question.,14
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"We propose a Council of Finance, a permanent body, to deal with the present and future debts and their repayment, subject to conditions laid down by Parliament. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - Is there any contract or implied undertaking on the part of the Commonwealth to contribute towards a sinking fund? If not, is it likely that this question will arise during the present century ?",14
14,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There are no implied obligations in the agreement, and there is in it no direct obligation on the Commonwealth to contribute towards any sinking fund. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If we created a sinking fund and liquidated the existing debts, would any part of the 25s. be credited to it?",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The control of future debts will depend upon the policy adopted by this Parliament after it has received the report of the Royal Commission. If no alteration were made in the present arrangement, the 25s. could be credited against any debts.",15
16,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,If we took over the whole of the debts,15
17,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Is it in order for honourable members to ask a series of questions, practically amounting to a dialogue, in anticipation of the discussion of an Order of the Day?",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Debat e on a subject set down for discussion is not allowed, but questions asked to elicit information regarding such a subject are allowed.",15
19,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"If the Commonwealth takes over the debts now accumulated, and, by the establishment of a sinking fund, extinguishes them, will 25s. per head still be payable to the States under the proposed agreement?",15
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I presume that the honourable member has in mind a sinking fund established by the Commonwealth, though he did not say whether it would be established by using the 25s.",15
21,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,No matter how it is established.,15
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is the whole tion, point. If the 25s. contribution to the States, after meeting all interest, is paid into a sinking fund to liquidate their debts, and accomplishes that object, the mere fact that it has done so will not terminate the agreement. But the latter terminable by the people at any time, and DEAKINU certain to be readjusted in the far distant future into which we are now endeavAct ouring to look. The mere fact that the contribution of 25s. per head created a sinking fund, and extinguished both interest and principal, would not affect the obligathis tion under the agreement to continue payment to the States unless and until that was amended. MILITARY AEROPLANES. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In yesterday's Age, HenMartin, of Germany, is reported to have said that ten years hence that country will have 1,000 dirigible balloons and 10,000 aeroplanes, which will be armed with torpedoes, and, in the event of war, will imperil the British fleet and facilitate the invasion of England. In the face of this declaration from such a fighting nation as Germany, is it worthwhile to continue spending money on fleets, instead of constructing aeroplanes?",15
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member should address his question to the German Admiralty, and suggest the discontinuance of the building of vessels of the Dreadnought type. In the next place, I believe, from the multiplicity of the suggestions that are now"" reaching the Commonwealth Defence Department, we shall be able to match the Germans in any particular. PAPERS.

NA (FINANCE) BILL. Debate resumed from 9th September is (vide page 3304), on motion by Mr. That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to finance.",15
26,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney) [10.47]. - The Prime Minister has exhibited to us morning another phase of this questhat tion, displaying quite accidentally the amazing fertility of resource of the representatives of the Commonwealth at the Conference, and the inexcusable neglect of its interests in the recent agreement. I shall speak of that neglect in due course, but it appears to me to be necessary to emphasize now the fact that it is deliberately proposed to enter into an agreement from which the Government of the Commonwealth can never extricate itself, and that, no matter what may be the outcome of the recommendations of the Council of Finance, no matter whether we pay off that proportion of the State debts, the annual interest on which would be met by the payment of 25s. per head of the population, that payment is to continue for all time. The Prime Minister dealt most exhaustively and thoroughly with this question on Wednesday evening, but I venture to say that during the whole of his speech he did not succeed in convincing any one either of the expediency or wisdom of his action. One is indeed amazed by a comparison of his former declarations with his present attitude. I do not wish to refer to the dim and distant past, when the honourable gentleman posed as the champion of the Commonwealth, but to that comparatively recent day when he laid upon the table of the House a memorandum of the policy cf the Government which was divided into three parts-in that respect typical of the Ministry itself. One part was labelled "" Finance,"" and in it we have the statement thatFinance is every year a vital question, but it is no exaggeration to say that the obligations of the next eighteen months render it at present more important than at any period since Federation. The proposal there hinted at wasA temporary arrangement for a term of years, to replace the existing distribution in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for submission. If that statement means anything it means that the intention of the Government when the memorandum was laid on the table was to propose that we should continue for a term of years the Braddon blot in a modified form. The memorandum was presented early in June, but from that time until the Conference met no scheme had been put forward; none had been conceived. The Prime Minister admitted the other evening that he had no conception of the obligations of the States when he entered the Conference, and that their requirements proved to be such as to fill him with the most profound amazement. As a set off, however, he found that the States had not the slightest conception of the obligations of the Commonwealth. When they saw the balance-sheet presented by the Treasurer they realized that they could not receive or expect to receive from the Commonwealth as much as they had hoped, whilst he on his part realized that we could not withhold as much as we desired. This is all very interesting, but an honourable member who has been so long in the public life cf the Commonwealth, and yet calmly admits going into that Conference without knowing the financial circumstances of every State, must have neglected utterly the duty cast upon him by virtue of his office. There is no circumstance in the financial position of the States or Commonwealth of which he ought not to have informed himself-n o contingency with which he ought not to have been thoroughly conversant. The honourable gentleman asks the House to affirm agreements that have been arrived at with the State Premiers, the central idea of which is a permanent arrangement, to be embodied in the Constitution, providing for an annual payment from the Commonwealth to the States of 25s. per head of their population, with a special provision in favour of Western Australia. To that arrangement there are two objections, both of which, I think, are fatal. One is that the payment is too high, and the other 'is that the arrangement itself is to be permanent. I take it that the first objection must always be fatal in relation to a division of money. When a man proposes to work for another, the question as to whether he shall receive wages is one concerning which there is no dispute. The whole point involved is what wages he shall receive. And so when an article is to be sold, the question at issue is not whether it shall be sold, but. whether it shall be sold at a certain priceIn the same way when there is to be a division of money, the question is not whether there is to be a division, but what the division shall be. When, therefore, it is proposed that we shall pay to the States 25s. per head of their population per annum, the question is not whether we shall pay something, but whether we shall pay that amount. To propose not only that the payment shall be made, but that the agreement shall be as permanent as human beings can make it ih a Democratic country-and far more permanent than it ought to be made in a Democratic country-is to reach the very climax of inexpediency and unwisdom. From the inception of the Commonwealth the Prime Minister has declared himself to be a champion of national as opposed to provincial rights; but it has been reserved to him to make an alliance with an honourable gentleman whose boast it has always been that he opposes nationalism and upholds provincialism. The Minister of Defence a day or two after he had been called, for some mysterious reason, and by some inscrutable means, to his present office, declared, in the new Masonic Hall, Sydney, that he was glad to. say he was a State Rights man. We see clearly enough in this agreement his handiwork. We find on it his thumb-prints.",15
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What did I say?,17
28,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleman declared in the new Masonic Hall, Sydney, that he was an advocate of State Rights, and was proud to be recognised as such.",17
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is that all I said?,17
30,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; but since the honourable member has the honourable member for Corio at his back, I am not going to quote all that he said, for it would take too long.",17
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's statement is an entire misrepresentation.,17
32,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not.,17
33,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister Qf Defence must withdraw the remark that the statement made by the honourable member for West Sydney is a misrepresentation.,17
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will, sir, if it be out of order; but I think, sir, I am entitled to say that it entirely misrepresents me.",17
35,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Since the honourable member has questioned my statement, I repeat that not only in the new Masonic Hall, Sydney, but constantly in this House and elsewhere, he has gone out of his way to declare himself a champion of State Rights. It is no misrepresentation to say that. Indeed, it is a gross misrepresentation of fact to say the opposite.",17
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is ..the honourable member opposed to State Rights?,17
37,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am opposed to the monstrous position taken up under the guise of the championship of State Rights, by which the honourable member and his friends really mean vested interests. Who are behind the State Rights party? Is there one relic of Toryism-on e relic of the Black Labour party-the wreckage of which the Prime Minister spoke last yearwho is not a State Rights man to the very backbone? I well remember when the Age declared that the division on the Surplus Revenue Bill in this House separated into two camps, in the one those who were in favour of a national policy, in the other, those' reactionaries who cling to a provincial policy. Every honourable member, except the honourable member for Dalley and the honourable member for Wimmera-al l who now sit on that side of the House, and who were not members of the Prime Minister's former party-vote d against the Surplus Revenue Bill. The honourable member for Parramatta has always been the Leader of that Party, and he is the one in whom the Conservatives of the country, who now call themselves the State Rights men, place implicit and blind trust as their champion. The honourable member has succeeded in diverting the steps of the Prime Minister from the plain broad path along which he was marching into a tortuous and rocky road ending in a culde-sac, and affording no prospects for national progress. What are the circumstances surrounding the agreement? Any one can understand why the French, after the confusion and rout of their forces at the fall of Sedan, agreed to the treaty with Bismarck, or why a rat in a trap will agree to any condition in order to escape. But the Commonwealth had at its command the entire situation, and was in a position to dictate reasonable terms, and have those terms accepted by the States. At its back was and is the great overwhelming majority of the people, who, as the Prime Minister said the other night, are the least likely to overlook State Rights, seeing that every one of them is a citizen of the States. When it comes to the rights of the States, no one is more jealous than the men who send us here; and not one of us would be within these walls if we had dared to oppose true State Rights in any serious particular. Does the Prime Minister think for a moment that he, or any one of us, would have been returned to-injure their true interests by the electors of the Commonwealth, who are, as he told us, also electors of the States? Does he think that the people would send me here-the same electors who send representatives to the State Parliament-if , in any vital particular. I was opposed to the interests of the people of New South Wales? After ten years of a burden, which, as time went on, became almost intolerable, does any one think the Commonwealth is justified in neglecting an opportunity to come into its heritage? Are we justified in approving an agreement, which, in all essentials, binds the Commonwealth for all time in fetters not less intolerable and vexatious than those of the Braddon section itself ? Comparing the Braddon section with the proposed agreement, it has to be said that the former, unwise, illogical, and unscientific as it was, at any rate was agreed to by men who, in some sense of the word, were admittedly placed in a difficult position. I do not believe that the position was really difficult ; but the consummation of Federation depended on assent by the smaller States, which did not regard their financial position as assured without some such proviso. The section was introduced into the Constitution without any clear conception of its effects; but, after nine years' experience, can any one say that, if it were submitted to the people, they would reaffirm it? Never ! Yet, after nine years' experience, the Prime Minister calmly asks the House to make permanent a provision' which, in all essentials, so far as principle is concerned, is not less obnoxious or less harmful to the interests of true national Government in this country. Let us see, first of all, what the position is in regard to the amount. It is proposed to hand over 25s. per head to the States; and that, roughly speaking, divides the revenue of £10,600,000 into half, giving some £5,000,000 to the States, and a similar amount to the Commonwealth. In the year 1910-11, according to the tables prepared by the Treasurer, it is proposed to hand to the States £5,668,000, which, on the revenue I have mentioned, would leave us with £5,000,000; and I venture to say, on the statement by the Treasurer, that that will be insufficient to meet our present obligations. When I speak of ""our present obligations,"" I do not refer only to those obligations set forth in the Budget, but also to those which have been deliberately invited by the Government, and which the country realizes will have to be met- I mean the obligations connected with defence, and others hardly less important, to which we are irrevocably committed. The Government have deliberately involved us in an additional expenditure of £2,000,000, in connection with the provision of a Dreadnought or its equivalent. Defence generally, according to the Minister in charge of trie Department, is to cost this country at least another 5s. per head. I estimate that the extra taxation to place defence on a sound footing will be, at least, £1,000,000 per annum, in addition to the expenditure proposed in [120]. the Budget, for some years at any rate; and this means very little less than 5s. per head per annum. This expenditure will have to be met. There is an indication, as shown in the cables recently, of a proposal to borrow a sum of money for defence purposes, the sinking fund and interest of which would amount to £500,000 per annum. I sincerely trust that this House will never assent to such an unwise and suicidal method of financing the defences of this country. No country which makes any pretence to wise administration of its financial affairs has ever resorted to such means for defending itself-a n actual state of war alone justifies such a step. But if we do borrow, and* have to find £500,000 per annum, we must get the money from somewhere, and the payment of 25s. per head will leave us without sufficient means of doing so. But there are several other proposals of great importance which involve additional expenditure : The Northern Territory, the administration of which at present involves a loss of about £200,000 per annum. The construction of a transcontinental railway, which will cost anything up to £5,000,000, the interest on which will mean, even in the early stages, £50,000, and, when the whole of the money has been expended, five times that amount. We should also, have to spend money 'in developing the Territory, and, for a littlewhile at any rate, we shall have to make up the loss on the working of the railway. Either this Order of the Day is on the notice-paper for show purposes or it is there for a definite purpose; and, if it is there for the purpose of taking over the Northern Territory and developing this Eldorado",17
38,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is not a road there yet!,18
39,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not yet. If we are to develop this Territory, the riches of which are fabulous, or would be so regarded in any other country in the world but this-if we are going to avail ourselves of an opportunity almost unique in the history of a young nation, to people, develop, and defend this country-w e shall have to spend money - Then, of course, there is the Western Australian transcontinental railway and the Federal Capital. I emphatically protest against the statement of the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth is free to impose both direct and indirect taxation. The honourable gentleman knows very well that, with the cohorts behind him, direct taxation in this House is impossible, and that there is a deliberate intention on the part of those creased 'Customs taxation. men, whose handiwork in this agreement is too clearly seen, to impose revenue taxes the people. It is by means of duties on tea, kerosene, and sugar that the deficit to be made up-screwed out of 'the very life blood of the people of the country. That is the ideal of finance and taxation the honourable member for Parramatta. He advocates direct taxation on the land, question to be remitted to a State Parliathe ment, where there is a. Legislative Council, the members of which would die on the floor rather than accept such a policy-an Assembly where there is an obedient obligations majority behind M.r. Wade, who would indirect taxation. never agree to it, or, if they did, would agree, to it in such an emasculated form as would bring land value taxation into contempt. The Minister of Defence knows that it is perfectly safe to say that he is in favour of direct taxation by the States, and of placing the Commonwealth in such a position that it must have more revenue, when he knows that the people whom he speaks-the party of vested inteamount. rests whose mouthpiece he is-intend to tax tea, kerosene, sugar, and other necessaries of life. It is just as well that the people of the country and honourable memleaves bers should be reminded of the taxaing tion to which we already submit. ters, The Age, in a very excellent leader pubnow lished on the 8th of this month, gave a of the Customs and Excise taxation per head of the chief countries of the world. It showed that in Germany - a country which, if any country has, has adopted Protection deliberately, and derived a fit from it, a country whose population jjone ahead with most amazing strides-the revenue from Customs and Excise is 15s. per head. That of Australia is £2 ios. 8d., or over three times as much. The United States, a country which is should never enter. avowedly and deliberately protective, rives a revenue of £1 9s. 6d. per head from Customs and Excise, while in the United Kingdom, which deliberately poses Customs and Excise taxes for the pose of deriving revenue, and draws 67 per cent, of the whole of its receipts from that source, the amount is jQz us. 5d. per head. In Canada, the country which is most like ours, the amount is £2 2s. nd., which less by 5s. than has been derived by lowest tariff imposed in this country since Mr Hughes. inception of the Commonwealth, and 8s, less than under the present Tariff. Clearly, therefore, there is no room here for inIn fact, the very reverse is the case. Surely the people on of this country have a right to expect that the burden of government shall be shared is equally-that the additional' burdens shall not be piled only upon them-and yet this agreement is so cunningly devised that it is of upon the people that the burden must be placed. A sound principle to go upon would the have been to leave to the one authority raising of practically all direct taxation, while leaving the other to get the whole of its revenue by indirect taxation. The Commonwealth could havefinancedits almost, if not entirely, out of",18
40,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about defence expenditure ? The wealthy ought to pav for that.,19
41,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that thai is an exception. The practical answer to my honourable friend is that the Labour party proposed to impose i i tax upon the unimproved value of land, which, I think, would have given us, together with the whole of the of Customs and Excise revenue, a sufficient If we keep from the States an amount of revenue sufficient to enable us to pay our way, it throws upon them the onus of getting revenue by direct taxation. It them the disagreeable duty of impostaxation upon their friends and supporthat is to say, upon those men who regard the States as the citadel and table hope of Conservatism and reaction. Truly times have changed. I remember how the honourable member for Parkes, who sits peacefully now on the back Ministerial bench, went about the country eight or benenine years ago, clothed with the mantle of has Elisha, and delivered himself of prophesies. One of them was the promise of a 2d. glorious political mansion, inside which the hob-nailed boots of a party ignorant alike of sociology, history, and economics, That mansion has debeen erected, but inside its sacred walls the honourable gentleman sees, to his eternal discomfiture, the hob-nailed boots of that imparty making themselves more and more purprominent. Now, therefore, the hcnorable gentleman and his friends have transferred their wavering allegiance to the State Parliaments. They heard the trumpets, and saw the advancing phalanx-the cohorts of the is Labour party-in the State Parliaments, the and they thought, "" We must be up and the doing. We must erect a place where these pestiferous persons cannot come."" They erected it, and behold, in the very holy of holies, we came, we saw, and we conquered !",19
42,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We see through the conspiracy for unification.*,20
43,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleber man, in regard to his Federal sentiments, occupies a very curious, and rather enterbe taining, position. The things he said favour of Federation would move any one to tears. The hopes he entertained, as contrasted with the Dead Sea fruit has since been gathered, would complete the process, and any one who could refrain from shedding tears at the great that he has done, and the very little that he has received in return for it, would indeed have a heart of stone. I am not a unificationist at all ; I never was. at the same time. I never have been, and never shall be, a supporter of that which, under the guise of State Rights, is deliberately intended to put back the hands of the clock of reform. The people of country are determined that the wealthier classes shall pay their fair share of taxation, and wriggle about as that party may, first to one side and then to the other, Federaldurate ists at one moment and State Righters at trouble. another, the people, who the Prime ter said the other evening are the people, whether acting as electors of States or of the Commonwealth, have awakened, and no effort of the honourable member, or of any other like him, can pull enough wool in front of their eyes to blind them to the true facts of the case. I speaking, before being interrupted, of the requirements of the Commonwealth. that the Northern Territory would involve us m an additional annual expenditure of anything up to £500,000; that there is now an annual loss of £200,000, sion and if the transcontinental railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek is conrunning structed, allowing for the loss on working in the earlier years, for interest and ing fund, and for money expended in desubject velopment-becaus e we must spend money in developing that country-ther e will necessitated an additional expenditure of anything up to half-a - million pounds per will be observed. annum. Even putting the loss at £300,000, which is very much less than sufficient, still that money will have to found. There is also the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, which we must assume that the right honourable the Treasurer desirous of carrying out, and which will [120]- 2 volve us in a sum very little less. At least £50,000 a year will be required for the Federal Capital for the next ten years. The High Commissioner Bill is on the notice paper, and is, apparently, so urgent that the other evening the first honourable memwho desired to say one word against it was promptly gagged. It , therefore, must a very urgent measure indeed, and that in also will mean an expenditure of another £20,000 a year. Now it is obvious, I venture to say, that under the 25s. per head which arrangement we can do none of those things. The very most that we can give to the States at the present time, and pay deal our way, is £ 1 per head. The Prime Minister said the revenue would increase, but how any man in his position could make such a statement. I fail utterly to underBut stand. I confess I have a sneaking sympathy with the honourable member's difficause culty in wandering about the maze of figures in which he finds himself, no doubt"", continually at a disadvantage. Figures are this very awkward things. To an expert they may be most plastic, and, in his hands, can be made to prove anything, but to a gentleman like the Prime Minister they are obbeasts and a source of continuous They can never be relied Minisupon, and compilations carefully made same for him have to be handed in at the . the tail-end of his speech, because he has entirely overlooked the fact of their existence, or the place in which they should go. But we had a right to expect that he should look at the circumstances of the was case. The revenue will never become any larger per head, unless he proposes to imI said pose more taxation. Honourable members interjecting,",20
44,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On a previous occaI drew attention to the undesirableness, and, in fact, the disorderliness, of comments upon an honourable member's speech while it is being delivered, and sinkI trust that honourable members will not the Chair to the imputation of differentiating between honourable members by be allowing similar comments to be made now. I hope, therefore, that the rule laid down",20
45,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Customs revenues of countries are subject to well-known and be long-established laws. One of these is that the amount derivable from' revenue duties depends upon the spending power of the is people. The spending power of the people inper head in this connection is not likely to increase. We are a prosperous country, and although we shall be possibly more prosperous, when ampler opportunities are afforded to the people of getting a fair share of their earnings, of going upon the land, and of producing more wealth, yet for all that, their spending power will be spread over other articles and over those not imported, but manufactured - within the country. The revenue derived from duties on articles which are so made must necessarily tend todecrease. I am not, and never have been, a Protectionist, but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that, since the imposition of the Tariff, manufactures have increased in New South Wales to a notable extent. When in England I visited a verylarge establishment whose proprietor told me that, whereas formerly he had been exporting to. this country annually £50,000 worth of women's underclothing, he now exported practically nothing. One has only to study the records of the Statistician to see that the tendency is for more and more of our own requirements to be made here. Consequently, the Customs revenue must decrease. It would be inexplicable if the Prime Minister, who for years has been the tireless advocate of Protection, should forget the purposes for which the Tariff was imposed, and be unaware of the circumstances which I have mentioned. The object of protective duties is to encourage and stimulate industries, at the expense of importations, and, consequently, of the Customs revenue.

47,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not regret what I have done. Under the circumstances my action was not merely excusable, but praiseworthy. Since there was to be a Tariff, it was better to frame it for the encouragement of manufacture than to screwmoney out of the people, and enable the rich to evade their just responsibilites. The Prime Minister tells us that he anticipates that the revenue will increase per head of population, a statement which can only be interpreted to mean that we are to have revenue duties. We shall know in the future what "" State Rights "" mean. The people should be told every day and every hour, until the election comes, that it is behind this mask that Conservatism and vested interests hide. What State Right is threatened by any action of this Parliament? Do we propose to deprive any man of his liberty, or to take a penny from his pocket? No. The Prime Minister himself exposed the fallacy of the assertion that State Rights are in danger when he said that all taxation comes out of the one pocket. The only question is whether the taxpayer will pay his money to Peter or to Paul. The people can bring to a proper sense of responsibility both the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments, and if either endeavours to take away their privileges, or to tax them unnecessarily or unwisely, that will be done. The Prime Minister'showed the hollowness of his case when he spoke of the division of interests between Commonwealth and States, which if we were other than one people would have led to war or arbitration. What he meant, if he meant anything, was that there are conflicting interests. It is quite true that in some respects the interests of the Commonwealth and the States are not identical. For eight years the Prime Minister has been pointing to the path which the Commonwealth should follow. He has advocated the building of a glorious edifice of national life, provision for national defence, development of the country, and the abolition of provincialism. But now he is endeavouring to switch the Commonwealth car off the main line on to a side track, whence it may well plunge into a ravine. This morning's Age shows clearly why the Commonwealth and the States have not the same interests. Every one knows that they are composed of the same people. But the interests of the man who pays rent are not identical with those of the man who 3 receives it. Nor are those of the man who borrows a sovereign identical with those of him who lends it. The interests of the States as such consist in side-tracking, delaying, and hampering the Commonwealth in every conceivable way; the interests of the Commonwealth as such consist in laying a sure and lasting foundation for the future of this great nation. The Age properly points out that the States have their watchdogs of Toryism, their Legislative Councils; men who represent nothing but their own interest, in some cases nominated, and, in others, elected upon a restricted franchise. In South Australia there have been several battles on the question whether the people or vested interests shall rule, and times out of number the people have been defeated and compelled to accept a compromise. In this Parliament alone the people rule without let or hindrance, and it is against this great Democratic body that the State Rights party is arrayed. There is in this House a fair representation of the will of the people as recorded at the ballot-box, and in the other Chamber a representation of the States as entities. Either the Senate is superfluous and unnecessary, or it is clothed with sufficient powers to safeguard every State right. We were told when the Constitution was being discussed that the Senate was required to protect State Rights, and on that ground we adopted the undemocratic arrangement whereby Tasmania, with a population of 180,000, receives the same representation as New South Wales, with a population of 1,600,000. There are more people in my own constituency than there are in the whole of Tasmania.",21

I fail to see what connection that has with the question immediately before the Chair. . Mr HUGHES - I am merely following the example, good or bad, set by the Prime Minister. I am endeavouring to show that the question of State Rights, about which we have heard so much, gave rise to the Conference and to the agreement now sought to be forced upon us. I am showing at the same time that the Constitution provides for the Senate as the guardian of the rights of the States.",22
58,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I interrupted the honourable member when he was proceeding to discuss the advisableness of equal representation in the Senate.

59,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the Constitution Bill was before the people, we heard as a justification for the proposal that there should be equal representation of the States in the Senate, that it was necessary, owing to the fear that the rights of the States would not otherwise be safeguarded. We know that the preservation of State Rights is provided for in the Constitution, and I call upon the Government to declare whether they have lost faith in that part of the Constitution which provides for the States as such, and if I ' m blest ! so, they have to take the only course open to them. The Prime Minister has become a strong advocate of the principle of the referendum. He and his party say to us : ""You will commit yourselves to nothing by passing this Bill. Let the people say whether or not they will accept the agreement."" I reply : ""Ask the people, too, whether they believe any longer in equal representation in the Senate."" The honorthink, Mr able and democratic member for Parramatta",22

61,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not regard that statement as offensive, nor do I think that anv honourable member would.",22
62,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that it was very questionable taste on my part to make such a statement concerning the Minister of Defence. What I was about to say was that honourable members who profess to believe in Democratic principles, and at the same time cast reflections upon a Parliament which faithfull y represents the opinions pf the people, if any Parliament does, accuse Democracy itself of being able to manage its own affairs. In this Parliament the people speak without let hindrance, and, therefore, I do not hesitate to emphasize the point that the State Rights party is simply a body of men banded tomust gether in the only citadel left to them prevent an equitable and proper adjustpeople ment of the burden of government on the shoulders of the rich. Many years ago the Minister of Defence expressed the opinion that land values and land ship were legalized theft, but today, with a pathetic devotion which is most touchpoint ing, he stands within the citadel, and is the chosen champion of "" legalized theft,"" hoping to be amply rewarded, no doubt, by his friends. In a table proreceive vided for us by the honourable gallant and learned Treasurer, who, for some inscrutable reason, insists upon placing his full title on every paper that he submits to us, is shown that in 1920 the population of the Commonwealth will be 5,238,000 As a matter of fact, it will not. That estimate is ljased upon the increase of lation, being at the rate of 1.49 per cent.; immigrants. but, as a matter of fact, the increase today is at the rate of 1.88, so that our population at that rate will be, not 5,238,000, but 5,380,000. But, if the crease be on the basis of that of New South Wales at the present time, namely, 2.77, then our population in 1920 will 5,934, >0oo and consequently Ave shall have to pay on that basis. The Prime Minister deliberately put forward this agreement on Wednesday evening as ing an inducement to the States to courage immigration. For every additional person they can bring to our shores they will receive from the Commonwealth 25s. per annum. The Commonwealth Government say that as soon as the Commissioner Bill is passed they to carry on a systematic campaign advertising the resources of the country, and to endeavour to attract more people to Australia. In the circumstances, thereexpenditure fore, it is no exaggeration to say that, fore long, the present .rate of increase New South Wales will, in all probability, be general throughout Australia, and that our population in 1920 will be nearly 6,000,000. Now it costs the 'Commononce wealth more to govern every person, pay the States 25s. per head, than every person returns in revenue to it. year the Customs and Excise revenue amounted to £2 ios. 8d. per head of Mr Hughes. unpopulation, but the average has been about £ 2 6s. per head. If we return to the or States 25s. per head of their population, and it takes over 25s. per head to govern the Commonwealth, it is very clear that we lose on every additional person that to comes to the Commonwealth. The more the States gain, the more revenue they will receive from us, and the greater a must be the loss to the Commonwealth.",22
63,Mr HUTCHISON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This agreement isownerreally an immigration bonus.,23
64,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Undoubtedly . That was emphasized by the Prime Minister, who urged that, as the result of the agreement, more people would come to Australia, and that, consequently, we should .more revenue. It is true that we shall, but we shall not get more revenue per head of the population. The class of immigrants coming here is a class that settles it in our towns. I am told-and this is a point on which we ought to have an answer - that the Victorian Railways Department makes it a practice, in taking on casual populabourers, to give a preference to new-chum",23
65,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-The same thing is in 1920 being done in New South Wales.,23
66,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The reason is perinfectly clear. The Department desires to obtain on its books a large number of persons, so that it may be able to pick and be choose, and may never be at a loss for labour. Another reason is that it is desired to afford every immigrant a chance of sharing the wage fund, ^which is already betoo low for those here. ' The immigrants encoming here today under existing circumstances are a class of men who merely share what is already here. In 1920, instead of giving the States £6,622,500, as estimated in one of the tables presented High by the Treasurer, we shall give them propose £7,500,000, and the Commonwealth of revenue will not have increased proportionately. Every year we shall be worse off. Every year our obligations and will be increasing, while this befetter will be perpetual. The Leader of in the Opposition last night pointed out that some modification of Mr Harper's scheme seemed a logical, scientific, and sensible way of adjusting the - finances, severing and for all the dependence of the and Commonwealth on the States. It is an undignified position for the national GoLast vernment to depend on the States. It is not a dependency on the people of the States, the because the State and the Commonwealth people are the same, but it is a dependency on the States, who must be paid the 25s. per head even if our revenue falls to ,£9,000,000 or £8,000,000. No matter what thefluctuationsof the revenue may be, we have to provide a perpetual payment, like an annuity, in regard to which we take all the risks and responsibilities, while the States have all the advantages. The Prime Minister said that the payment would be a sufficient one to enable us to take over £160,000,000 of State debts; and I then thought that what he meant was that, if we took the debts over under a recommendation of the Council of Finance, we should, when we had taken them over, arid had liquidated them by payments to a sinking fund over a long term of years, be better off. But the Prime-Minister tells us that, after paying all the debts off, owing to oui being able to float loans at a lower price, we shall still have to pay the 25s. per head-for ever and ever. A more monstrous ot more idiotic proposal"" has never been put forward. The Age, to which I turn with the devotion of a needle to the magnetic pole, says on this matter :Nothing that the Ministry has ever done, or could have, done, is so much abhorred as this anti-Nationalist agreement with the States, in which the latter have succeeded in ensnaring the Ministry into giving a deadly blow to Commonwealth prestige. . . . It may be, of course, that such Ministerial pressure will be put upon some of these Ministerial supporters as will compel them to choose between smashing up the "" Fusion"" Government or voting for a thing which they utterly disapprove of. If it be true, ns is alleged, that Ministers have resolved to make the acceptance of that agreement a party question, on which the Ministerial l i fe is to depend, it evinces a tyrannical pressure which is contrary to the natural freedom of a free man in Parliament, ancl as such it ought to be resisted at any hazard of party complications - by every man who has the spirit of sel'f-respect, and who feels fidelity to his own principles to be a more sacred thing than tlae ties which can bind him to any set of Ministers. Before taking such a step as Ministers took at that secret caucus of the enemies of Federation, they owed a duty to their supporters. They had no more constitutional right to bind Parliament than they had to tear up the Constitution Act itself. We may still hope that the matter will not be treated as a strict party one. I ask the Government whether they propose to make this ai party question or not. If they do, then all discussion is wasted ; there ought not to be one hour allowed to elapse before the honourable gentleman, who has been selected for the honourable duty, should be asked to move the "" gag."" Let us come to a decision-let the Government put its cohorts into force. Protests from that side are only hot air, unless they are tq be backed by a vote. Jf honourable members are to protest and then fall obediently into line, it is a humiliation and degradation that this Parliament might well be spared. Under the circumstances, we ought to be told, and we have a right to demand, from the Prime Minister, whether this is to be a party question or not; and, for my part, I insist, on an answer now. Does the Prime Minister propose to allow his followers to have a free hand ? If he does, then no time need be wasted, and the division could be taken tomorrow-onl y the result will be the exact opposite of that which the honourable gentleman anticipates, for there is in this Parliament a majority who will never vote for the agreement if it is allowed to vote as it pleases. There is, however, an unhappy band of men, whose fortunes are allied to those of the Ministry, and who, though opposed to the agreement, will be compelled to vote for it. The Commonwealth will then have sunk and degraded to the levelof merely recording the decrees and determinations arrived at in secret caucus by a body of men whom the Constitution does not recognise, who have no authority or mandate from the people, and who hold office by the slenderest of tenures. One of the Premiers today is fighting for his political life, and, I venture to hope, will lose it ; while another Premier holds office with a majority of one. An epidemic may at any moment reduce any of them to disaster-choler a morbus may put them all out. The Ministry have come to an agreement with the Premiers, and they force it on their followers. To what contemptible depths are they being dragged? The honourable member for Robertson has a superior smile, but will he not yield ? The honourable member knows very well that, when the whip is cracked, he will fall in and record his vote for the agreement. On his life, he dare not do otherwise. The honourable member for Maribyrnong will, when the whip is cracked, vote for an agreement which will kill new Protection utterly-whic h will also kill the old Protection for ever and ever. This agreement is a deliberate handing over of every power and function of the Parliament of which we have proudly boasted, into the hands of the State Rights party, who are the party opposed to every principle to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has' always avowedly owed allegiance. Is this to be made a party question? If not, let us waste no time, but make short speeches the order of the day. Let every man record his senthey timents and vote; and we shall see on the Ministerial side a miserable, puny, ragged band of men united by some ties, the nature of which they dare not disclose, and serted by every man in the chamber who is free to follow .the dictates of his own that mean? conscience. But if , on the other hand, parly whip is cracked, we shall see a jority, composed of unfortunate and degenevoice rate men, who would rather betray the Comment monwealth and sell the people than stand up for their own principles. Now, let say something about the proposal to make this agreement a permanent feature, of the Constitution. I have shown that the amount is insufficient, and that the circuman stances which led up to the agreement such as to make it an insult and a degradashould tion to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister proposes that the payment to the States shall be made permanent. How can any Democrat make this infamous attempt-for an infamous attempt it is-to fetter posterity? The history of all gressive nations shows conclusively futile, or how dangerous when not are the attempts of one generation to deterpeople, mine the course of another. The TJnited States attempted to do that, and did and paid the penalty in the bloodiest war of modern times. And that country now on the eve of another upheaval the result of which, whether it finds expression in a war in the ordinary sense, or in some wild social cataclysm, we cannot foretell; but, as surely as the rule of the dead hand endeavours to prevent the American people ridding themselves of the incubus of trusts and wealth, so surely will there be a disturbnot ance the like of which the world never We have a Constitution, which, happily for us, is only a feeble imitation of the TJnited States Constitution. But yet our Consticlare tution is one which hampers Democracy every turn-is opposed to the basic prinplace? ciple of Democracy. It sets at nought rule by majority. It is a compromise, an unhappy compromise. When we regard it as the last word of wisdom of men we were taught to look upon as the greatest ber say that statesmen of our time, when w e con- ; sider that this is their supreme effort to enable Democracy to achieve a nagag tional existence, we can only say that time, and a very little time, has proved them to have been lacking in every essential of true statesmanship. We see Mr Hughes. clearly enough that in the finance sections committed the most egregious and inexcusable blunders, and, in other parts of the Constitution, blunders not less deplorable. Before the Constitution can debe amended, there must be a majority in a majority of the States. What does It means that Tasmania, the which, under the agreement, will derive maconsiderable benefit, will have the same in declaring whether the agreeshall be repudiated or removed, as a State fifteen times its strength in point of me numbers. We have a perfect right to expect the Government of the Commonwealth to faithfully reflect the opinions of the people; and when the electors consider that amendment of the financial relations bewere tween the Commonwealth and the States take place, they ought to be in a position to see that it does take place. The Prime Minister told us that it is necessary Why? to amend the Constitution because a Statute cannot bind a succeeding Parliament. That is perfectly true; but I venture to say prothat any Parliament would honourably how observe a Statute of a previous Parfutile, liament unless a mandate of the expressed in an unmistakable way, authorized it to do otherwise. We do it; not realise in this country yet, the extent to which we have fettered Democracy. is The first Constitution in the world, the British, is not written, and sets no limits to the powers of the people. I do not know whether honourable members appreciate the extent to which the British Parliament is sovereign. When I heard the Frime Minister say that the States would have no guarantee that we should not repudiate the agreement, I do know whether he remembered the saw. powers of the British Parliament. Do honourable members realise that the British Parliament could within twenty-four hours dethat King Edward was no longer at King, and put plain John Smith in his Do they realise that if necessary every article of the Act of Union between and England and Scotland could be repudiated tomorrow if the British Parliament liked? whom Mr CROUCH - Does the honourable mem",23

Let me read what Dicey has to say on this question, so that honourable members may realise the difference between the powers of Parliament and its actions. My point is that it would be perfectly safe to embody any agreement in a Statute, and that every Parliament would honourably observe its terms until such time as the people gave an unmistakable mandate to the contrarv. The Acts referred to by Dicey on page 63 are the Acts of Union with Scotland and Ireland, which were, if any Acts could be, deliberate agreements between parties having most divergent interests. The union has been observed ever since, seeing that England, Scotland, and Ireland are now under the Crown, and the treaties which were embodied in those Acts were intended to bind future Parliaments, although they never did. cannot prove his statement about the abolition of the mon arch v.",26
72,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is out of order. He has been repeatedly called to order, and I ask him now to observe the direction of the Chair. Otherwise a further step must be taken. Mr HUGHES' - I wish to show how safe it is to allowa Parliament to rely upon a Statute which embodies an agreement, and to prove that in cases which embodied agreements and treaties infinitely more important than this, the result, after a hundred years' experience and more, has been that no accusation of breach of faith has been made. Dicey says :Of statutes intended to arrest the possible course of future legislation, the most noteworthy are the Acts which embody the treaties of Union mark. with Scotland and Ireland. The legislators who passed these Acts assuredly intended to give to certain portions of them more than the ordinary effect of statutes. Vet the history of legislation in respect of these very Acts affords the strongest proof of the futility inherent in every attempt of one sovereign legislature to restrain the action of another equally sovereign body. It is shown that in several important particulars those Acts have been amended after a lapse of time, but only with the approval, and very much to the advantage, of T all parties concerned. Here is a passage, on page 64, that will apply particularly to usOne Act, indeed, of the British Parliament might, looked at in the light of history, claim a peculiar sanctity. It is certainly an enactment of which the terms, we may safely predict, will never be repealed and the spirit will never be violated. This Act is the Taxation of Colonies Act 1778. It provides that Parliament "" will not impose any duty, tax, or assessment whatever, payable in any of his Majesty's colonies, provinces, and plantations in North America or the West Indies; except only such duties as it may be expedient to impose for the regulation of commerce; the net produce of such duties to be always paid and applied to and for the use of the colony."" From the time that Act was passed until now no attempt has been made by the British Parliament to infringe it, but it is competent for that Parliament tomorrow to impose a tax upon every person in Australia, Canada, or the West Indies. Of course, no Parliament would do it, but it shows that the check that would prevent this Parliament, for instance, from going back upon the Premiers' agreement, would be that if the people outside were opposed to such a course.Parliament would not dare to take it. We clearly reflect the opinions of the people. Parliament is a .reflex of the people outside; members at each election represent the opinions of the electors, and endeavour, as far as they are able, to give effect to them. The things that the British Parliament might do, and does not do, are staggering. Dicey says, on page 76Parliament might legally establish an Episcopal Church in Scotland; Parliament might legally tax the Colonies; Parliament might without any breach of law change the succession to the throne or abolish the monarchy; but every one knows that in the present state of the world the British Parliament will do none of these things.",26
73,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member does not pretend that Dicey knows more about it than the honourable member for Corio?,26
74,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order ! The honourable member for Gwydir has just said that an honourable member of this House is an imbecile. I ask him to withdraw that re,26
75,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did nothing of the kind. Mr SPEAKER* - I trust the honourable member will not put me in the position of having to prove what he did say. I heard him distinctly use the word, and I ask him to withdraw it.",27
76,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not use the word in the sense that you mentioned.,27
77,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not aware in what sense the honourable member used it, but I ask him to withdraw it, as it should not be applied! in this Chamber to any honourable member.",27
78,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I withdraw the statement, but I am very sorry I have to do it.",27
79,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The British Parliament might do any of those things, but does not do them, because, as Dicey points out, there is an internal and external limit to all powers. Those limits are very real and effective. The external limit is determined by the character of the person or body to be affected by the acts of the Parliament, and to whom Parliament is responsible. The other is the nature of Parliament itself. Persons elected to Parliament are necessarily subject to their environment. They have been before the people, have laid their views before them, and realise that they should represent them. It is, therefore, in the last degree improbable that the Commonwealth Parliament would repeal an agreement arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth until such time as the majority of the people throughout Australia wanted it repealed. And will any man say that when the people of the country want it repealed, it ought not to be repealed? No one dare say or ought to say so. Therefore, this infamous attempt to fasten this fetter upon our limbs for all time is inexcusable. oppose this agreement. It appears to have been conceived under most extraordinary circumstances, which can only be explained by the sinister relations that now exist between the so-called State Rights party ancl the Fusion Government, whereby nationalism has been deliberately sacrificed on the altars of provincialism. When I say "" provincialism,"" I do not refer to the opinion that the States ought not to be shorn of their powers. I mean by "" provincialism "" that settled body of opinion which aims at ing the growing determination of the Commonwealth to tax the wealthier classes. That, and that alone, is the thing by which we are faced. There is a very proper room for difference of opinion as to how far the Commonwealth powers should go. I can conceive of an elector asking himself whether a power should be exercised by the Commonwealth or by a State, and considering the matter in a way which, would in no narrow sense be provincial. But a deliberate attempt is being made to fetter the Commonwealth, to prevent us from giving effect to the new Protection, and from fulfilling the fiscal destinies of the country. Rightly or wrongly, we have adopted a protective policy. The champions of Free Trade are, one after another, abandoning even the pretence of opposing Protection, and seek now merely the imposition of revenue duties. So long as the honourable member for Parramatta is in power we shall not have direct taxation. In the Parliament of Victoria, it has been proposed-it may be the mere rattling of a pea in the colander-to tax wealth and monopoly. But here taxes upon tea, sugar and kerosene threaten us. I oppose the proposed agreement because I consider the contribution per head too high. I think that £ i per head is as much as we could give. I oppose it because it is to be permanent, and because of its underlying recognition of our dependence upon the States. I oppose it because, as the Age points out this morning, the powers arrayed in opposition to us have set their face like steel against the new Protection, Wages Boards, and liberal Factory Acts. The honourable member for Parramatta saysnot only that he is "" as good as a Labour man,"" but that he is better, and to show that he is so he sits on the same seat as the ex-president of the Employers' Federation. To show how closely he is allied with Democracy, he sits cheek by jowl with those I whose every attempt has been to choke it.. I see no excuse for making the contribution to the States permanent. We have now the opportunity, for which we have long been sighing, to break free from the constitutional fetters, and acquire control of our revenue. As for putting this question to the people by referendum, I ask the Prime Minister if he will give the people the opportunity to deal by referendum with other questions ? Is he prepared to ask them, not to only accept or reject this agreement,, but whether they will accept 25s.. check- or £ 1 a head, or allow the Commonwealth to take control of the whole of the debts, the States paying each year sufficient to make up the shortage between the interest due and the Commonwealth revenue available for the purpose of paying it ? If not, of what value is his talk about the referendum? The press of this - country, with few exceptions, will counsel the people to accept the agreement, and they will sign their death warrant without knowing it. Nine out of ten of those who voted for the draft Constitution thought that they were voting for the abolition of State Parliaments. Were it before them today, they would spit upon the provisions relating to equal representation and finance. They see now that Democracy is hampered in every direction, and needs an opportunity to freely' express itself. I shall never assent to a snatter going before the people unless they are able to do more than follow the advice of the press. They may act foolishly at times, but they rapidly recover their senses. If this agreement is ratified, a year hence the people will wake up to the fact that they have made a mistake, and that not a little one. I hope that the public will not be gulled by the specious talk about a referendum, and the furious desire expressed by the Prime Minister to put the matter before the constituencies. Of the three points to be considered, the first is whether the method of distribution is desirable. I have nothing to. say against a fer capita distribution, just as I would have nothing to say should a man with whom I was in partnership propose to divide the funds of the concern between us. But I should ask, "" How much am I going to get?"" As to the Council of Finance, it must either be a fraud and a sham, and proposed only as a placard, or it must be absolutely destructive of the agreement. TJnder the agreement, we shall not have enough money to take over the debts of the States, and to take over oniy half of them would not do good, but harm, because there would be a Commonwealth stock competing with State stocks. The advantage to be gained by the transfer of the debts is in allowing one Commonwealth stock to be substituted for the State stocks. To make the agreement permanent would be .an outrage to which, I hope, Parliament will not agree. I hope that even the most abject of the Ministerialists will make some sort of protest against this. Let the matter be treated as a non-party question, andlet the people demand that honourable members shall express themselves regarding it without fear or favour. The Ministry will then be left with but a scattered remnant of its followers, who will cling to it either for something they hope to get, or because their position is so desperate that they dare not emerge from its cover.",27

I agree with that observation. This is one of the most important questions with which a Parliament has to deal, and we should approach it as calmly and judicially' as possible. I do not agree with the honourable gentleman that this is not a critical time in the history of the Commonwealth. It is absolutely necessary to effect an amicable settlement of the financial question. This question was one of the most troublesome when the Constitution was being framed, and since Federation, has occupied the attention of six or more Premiers' Conferences, and has always been treated in this Parliament as of the gravest importance. Unless it is settled now, there cannot be harmony in the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Therefore the situation is critical. If we do not settle the matter now amicably, on a basis satisfactory to the Commonwealth and to the States, we shall not have anything approaching true Federation for many years to come. Friction will result. If the people are losing faith in Federation now, they will do so more rapidly in the future.",28
81,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are not losing faith in Federation.,28
82,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some honourable members have declared that the people, if they had the chance, would reject the Constitution.",28
83,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They desire unification.,28
84,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If something is not done for the settlement of the financial question, and the Parliament seizes upon the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, we shall practically have unification. But, however beneficial that might bethough personally I regard Federation as preferable-it should be brought about by means which are fair and above board. If we desire unification we should go out to the people and advise them to accept it, and so bring it about by constitutional methods. Even if such - a system were better than Federation, we certainly ought not to attempt in an indirect way to break down the Constitution in order to introduce it. To return to the main question, I would remind honourable members that the members of the Federal Convention, and more particularly those who were regarded as financial authorities, were extremely anxious that a settlement should be arrived at whereby the future financial stability of the States would be safeguarded. Even such an ardent Federationist as the late Mr Kingston strongly held the view that such a settlement should if possible be devised. That was the view he took at the Melbourne sittings of the Convention. The Convention recognised that there were two parties to be considered, and that the Commonwealth would take over one of the chief sources of revenue which the States possessed. It did not know what results the adoption of a uniform tr.riff would produce. It had no data to go upon, but it was felt that the situation demanded the greatest care, and that the utmost forethought was necessary to insure the solvency of the States and the Commonwealth. So critical did the situation become in regard to the question of finance, that the Conventions were almost being dissolved without any definite result. A compromise, however, in the shape of the Braddon section, was ultimately arrived at. It was determined that that provision should remain in existence for ten years, and it was hoped that during that period data would be forthcoming which would enable a more satisfactory settlement of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth to be made. All this goes to show that the Convention never lost sight of the fact that there were two legislative authorities, each possessing moral claims to fair treatment. Why honourable members should overlook that fact, I fail to understand. If we desire to view this question fairly and impartially, we must give full weight to what was the evident intention of the Convention. No lessan authority than the Age also took up the position at that time that it was absolutely necessary to safeguard thefinancialstability of the States. On 17th January, 1899, the Age, discussing the information published, that the right honourable member for East Sydney had formally invited the Premier of Queensland to join the Federal Convention, said :One of the amendments of the New South Wales Parliament is a repeal of the Braddon blot. Everybody is quite agreeable to see the clause struck out, because it is admittedly a very cumbreus and unworkable one. But there is just as great a consensus of that the reasons which induced the Convention Mr Atkinson. to insert the Braddon clause still render some substitute for it necessary. The point may be stated almost in a sentence. The Colonies, under the Bill , give up in Customs duties their mainstay in revenue. They must have the money back in a practically undiminished form, or local financial chaos would ensue. The Braddon clause compelled the Federal Treasurer to return to the Colonies £ 3 out of every £ 4 raised in Federal revenue. This was the only guarantee which the provincial Treasurers would have concerning the sources of their own revenue. The provision was about as clumsy as can be imagined, but the guarantee contained in it, such as it is, must be maintained in some better shape, or else the Federal Constitution would leave the Colonies mere helpless hangers-on of the Federation, dependent on the nation month by month for their solvency. Such a situation would be a blow at ""State Rights"" more staggering than anything suggested in any other quarter.",28
85,Dr WILSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was that statement published by the Age?,29
86,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was published by the Age at a time when its true mind, so to speak, on this question could be correctly gauged. It agreed with the view I have just expressed. It rightly pointed out that the States depended largely for their revenue upon Customs and Excise, and that the Commonwealth, in 'taking over that source of income, must give, some guarantee for their future solvency. That is what we are asking for in this agreement, and I may say at once that I regard the agreement as a fair one. In another article dealing with the Convention Bill as adopted by the Premiers' Conference, the Age, on 4th February, 1899, made the following statement :The retention of the Braddon clause is clearly the result of this feeling, for they confess they only retained it because, after giving full consideration to the objections that have been urged against it, they could find nothing better to put in its place, unless the whole financial question is reopened and a fresh start made with it. If the Federation-at-any-price party had been given their way it would have been simply dropped altogether, and the Treasurers of the various States would have been left at the mercy of a dominant Assembly over which they had no control for their revenue. The hysterical cry of the Trust-the-Federal-Parliament has, fortunately, been shrieked into the ears of the Conference in vain. These are telling quotations, and go to the root of the matter. Another reason why the financial question should be settled now, and settled upon a fair basis, is to be found in what may be described as the history of Federal expenditure. The statistics show that the Federal expenditure in 1901. which covered really only a six months' opinion period, amounted to £1,296,0 -53. In 1901-2 it was £3,932,746, and it increased year by year, until in 1907-8 it had reached the large sum of £6,162,129. Budget statement last month, the Treasurer estimated that the expenditure for the curlish rent year would be well over £7,000,000. Surely, if we think that the States have right to participate in the receipts from Customs and Excise, it is time that we be that, gan to place them on a sound and definite footing. Year by year, we are dipping more and more into the fund from which the States are supposed to obtain a large proportion of their revenue, and we have reached a point in our history when the Federation must take the responsibility of financing its own projects. When the monwealth was established, no one imagined that by 1910 the Federal expenditure would have reached its present mous proportions. The position from the point of view of the States each comes more critical. We have many large projects in front of us, and it is unreasonI able to assume that they can be financed out of revenue. If they are to be underfor taken, we must look them fairly and reproductive squarely in the face. Instead of taking out of revenue for these projects, year after vear, a few hundreds of thousands of pounds-sum s which may not seem large compared with the great undertakings that we have in view, but mean a great deal, some of the smaller States-w e should pare to finance our own projects, and to take the responsibility for them. Treasurer must look at this matter and tell the House what his borrowing policy is going to be. We have doubtedly reached the time .when such policy must be initiated.",29
87,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,30
88,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was saying that, in my opinion, the time has come for Commonwealth to inaugurate a loan policy - that a Commonwealth like this should prepared to finance its own projects, not, year by year, dip into the surplus that is returnable to the States. We have large undertakings looming in near future, including important railway construction, the taking over of the Northern Territory, and the Federal Capiand, tal, and so forth, and some of these works are of a permanent character. The only fund contributions necessary. feasible method is to borrow; and, i we go about the matter in a busithe nesslike way, the borrowing will not be a matter of much concern, seeing that we shall have good assets. I is time the Treasurer took a stand, in order In his to show the States that he means to do his duty to them; and this would tend to estabthat confidence which the Federal Parliament ought to command. I hope, of a course, that in any borrowing the Treasurer will exercise business caution; and if there be works urgently necessary in the Post and Telegraph Department, and £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 is required for them, he will see that the loan is short-dated, with a good sinking fund, so that the indebtedness may be cleared off, at any rate, within the' life of the works.",30
89,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have been talking of Comsinking funds for half a century !,30
90,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have' not as yet 'borrowed as a Commonwealth, and we enorhave plenty of time before us.",30
91,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are sinking funds year beestablished in one State.,30
92,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Sinkin g funds have, believe, been established in Western Australia. In the case of a great railway, instance, especially if it is to be of a character, there is no need for a sinking fund, or, at any rate, the annual contributions may be very small and spread over many years. In fifty years' time the railways in some of the States will be of infinitely greater value than they are to to day ; and, in fact, there is hardly a more prestriking fact in colonial history than the magnificent results of the policy of borrowThe ing. Some thirty or forty years ago fairly, our borrowings were small, but we have since borrowed with much greater unfreedom, and the amount borrowed, a as compared with our assets and the progress we have made, show that good business qualities have been exercised in this regard. No doubt, in some of the States, and my own especially, there arc the ""white elephants,"" and log-rolling may have been frequent; but, as a whole, the be results of our borrowing are highly creditand able. Has the time come when the borrowing policy should be nipped in the bud, and Australia cease to develop her great the resources? It would appear that we were becoming a little afraid of our future; but surely our resources will bear inspection, if judiciously developed, will provide handsomely all the interest and sinking At any f rate, I hope the Treasurer will show that Federation is prepared to finance its own projects, and so avoid throwing the onus of raising additional taxation on the t State Treasurers. As to the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, I find that this year there is a deficiency over £1,800,000. Against that we have in the trust fund for old-age pensions over £600,000, leaving .a net deficiency of £1,200,000. This deficiency, we are told, is greatly due to the fact that we have to pay old-age pensions; and, seeing that the States are practically giving £600,000 under the agreement towards that expenditure",30
93,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And are being relieved of a liability of £900,000 !",31
94,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , but after this year the States will practically give up more than the equivalent in the amount they are receiving under the present system. However, I do not wish to press the point, but merely say that, seeing that this Parliament imposed the necessity for the payment of old-age pensions, the States are doing as much js can be expected of them. Old-age pensions are intimately connected, not only with the agreement, but with the whole scheme of finance. It is over twelve months since the Old-age Pensions Act was passed, and we immediately started a trust fund, which', as I say, now amounts to over £600,000. If it has taken us so long to collect £600,000, and we have to pay annually at least £1,500,000, old-age pensions will undoubtedly tax the financial ability of the Treasurer of the day. While I agree with the principle of old-age pensions, and hold that we ought to see there is no privation on the part of the man who has worked hard, and, perhaps, reared a creditable family, while, owing to one circumstance or another, he has been unable to lay something by for his old age, the fact remains that the Commonwealth has to raise a certain amount of money. Old-age pensions are established in nearly all civilized countries; and I am glad to say that our scheme stands well to the front for liberality. But we must sooner or later follow the example of other communities, and call on the people to make some contribution towards a special fund. In Germany there is a system which is much belauded, and which, so far as one can judge from reading, is giving great satisfaction. There the object is to encourage thrift; and the people are divided into various classes, and called upon to contribute, according to ability, towards an insurance fund. The German Government pav a subsidy of £ 2 ios. for each person entitled, and the other contributions to the fund are divided between employer and of employee, the former being allowed to deduct the necessary amount from wages. Under our Act we could not have such a scheme, because we have decided to pay pensions of ios. a week, without calling for any contribution, but it seems to me that some step must be taken in that direction. I suggest that every member of the community should be called upon to contribute according to ability, and only those who, under our present system-, are entitled to pensions should receive tfiem. It is only fair that society should levy from those who can afford to pay it a contribution for the assistance of those who cannot maintain themselves in their old age. If we had such a scheme-and it is not so visionary or impracticable as might be thought from a superficial view-it would be very easy to collect the money, particularly in the cities. Every head of a factory could pay the contributions that would be levied upon his employees, and, at the end of certain periods, he could deduct the amounts from their wages. We should all pay our fair share towards the fund, and no very large subsidy would be required from the Federal Parliament to make up the amount required to pay the pensions of those entitled under the Act. Such a system would be beneficial, because it would encourage thrift. It would be an antidote to the defect in the present scheme, which means the sapping of self reliance in the people, and, when the person entitled to a pension came to draw it, there would be attached to it none of the stigma attaching to a charitable dole. It would be to every man the reward of his own thrift, and he would feel that he was entitled to it. It would also bring home the fact that each and all of us ought to be prepared to provide for the needy. It would give the people generally an idea of what taxation was; whereas, as things are now, some people pay very little taxation, take no interest in affairs of State, and have no knowledge of how government is conducted. If a scheme of that sort turned their minds to those subjects, I am sure that great benefit would ensue. We could issue stamps, so that when a man paid his contribution he would get a receipt stamp affixed to his book, and, unless he could show that, or was good on the books, a pension need not be granted to him. If I were framing a scheme of that sort, I should provide for exemption certificates for persons who were so poor that they could not contribute, who, if otherwise entitled when they reached the age, should certainly be entitled 'to receive a pension. Both that subject and the matter cf borrowing might well be recommended to the attention of the Treasurer at this period of our history. The question of insuring against unemployment is a kindred idea to the one which I have just been elaborating. I am sure it is feasible, and I believe a practicable scheme that will meet the difficulty could soon be evolved. I come now a little more directly to the agreement which is before the House. I am glad to see that in the first clause it is set out that the agreement is to fulfil the intention of the Constitution by providing for the consolidation and transfer of State debts; and, in order to insure the most .profitable management of future loans, for the establishment of one Australian stock. I am pleased to know that the parties to the agreement have thrown their minds back to the time when Federation was inaugurated, and endeavoured to place before the country a scheme based on the true intentions with which the States entered into Federation. According to the second clause, the arrangement is that j£i 5s. per annum per head of the population, according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, shall be paid to the States by the Commonwealth. In that the Commonwealth wisely does not limit itself to Customs and Excise revenue. All it has to do is to provide for the States j£i 5s. per head of the population. That, of course, is to be a first charge upon the revenues of the Commonwealth, but is not limited to Customs and Excise. I wish to direct the attention of honourable members to several passages in a speech delivered by the late Mr Kingston, at the Melbourne Federal Convention, in 1898. On page 863 of volume 1 of the Debates, he is reported to have said I am one of those who in all things necessary are prepared to trust to the uttermost the Federal Parliament, but I have some little doubt as to whether the amount of confidence which we are asked to repose in the Federal Parliament in this matter is necessary in the national interest. I am sure of this, that it is altogether against the provincial interests that it should be so reposed if it is not necessary, and for reason : It makes the financial condition of the provinces absolutely depend on the' good-will of the Federal Parliament, and that means the good-will of the Federal Treasurer. It places the question of the solvency or insolvency of the States absolutely at the mercy of the Federal Parliament. On page 866 of the same volume, these words are recordedI do not know that any Federal Executive should, for all time, be placed in the position of having the power to decide on the solvency or insolvency of the States. Having this surplus of four 01 five million pounds, increasing in the natural order of things, for distribution amongst the States at their own will, and subject to no restriction, I am almost inclined to think that it would be better to provide that at some period, at the least, a fer capita distribution should be insisted on. Those remarks, uttered by Mr Kingston at the proper time from which to gauge the intention of the framers of the Constitution, are worthy of the most careful consideration by the House. If we are to take an impartial view of this question-and the Leader of the Labour party has invited us to regard it as a non-party questionwe cannot pass those sentences by without due respect.",31
95,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No nationalist objects-, to a per capita basis.",32
96,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then I should likefo know what the honourable member does object to in this agreement.,32
97,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The permanency.,32
98,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In the'very debate from which I have quoted the late Mr. Kingston was very clear upon the point that there ought to be a permanent protection for the States. He recognised that they were parties to the whole Federal bargain.,32
99,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He spoke on that occasion in the pre-Federation days.,32
100,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It was when the delegates to the Convention met to frame the Constitution- a time that should be regarded as very vital in our consideration of this question if we are to do it justice. I do not think that' anybody can object to the amount which the Government propose to return to the States per capita as too much. If the States could only have agreed to some definite per capita basis, as they did at Hobart last year, they would, two or three years ago. have received a very much larger per capita return from the Commonwealth than they are now able to secure. Some years ago, in some articles in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, T think, speaking from memory, it was worked* this out that the States ought to receive about£ 2 per head, and Mr Johnston, the Tasmanian Statistician, also put the amount much above 25s. I am positive that if the ritates could have agreed amongst themselves two or three years ago, and settled. the matter there and then with the Federal authorities, they would have received a larger amount than they are now prepared to take. I do not think that 25s. per head is enough to give the States. I should like to see the amount higher, because the Federation could stand it. If , for ample, it were 5s. higher, it would mean giving back to the States, roughly, £1,000,000 more. Seeing that we are about to be committed to the expenditure of millions, and are going in for a loan policy, what is a million in that matter to us? But a million spread over the services of the States might keep the ledger straight in some of the small States. If the States suffer, the Federation suffers. It is the same people that are being dealt with, and it is to our interests to maintain the solvency of the States. Honourable members ought to study table 4 on page 7 of the papers circulated by the Treasurer in connection with the agreement. It appears from it that in the year 1910-ri, under Sir George Turner's scheme, propounded at Hobart in 1905, the States would have received more. They would have .received £8,041,850. Under the present proposal, the States will receive £5,668,750; so that the Commonwealth gains £2,373,100. Similar results would have flowed from the acceptance of the Treasurer's scheme; while, had that of the honourable member for Hume been adopted, the Commonwealth would have gained £ 3 3 ; 5 more than they will now. I 2 I Under the scheme propounded by the Premiers at Hobart, in 1909, the Commonwealth would pay to the States in 19.10-11 £1,081,250 more than it will under the present scheme. The gain to the Commonwealth under the agreement will be a continuing one. No one who wishes to treat the States fairly will object tb their receiving 25s. per head of population. Any one wbo would do so would be prepared to see the Commonwealth, at the end of 1910, seize the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, leaving the States to provide for the interest on their debts as best they might.",32
101,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How is the wealth to obtain the revenue necessary to pay the contribution to the States ? Is it to borrow ?,33
102,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"During the past nine years, we have been paying the States £2.000.000 a year more than we shall have to pay them under the agreement, and have had no difficulty in finding the money.",33
103,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is proposed to borrow to pay old-age pensions.,33
104,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That remark is more reckless than accurate. Old-age pensions exwill be financed by the States giving up a certain amount of revenue. I have roughly outlined a scheme for their payment. No trouble about finding the money is to be anticipated at present, but there may be trouble in the future, when we have great public works for developmental purposes to pay for as well. If we carry out any large part of the programme which has been outlined for us, we shall require special contributions to provide for' the payment of old-age pensions. I am glad that the far capita system of distribution has been adopted. The credit for this must be given to the Government Statistician of Tasmania, who worked out a scheme for meeting the present difficulties and avoiding future troubles, which is better than any other yet proposed. Parliament owes a debt to that gentleman for his practical and business like proposal. It is strange that two Tasmanians are so prominently associated with the settlement of the financial difficulties of the Commonwealth. The name of the late Sir Edward Braddon will go down to history in association with the section of the Constitution to which it is so often applied. Although that section was adversely criticised at the time of its proposal as clumsy and unworkable, those who so condemned it have since pronounced it to be, not a blot on the Constitution, but a blessing.",33
105,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of the members of the Convention say that the late Sir Frederick Holder originated the proposal.,33
106,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At any rate, Sir Edward Braddon moved the insertion of the provision in the draft Constitution. It is said that necessity is the mother of invention, and perhaps the necessitous condition of Tasmanian finance is the reason why two Tasmanians have been so prominent in this regard. Ever since Federation, the Treasurers of the smaller States Common- have had an anxious time. One reason why we should adopt the agreement is that the States have at least 87 per cent, of the functions pf Government to perform. On them devolves the expense of developmental works of all kinds, including the construction of railwavs, - and the opening up and maintenance of roads. A young country cannot expect to attract immigrants unless its resources are developed.",33

The Constitution provided this system should remain in force for vears; but, after nine years, it has not been abolished.

Tasmania and Queensland, being small consumers, receive only a small part of the Customs and Excise revenue, but have to contribute per capita for big works in other States from which they get little or no benefit, direct indirect.

114,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So far as the present inis concerned, I agree with the honourable",34
115,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But for the fact the 25s. per head is to be paid for all time. I should net be prepared to accept I am forced the conclusion that every time a scheme it has been brought forward for the settleof the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States the tendency has that been to diminish the amount proposed to returned to the States, and that if I do not accept this arrangement, and the whole question is once more re-opened, the States o may not receive as much as it is now proposed to return to them. The State Premiers have closely studied the question; they know the necessities of their finances better than I do; their Treasurers are prepared to accept the payment of 25s. per head of their population, and therefore they must regard it as satisfactory. In all other respects I am heartily in accord with the agreement, and hope to see it become law. I have heard, with some, surprise, the objections raised to it by honourable members of the Opposition. In April last year the Brisbane Labour Conference propounded a scheme which closely resembles that which we are now asked to adopt. It provided for a return to the States of something like 24s. per head of their population. The-percapita system of distribution was adopted, and yet we find in the Labour party in this House some of the strongest opponents to the agreement now before us. Had the Labour Government remained in office, would they have dared it the next general election to advocate any financial settlement other than that adopted by the Brisbane Labour Conference? think not. That scheme was not included in the programme of the Federal Labour party, otherwise they would have been compelled to accept it.",34

He claimed that the great merit of the Brisbane Labour Conference scheme was that it provided for the future, whereas the defect in that propounded by the honourable member for Hume was that it did not provide for the fair treatment of the States in the future. Will the honourable member for Melbourne Ports say that the honourable member for South Sydney is another smallminded State Righter? ' I would remind him that the honourable member evidently thought that the Brisbane Labour Conference was asking too much from the States, because he said that it would be a bit of a wrench for them to have to give up £2.700,000.",35

"""" Mr ATKINSON - The Leader of the Opposition last night sought to make a great deal of capital out of the fact that this agreement does not provide for the transfer of the State debts. But the members of the Brisbane Labour Conference, who carried the Labour scheme, said it would be impracticable at present to deal jointly with the distribution of revenue and the transfer of the debts. The Opposition, to my mind, have no basis for their objections, and if they are true to the majority in their ranks, they will be found heartily supporting this measure. When on the platform they invariably take up the attitude that they vote according to principle, and that it is only their opponents who have any time-serving objects in view. Yet in connection with what is undoubtedly one of the most important questions that could engage our attention, we find them absolutely opposed to what, in reality, they' believe in. That alone should make the waverers on this side of the House, if there are anv, determine to support this agreement. This is a Federal I scheme in that it provides for a per capita distribution of revenue so that all the States will be treated alike, and in the main it is based on justice. The larger States, and particularly New South Wales, will be called upon under it to make considerable sacrifices. But New South Wales may well take into account the fact that the bookkeeping system has been in operation for about four years longer than was intended. The Premier of that State is taking up a magnanimous position, recognising that as a giveand-take policy must be adopted, the larger States should be prepared to make some concessions tb the smaller ones. The smaller States are giving up much, because,, as I have shown, they are not likely to receive, under the proposal, nearly as much as they are receiving under the Braddon section. Queensland is a sufferer under the return upon a consumption basis, but no State suffers more than my own. I have no desire to indulge in any special pleading, or to ask for charity; but, watching the progress of matters closely for the last two or three years, it seems to me that honourable members do not really appreciate the position of Tasmania.",35
121,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I know no State that has been more efficientlv represented than has he did Tasmania in resraxd to grievances.,35
122,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not wish to appear as ventilating grievances, but merely as presenting a few facts, and asking for simple justice. However accurately honourable members may gauge conditions in other States, they do not seem to quite grasp the Tasmanian position. That State has given up a larger proportion than almost any other State of the revenues she relied on before Federation. In the year before the Commonwealth was inaugurated, Tasmania collected £492,000 through Customs and Excise, and has since not received anything like that amount as her share.",35
123,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does that not mean that the people of Tasmania are taxed less?,36
124,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a pertinent question; and the fact, to a certain extent, does mean that the money remains in the pockets of the people, although not to the extent that it should. Tasmania has largely increased her imports from Victoria, New South Wales, and the other States, and, though we do not object to that, the fact has been detrimental to her revenue. For the articles imported, in certain lines we pay as much as we did when they came from abroad, duty added, and, while revenue is lost, the money is in the pockets of neither the purchaser nor the Treasury. I also remind honourable members that, since Federation, Tasmania has increased her direct taxation far more than has an) other State. At the time of Federation, the direct taxation in Tasmania was about 13s. per head, whereas it is now 29s. per head.",36
125,Mr STORRER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is 30s. per head.,36
126,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall take it at 29s. ; and from that source, at the time of Federation, the State raised £111,557, as compared with £276,450 today. Honourable members will begin to see how serious the position of Tasmania is, especially when it is remembered that most of the sources of revenue there have been pretty well taxed. As I have already said, Queensland suffers much in the same way, though that State has large resources yet untouched to fall back upon. In addition, Tasmania has the heaviest land tax of aU the States, so that even £20,000 or £30,000 means a good deal to her at the present time; indeed it may mean all the difference in the balancing of the ledger. Tasmania ought to receive a.t least what is proposed, and, if she has to develop her resources and attract intending - settlers, a great deal more. The honourable - member for Melbourne Ports seems to think I am not putting the case from the - stand-point of the Brisbane Labour Conference quite fairly; but I remind him that the honourable member for West Sydney urged, as the merit of the scheme of that Conference, that it was for all time. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition said quite the opposite next day, but I suppose these little differences must occur in the best regulated families.",36
127,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who is right?,36
128,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have read the report of the Conference, and, judging from those who chiefly spoke, I think the honourable member for West Sydney is right. Some people object to the permanent arrangement, but there are two parties to the agreement; and, even in an ordinary land transaction, we cannot expect one party to hand over all the security and trust to the honour of the other. Is it not right that the States should have some security ? And what security is there that the Federation will carry out the arrangement in the spirit and for the time contemplated, unless it is embodied in the Constitution? It is only fair, if we are in earnest, that we should be prepared to give every security. If the arrangement is not satisfactory the Constitution may be amended; and surely the people may be trusted ? In twenty or thirty years the Commonwealth may be reaping a huge revenue, and the people will then know how best to deal with the position. I believe that a great deal can be done by means of this agreement to establish harmonious relations between the Commonwealth and the States, seeing that each will be independent in their finances, and thus many causes of friction will be removed. Another fact that makes' for better feeling is that now, for the first time, we have a Government that may be said to be fairly representative of the people; and the State and Commonwealth authorities at the last Conference have, I think, surpassed all efforts in this direction. Their relations are more amicable than ever before, and points have been settled which, in the past, have caused great difference of opinion. I am satisfied that if the Federation and the States act to each other as they should, the people may well be trusted to look after their financial arrangements when the time comes for a change. At any Tate, we have no right to ask or expect the States to accept the arrangement without a guarantee of our good faith. It is an arrangement that can be well recommended to the people. It has been adopted by the Premiers and by the present Government, and, if the Government only stand firm, they will carry the country with them. The agreement will appeal to the people, who, as a rule, are pretty keen in money matters, especially when they can grasp the fact that that issue is involved. Those who support the Federal union as against unification, will regard the arrangement as founded on justice, and I think I cannot say more in its favour than the Age has already said. I am not referring now to what that newspaper has been saying during the last few days, but what it said when it viewed . this matter from a truly national and not a provincial point of view. On the 6th September of this year, speaking of the agreement, the Age saidIn the second place, it proposes to take away from the Commonwealth Parliament a power which it now possesses of dealing with the Customs revenue as its best judgment may decide. That is a very valuable power, deliberately invested in the Commonwealth by the people in a Referendum. There is no reason on earth why that power should be taken away from the Commonwealth, According to the earlier quotations I gave from the same weighty journal, it seemed to take the view that there was no reason why a permanent power should be given under the Constitution as against the States. However, I think honourable members will gain a little enlightenment as to the position if they compare this quotation with those I previously used. or why the people should be asked to take it away. That a Commonwealth Government, for mere party ends, should ask the people to contract the legislative power of the Commonwealth is an act of Federal perfidy so heinous that every true friend of the National Parliament sliould rise up and denounce it to the people. It is a wanton proposal of the State Rights party to belittle the National Parliament and to exalt the power and cause of the States. It is not too much to say that should Mr. Deakin ever seriously press upon Parliament this iniquity against the Commonwealth Constitution, he will rue the day. That is one side of the picture. Now let me refer to a time when the Age could be regarded as speaking just as impartially - s it can be today- a time when the question of Federation 'was being fought out and the Constitution was being evolved at the Convention. In its issue of 7th November, 1898, the Age used these wordsWe are told that we may safely leave our fate to the Federal Parliament to determine, but we should be disregarding the lessons of experience if we did. When the Canadian Constitution was being made, its authors faced the difficulty in a very different spirit. They saw the necessity of safeguarding the revenues of the various States, and met it by allotting them a - per capita grant out of the Federal Treasury for all time. Mr Atkinson.",36
129,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Melbourne Ports) [3-S ]-- I should like to compliment the 2 honourable member for Wilmot on the speech which he has just delivered. My leader said that this was not a party question, but insinuations have been thrown out that we nevertheless would make it so. I agree that it is not a party question, ancl can prove it by the opinions of people outside, by the real views of those on the other side, and by the opinions of members of the party to which I belong, who are in the State Parliaments. In our movement we have many men who think that this is a good agreement. In it there are men who are not national in spirit, but who are just as much State Righters and just as provincial as are many honourable members opposite and those who support them outside. So far from being a party question, the issue is really as between the broad national franchise upon which both Houses of the Federal Parliament are elected and the franchise which returns the Lower and Upper Houses of the States. If there is a. fight, it is based on that difference, and is not among the people themselves. Very, few of the people understand the question. The fight is really a political one, in which there are engaged those who are sitting on the Ministerial side in this House, together with those who hold the reins of power in the State Houses, on the one side, and on the other those who are actuated by the true national sentiment. The Federal and State Governments and their supporters have agreed to sink their differences at the next elections and to stand side by side to fight the Labour movement for all they are worth. That is the true position. To show that the question itself is not a party one, I know that in my constituency there are men who have never voted and never will vote for me, or for anybody in the Labour movement, but who are as strongly opposed to the agreement as I am myself. On the other hand, there are men whowill vote for me, but who are in favour of the agreement. The question is simply made a party one for political purposes inboth the Federal and State Parliaments.",37
130,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It cannot be made a party question, since, as the honourable member says, it has to go to the people apart fromparty.",37
131,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What the Prime Minister says would be perfectly true if the people as a whole understood the question ; but he knows, as well as I do, that it is a complex one, which, not being trained"" in finance, the great bulk of the people cannot understand. The only opportunity which they will have of hearing it explained will be by listening at the' next election to candidates who will place before them views and opinions from their own political stand-points, and by reading the newspapers. It is evidenf up to the present that all the leading newspapers of Australia except one have taken the provincial and not the national attitude. I do not know whether that one will maintain its present stand.",37
132,Mr WILKS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Some of the others have wobbled on it.,38
133,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be, bm perhaps, with a view to being on the side of what they think is the stronger party, they will still keep to the opinions which they are expressing now. I and other Victorian members have been - charged in this Chamber with being under the domination of the Age, so that anything I may say regarding that newspaper may be laughed at; but I would point out that the Age has now taken a stand in opposition to men whom it has supported for years in Victorian political life. No one, however, can say whether it will be brave and consistent enough to maintain its present attitude until after the next election: I hope it will, for then we shall have an opportunity of placing the true position at least before the people of Victoria. The question can be made a party one only by politicians. It is not a case of how the people will regard it, but of how politicians and newspapers will present it to them. That is what I am afraid of, for I fear that the outcome will be baneful, not to the Federal or State Parliaments, but to the national life of the Commonwealth. I shall be glad to obtain leave to continue my remarks on a future date. Leavegranted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT, ORDER OF BUSINESS-CUSTOM S AND EXCISE REVENUE RETURNS.",38
134,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [3.38] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to inform honourable members that the first business taken on Tuesday will be that of supply for one month, which has become necessary. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [3.39] - The honourable member for Yarra has asked the Treasurer to cause a statement to be prepared showing the Customs and Excise levenue for five years prior to Federation in the case, I think, of Victoria and South Australia only. Will he be kind enough to have all the States included in that return ?",38
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall be glad to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative. - House adjourned at 3.40 p.m.,38
