2,Mr ALBANESE,TRANSPORT SECURITY,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.02 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 amends the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. Background Australia's aviation security legislation framework consists of a number of layers of security measures, and is under constant review to ensure that Australia's aviation industry is safeguarded and able to quickly adapt to new threats to security. The Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 establishes a preventive security regime to safeguard against acts of terrorism and unlawful interference with the Australian aviation sector. The failed terrorist attempt on Christmas Day last year against a United States-bound flight clearly demonstrates the continuing need for stringent preventive security measures. Australia's maritime industry is critical to the social and economic prosperity of Australia. Nearly 4,000 ships carry goods and commodities to and from Australian shores each year, carrying 99 per cent of Australia's imports and exports by volume. These ships represent nearly 10 per cent of world seaborne trade by mass-the fifth largest shipping task in the world. The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 establishes a preventive security regime to safeguard against acts of terrorism and unlawful interference with Australia's ports, port facilities, ships and offshore facilities. It gives effect to Australia's international obligations as a contracting administration under the International Maritime Organisation's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, established under chapter 112 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. To quote from the recently released counterterrorism white paper: Terrorism continues to pose a serious security challenge to Australia. … The threat of terrorism is real and enduring. It has become a persistent and permanent feature of Australia's security vironment. Objective of the Bill The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 contains two amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. Both amendments have been developed to better equip the Australian government's capacity to respond in the event of an aviation incident. The bill also amends the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to implement a range of proposals which emerged from a recent examination of security arrangements for passenger ships undertaken by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Together, the measures in this bill ensure Australia's preventive transport security arrangements continue to deliver effective security outcomes, both now and into the future. Measures in the Bill I will first provide an overview of the measures in the bill to amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. The first amendment will allow the prohibited items list to be made in a notice issued by the minister responsible for administering the act. Currently, the prohibited items list is made in the regulations, and as such, any amendment to be made to the prohibited items list currently involves a relatively lengthy legislative process. This amendment will ensure that the prohibited items list can be more easily amended and updated to reflect emerging threats and vulnerabilities to aviation security, while still preserving parliamentary scrutiny. The second aviation security amendment will enable the secretary of my department to delegate all or any of his powers and funcentions to a senior executive service employee in the Attorney-General's Department. While this amendment is administrative in nature, it is being made in preparation for the establishment of the ‘Commonwealth Incident Coordinator' position within the Attorney General's Department from 1 July 2010. The creation of the position of the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator forms part of the Australian government's all-hazards approach to crisis and consequence management. The role of the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator is to coordinate response planning and the implementation of Australian government crisis management decisions across relevant domains. By delegating these powers to the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator, the Australian government will be better placed to respond in a fully coordinated fashion to rapidly developing security incidents. For example, as part of a coordinated response to a terrorist incident, the Commonwealth Incident Coordinator could use the powers to direct an aircraft subject to a bomb threat to land at a particular airport, or park in a specific part of an airport, where emergency services are best placed to respond to the threat. I will now describe the measures in the bill which amend the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. Firstly, the bill inserts provisions to allow ship operators to be given exemptions from certain security requirements in certain circumstances, where there is no impact on the security outcome. From time to time, Australian ships that are not required to be security regulated under the act need to travel overseas or to another Australian state or territory on an exceptional basis. These one-off voyages every five years or so are typically for maintenance purposes but mean that these ships must comply with all of the security obligations under the act, at a significant additional cost to their operations. The amendment proposed in the bill would allow operators of Australian ships to apply to the secretary for an exemption from the requirement to hold an International Ship Security Certificate or a ship security plan. Such an exemption would only be granted in exceptional circumstances and if security in the maritime environment was not reduced. This amendment is consistent with that provided for in the Safety of Life at Sea, or SOLAS, convention, to which Australia is a signatory. A similar situation exists for foreign flagged ships; they are occasionally granted an exemption by their flag state from complying with their requirement to hold an International Ship Security Certificate or its equivalent. Such an exemption is often granted to allow the ship to travel to Australia as part of a one-off overseas voyage to conduct maintenance on the ship, a similar situation to the one I just explained. There is currently no ability under the act to recognise an exemption made by another contracting administration to the SOLAS convention, meaning that a foreign ship arriving in Australia without an International Ship Security Certificate is in contravention of the act. The proposed amendment would allow for regulations to be made prescribing certain kinds of regulated ships that are exempt from the requirement to have or obtain a valid ship security certificate on arrival Australia. Secondly, the bill makes amendments with regard to passenger ships to enable regulations to be made to define different classes of passenger ships and to enable screening officers to conduct frisk searches of passengers and crew. Currently a ‘one size fits all' approach is applied to passenger ship security regardless of the operational characteristics of the specific ship or class of ship. This approach does not allow individual factors, constraints and considerations to be taken into account when prescribing an appropriate and customised range of preventive security measures in relation to the level of threat for their operating environments. This amendment would allow for the prescription of different classes of security regulated ships in the maritime security regulations. For example, this would allow passenger ships to be defined by any combination of size, passenger capacity, areas of geographical operation, type of items carried or the types of activities they conduct. It would allow for customised security measures to be developed and applied to each class, avoiding the issues attached to overor underregulation. Passenger ship security will also be strengthened through the introduction of frisk search powers to enhance the screening and clearance of passengers and crew in certain circumstances. The establishment of frisk search powers for the passenger ship sector means that more effective security screening processes can be promptly introduced, should the nature and level of threat in the maritime environment suddenly escalate. The recent events of Christmas Day highlight the need to have a responsive security framework, adaptable to rapid changes in circumstances. The power to conduct frisk in searches in certain circumstances already exists for aviation travellers and the proposed amendment would mirror these arrangements. The bill will also provide greater flexibilment. ity to make regulations with regard to screening and clearing matters. I propose to amend the act so that regulations can be made to address all necessary aspects of maritime security screening practices, and not be limited to the matters fied in that section. Thirdly, the bill enables certain persons to be appointed as security assessment inspectors to conduct security assessments of maritime industry participants. Currently the act does not have any explicit powers of entry into security regulated areas other than for departmental officers and law enforcement officers. This amendment will enable the secretary to appoint a person as a security assessment inspector if that person meets criteria to be specified in regulations. Appointed security assessment inspectors will be able to survey the extant security environment at a regulated maritime site and examine the effectiveness of current security policies. This will enable timely responses to changing and emerging threats to be developed to ensure the regime continues to meet the threat of terrorism both now and into the future. Fourthly, the bill provides for measures to allow the secretary of my department to delegate his powers under the MTOFSA, the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003, to agency heads and certain SES officers in other agencies in certain circumstances. Currently, the secretary of my department may delegate all or any of their powers and functions under the act to an SES employee in my department only. This amendment would allow the secretary to delegate all or any of their powers and functions to the agency head of an agency that conducts national security activities and an SES employee in the Attorney-General's DepartIn respect of delegations to agency heads, these may be subdelegated within the agency to an SES band three employee. This amendment would also allow the secretary to delegate his or her powers and functions to the Commonwealth Incident Coordispecinator and mirrors the aviation security amendment I mentioned earlier. The ability to delegate powers externally across the aviation, maritime and offshore environments provides my department with the maximum flexibility within the legislative framework to enable an appropriate incident response to be made in unexpected and often urgent situations. Finally, the bill makes some minor amendments to modernise image recording powers for maritime security inspectors. To modernise the options for use of recording media and to align with the newly introduced powers of a Security Assessment Inspector, the bill replaces the power to photograph equipment with the power to make a still or moving image. To correct a drafting anomaly, the bill introduces a similar power to allow for the recording of images by maritime security inspectors when inspecting equipment at a place, vehicle or vessel under the control of a regulated maritime industry participant, to align with their existing power to photograph on board a security regulated ship and on an offshore facility. Conclusion Just as terrorists will continue to alter their methods, so too must we ensure that our preventive transport security arrangements evolve to meet this threat. The Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 will enhance the operation of the aviation and maritime security regimes for the benefit of our maritime, offshore and aviation industries and the Australian public. I am confident that the measures introduced in this bill will contribute to a transport system that is more secure against the threat of terrorism. I commend the bill to the House.

3,The SPEAKER,TRANSPORT SECURITY,Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA BILL (No. 1) 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brendan O'Connor. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,21
4,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010 contains three amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Two of these amendments relate to import concessions for the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The amendments will insert end-dates for items 61 and 73 in schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff. These amendments reflect the government's change of policy from providing assistance through tariff concessions to providing a wider range of support to TCF industries as set out in the government's TCF innovation package as announced in the 2009-10 budget. The government's TCF innovation package will drive innovation and renewal in the Australian TCF industries by investing $401 million in a retargeted TCF package from 2009-10 to 2015-16. The new TCF innovation package redirects $55 million towards innovation, including $10 million in new funding. The package recognises the importance of the TCF industries, which employ over 45,000 Australians and underpin regional economies around the country. It aims to make the TCF sector stronger and more sustainable by supporting the development of new products and processes, especially at the high-tech, high-value end of the market. The bill amends item 61 to insert an enddate of 30 June 2010. Item 61 provides the means for duty concessions under the Expanded Overseas Assembly Provisions Scheme. This scheme provides duty concessions for certain TCF goods that are manufactured overseas from Australian fabric and are subsequently imported back to Australia. The bill amends the end-date of item 73, changing the existing end-date from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2011. Item 73 gives effect to the Product Diversification Scheme for certain clothing and finished textiles. This scheme allows a producer to earn duty credits for certain clothing and finished textiles and then to apply those credits, through item 73, to offset duty payable on qualifying imported finished products. While importers will no longer be able to earn duty credits under the PDS after 30 June this year, the end-date of 30 June 2011 for item 73 will provide importers with an additional 12 months to use those credits. The bill also inserts an end-date of 31 December 2009 for item 53C in schedule 4 of the customs tariff. Item 53C provided a mechanism to reduce the general rate of customs duty from 10 per cent to five per cent for certain goods that were not of a kind used as components in passenger motor vehicles. From 1 January 2010, the general rate of duty for the above goods reduced from 10 per cent to five per cent. As a consequence, there is no need for the item 53C concession and the item is redundant. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Coulton) adjourned.",21
5,The SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting NA Public Works Committee Reference,22
6,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.21 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency at the New Acton Nishi Building, Edinburgh Avenue, Canberra City, ACT. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency proposes to undertake a fitout of new leased premises at the NewActon Nishi Building, Edinburgh Avenue, Canberra City, ACT, at an estimated cost of $20.5 million plus GST. The DCCEE currently occupies offices at 2 Constitution Avenue and 20 Allara Street, Canberra City, ACT. The existing leases will expire on 31 December 2012 and 14 June 2011, respectively. The existing fit-outs at these locations are in poor condition-in most cases more than 20 years old-are not related to the DCCEE's organisational and operational needs and are not capable of economical refurbishment to modern standards. As a result of the recently announced machinery of government changes, the DCCEE also has staff currently accommodated in the Parliamentary Triangle, Forrest and Woden in offices which are managed by other Commonwealth agencies. The proposed fit-out will provide the opportunity to co-locate all DCCEE staff and provide significant benefits in relation to functionality, operating efficiencies, administrative overheads and environmental ratings. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction of the fit-out is expected to commence in September 2011, with completion scheduled for August 2012. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA BILL 2010 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 March, on motion by Ms Roxon: That this bill be now read a second time. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (9.24 am)-Last night prior to the adjournment, I was taking the House through all of the initiatives that the federal government has implemented in relation to health, from the initiation of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission inquiry back in February 2008 right through to the significant increase-up to 50 per cent-in health funding, the increase in training places and other initiatives. In contrast, the Liberals in government, under the stewardship of the then health minister, now Leader of the Opposition, slashed $1 billion from public hospitals. They caused a national shortage in the medical workforce by freezing medical student places and capping GP training places, leading to a critical doctor shortage affecting 60 per cent of the population. They did nothing to plan for future challenges like the ageing population and the growing burden of chronic disease. Last night in the debate on these bills, the member for Herbert referred to the problems associated with Townsville Hospital. I do have to ask: on how many occasions, when both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Herbert were in government and the Leader of the Opposition was health minister, did the member for Herbert on behalf of his constituents actually raise concerns about Townsville Hospital and how the federal government should assist? It is important also to look at the Liberal Party since coming into opposition in 2007. They opposed the alcopops legislation, which was an important measure to address binge drinking by young people; they opposed the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill, which sought to establish the first-ever national approach to preventive health through this national preventive health agency; they opposed means testing for private health insurance, which would ensure that the government provides rebates in a way that is fiscally responsible and direct taxpayer dollars into areas that are most in need, such as health reform. Mr Tony Abbott is working hard to distinguish himself from the previous leaders of the opposition and the Rudd Labor government. This leader of the opposition is doing so by saying ‘no' in the Senate on every policy that has been put forward in the area of health. Mr Abbott's latest example of this is the rejection of the private health insurance rebate bill. This decision blows a $2 billion hole in the budget and, by the middle of this century, it will be a $100 billion hole. This is money that would be better spent within the health system. Unfortunately this is not the only piece of legislation that is being blocked in the Senate when it comes to health and important priorities for the community. The landmark legislation that will give more support and recognition to midwives and nurse practitioners has been delayed month after month after month, and the Liberal Party have not yet agreed to support this important reform within the health system. The opposition have twice blocked changes that we took to the last election to make sure that we could provide more than a million extra dental services to the most needy in our community. Unfortunately, it is not only health reform that the opposition is blocking in the Senate. Even our young people wanting to study at university have been left in the lurch because of the opposition refusing to pass the income support for students bill. The protection of the environment into the future through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is also a target for the opposition. In fact, the opposition has blocked 41 bills in the past year, which is four times as many as any other opposition in the past 30 years. I have to say that the LNP candidate for Petrie has recently come out saying that he supports local hospital boards. I hope that means he will now support local hospital networks. The other members from Queensland in this chamber may be very interested to know that he says he is going to advocate strongly for Logan Hospital to be the first off the mark. I am sure that Logan is a lovely hospital, but Logan has about four other federal electorates between Petrie and where it actually resides, and it is certainly nowhere near outer northern metropolitan Brisbane. Mr Ciobo interjectingDr Emerson interjectingMrs D'ATH-I would say good on the LNP candidate for Petrie promoting Logan as the first off the mark, but, as the member for Petrie, I will actually be advocating for Redcliffe Hospital and my local health professionals to support our area to be the first off the mark. For the Rudd government the message is simple: we are serious about health reform; the opposition is serious about playing politics. This legislation before the House is part of the Rudd Labor government's commitment to health reform and is another step forward to positive change. I commend the bills to the House.",22
7,The SPEAKER,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,I thank the Queensland members present in the chamber for not showing their territorial biases too much.,24
8,Mr CIOBO,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"I rise to speak on the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, which are before the House this morning. There can be no doubt that for the Australian community health is one of the key national policy priorities for government. We have seen a shift in our aged population. In the early 1990s, around 12 per cent of the population were aged 65 and over. Based on demographics, we anticipate, with the affliction of time and the ageing of the population, that those Australians aged 65 and over will become roughly one in three-nearly 30 per cent of Australia's population-in the next couple of decades. We have a landmark change happening across the Australian community in the number of older Australians. The increasing number of older Australians, predominantly driven by the baby boomers, who were born after the Second World War, has meant a number of things. The first is that, where you have a large socialised health compact, as we have in Australia, there will be an increasing demand upon the services provided by the Commonwealth. Coupled with that is the fact that with the ageing of a large proportion of the population there will be fewer people actually contributing to Australia's tax system. Indeed, with a large number we will be in the situation of having a net drawdown, so to speak, by taxpayers of consolidated revenue for services such as health. It is crucially important that we continue to identify measures that can be taken to increase efficiency. We need to consistently utilise new technology to ensure that we develop maximum bang for our buck. That is crucial because, with a decline in the number of taxpayers paying tax and an increase in the number of taxpayers drawing on those services, we need to make our dollar stretch further. This is a problem that besets all governments. It is not something that is unique to the Labor Party and it is not something unique to the coalition; it is a common policy challenge, something that as a nation we must address. The bill that is before the parliament today to some extent addresses this issue. It effectively provides a resource for government to ensure that we are able to gain greater efficiencies and improve productivity when it comes to the administration of the health system. The Healthcare Identifiers Bill will provide for a 16-digit identifier for every Australian and every healthcare provider. This will provide greater efficiencies when it comes to the administration of this scheme. If I look back over the past several years I am conscious of the fact that it was the previous coalition government that took perhaps some very bold steps-I would argue too bold-with respect to advocating for an access card. The access card, which some may consider a forerunner to or a super-duper version of a healthcare identifier card, on the plus side would have provided for greater efficiencies with respect to the administration not only of health but more broadly of the social welfare system in this country. The concern that I had at the time, albeit it was a coalition initiative-and I certainly spoke quite strongly within my own party room about the access card-was that a situation might arise where, with the passage of time and function creep, the access card would have become a national identity card. For Liberals like me the notion that we would hand up to government the power to have something like a national identity card was one step too far. We saw around the world other governments moving down that pathway. Indeed, the United Kingdom has moved down that pathway, forcing all citizens and residents in the United Kingdom to have a national identity card. The parallel between that and the bill today means that those of us who are concerned about the relationship between the individual and the state must remain vigilant about where exactly we go with this legislation. On the face of it, the bill that is before the House is not, I believe, of significant concern. It is about efficiencies. It is about ensuring that government can utilise technology that will enable it to stretch its health dollar further, that will enable it to ensure that the administrative arrangements that are in place are utilised most efficiently and productively so that all Australians benefit from a more efficient system. Let's be frank: there are not too many Australians who would argue that when it comes to government administration we are among the most efficient in the world. That notwithstanding, we need to be conscious of unintended consequences and function creep. These remain for me very serious considerations which I believe all members of this parliament should be concerned with. The introduction of a healthcare identifier, which provides a 16-digit number for every single Australian, means that there will be, for the first time, a great ability for governments to have, through the use of that single identifier, access to a raft of health information on every single Australian. As I said, on the face of it I am comfortable with that insofar as it provides greater opportunity for efficiency and, perhaps even more importantly, the opportunity to ensure that, when it comes to the administration of health and linking patient records with patients, there is less room for error. That has to be a positive. I certainly do not believe this legislation is bad. I think it has taken a long time to come about. We have had a vacuum for a couple of years now while this government has been ambivalent about which way to move. Nonetheless, it is in broad terms a logical and solid step forward in the administration of Australia's health system. I want to state on the record that I will continue to watch closely the development of policy around this bill and associated bills that deal with the labelling of each individual Australian with a single number which provides government greater access to records all administered through one number. I believe that we will see with the passage of time increasing pressure to utilise this number as successive governments say: ‘Look, we are only seeking to add on this particular function. We are only seeking to ensure that when it comes to your unique health identifier number we are only adding on this one particular aspect.' Who knows what that will be? Perhaps it will be combined with passports in the future. Perhaps it will be combined with drivers licences in the future. Perhaps it will be combined with tax records in the future. Perhaps it will be combined with welfare records or family tax benefits in the future. There is a whole raft of different things that successive governments could say, ‘This will stop duplication and mix-ups.' Each argument individually will make sense. Each time a government stands up and says, ‘Look, when it comes to making government more efficient we believe this is a step in the right direction.' I concede that I would agree with each one of those arguments if they were taken in isolation. But the problem we have as policymakers is that it is actually not that far of a journey between starting with a system like this and ending up with a situation that I foresee down the track: where each and every Australian has a 16digit number identifier which links them back through all government records about them in all government agencies and departments. It would also seem logical to conclude that it would not be very long before criminal records, police investigations and all such matters are all linked as well to unique 16-digit identifiers. Some Australians, I concede, would have no problem with that. Some Australians would be very comfortable with government agencies being able to access all of those records at the push of one or several buttons. But we must remain vigilant about the abuse of power by governments. It is well and good for the population to say: ‘Well, we've got nothing to be concerned about. Governments have, over time in this country, proven that they don't abuse powers.' Other Australians would say there have been many examples of abuse of government power in the nation's history. It all depends on your perspective. But I can say with authority that when you look around the globe you see many examples of governments misusing power as a direct result of the adoption of technology which enables all of that information to come to one particular person. Over the past several weeks I was concerned when I saw numerous media reports talking in particular about the unauthorised access by bureaucrats of people's private information in health records. When audited, there were thousands of examples of unauthorised personnel within Australian government agencies and departments that were accessing other people's private information with no authority and-it would appear on the face of it-with no proper motive. This has been a concern that the tax office has dealt with for some time. Occasionally we do see, unfortunately, from the tax office the personal tax records of high-profile individuals and celebrities being accessed without authorisation, and, on occasion, if memory serves me correctly, some of that information has spilled into the public arena. If I was one of those Australians, I would be saying, ‘Whose business is it that my private tax records should be out there in the public dothose main because a bureaucrat somewhere has taken it upon themselves to access my information and put it out there?' That is just one single agency's record. Can you imagine what the potential could be for the abuse of information if every single government record or piece of information about an individual was accessible from all departments through one unique identifier? We might say, ‘Well, they're celebrities and they can deal with it.' The reality is, as recent media reports have demonstrated, there are many examples where people have misused and accessed information on other Australians. Perhaps it is a friend of the bureaucrat or someone who happens to be in the newspaper or the Woman's Day that particular day, and their interest is piqued and they have a little squiz at what they have in their health or tax records. I would like to pretend that that is never going to happen but the truth is, as we have seen in recent weeks, it happens thousands and thousands of times every single year. It is for that reason that I think as Australians we need to remain vigilant about where these particular initiatives go-certainly I will as a policymaker. But that is part of the broader fabric of the debate about when successive political parties take the reins of government and help to move Australia's health system forward, and the administration of Australia's health, welfare and other systems when governments seek greater efficiencies. I am not a troglodyte. It is not that I believe that all technolscratch ogy is bad, but we must recognise that with this new technology in particular there is a greater ability to misuse the information that is contained within the 16-digit identifier. I will touch upon some other health related issues which are more pertinent and perhaps more germane to the aspects of this bill. I noted previously that the member for Petrie and others in this debate have railed against the coalition recently blocking the private health insurance legislation. The first point I would make is that the coalition is unable to block anything. We hear the Labor Party talking about how the coalition blocks this, that and the other, but it is simply untrue, because Labor members know that the coalition cannot block anything in the Senate. The coalition can be opposed to something but it requires other senators to support the coalition in order to block legislation. It is simply convenient for the Labor Party to make out that their legislative agenda is frustrated, when in reality they have not been able to advocate a reason strongly enough for why other senators should support their legislation. We on this side of the House know bad legislation when we see it, and that is why we stand opposed to it. And do you know what? It seems that there are other non-major political party senators who also recognise bad legislation when they see it. I say good on them for standing up to this government and good on them for ensuring that this government does not have the freedom to reign all over the place when it comes to policy and when it comes to introducing policies that would be damaging to Australia's national interest. If the Labor Party cannot come up with policies that garner enough support; so be it. It is the Labor Party's problem to ensure that they get the support of crossbench senators to get their legislative agenda through. In addition to that, you have really got to your head when the Australian Labor Party stands up in this chamber and says, ‘How unfortunate and how dare the coalition block our attempts to make private health insurance less attractive to the Australian people.' This is from the government whose Prime Minister, before the last election, hand on heart, said: ‘We will not touch private health insurance. Trust us. The Australian Labor Party has no ideological war with private health insurance. You can trust us. We won't touch it; we won't do anything to it.' That is basically what the Prime Minister said. Lo and behold, less than two years later the original moves to gut private health insurance were made by the Labor Party. They have the audacity to come into this chamber and say, ‘How dare the coalition block it.' I would say the Australian people recognise when a government is breaking a promise. How absolutely absurd for a member of the Australian Labor Party to come into the chamber and say, ‘How dare the coalition block our attempts to gut private health insurance.' You know what? My response to the Australian Labor Party is: honour your election promises. How dare the Prime Minister walk into this House and seek to make a change to private health insurance after he promised that he would not.",24

11,Dr EMERSON,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the departure by the member for Moncrieff",27
12,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,What is your point of order?,27
13,Dr EMERSON,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"It is on relevance. He is being irrelevant, and we are seeking to honour election promises and they are being blocked.",27
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,The minister has no point of order. The member for Moncrieff will continue.,28
15,Mr CIOBO,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"We see the sensitivity of Labor members in this chamber. I notice that the minister at the table, the honourable member for Rankin, did not jump up when the member for Petrie was talking about this exact same issue. I notice the Labor members were nowhere to be seen when it came to the member for Petrie talking about the injustices of the coalition trying to force Labor Party to honour their election promises. But now, when the truth comes out, we see them springing up trying to take points of order. Let us look at the health system in this country, because we all know that one of the other promises made by the Prime Minister was that the buck would stop with him when it came to Australia's health system. Now, two years later, we have the absolute debacle of administration of health in this country as the Prime Minister desperately tries to get state governments to stitch together and sign up to his particular initiative, if you want to call it that, on health. We saw the Labor Premier In Victoria, John Brumby, absolutely tear apart this Prime Minister and this government's latest proposal when it comes to health and ask how it is possible that the bor Party, which signed up to the most recent GST arrangements, would now seek to rip those apart and leave state governments in a situation where they have far less money to run their own states and their own health systems and instead try to siphon off 30 per cent of that money to the federal government. Little wonder that Colin Barnett, John Brumby and, I predict, probably Kristina Keneally and others will rail against this government's myopic approach to health administration in this country. On a final point when it comes to health, I would like to touch upon Labor's much vaunted proposal, which I believe should be much maligned, to deal with health through GP superclinics. In my own electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast, the fastest growing region in this country, the coalition introduced a number of initiatives when we were in power to help provide Gold Coasters with greater access to health. One of those was funding for doctors to be able to treat the patients after hours. The Labor Party said that that was not necessary because they would introduce a GP superclinic, which would facilitate access to doctors by the general public. In my seat they axed funding for after-hours medical treatment. What did they do? It would be logical to conclude they would have built a GP superclinic. But, no, here we are two years later, the sixth largest city in the country, and we have no GP superclinic. This is a government that ignores the sixth largest city in this country and expects to get the support of its citizens. They can forget about it, absolutely forget about it. I turn my back on their failed policies and I know my constituents will as well.",28
16,Ms REA,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"It is because I rise to very clearly support the legislation that we are currently debating-the La- Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and cognate legislation-and also because I am afraid that my colleague the member for Rankin will take a point of order on relevance, that I would like to address my remarks to the legislation rather than counter the irrelevant diatribe that we just heard in the last half of the member for Moncrieff's speech. This is a significant piece of legislation and, yes, there are issues that must be dealt with when it comes to dealing with people's health records, and I will come to some of those issues in a minute. Can I begin by saying that this legislation introduces a 16-digit number which could be the difference in saving someone's life or indeed improving their quality of health care and therefore their well-being for the rest of their life. It is lutely essential that, if we are going to provide better quality health care in this country-and we all acknowledge, across all levels of government and across the broader community, that there is a need to improve our health system-then we need to embrace the advantages of the digital age, the advantages of new technology, and look at ways in which we can use that technology to improve the healthcare system. This 16-digit number, the individual health indicator, that will be provided to every Australian will go a long way to improving the quality of health care. It is an important initiative. It is not a new one. It was agreed by COAG in 2006, which was prior to the election of the Rudd government, and indeed it was affirmed again by COAG in 2008. Clearly all of those in the government involved in the provision of healthcare services, whether at the state or Commonwealth level, acknowledge that this is a single, very significant reform that will improve health care for all Australians. We acknowledge that the fundamental premise for anyone using the health system and being provided proper health care is the qualifications and skill of the medical practitioner they go to see. That is essential. But this particular reform means that we have acknowledged that sometimes even the most qualified, well-trained and clever medical practitioner can make a mistake or not provide the best health solution for that individual patient simply because they do not have all of the information or they do not have accurate information that will assist them in their diagnosis and their prescribed solution. This is a very important reform because it adds to the very skilled work done by our medical professionals. It makes their job easier and it also makes their job better in terms of providing appropriate health care. The statistics show that. There have been studies done in hospitals that show somewhere beabsotween 17 and 19 per cent of tests are unnecessary duplicates simply because there is a lack of information about a patient's medical history. More significantly, 18 per cent of those tests showed medical errors were attributed to a lack of information. So we are not just talking about duplication or unnecessary treatments for people who have a medical history. We are actually talking about the potential for a wrong diagnosis or a wrong treatment. Eighteen per cent of those tests showed medical errors attributed to a lack of information. So doesn't it make sense for us to introduce a single, simple process at a national level which provides accuracy and consistency of information that will give everyone accessing the health services greater confidence that their medical practitioner, the health professional they have gone to see, will be able to give them the best quality care because they have all the information they need at their fingertips? It makes perfect sense. It is something I applaud the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing for introducing. I think it is interesting that even amongst the broader medical community there is strong support for this initiative. In fact, during the consultations that occurred around the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report, I invited a number of local health professionals within my electorate of Bonner to come and discuss with me the proposals that were put forward by the commission. We had a range of people there. We had nurses, doctors, allied health workers and people who worked in aged care in nursing homes-a broad range of people involved in the health sector. They were all very experienced and skilled people and obviously very committed because they took time out of their busy days to come and sit down and have a discussion about the ways that they believed the health system could be improved. They offered us a range of suggestions that I think were very interesting and very exciting. What stood out to me was that, to a person in that room, the single reform they all said could change the quality of health care in this country was moving towards e-health and having a consistent and accurate database of information that was easily accessible by health professionals and health providers across the nation so that, no matter where you were or who you were, your medical history would be available to anyone you went to see because you needed medical advice or medical assistance. I am very pleased that, having consulted with my local community, obviously this initiative has been reflected across the broader community and has come out as part of a recommendation in the reform commission's report and has been acknowledged by the minister to the extent that we now have this legislation before us. I think this is a very exciting initiative. I know amongst the broader medical community and across the general Australian community there will be an acknowledgement that this will significantly improve our health system. Of course, we will have to be mindful that there are issues around introducing an identification number. We have to be mindful that people are quite rightly concerned about anything that they may see as intruding on their privacy, particularly with something tive as their medical history and health information. It would not be acceptable to anybody in this parliament if legislation were introduced that did not reflect and honour the need to protect privacy wherever appropriate. That is why I am pleased that as a result of this bill the health minister has included number of initiatives and a number of safeguards that go towards protecting privacy. Indeed, the bill was drafted after three privacy impact assessments had been done, and all of the issues and concerns raised as a result of those assessments have been included in this legislation. It is important to point out to those opposite and those in the broader community who will want to make a bigger issue about the privacy impact of this legislation than the significant and positive improvements that this reform will make that safeguards have been identified to ensure that minimal demographic information will be required to assign and obtain healthcare identifiers. The service itself will not be the retainer of all that medical information. There will be minimal information in order to simply provide the process needed for health providers accessing this. No clinical information will be held by the service operator. Only authorised healthcare providers will be able to access the healthcare identifier service and obtain healthcare identifiers for their existing patients. The Medicare card and the Department of Veterans' Affairs treatment card are to be used as tokens to obtain an individual's healthcare identifier. So it is very clear that the minister has listened to any concerns about privacy and has included very important and appropriate initiatives within this bill to ensure that we allow this service to be introduced and we enable medical practitioners to access significant information to support them in their job of caring for and curing the Australian community, but not at the expense of the as sensi- privacy of information. I said it earlier, but, on that point, I do think that I need to address some of the doomsday pessimism coming from those opposite on this issue. We do live in a digital age. Almost every single thing we do these days depends on a computer or some form of a new technology. Information these days is disseminated, accessed and spread by new technologies. People pay for all sorts of goods and services using their credit cards over the internet. We know that this is no longer a novelty. We know it is not some sort of new thing that we like the look of but should be a little bit scared about. This is actually the way that we conduct our day-today business, so I do not think we need to be too scared anymore of using the advantages that these new technologies provide to improve the services that we as a government are responsible for providing to the Australian community. We need to embrace technology and use it for better. There is no ter example than this bill, which takes advantage of technology through the simplicity of a national database and a 16-digit numberthat is all it needs to be-to make the difference between living a good and healthy life and finding suffering and pain as a result wrong diagnosis or a wrong treatment. I think the bill speaks for itself and I commend it to the parliament.",28
17,Ms MARINO,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"I rise to speak on the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, which will see the introduction of a 16-digit identifier for every Australian and every healthcare provider. The introduction of these individual healthcare identifiers is a part of establishing a national e-health system for the future. Healthcare identifiers are just the first step in establishing this system to ensure a more cohesive, coordinated healthcare system for Australian patients. The coalition is supportive of the concept of e-health. However, we, and I particularly, have very serious concerns and issues about the security of information under the system. An e-health system would provide an opportunity to improve health care in Australia. We have a healthcare system that we know is under pressure. For this reason, it is important to continue to improve health care in Australia across the board. As we know, Australia is behind countries such as Great Britain, Germany and Canada in the implementation of e-health measures. The systems introduced in these countries share diagnostic imagery between providers and eprescription services and facilitate communication between providers, reducing the silo method of treating patients-important to each patient. However, as I mentioned earlier, while I believe that a national system will provide for greater consistency of health care, I have bet- a number of concerns surrounding the privacy and the security of patient information. In introducing the system, the government must categorically guarantee the security of patients' information under this system. There are no ifs and buts-it must guarantee of a that. My questions arise because the government is yet to really outline the stringent regulatory framework to ensure absolute security of health information further into the future. I note that, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, the National E-Health Transition Authority has admitted it is yet to decide how access control would work, yet we have the bill before the House today. To further compound the problem, the system is due to start on 1 July, yet the software makers have not yet been provided with the specifications to design an appropriate IT framework or to integrate healthcare identifiers into existing software packages. This alone should be of concern to everyone in this parliament. We have previously seen first hand the problems of rushed and bungled legislation-the tragic Home Insulation Program, for example. I have very genuine concerns about exactly how the government will guarantee the security of this patient information. That and the lack of thoroughness of this legislation have also been raised by doctors and others. An article in the Australian on 19 January stated that doctors and other experts have raised concerns about breaches of patient privacy and criticised the rushed and limited one-month consultation period for the new laws-conducted over a holiday period. The article quoted the Royal Australian College of GPs as stating that greater clarity was needed about who would have access to patient information and whether doctors needed their patient's consent before using a healthcare identification number. Recently we have heard that Medicare has investigated over 1,000 employees for potential unauthorised access to client records in the past three years. If Medicare is going to be the handler of Australian patients' personal information, then clearly we have very serious concerns about the security and integrity of these processes. The National E-Health Transition Authority's Dr Haikerwal also raised concerns over the Labor government's proposed e-health legislation, but this time in regard to the costs of the system. In the Herald Sun, Dr Haikerwal said: If you look at e-health systems around the world, the cost falls on to the shoulders of the healthcare providers; the benefits are reaped by the patients and Government. The government released a discussion paper in June 2009 and drafted this legislation in December 2009. Fifty-five organisations and individuals made submissions on the draft legislation and while most were supportive of the legislation they raised a number of technical points, including the possibility that doctors may be in breach of legislation by disclosing healthcare recipients' identifiers, the exclusion of private health funds from using the new healthcare identifiers and the compliance costs of an extra level of privacy legislation. As I have stated previously, we continually see examples of the Labor government rushing health legislation without serious, detailed and inclusive consultative processes. We saw the government's attempt to target thousands of Australians by proposing that the most vulnerable, those needing cataract surgery, would have to pay hundreds of dollars more for life-changing cataract surgery. As we know, the majority of those are seniors-the very people who can least afford to pay more. There was the IVF debacle where the minister was forced to backflip on the government's proposed halving of the Medicare rebate for IVF treatment. The WA Liberal government has also expressed concerns about the rollout of GP superclinics in Western Australia, and we have also seen the Labor government continue its attack on those with private health insurance. Fortunately for those holders of private health cover in my electorate, the Senate voted against that legislation two days ago. Australians deserve a national system that will provide for greater consistency of health care but, in such a system, they also must have absolute confidence in the government guaranteeing complete security of their private information. I am particularly interested in, but extremely concerned with, the processes that the government will use to provide this guarantee of privacy and the penalties for those who access, use, pass on or sell the information. An article in the Medical Observer referring to Medicare staff who had accessed patients' information illegally quotes a Medicare spokesperson as saying: … there would be an audit log of all access to healthcare identifier systems, which would be used to identify potential inappropriate access. Well, this is no deterrent at all. This is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. And I have no doubt that those seeking to access the information will still do so. The Medicare spokesperson went on to say that ‘customers would also be able to use the log to learn when their UHI record had been accessed'. Again, this is too late. Who has it? Where is it? What is being done with it? You might be able to identify that someone has accessed it, but they have already got it and it has gone. I do not know what sort of comfort that will be to people. If you can tell your UHI record has been accessed, it is already too late. Whoever wanted that information, such as someone with potential commercial gain, already has it. And, in a broader e-health sense, I would suggest that no Australian would want their personal medical information broadcast to the world or used for any purpose without their express permission. I can only imagine the concerns of someone who may be suffering from depression or any member who has any particular personal or private medical condition-and such conditions are often extremely sensitive-and the trauma for those same people if those details are publicised or used illegally. The very same article in the Medical Observer quoted Dr David More, a health IT consultant, as saying: If Medicare can not manage its own staff, and have them snooping, then we have to wonder about trusting them with the UHI numbers, and eventually with e-health records … I share Dr More's concern and hope that he is one person whom the Senate inquiry takes evidence from. I want to see the security measures for the storage and transfer of ehealth details and the regulatory framework in which e-health is set to operate. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, which is currently investigating cybercrime, I make a very, very strong recommendation also that the Senate inquiry take evidence and information from those involved in investigating cybercrime, such as the Australian Federal Police, state based technology crime investigation units, security organisations and various cybercrime agencies. Given the evidence we have taken during the hearings into cybercrime, I think there is a serious issue in relation to the capacity of government to guarantee the security of patients' information from both domestic and international hackers, from organised crime elements in time and from those who seek to profit from the information contained in patients' records-and there will be many who have a very direct and significant commercial and vested interest in e-health records. There are also those, I would suggest, who would be prepared to pay, and pay well, for perhaps Medicare staff, or whoever has access to the healthcare identifier systems, to allow them to access information. We do not need another rushed program. The potential for misuse and harm is too great. The Senate inquiry must fully explore and expose any and all of the potential flaws in this proposal.",31
18,Ms LIVERMORE,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"I am pleased to speak this morning in support of the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and its related bill. This bill is designed not to establish a national Healthcare Identifiers Service. It also sets out arrangements for its operation and its functions, which will be to assign, issue and maintain healthcare identifiers for individuals, healthcare providers and organisations. This bill is one of many that we have had before the parliament through the term of this government that is about preparing our healthcare system for the future, making sure that the healthcare system that Australians rely on now will be there for them well into the future, delivering the care and the services they need. When the Rudd Labor government took office in 2007 we knew that we had a lot of work ahead of us to undo the damage done to Australia's health system by 11 years of the Howard government's neglect and underfunding. Who can forget the legacy of the former Howard government's health minister, now Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, who presided over the ripping out of $1 billion from the public hospital system? Our constituents are still feeling the effects decision to cap GP training places each time they call their local doctor's clinic to be told that there will be a week's wait to see a doctor or, even worse, that the books at that particular clinic are closed to new patients. We got to work on this huge task straight away. Already in our two years of office the government has put significant new funding into health and put forward initiatives to solve some of the immediate problems we inherited from the previous coalition government. There has been a 50 per cent increase in hospital funding over the next five years in Australian healthcare agreements with the states and territories, and this represents a $64 billion investment. We have committed an unprecedented $1.1 billion investment towards training our doctors, nurses and health professionals, not the least of which is a 35 per cent increase in the number of GP training places. We are funding a rural doctors incentive scheme that now extends to 500 additional communities, and I am pleased to say that a number of those communities are in my electorate. As a result, there are incentives for 2,400 additional doctors to encourage them to stay in the bush. There is now a greater emphasis on preventative measures, including an $872 million investment in programs to be rolled out in schools, workplaces and local communities to focus on reducing risk factors such as smoking and obesity and encourage people to increase their physical activity and eat healthily. For the first time, the Australian government is investing more than $1.8 billion directly into expanding emergency departments, post-acute care and elective surgery. Also for the first time, the Australian government is investing directly in the capital needs of local hospitals. Rockhampton Base Hospital, which is the largest hospital in Capricornia, received $76 million in last of his year's budget for an expansion that will mean more operating facilities, more training facilities and a capacity for the hospital to deliver more cancer services in the future. This funding, which is not insignificant, and these initiatives deal with some of the most pressing issues, such as waiting lists, infrastructure and workforce. But we know that we have a health system that is stretched to breaking point right now and is in no shape to cope with the demands of the future. That is why the government has also engaged in the extremely challenging work of looking at the structural reform required to meet those and other future demands. The report produced last year by the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission was very clear-our health system is not prepared for future challenges, for a number of reasons. Those challenges are well known to all of us. First of all, we know that we are facing an ageing population, and that means an increase in the healthcare needs of the overall community and an increase in the cost of meeting those needs. Our population overall will grow, calling for more health services infrastructure and a larger health workforce. The rates of chronic disease are projected to grow. For example, type 2 diabetes is projected to increase by more than 520 per cent between 2002 and 2032. That is a staggering increase over a relatively short time. The workforce shortages that already impact on our health system will not go away. We need to be training more health professionals and doing more to make the most of the skills of the various parts of the health workforce. The recent Intergenerational report reinforced the need for change. That report included estimates that by halfway through the century health costs would consume the entire revenue raised by state governments. Furthermore, the ballooning of health costs presents risks to the entire Australian economy. In light of those warnings, the only answer is reform of the health system in a big way. Again, the work of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission highlighted the weaknesses in our present system that need to be addressed if our health system is to be strong and sustainable into the future, if it going to be there for all Australians in the way we have rightly come to expect. The first of these weaknesses is that there is too much blame and fragmentation going on amongst governments. At the moment we have eight different health systems split between our states and territories, and we also have Commonwealth funding for various parts of the health system but this is not essarily in any logical order. Responsibilities for health between the different levels of government are very unclear, resulting in duplication, cost shifting and blame shifting. The classic example that always comes to my mind is a community in my electorate where there is a small rural hospital and right next to the hospital is a GP clinic. The same doctor services the public hospital and has the right of private practice. There is no problem with that, but you end up with patients being sent over to have a procedure done in his clinic, I do not believe for any clinical reason-it is the same doctor-but the cost then does not come out of the Queensland Health budget attached to the hospital; it is billed to the Commonwealth through Medicare. I do not think there is any healthcare impact of people having to walk from the hospital to the surgery, but it just highlights the unnecessary cost shifting and complication that is there, just in one small town in my electorate. If you can imagine that happening right across the health system, you can understand why that fragmentation and those incentives for cost shifting are such a problem. There are also gaps and poor coordination in health services that people need. So, again, particularly elderly people or people with chronic illnesses will be accessing a suite of different services being provided by a whole range of health providers. Some of those are going to be Commonwealth funded and some will be state funded, and some will is be half and half. When there are those gaps or this lack of coordination, you can just see that there is room for people to fall through the cracks and not have their health needs met, or certainly not have them met in an efficient or timely manner. There is too much pressure on our public hospitals and health professionals. In Australia we have much higher rates of hospital nec- admission than other comparable countries. Our public hospitals are just the default for anything that happens in our health system, and of course we know that that is not the most efficient or cost-effective way of dealing with many of the health problems that we have. Certainly as we look into the future, where chronic disease is going to take up much more of the health system's time and resources, public hospitals will not necessarily be the answer to meeting those needs. There is also too much waste and inefficiency. The Commonwealth government currently funds states with block grants for public hospital services. Even though we know that some states are delivering services more efficiently than others, it is still difficult to identify exactly where that is happening and to reward those who are meeting best practice. The government has seen the warnings in the Intergenerational report and from the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and have also listened to the views and experiences of thousands of health professionals and advocates during more than 100 consultations in hospitals and communities around the country. We are convinced that now is the time to act if we are to build an efficient and reliable healthcare system, and that is what we are going to do. A major part of the government's reform plan for health was announced last week. For the first time the Commonwealth government will take on majority funding responsibility for public hospitals, along with full funding and policy responsibility for GP and primary health care. The government will use its position as the majority funder of health and hospital services to impose strong national standards for health care and build a nationally unified health system. That is the plan that will go for discussion to the COAG meeting with the premiers at the beginning of April. We hope that the premiers can come on board with that plan because the warning in the Intergenerational report was that state revenue bases are just not going to be able to handle the pressures coming down the line towards them-the demands from the healthcare system. They are not going to have the financial wherewithal to deal with those pressures and this is a way for the Commonwealth government to step up and take on that financial responsibility-but, through assuming that responsibility, we also want to be able to build a properly unified health system that overcomes some of those current weaknesses that were identified in the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report. As I said at the outset, this bill is part of the government's looking to the future and looking to what we need to do to prepare a future health system that is strong, sustainable and on a financially secure footing. One of the areas that the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission spent some time on in their report was the whole question of ehealth-electronic health. That is what this bill is taking steps towards. The Healthcare Identifiers Service will be asked to provide a national capability to accurately and uniquely identify individuals and healthcare providers to enable reliable healthcare related communication between individuals, providers and provider organisations. This is something that the previous government and COAG have been working towards for some time now. There is a general recognition that we have to do much more in the area of ehealth if we are to capture the efficiencies, increase effectiveness and have better coordination within our healthcare system. I was reading through the national ehealth strategy, which was prepared for the government by Deloittes. They put the benefits of e-health as moving towards an individual electronic health record that each patient, each person, in Australia will have control of and that will seamlessly and efficiently transfer information about that individual patient to all the sections of the healthcare system that they interact with. The challenge that the national e-health strategy report puts out is: The Australian health system is straining to deal with increasing cost and demand pressures and a shortage of skilled health workers. Given this reality, we need to move to a system where every interaction between consumers and care providers achieves maximum impact on health outcomes and where scarce financial and human resources are deployed as effectively as possible. I believe an individual electronic health record does give consumers and individuals much more power and input into managing their health and their interaction with the health system. It also means that care providers and healthcare managers can reliably and securely access and share health information in real time across geographic and health sector boundaries. When you look at what we are missing out on in this area under the present system, you see there are real costs. Most seriously and significantly, costs occur in the medical when there are bits of paper held all over the place-some in the public hospitals and some with your GP. Some of the figures show that up to 10 per cent of visits to GPs are of people seeing that GP for the first time. I am not sure whether that is the figure I read in preparation for today, but I wonder whether it might be even a higher figure than that. When you have people travelling around in an electorate like mine, where a lot of people are doing fly-in fly-out work in the mining industry, there is a lot of mobility between communities. Studies have found that up to 18 per cent of medical errors are due to the inadequate availability of patient information, because at the moment it is up to patients to be transferring all of that formation and taking that information with them and making sure they are giving it to the right person at the right time. These adverse events coming out of that lack of coordination represent approximately $3 billion in avoidable annual expenditure, money that could be better spent absorbing additional health sector demands driven by an ageing and sicker population. The government is convinced that this is the right way to go, that we should be moving towards the development of electronic health records, but putting in place the Healthcare Identifiers Service is the first step. The previous speaker talked about the issues of privacy and the integrity and security of information contained in any electronic health system. That is a big part of what the Healthcare Identifiers Service will be doing. This legislation also makes minor amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 and the Health Insurance Act 1973 to support the robust privacy framework which has been developed for the Healthcare Identifiers Service. Privacy and security of that information is very important. I notice, in reading the e-health strategy areas documents, that with an electronic health record the idea is for the consumer, the individual, to have control, to have access to that record. In some ways, that actually gives some more security and more peace of mind than might otherwise be the case. That kind of electronic sharing of data brings with it a trail or a record so that the individual consumer can keep track of who has accessed that information. I know that I have a health file at the Rockhampton Base Hospital, but how do I know where it is right now, who might be looking at it, who looked at it yesterday or what they did with it? The evidence there on electronic health records indicates that there is the capacity for those records to have an electronic trail that would allow conin- sumers to give themselves peace of mind on who is accessing their information, when and why. This legislation is very clear on the importance of that privacy. It explicitly limits the adoption, use and disclosure of healthcare identifiers to healthcare information management and communication purposes as part of delivering healthcare services or for other related purposes. There are also penalties for the misuse of healthcare identifiers by the Healthcare Identifiers Service operator or any other persons or organisations. We are going to continue towards the development of this electronic health capacity, because we see that it is complementary to what we are trying to do in reducing the fragmentation and duplication that goes on in our current system. I support the legislation that is before the House.",33
19,Dr WASHER,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"Moore) (10.32 am)Before I start my speech, I would like to commend the member for Capricornia for her models on the increasing incidence of chronic disease. I support her in a lot of she said. The Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and cognate bill aim to implement a national system for consistent identification of customers and healthcare providers, and set out purposes for which healthcare identifiers can be used. In July 2004, health ministers endorsed the formation of the jointly funded National E-Health Transition Authority. The authority was to be responsible for establishing a national health information management and information and communication technology entity. One of its fundamental objectives was the development of a patient identification system, which, together with a product and medicines database and national provider index, was to contribute to a national shared e-health record. COAG agreed to accelerate the development of a national electronic health records system in 2006 with funding of $130 million to June 2009. In 2007 COAG agreed to a further $218 million over three years and signed the National Partnership Agreement on E-Health. This signed agreement outlines a framework for cooperative jurisdictional arrangements and responsibilities for e-health. It sets out the objectives and scope for the Healthcare Identifiers Service, as well as relevant governance, legislative, administrative and financial arrangements. Once enacted, this bill will operate in conjunction with this agreement to support the operation of the service. Implementation of a national healthcare identifiers system will: support messaging from one healthcare provider to another by providing a consistent identifier that can be used in communication; facilitate electronic communications between providers by establishing a way for healthcare providers to look up the contact details of other healthcare providers; and support the implementation of what a security and access framework to ensure the appropriate authorisation and authentication of healthcare providers who access national e-health infrastructure. The communication of health information and accurate identification of individuals is a critical part of effective health care. It is estimated that 10 per cent of hospital admissions are due to adverse drug events and up to 18 per cent of medical errors are a result of inadequate access to patient information. The use of individual healthcare identifiers will assist healthcare providers to accurately match the correct records to their patients and improve the accuracy when communicating information to other healthcare providers. Greater accuracy of information available is not only critical to effective health care for the individual but it also enables greater efficiency and productivity. Other countries which have implemented e-health systems have demonstrated significant improvements in productivity. It is thought that the implementation of e-prescriptions in Sweden, Boston and Denmark has reduced providers' costs and time, resulting in an improvement of productivity of over 50 per cent. Ereferrals in Denmark have reduced the average time spent on referrals by 97 per cent; and in America and France test ordering and results management systems have reduced time spent by physicians chasing up test results by over 70 per cent. By outlining solutions for e-prescriptions, e-referrals and electronic test ordering, it is estimated that Australia's e-health strategy will reduce by 10 per cent the time currently spent by care providers in discovering information. This conservative figure may not sound significant, but in net present value terms this is in the order of $2.8 billion over 10 years. Around 25 per cent of a clinician's time is spent seeking information about a patient, and 35 per cent of referrals are inappropriate as a result of insufficient direct cess to specialists and insufficient information being passed from primary care to specialist. I can vouch for that problem. Another concerning issue within our healthcare system is unnecessary or duplicated treatments. It is thought that unnecessary duplicate testing in hospital environments occurs at a rate of around nine per cent to 17 per cent-and I would suggest that that is a pretty conservative estimate. It is estimated that the implementation of e-health will result in a 15 per cent reduction in unnecessary tests. Based upon an average cost of $36 per test this would result in benefits around $800 million in net present value over a 10-year period. Although those healthcare providers who elect to participate may incur some costs associated with complying with required regulations, the system will result in efficiencies in a number of areas. The use of identifier numbers is likely to result in improved business practices and more efficient communication with other providers. Costs that may be incurred would include the upgrading of IT systems to incorporate appropriate minimum standards and security features to access the Healthcare Identifiers Service. However, the service draws heavily on the same IT infrastructure as Medicare Online. So for those providers that already have this in place that will be of no concern. The other cost will be the time required to educate and train staff; however, reference materials will be available to minimise this time outlay. A public awareness program via a range of methods will provide consumers with information about the service and its benefits. Those healthcare provider organisations that elect to participate in the service will also be provided with materials and appropriate sources of information to provide to patients. An individual healthcare identifier will acnot be required for claiming healthcare benefits. So, if the healthcare provider is unable to obtain a person's identifier for whatever reason, the patient may still undergo treatment. The implementation of the system will not affect anonymous healthcare services that are currently provided. Where lawful and practical, individuals may still seek healthcare treatments and services on an anonymous basis. As Medicare Australia will be the operator of the Healthcare Identifiers Service, the bill confers functions upon the CEO of Medicare Australia. These functions include: assignof ing, collecting and maintaining identifiers for individuals, individual healthcare providers and organisations by using information already held by Medicare Australia for its existing functions; collecting information from individuals and other data sources; developing and maintaining mechanisms for users to access their own records and to correct or update details; using and disclosing healthcare identifiers and associated personal information for the purposes of operating the service; and disclosing healthcare identifiers for other purposes set out in the bill. The bill outlines what permitted purposes for identifiers may be disclosed and the offences and relevant penalties for misuse or breach of the legislation. This clear framework supports the proper use and disclosure of healthcare identifiers. The Federal Privacy Commissioner will provide independent regulation of how healthcare identifiers are handled and of the operation of the service and will handle any complaints that are made. Where states have existing privacy arrangements, including an appropriate regulator, that regulator will be responsible for handling complaints which are made against a public sector organisation in their jurisdiction. For those states and territories that do not have such arrangements, these will also be handled by the Federal Privacy Commissioner. The bill also establishes a ministerial council, whose key functions include development and review of regulations to support the operation of the service and the issuing of policy directions to the service operator, Medicare. The service will be funded until 30 June 2012 as part of the $218 million allocated by COAG to the National E-Health Transition Authority. Of the $218 million, $52.02 million has been allocated to the operation of the service by Medicare. Funding beyond this date will need to be determined between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. In addition to this funding, $0.5 lion has been allocated by the Commonwealth for the Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner for regulatory oversight and advice on the introduction of the identifiers. In summary, a national e-health system will improve safety and quality of healthcare in this country. It will improve access for healthcare providers to reliable healthcare information when and where it is needed. It will enhance shared care of complex medical problems and chronic disease. I would emphasise that as a major failure of Medicare currently, which is dysfunctional in the management of chronic disease. A national ehealth system will reduce the burden on the health sector through better health management; improve healthcare planning to ensure resources are directed to where they are needed most; and, most importantly, save lives through better decision support, increased access to information and reduction of adverse events. Obviously, there must be appropriate security measures and standards imposed throughout the health sector to ensure that privacy and confidentially of information are maintained and that there is the capacity for effective handling of complaints and review of the service. I would suggest, just light heartedly, that it is better to be alive and well than to have a little confidentiality breached and be dead. A bill which aims to introduce such a national e-health system is to be commended.",37
20,Mr CHEESEMAN,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"I would like to recognise the contribution made by the member for Moore. He has had a long history in health care. As a doctor in this place, he has helped quite a number of members of parliament from time to time. I take this opportunity to make my contribution in the debate on the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and cognate bill. This legislamiltion is another example of why Australia's healthcare system-and of course Labor's Medicare system is at the heart of our country's health system-is one of the best systems in the world. This legislation and Labor's proposed healthcare reform program, as announced by the Prime Minister last week, show a pathway towards maintaining our mantle as having the best system in the world. This legislation shows a core quality that is one of the primary reasons we have such a fantastic system that is the envy of the world. This quality is the quality of continual improvement. We know we have a fantastic system, but we do need to continue to work on it and refine it to ensure that it delivers for all Australians. We have to be vigilant and keep reviewing and improving our healthcare system. This legislation is about building the best healthcare system for the futurefuture-proofing our system. The Healthcare Identifiers Bill will establish a national Healthcare Identifiers Service and sets out arrangements for its operation and its functions which will assign, issue and maintain healthcare identifiers for individuals, healthcare providers and organisations. This bill will provide a national capability to accurately and uniquely identify individuals and healthcare providers to enable reliable healthcare communication between individuals, providers and provider organisations. This approach to healthcare identifiers was agreed by COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, in February 2006 as part of accelerated work on electronic health records to improve patient safety and increase efficiency for healthcare providers. We know this issue has some risks. The importance of confidentiality and security of information is paramount. So we know there is risk, but we also know that that risk can be managed. We also know we have to take this step for the sake of providing better healthcare services and for the efficiency that electronic health records provide. We also know from similar types of projects in other institutions in our society that we will be able to do it well. I believe that this is a very big step in developing a future health system that is more efficient, more flexible, more reliable and safer for those involved. This legislation establishes the Healthcare Identifiers Service and allocates functions to Medicare Australia as the initial service operator. Medicare Australia's existing information and service infrastructure is to be used to establish the individual and provider identifiers. The key objective of the Healthcare Identifiers Service will be to provide a national capability to accurately and uniquely identify individuals and healthcare providers to enable reliable healthcare related communication between individuals, providers and provider organisations. The identifiers are a fundamental building block for the national e-health system. E-health has the potential to improve patient safety and of course health outcomes for all of us. We should consider these facts as key drivers. It is estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of patients with chronic diseases are hospitalised because of inadequate care management. Up to 18 per cent of medical errors are attributed to inadequate availability of patient information and between nine and 17 per cent of pathology and diagnostic tests are unnecessary duplicates. Think of the waste when these statistics are translated into dollars across the system. If we could just have these error rates-and ehealth records hold out real promise in this regard-we would save our country billions of dollars over the decades to come. This money of course could be reinvested into other new and emerging technologies. Think of the many ways this money could be spent to further improve the treatment that patients receive. E-health has the capability to radically improve the amount of waste and, therefore, make our fantastic health system even better at delivering for all of us. In my electorate of Corangamite, I recently released a four-point plan to improve the health of the region. It is about creating better health solutions in my region. The last federal health minister in the Howard government, Mr Abbott, did tremendous damage by ripping more than a billion dollars out of our health system and capping the number of GP training places. This is having a real impact in regions like Corangamite where there are skill shortages today. The key parts of the plan that I announced strongly support the Rudd government's health reforms, which will establish local hospital networks to be run by health and financial professionalswho will be responsible for running local hospitals rather than central bureaucracies. We will work with local councils and sports clubs to apply for one of the Australian government's Healthy Communities comprehensive five-year intervention trials, whereby sports clubs and officials will be funded to significantly raise the level of participation of young people in sport. This will particularly relate to the Colac Otway region. Sport is fundamental in securing better health outcomes in the long term. We will work with Deakin University medical school to ensure that nursing training continues to be rolled out across the region as well as the training of new GPs who will be coming out of the Deakin University medical school over the next few years so that they can take up the opportunity to practise medicine in regional communities such as Corangamite. Better e-health and better data are critical in making and developing the case in each of these areas. If we are able to integrate information and share that information where appropriate amongst healthcare providers and individuals, it will lead to much stronger outcomes for the patients. The Colac Otway region, which is a very important part of my electorate, has high health needs in different areas and, due to the nature of the region, hospitals are not often that close. The federal government is attempting to undertake a massive shift in our health spending based on preventative health. I think that an e-health record is very important in terms of setting up strong, well thought through, individually tailored, preventative health strategies. Good e-health services are central to that policy shift, view. One of the local proposals I have put forward in the area of preventative health in our region is to secure the opportunity of being part of the five-year preventative health trials, and having strong e-health records will assist with that. I want to see our local shire councils combine with our sports clubs and other health stakeholders to drive participation in sport, and an e-health platform is very much an enabler of that. The most important organisations in our shire and our region, in terms of keeping young people active, are the sports clubs. Good e-health capabilities will, in my view, enable us to design systems to analyse the impacts that sporting activities might have over a significant period of time. The federal government's preventative health strategy has a vision for Australia to be the healthiest country by 2020. The strategy provides the road map for a series of strategic and practical actions to be implemented across all sectors between now and 2020. The preventative health strategy is being driven by projected future costs in our healthcare system, which are experiencing significant pressure particularly because of our ageing population. In light of this projection, in 2006 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, established the Australian Better Health Initiative with the aim of refocusing the health system towards promoting good health and reducing the burden of chronic disease. Good e-health systems go hand in hand with these initiatives. These bills are about taking a national approach to ensure that the frameworks and the key infrastructure components are coordinated and aligned across Australia. The Commonwealth portion of funding for the costs of operating the Healthcare Identifiers in my Service, which totals $52 million over the next couple of years, was agreed through the Strategic Priorities and Budget Committee on 26 November 2008 as part of the total amount of $218 million to provide this ehealth framework. The Commonwealth share will be $26.01 million, which is 50 per cent of those costs. I believe that spending this money is one of the best things we can do to invest in a modern healthcare system for the future. I should also note that the identifiers will not hold any clinical information. They are not electronic health records but they are a key step in building the infrastructure for an electronic health record into the future. They are the building blocks for a thoroughly modern future health system. Individual health identifiers, IHIs, will be allocated to all individuals who receive health care in Australia, but consumers will not be refused health care if their identifier is not available for some reason. The IHI will be generated as a temporary number in situations where an individual cannot be identified at the point of care-such as in emergency situations such as traffic accidents-or where a person is not entitled to Medicare provisions, such as tourists who have come to Australia. In conclusion, this legislation has very lengthy origins and was developed as part of a COAG process. I will not go through all of the steps, but, most recently, on 7 December 2009, COAG considered a report on the outcomes of the public consideration on healthcare identifiers and privacy and signed a national partnership agreement setting out cooperation between jurisdictions and arrangements for e-health, including the Healthcare Identifiers Service. The government has committed to work and consult closely with government agencies, state and territory governments and clinical, community and consumer stakeholders in the rollout of the Health Identifiers Service. The Minister for Health and Ageing is required to have a report prepared on the operation of the IHI service and the legislation, which will be tabled in both houses of parliament. This legislation has all the checks and balances that ought to be required in legislation of this nature. It is legislation that is on the cutting edge of a modern healthcare system in Australia. It is legislation that will be good for Australia, will save billions of dollars into the future and will provide better health outcomes for all of us. I commend these bills to the House.",40
21,Mr ZAPPIA,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"I rise to speak in support of the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. Since coming to office in November 2007, the Rudd government has embarked on a major reform of the Australian health system, a reform needed in response to both the immediate health needs of today and the changing health needs and growing health costs of the future. Treasury estimates have concluded that by 2045 health spending will consume the entire budget of the state governments. That is something that we certainly need to be aware of and plan for accordingly. Health needs have weighed down the health services in Australia for over a decade, and I have to say that in that respect the previous government largely ignored the reforms that were needed. We have a national health system that is financially inefficient and which does not deliver the best possible care to the Australian people. The Rudd government has made it a priority to address the inefficiencies in Australia's health system and to ensure Australians have access to better health services. To date, the Rudd government has increased health and hospital funding by 50 per cent to $64 billion over the next five years. That funding includes: $1.1 billion to train more doctors, nurses and allied health workers, in the largest ever investment in the health workforce; $750 million to take pressure off emergency departments; upgrades of 37 hospitals around the country; $500 million for subacute facilities, including rehabilitation, palliative care, geriatric evaluation and psychogeriatric services; $600 million in an elective surgery waiting list reduction plan that has delivered more than 62,000 procedures, and new elective surgery equipment and operating theatres for 125 hospitals across the country; and $275 million for 36 GP superclinics around Australia. I am pleased to say that one of those GP superclinics is in the electorate of Makin, and if time permits I will talk a little bit more about that later on. There has been an $872 million investment in preventive health programs to be rolled out in schools, workplaces and local communities with a high incidence of chronic disease; $1.6 billion allocated to close the life-expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians; $134 million invested in the rural and remote workforce; and $3.2 billion invested in health infrastructure projects, including $1.5 billion to upgrade 18 hospitals around the country, $1.3 billion over six years to modernise Australia's cancer infrastructure, $430 million to upgrade 12 medical research and clinical training facilities and $293 million allocated for 2,000 transition care places. Last week the Prime Minister announced the Rudd government's national health reform proposal. It is a proposal that brings together the work of the Bennett health review and the subsequent widespread consultation by the government with health service providers and the community around the country as part of that review. Under the Rudd government's national health reform proposal, the federal government will replace eight separate health systems with a single national health and hospitals network, combining all public hospitals and all GP services and related services; dedicate one-third of GST revenue directly to health and hospitals; and put local hospital networks in charge. To deliver this system, the federal government will take 60 per cent of funding responsibility for public hospitals, take over full responsibility for GP and related services provided outside of hospitals and pay local hospital networks directly for each hospital service they deliver, rather than just handing over block funding grants to the states. The measures in this bill are another important step in modernising Australia's health system. It is a proposal that benefits the patient, the health professionals and the Australian taxpayers. As the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, stated in her second reading speech: This new identifier system will facilitate reliable healthcare related communications, support the management of patient information in an electronic environment and provide the foundations necessary to support the development of a national e-health record system. I note that this system is being implemented after agreement with all the Australian states and territories. In fact it was an agreement reached, if I recall correctly, in November 2008. The existing system of medical data is outdated, inadequate and wasteful. As other members have pointed out, including the member for Corangamite, who has just spoken, it is estimated that between nine per cent and 17 per cent of medical tests are unnecessary duplicates, wasting both patient time and tens of millions of dollars. I agree with the member for Corangamite, who quite rightly asked the question: wouldn't those tens of millions of dollars that are being wasted be better spent on services which the community is screaming out for but for which funds are not available? That is a stark example of how our health services across the country could be improved. Looking at this from a patient's perspective, we see that up to 18 per cent of medical errors are attributed to inadequate availability of patient information. One wonders about that figure not simply as a percentage but because of the emotional cost that patients incur as a result of medical errors, which in turn occur because the system could be working much better-and making it work much better is exactly what this proposal aims to do. I am aware that there have been some concerns expressed about this proposal, particularly concerns relating to the privacy of medical information not being properly protected and that wrong medical diagnoses may form part of a patient's record. I was pleased to hear the member for Moore make a contribution to this debate because as a practicing GP he knows only too well the system that GPs currently operate under. In response to both of those matters, though, it is my view that both of those concerns are valid under today's management of the health system. The privacy of medical information and wrong medical diagnosis are already issues under the existing system. Whilst it might have been an issue that was raised as part of the response to this proposal, it is my view that it is no greater issue than exists under the current arrangements. On the issues of privacy and wrong medical diagnosis, the minister has stated that no clinical information will be held by the service operator. Only authorised healthcare providers will be able to access the Healthcare Identifiers Service and obtain healthcare identifiers for their existing patients. The Medicare card and the Department of Veterans' Affairs treatment card are used as a token to obtain an individual's healthcare identifier. In fact, the legislation was considered by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Attorney-General's Department and the Solicitor-General, amongst others. I also note that the issues of privacy are specifically dealt with by the consequential amendments that are attached to this bill. Australians want the government to deliver a better health system. This message could not have been made clearer than in that which we are seeing in the lead-up to the South Australian state election, where health has become a dominant election issue, as it was in the last state election in 2006 and in the 2007 federal election. There has been a range of commitments made in the lead-up to the state election in South Australia. I am pleased to see that the South Australian Rann government is committing to building a brand new Royal Adelaide Hospital if it is re-elected-a brand new hospital that would deliver after many years the kinds of services that are required by the people of Adelaide; a brand new Royal Adelaide Hospital that has the support of much of the medical community in South Australia. Again, that was made abundantly clear last week when a number of key senior medical people from South Australia openly stated that we needed a new hospital in South Australia. It is a huge investment but it is required to ensure that the health services in South Australia in the future will be able to provide the level of services that the people quite rightly expect. I am also pleased to see that only yesterday the Premier of South Australia, Mike Rann, committed an additional $44 million to the upgrade of the Modbury Hospital in my electorate of Makin. This $44 million is in addition to a $25 million commitment to establish a GP superclinic almost adjacent to the hospital. It is a $25 million commitment made up of $12.5 million of federal government funds and $12.5 million of state government funds. It will be a service that will complement the services provided by the Modbury Hospital. I reiterate something I said in this House only a couple of weeks ago about the Modbury Hospital. The hospital services the north eastern parts of Adelaide and has done so since 1973, when it was established by the Dunstan Labor government of the time. In 1993 the Liberals came to office in South Australia and immediately privatised the Modbury Hospital. As a result of privatising the Modbury Hospital, the services from that hospital began to detesources riorate-so much so that by the time the Labor government was re-elected in 2002 the local community was screaming out for the state government to take back control of the Modbury Hospital. At the expiration of the agreement with Healthscope, which was the private operator that had been managing the Modbury Hospital, in 2007 the state government did exactly that and took back ownership and control of the hospital in every sense of the word. Since 2002 the Rann Labor government has committed $39 million in additional funding to begin to restore the services that the local community quite properly expect from that hospital. To see an additional commitment now of $44 million towards that hospital is something I certainly welcome. The $44 million includes the development of 25 purpose-built emergency cubicles and the redevelopment of levels 5 and 6 to provide 36 single rooms in those two levels. Those are two levels of the hospital that have been largely unused for several years now. The emergency services are the critical aspects the hospital that the community wants to see upgraded. Again, as someone who represents the people out there and who has called for the upgrade of the emergency services department, it is something I certainly welcome. I also welcome, and I have very much supported, the $25 million investment in the GP superclinic. One of the issues that was clearly raised with me when I visited the hospital in the lead-up to the 2007 election was that the hospital emergency department was dealing with an overwhelming number of people who were coming into the hospital but who could, and should, have otherwise gone to their local GP. But because they did not have access to their local GP for a range of services they were using the hospital, thereby draining not only the financial reof the hospital but also the staff time needed to attend to them. The establishment of a $25 million GP superclinic in close proximity to the hospital will take that kind of pressure off the hospital and allow the hospital to get on with the services which hospitals are built for. As part of health reform in this country, when the state Labor government came to office it embarked on a similar program to that which I am now seeing the Rudd Labor government do at a national level. I am pleased to see that the South Australian Minister for Health has come out in support of the Rudd government's national health reform proposals. But the state Labor government at the time also embarked on a proposal of its own where it was going to reform the health system after a lengthy inquiry by Mr John Menadue, who is considered to be an authority on the provision of health services in this country. Part of that reform meant that there was some restructuring of the Modbury Hospital. But I make it absolutely clear that the Modof bury Hospital was built by a Labor government, it was privatised by a Liberal government-demonstrating their lack of interest in the services being provided by the hospitaland it took a state Labor government to bring it back into the public fold and make real commitments to ensuring that the hospital is able to deliver the services that are required. I also point out that, in the years that the hospital was privatised, over the last decade, hospital funding in this country was cut by over $1 billion by the current Leader of the Opposition. It is no wonder that hospitals around the country, including the Modbury Hospital, saw a deterioration in the services they provide. Again, it has taken the Rudd government to reinstate that funding-and in fact increase it by 50 per cent. These bills, as I said earlier on, are part a range of reform measures that are required to ensure that into the future we have a health system that people around the country will benefit from, a health system that will be efficient for the Australian people and efficient for Australian taxpayers in that it is not wasteful. It is one of a number of measures. I understand that this is the first step to establishing an e-health records system around the country-again, something that is absolutely necessary in today's modern society. We have said on many occasions in this place, in respect of a whole range of matters, that we have moved on since Federation. People in this country move around, from one state to another, on a regular basis. Their employment takes them from one place to another. Whether they are on vacation or whether they are studying, Australians move frequently. If people move frequently the best care we can give them is to ensure that the doctors who are treating them at the time have the most up-to-date and accurate records in respect of the health of those people-and that is exactly what this proposal begins to do. I commend the bills to the House.",43
22,Mr BUTLER,HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS,"I have some comments to make in relation to both bills. The Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 seek to establish a single national healthcare identifier system for patients, healthcare providers and healthcare provider organisations. This system will not only facilitate more reliable healthcare related communications and the management of patient information but provide the core infrastructure to develop a national e-health records system. I would like to thank the members for their contributions to the debate on these bills. E-health has a crucial role to play in of ensuring the success of the healthcare reform agenda which the government is currently undertaking. The development of a national e-health system will improve safety and quality and patient convenience by ensuring that the right people have access to the right information at the right time. Governments across the country have invested considerable amounts of time, money and energy in developing e-health initiatives, but until we have a national healthcare identifier system in place there will continue to be a barrier to developing a well connected, national healthcare system. The Healthcare Identifiers Service will establish the infrastructure necessary to support future e-health development by overcoming the fragmented approach that currently exists when it comes to identifying patients and healthcare providers. Combined with a national authentication system, and the appropriate regulatory support, healthcare identifiers will deliver the access and identity requirements critical to ensuring confidence in the way a patient's health information is handled in an electronic environment. The bills seek to limit the use of healthcare identifiers to activities regularly associated with the delivery of healthcare, including for communication and information management purposes and other specified purposes, and to establish privacy protections to support the appropriate handling of healthcare identifiers. The government is committed to working with a broad range of patients and healthcare providers to educate them about the healthcare identifiers and the benefits associated with them. I am aware that there is considerable community and stakeholder interest in this legislation and in the government's e-health agenda more broadly. That is why the government conducted two rounds of public consultation on the policy proposals and draft exposure legislation in 2009. To further allow as much consultation as possible on these bills the government has referred both bills to Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for consideration. Healthcare identifiers are an essential building block to developing a national ehealth system, which will over time improve the way in which healthcare is delivered in this country. This will help to ensure that as a nation we are in a position to continue delivering quality health care to all Australians. I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to.

26,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"I say at the outset that the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010, though minor in what it is proposing, affects two extraordinarily important areas-Australia's economy and the future treatment of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and gas industry in Australia, Adelaideparticularly the offshore oil and gas industry, has been one of the extraordinary success stories for this economy and an area which has seen enormous investment and development. It is no exaggeration to say in relation to offshore oil and gas, particularly off Western Australia but also off Victoria and parts of South Australia, that there will be literally tens of billions of dollars in investment in this industry over the next five to 10 years. It is our goal as a nation not only to see this gas exploited for the economic wealth that it brings to this nation and the jobs that creates for all Australians but also to see particularly the liquid natural gas industry in Australia developed as a clean energy alternative for the rest of the world. We all know that greenhouse gas emissions have to be cut and that Australia needs to play an important role in that. The coalition has a direct action plan which is able to do that without decimating jobs in industry in Australia and without causing enormous increases in the price of energy, particularly electricity, for the households of Australia. Part of that solution, as well as capturing carbon, lies in using gas as an energy source here in Australia. But, as we know, the issues in relation to greenhouse gas emissions do not just relate to one country. What is emitted by one country is shared by the rest of the world. So it is important that we as a nation are able to ensure that we have the opportunity to be the supplier of a clean energy source to the rest of the world. Natural gas is a transitional energy to a zero-emission future. It emits half to one-third of the emissions of a coal fired power station when used to generate electricity through a combined cycle electricity plant. Also, for those countries who do not have abundant coal reserves, such as Japan, it is a very important part of their electricity generation industry. So Australia can play a major role in the global reduction of greenhouse gases through the development and export of liquefied natural gas. The second area which is also covered by these amendments is the actual storage of greenhouse gas emissions. It is something both the government and the coalition support very strongly. In my time as the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources I worked with the industry to realise the potential of clean coal and also, more importantly, carbon capture and storage. Without carbon capture and storage there is no future for coal it as a domestic energy source for our power stations in Australia as we move forward to a lower emission economy. The capture of that gas, the technology that goes with it and ultimately the storage of carbon dioxide in reservoirs both onshore and offshore will be a critical part of our low-emission future. This legislation touches on that as well and the way in which we are able to regulate that not only to ensure that the storage of that gas is possible but also to assure the community that the processes of the storage of that gas mean that that gas remains where it is supposed to be for decades and centuries to come. I would like to address the two parts of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010. Firstly, in relation to offshore petroleum measures, much of the reform of regulation surrounding offshore petroleum resources began under the previous coalition government. In fact, it was begun by me as the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. The coalition also provided a number of incentives to encourage exploration and investment in that sector which we as a country need to ensure that not only the current known reserves of oil and particularly natural gas are exploited but also the exploration for new reserves of natural gas continues. We all know that there are extensive traditional reserves of natural gas in Australia, particularly off Western Australia. Some 200 trillion cubic feet of known reserves exist off Australia. The exciting prospect is that onshore, particularly in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, there may be an equivalent or even higher level of reserves of coal seam gas that will see Australia more than abundantly self-sufficient in these gases and, as I said, able to supply a growing world need for clean energy well into this century. Those incentives and the encouragement we gave for exploration are vital to the continuing expansion of the oil and gas industry in Australia. We are therefore pleased to support the measures that have the support of stakeholders and ensure the regulation of offshore petroleum activities is safe, effective and sustainable. The coalition supports the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2010 and is happy for that to proceed unamended. We acknowledge that there is a minor technical amendment that stems from an amendment to the act late last year. The changes will provide transitional arrangements retrospectively from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2012 to impose a safety case levy for designated coastal waters. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2009 commenced the phase-out of the pipeline safety management plan levy and its replacement by a safety case levy covering pipelines to facilitate pipelines being covered under safety regulations in future, rather than under pipeline regulations. This is part of the harmonisation of this array of levies and regulations that exists across the industry and across states. Australia needs to have a very harmonised and national approach not only to the way we administer and apply these levies but also to the regulations that go with them so that, regardless of whether you are operating in the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, Western Australia or Victoria, there is a single set of rules. It was intended that the state and territory regulations would be amended to correspond with the Commonwealth legislation. Quite frankly, that just makes good sense. This has not occurred and, as a result, some safety levy payments due to NOPSA may not be collectable until corresponding amendments are in place. The current safety levies bill seeks to address these issues with transitional measures. As I say, the coalition does not oppose this bill. However, the so-called miscellaneous measures bill that is being considered cognately with the safety levies bill is not as straightforward. My colleagues in Western Australia are particularly concerned with some aspects of this bill. It seems only reasonable that, with two-thirds of Australia's offshore oil and gas resources and over 80 per cent of offshore titles being based in Western Australia, this parliament, this government and the industry as a whole should take a reasonable interest in, and pay reasonable respect to, those concerns. We, as a result, have significant concerns about the miscellaneous measures bill, including the fact that there has not been adequate consultation and that the negotiations have not been completed on it. We think there is room for further examination to ensure that all stakeholder concerns are addressed. There is no rush for this legislation. To address those concerns, from my experience as the Chairman of the Ministerial Council on Energy and of the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources, it is important that we get these things right. If we do not get them right at the outset, inevitably the actual execution of them-the putting in place of their administration and the collection of the levies associated with them-grinds to a halt. As such, and because of our concerns about the failure to complete stakeholder consultation and our desire to ensure that this is right before it is implemented, we have sought to have the miscellaneous measures bill referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. That bill will be examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which is due to report back to the Senate by 23 April 2010. Of preliminary concern, particularly to my Western Australian colleagues, is the first item of this bill, which seeks to remove the payments to the states and Northern Territory. Part 1 of schedule 1 of the miscellaneous bill allows for the Commonwealth to retain industry registration fees under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas (Registration Fees) Act 2006 rather than returning them to the states and Northern Territory for the purpose of funding the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator. The operation of that offshore regulator is crucial not only to ensure, as I say, the safe operation of this industry but also to ensure public confidence in the way this industry operates. We have unfortunately seen a number of instances in recent years that have caught the public attention. We saw a fire on Veranus Island, which not only crippled the gas supply from that island but had a flow-on effect on energy users right down the Western Australian coast and certainly to the southern part of Fremantle and all points in between, as well as inland in the minerals province. We saw a fire in the gas plant there and we obviously need to ensure that is not repeated. The role of NOPSA and of this new regulator that is being established is to ensure that there is sufficient oversight and regulation of the operation of these oil and gas plants to ensure that these sorts of instances do not recur. It is impossible to prevent accidents completely, but there is the opportunity to prevent many of them, so the operation of this new regulatory body is crucially important. It is also important that the states are able to contribute to that; hence, our concerns about the failure of this money to be returned to the states and territories. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the retention of registration fees estimated to result in a decrease in expenses to the Commonwealth of around $15.3 million in 2010-11 and $7.7 million in 2011-12. The Western Australian government indicates, though, that this number is actually $15.3 million in an adverse hit on the Western Australian budget in 2010-11. The federal government has stated that it intends to retain the money collected under the registration fees act for the period 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2011 for the purposes of funding the establishment of the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator. That is crucially important, as I mentioned. There are roles that need to be played by these bodies, and NOPSA, and now the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator, have a crucial role not only in the gas industry but, as we have seen recently, in investigation of the oil leak that occurred off the north-west coast. We do have concerns that the federal government would be moving through this bill to hold fees for the establishment of a National Offshore Petroleum Regulator given that at least one state government-that is, the Western Australian government-has concerns about the proposal. I am sure that Western Australia's concerns in relation to the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator can be addressed but we need to see full and frank consultation on this. We need to see discussion, explanations and negotiations take place to ensure that this National Offshore Petroleum Regulator has the support not only of the biggest state in regard to the oil and gas industry but also of a state which obviously plays a part in our national system. We need to ensure, in fact, that all states agree with the establishment and operation of the NOPR. The Western Australian government has been quite open in expressing its concerns about the Productivity Commission's recommendations and the implementation of is their recommendations and, given that Western Australia's budget is going to be hit by this measure, identified in this bill as savings to the Commonwealth, it makes sense that its concerns are fully addressed before the passage of this piece of legislation. As the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum pointed out to the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism during the short window of time they had to comment on the bill, they said that they ‘do not believe NOPR. that to unilaterally impose this amendment is in the spirit of the cooperative federalism publicly embraced by the current federal government'. I think that is probably optimistic in terms of the constructive cooperative federalism that is being embraced by this government but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. I will believe that they do actually care about what state governments say, and particularly state governments that are not of their persuasion, and on that basis it only makes sense to me that there be further time to comment and consult on this bill, to perhaps arrive at a negotiated agreement on this bill and to put something forward which, importantly, everyone agrees on. The federal government has announced that it will proceed with the recommendation of the Productivity Commission and that it will establish the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator, to commence in 2012-still at least two years away. The minister indicated in his second reading speech that he does not expect to introduce the legislation to enable the establishment of the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator until 2011again, a year away from now-and that would only be following further discussions with the Ministerial Council on Minerals and Petroleum Resources. The question must therefore be asked: why should the parliament, before that time, approve these changes in fee structures, particularly when they have a $15 million per annum negative impact on the Western Australian budget and when this parliament has not considered the legislation to actually establish the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator? That is a long-winded way, perhaps, of saying there is no rush for this legislation and that there is ample time to ensure that the spirit of the agreements is adhered to-that, in fact, we see full consultation and much better cooperation in relation to the establishment of the Given the concerns of the Western Australian government as a key stakeholder in the NOPR, we believe this bill should not be supported at this point in its current form. The coalition, as has always been the case in our term in opposition, is prepared to sit down with the minister and discuss the matter further, thus ensuring that this bill is optimal and that it has the support of all states as well as the Commonwealth. There was limited consultation on the specifics of this bill and limited opportunity for concerns to be addressed before the legislation was introduced. While many of the other amendments in this bill are of a technical nature, I note that the Western Australian government has also made some comments to the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism about other aspects of the bill. These include aspects relating to the functions of the safety authority, issues of natural justice in relation to property rights and the proposal of changes to the duties of titleholders. All these issues are important and all these issues must be fully explored. I trust that with further consultation these issues can be clarified and resolved to the satisfaction of all stakeholders and I urge the government to ensure that this occurs before the Senate considers this bill. Given this bill has the greatest impact in Western Australia, it makes sense for the Commonwealth government to work with the Western Australian government on a way forward on this bill and also in the establishment of the NOPR and associated funding arrangements. It is premature for the parliament to approve this component of the legislation in advance of further progress on the establishment of the NOPR through the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources. Hopefully, these concerns can be resolved with further discussion in this forum and the parliament can consider a comprehensive plan, including the funding arrangements for any national offshore petroleum regulator. As I say, the coalition supports the establishment of the regulator. We have a long and proud history of ensuring that there is a national approach to the way in which we administer and regulate one of the most important primary industries in Australia. The oil and gas industry is an industry which has, as I say, made an enormous contribution to our economy, will make an even bigger contribution to our economy, will provide jobs and wealth to many Australians and will provide clean energy to the rest of the world. It is crucially important, therefore, as we put this legislation in place, that we have the full support of the states. It is the coalition's that the second part of this bill should be delayed until that consultation has taken place.",48
27,Mr CHEESEMAN,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"I would like to take the opportunity to speak to these amendments and also comment on the broader climate change issue. My electorate of Corangamite will be one of the areas most affected by climate change, and that is why I believe so strongly that we need to act now. I congratulate the Minister for Resources and Energy for his amendments in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010. The bill will amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. These amendments are minor policy and technical changes which will pave the way for the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator. This will improve the operations of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority. There is no adverse effect on industry and there are no extra costs to industry. This bill will also simplify the safety regime for titleholders. It will remove direct responsibility from a titleholder for facilities which it has no control over. It will ensure that offences that have occurred can be more successfully prosecuted by making them offences of strict liability. This bill will cause no adverse impact on any regional people, and this is great news for the people of my electorate and especially those who work in the offshore petroleum industry. I have spoken in this place on several occasions on climate change related issues. I have done this because I believe we need to act decisively on climate change and we need to act now. There is the likelihood that some greenhouse storage activities will happen in my region. This could be an industry view in my region that would provide people with well-paid employment and for those reasons I am hoping that it will be successful. This bill will help to make sure this industry is a success into the future. This industry is very important to my region's local economy. The Otway Basin is an important gas production area for the south-eastern gas markets of Australia. As at December 2009 the Otway Basin's petroleum fields provided approximately 23.4 per cent of eastern Australia's conventional gas production; proved and probable reserves of 1,197 petajoules, which is 17.8 per cent of Victoria's conventional gas reserves and 14.8 per cent of eastern Australia's reserves; 17.1 per cent of eastern Australia's total gas production of both conventional natural gas and coal seam gas and 3.5 per cent of eastern Australia's total gas reserves; and some 70,000 tonnes or 3.1 per cent of Australia's liquefied petroleum gas production. The basin also produces a small amount of condensate-708,000 barrels, or 1.2 per cent of Australian production. This is a significant contribution from my region to a very important industry for Australia. The Otway Basin has three major gas projects which all transfer offshore gas to onshore treatment plants. The largest development in the Otway Basin is the Otway gas project. It is a $1.1 billion development ated about 70 kilometres south of Port Campbell. We need to encourage these developments so we can act on climate change now. I would not be doing my job for the people of Corangamite if I were not talking about industries that are so important to my region. That is why I regularly speak on all climate related bills, particularly those that can help reduce our carbon footprint. My electorate will be very severely affected by climate change if we do not take decisive action. I have mentioned before in the House but I think I need to emphasise again the problems in my electorate. The Great Ocean Road, the Surf Coast and parts of the Bellarine Peninsula will all be adversely threatened by rising sea levels. Large parts of my electorate do rely on the tourism economy. The Great Ocean Road is an icon of Australia and a key component of the local tourism industry. This would be devastated if we did not act on climate change and the real prospect of sea level rise came to fruition. Large parts of the Bellarine Peninsula, a key part of my seat, are very lowlying and will be inundated if there is sea level rise. There would be devastation over large inland areas of my electorate caused by drought activity and the like. The small borough of Queenscliff would be very adversely affected by sea level rise. Many jobs will be lost to the local economy if we do not take decisive action. Many parts of Ocean Grove and the Bellarine Peninsula would be affected. We do need to take very decisive steps to reduce Australia's carbon footprint. I think offshore production of gas and liquefied assets and, ultimately, storage of greenhouse gases in those fields can provide a very significant opportunity for us to reduce our carbon footprint. This is in many regards a new situand emerging industry and we do need to take the necessary steps to support the growth and development of Australia's very, very significant gas reserves. Minister Martin Ferguson has been a passionate advocate for Australia to take advantage of all of the opportunities-whether in Western Australia, Queensland or Victoriato exploit the landscape and gas reserves we have and to store greenhouse gases into the future. That is why I believe that these small but important amendments are very important, particularly in regional economies like mine and in Western Australia and Queensland where we have very significant opportunities to grow a very significant industry and to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas footprint. These small changes are significant and they will pave the way for future growth and development of this industry to ensure that the necessary regulations are in place so that we do undertake these activities in a very safe and sound way. I publicly acknowledge the contribution that Minister Ferguson is making in this area. He certainly is a very thoughtful minister and someone who is prepared to take the necessary steps to help grow this very, very important industry into Australia's future. I commend these bills to the House.",53
28,Mr TUCKEY,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"O'Connor) (11.54 am)We have two bills here that are in cognate, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010 andOffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2009. As the opposition spokesman on these matters has already said, the coalition sees merit in the legislation proposing some changes in the offshore safety arrangements but expresses concern in regard to the so-called miscellaneous measures-the process by which usually governments slip something under the guard of those who are looking at the principal legislation. These, of course, are issues of grave concern to persons representing Western Australia and the areas such as mine in the electorate of O'Connor. It is all contained in the third paragraph of the second reading speech of the Minister for Resources and Energy on the introduction of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010. It is quite interesting to read the second paragraph. It says: It is nevertheless an important bill as it progresses the government's intention to establish a new National Offshore Petroleum Regulator. That is already covered by the acronym NOPR. That commences, according to the minister, on 1 January 2012. So what is the significance of these miscellaneous measures? They are to be found in the next paragraph of the minister's second reading speech, in which it is said: To this end, the bill introduces a measure by which the Commonwealth will retain the industry fees raised under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006 in order to use this money for the establishment of a National Offshore Petroleum Regulator. This is another example we find of this government making promises to the community for delivery in a future parliament. It is now my strong view that by 2012 a coalition party will be the government here in Australia. But, irrespective of that, goodness knows what the make-up of the remaining members of the existing government might be in this House at that time. What is the House deciding today-to take a significant amount of money? Thank you for the public servants who write the explanatory memorandum. They are not inclined towards spin; they try and tell us politicians the facts. They say under the heading, which they always use, ‘Financial Impact Statement': The Bill includes minor policy and administrative changes which will have a slight financial effect on the Australian Government Budget. Considering the size of it, I guess that is an accurate statement. I will come to the Western Australian budget, which is miniscule in comparison. I continue my reading from the explanatory memorandum: The retention of the registration fees is estimated to result in a decrease in expensesfor the Commonwealthof $15.3 million in 2010-11 and $7.7 million in 2011-12. In other words, we have a fiddle by which the Western Australian government, which have just also had the bad news of a very significant drop in their share of GST, are being asked by this government to contribute one-third of the remainder so that it can keep some sort of wobbly promise on reforming the health system, presumably for the better but which is yet to be proven. So here we are in this House being asked to authorise a reduction in the revenues of the state of Western Australia to ease the Commonwealth's efforts in creating a national offshore petroleum regulator. The Commonwealth government said that it is a good idea, and the coalition does not argue with that proposal. But now state governments are going to pay for the privilege at a point in time when we do not have a national offshore petroleum regulator-and $15 million is a significant amount of money to be removed from the coffers of the Western Australian government, struggling as it is to meet a significant amount of the infrastructure requirements that apply to the development of the arrangements involved in Gorgon gas and others. In my electorate-as it will be after the next election-people of the town of Kalgoorlie are very anxious that a rail-to-road transport hub should be developed within the town site areas of Kalgoorlie. Why? Because that would considerably shorten the journey that trucks must takeremembering there is no significant rail service north of Perth on the way to the Pilbara. There would be a considerable shortcut if certain infrastructure were improved to interconnect the roads that exist already with the north-west highway-this is the inland road-and if 100-odd kilometres of road were sealed it would be to the economic benefit of all Australians. Trucks could be offloaded in Kalgoorlie from the rail system and continue their journey up a sealed road to the Pilbara and, if necessary, onwards to Browse and other localities. So here is the state government seeking to do that sort of infrastructure development-it is not cheap; 160 kilometres is quite an extensive length of road-but the outcome would be a huge profit in every regard for the Australian nation in reducing the cost of this form of infrastructure, such as for Gorgon and others, and opening up further opportunities to the eastern states to participate in the supply of equipment and other items that will be required, which, considering the location, can be shipped in from overseas countries. These are opportunities in which the Western Australian government can help out, and I can assure you that if the amounts of money mentioned here-$20-odd million-were applied to that road it would be an excellent start. But here we are being asked to take money off Western Australia for an organisation that does not exist, may never exist and, according to the speech by the Minister for Resources and Energy, is not expected to be in operation until 1 January 2012. I understand that the coalition-with the support of other senators, I am sure-will see this matter go to a Senate inquiry. But no case has been put by the government to grab this cash at this particular time, and I have some doubts in this regard as to whether the Western Australian government could disband the authority within its mines department that delivers this inspection capability at present. The member for Corangamite made some reference to his own state and, by the way, spent a substantial portion of his speech on climate change. If you can reduce the travel distance as I have already described by way of a transport link and a transport hub out of Kalgoorlie, there must be a reduction in the emissions involved in transferring the goods over a longer distance. It is very significant. As things stand now, the east-west railway line delivers into the Perth metropolitan area and then the trucks take off from there into the north, when in fact the carriages could be dropped off at Kalgoorlie, the semitrailers unloaded at a proper hub and then the prime movers could move in and go straight up the inland road, provided that the connecting link is available and they are not smashing their trucks up on the original standard. Those things need money, and it is inappropriate therefore for us to be considering legislation that reduces the capacity of the Western Australian government to do that sort of good work. But there are other interesting factors, and the member for Corangamite raised the issue of climate change. Apparently, the benefits to his electorate will arise from placing an emissions trading tax on the very industries we are choosing to speak about today because they are carbon based industries. But, more importantly, as I mentioned in a doorstop interview this morning, the issue of a great big tax has been widened with the coalition's quite proper initiative to give adequate support to women who wish to have a family and who must lose their employment income during that period. Marital leave and maternity leave is a good process, but some people have tried to talk about the taxes as both being the same. They are not. The proposal from our leader, Mr Abbott, is one whereby the profit of certain big companies will be subject to an income tax, a tax you only pay when you are making a profit. The emissions trading tax is a tax you pay even if you are going broke-that is irrefutableand it is why the coalition, under Peter Costello, got rid of sales tax. It was because that was a tax you had to pay when you were going broke. The GST gives business a rebate on such taxes as it flows through to the consumer. So this is pretty interesting. There is another issue relevant to representing the interests of Western Australia. Two-thirds of Australia's offshore oil and gas resources and over 80 per cent of Australia's offshore titles are based off the coast of Western Australia. So this is legislation almost exclusively covers Western Australia, notwithstanding the benefits that will arise with coal seam gas in Queensland and, as the member for Corangamite has said, in Bass Strait, but they are minuscule by comparison. Therefore Western Australian representatives have a big responsibility to put the argument on behalf of their constituencies. I was in discussion the other day with the member for Canning, who is a member of the coalition and a man of great commitment to the issues I have just raised. He will be opposed in the forthcoming election by the state member for Armadale-not the retired state member for Armadale, but the incumbent state member for Armadale and one time minister in the Gallop and Carpenter governments. In other words, she still has an office provided by the WA taxpayer, she still has her income and, on retirementpresumably just before the election-she will have a very substantial superannuation payout of an order. I wish we federal members could get. Mr Shorten-When are you going to retire? It's a bit rich for you to talk about super, but don't let the legislation get in your way.",54
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,Order! I ask members to come to order and I ask the member for O'Connor to come back to the legislation before the House.,57
30,Mr TUCKEY,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"By the way, I will make a loss on it and I am not hanging around here to get it. When we have these sorts of contests it is very interesting to see how attitudes change. The present state government is a Liberal-Nationals-‘coalition' is hardly the right word-group who I am pleased to say is getting on pretty well. It is over there making a fuss about this matter. During the period when the member for Armadale was in government, she on occathat sion after occasion complained about the treatment that the Western Australian government got from the Howard government. On 29 August 2001, 20 May 2003, 29 June 2004, 8 May 2005 and 25 August 2005 she was on the record quite properly arguing the case for WA. But there is a significance about those dates: there is no such matter on the record after 2007. Apparently since there has been a change of government in this place that member no longer thinks she has a responsibility to argue the case for Western Australia, as the incumbent member for Canning certainly does. Of course we had a huge debate over the Bunbury highway and her original position, as a minister for transport, in refusing an offer from the Howard government of $170 million to start that project. All credit to the member for Canning. These are most important issues when one looks at the particular issue under debate. That issue is one relative to whether an otherwise unexceptional piece of legislation can result in a clawback of money from the government of Western Australia, who has been doing a pretty good job in this regard. I want to talk a little about the relevance of its work to the oil and gas industry. Western Australia, as other states, relies heavily on payroll tax as a source of revenue. I do not have to convince the House that, when a major project employing 10,000 people-of which we can be very grateful-is in progress, payroll tax is significantly enhanced, for instance in Western Australia. Yet the previous state government was unable to secure for Western Australia the Inpex development from Browse, because they could not make up their mind where they might put a hub on the 6,000-kilometre coastline that exists between Broome and Darwin. They could not find a place. Colin Barnett, the incumbent Premier, fixed that up in no time. The interesting point is that the Japanese group obtaining gas from adjoining deposits was prepared to come ashore in the Kimberley in Western Australia and do its development. The payroll tax revenue from the wages it would have paid in such a circumstance would probably build a hospital in WA. It certainly would have funded the road that is essential to shortening the transport distances to that wonderful area of development in Australia and to making eastern states manufacturers more competitive with overseas manufacturers, as an example outside my state. The previous state government could not do it, so Inpex has gone to Darwin. Good luck to Darwin. It is not a very good environmental outcome. There are huge lengths of pipeline undersea, high-pressure requirements, more emissions and more emissions in the actual manufacture of the pipeline-all bad things. More particularly, the traditional landowners missed out on a billion bucks. It will not go to Indigenous people in Darwin because the deal was already done. We have a government in WA who this government believes cannot do the job. This government would like to take the responsibility off the good WA government, when after a very short period of time we now have the major projects coming to Western Australia.",57
31,Ms SAFFIN,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"I speak in support of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010 and the accompanying Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2010. The government is establishing a national offshore petroleum regulator to operate from 1 January 2012, and it is important to have the legislation passed to get the necessary legwork done in time and to allow for the retention of the funds from 1 July this year. It will be these funds that will fund the national offshore petroleum regulator. The objective of the main bill is to establish the regulator, and the aims are as follows: to strengthen the role of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority, to make clarifications on how titleholder provisions apply where titles are held jointly by two or more titleholders, to make clear a titleholder's responsibility under the occupational health and safety provisions of the act and to make technical amendments to achieve a more enforceable regulatory regime and update the act in a few areas. These amendments are minor policy and technical changes which, most importantly, pave the way for the establishment of the regulator. This will improve the ability of the authority to regulate the structural integrity of facilities, wells and well-related equipment, and it will clarify the way the provisions regarding titleholders relate to situations where title is held by two or more titleholders. There are no adverse effects on industry from these bills and no additional costs as such. Currently, all the money the Commonwealth receives from industry fees under the act and related acts is paid to the states and the Northern Territory. In order to fund the establishment of the regulator, the government will retain the fees paid under the registration fees act. The minister will be reviewing the fees collected under the act and associated acts to ensure that the states and the Northern Territory will be able to continue carrying out regulatory functions on behalf of the Commonwealth until such time as the regulator is established. The augmentation of the authority's functions is to ensure that it can effectively and fully regulate the structural integrity of troleum and greenhouse gas facilities, wells and well-related equipment, even where certain structures such as pipelines and wells may not have people at or near them for extended periods of time. These amendments do not extend the authority's role beyond that of an occupational health and safety regulator. The bills provide clarity in relation to ministrative arrangements for and treatment of obligations of titleholders in situations where title is held by two or more of them. They also provide that a titleholder's duties under the occupational health and safety provisions of the act relate only to wells. Under the safety regime, a range of people have duties to ensure worker health and safety, but critical information about the well and reservoir is held only by the titleholder. However, the amendments remove any possibility that a titleholder could be held directly responsible for facilities which it has no control over. The changes to certain offence provisions in the act which relate to titleholders are to make sure that offences can be more successfully prosecuted by making these offences ones of strict liability. As they currently stand, the provisions require intent to be proved in order for a prosecution to be successful. This is very difficult to do given the nature and remoteness of offshore operations in addition to the proliferation of multiple titleholder arrangements. The amendments remove the need to prove intent. In line with government policy regarding strict liability, these changes are being made to offences with physical elements. I want to make a general comment about the issue of strict liability. While I support these changes and understand the need in this situation-it is to do with occupational health and safety, which has to be a primary pe- concern-I retain an apprehension, if you like, about strict liability in general. It is probably my lawyer's background there. But I do understand that in this situation, when we are dealing with occupational health and safety, it is important-understanding how it works and how it operates in this particular situation. Other amendments include a minor coradrection updating the act to reflect recent changes in regulations and providing further transitional arrangement in the safety levies act to allow further time for the amendment of state and Northern Territory legislation. I will turn to schedule 1 of the miscellaneous measures bill; there are certain parts in it that I will make some comments on. Part 2 provides the authority with a clarified role and some strengthened functions, and this is important. These amendments make sure that the authority's existing functions, relating to the structural integrity and the soundness, strength and stability of offshore petroleum facilities, also expressly cover wells and well-related equipment. They also expressly give the authority an ability to examine nonoccupational health and safety aspects of structural integrity, and that is important. In ensuring such facilities and structures are safe when people engaged in petroleum activities are at or near these facilities and structures, the authority may need to take into account aspects of structural integrity which may not necessarily be directly related to occupational health and safety but which are nevertheless important to consider in assessing the integrity of the facility or structure. This is largely because certain structures, such as wells and pipelines, do not usually have people constantly near them. That is a good thing; however, when people are near them, they need to be safe. However, to be clear, these amendments do not extend the authority's role beyond that of a health and safety regulator. They just give them the power and the authority to do what is necessary so that they can carry out their role as regulator. I turn to the provisions covering multiple titleholders. Part 3 clarifies how the act applies when a petroleum or greenhouse gas title is owned by two or more titleholders, also known as multiple titleholders. This is common in the offshore resources sector. The amendments set out that, where multiple titleholders are making an application or request or giving a nomination or notice, they must nominate one of the titleholders to act on behalf of the others to make these applications. This part also makes clear that, where a title is owned by multiple titleholders while legal obligations under the act apply to each and every holder of a title, such obligations may be acquitted by any one of the holders. It is important to bring that fication into the act. Part 4 makes a number of offence provisions which apply to titleholders where the offences comprise physical elements onlythe offences of strict liability that I talked about but for physical elements only. These provisions relate to the physical doing or not doing of an act-so by commission or omission-and relate to provisions that require information and record keeping or require compliance with expected work practices or with the regulator's directions. Given the nature and remoteness of offshore petroleum activities, it is not always possible to have regulatory staff constantly and comprehensively monitor the activities of companies. Regulatory staff are thus dependent on the titleholder informing them of compliance with requirements and directions. Making these offences ones of strict liability removes the requirement to prove that the titleholder intended to do or not to do a certain act. In a situation that is about safety and where safety is paramount, it is absolutely essential that things be kept in pristine condition to minimise any damage or injury. It is very difficult to prove intention in these circumstances, as we know, particularly where there are more often than not multiple titleholders and, therefore, this serves to frustrate compliance efforts resulting in the need for these amendments. These are very important amendments. Even though I said they are minor and technical, they are nonetheless very important changes to the act because they are about improving health and safety, improving compliance, ensuring that those are of paramount concern and having the regulator that can deal with those issues. I did not know a lot about this industry some years ago. I think as Australians and particularly as parliamentarians it behoves us to know about the industry. It is very important to Australia clariand the Australian economy. It was during my time working and living in Timor-Leste that I got to know a lot more about this industry, which I found very beneficial and useful in the role that I am playing today as an elected member. With those comments, I commend the bills.",58
32,Ms MARINO,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"I rise to speak on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010. These two bills implement policy and technical amendments to the existing offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage legislation, much of which began under the coalition government. The safety levies bill provides transitional arrangements retrospectively from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2012 to impose a safety case levy in relation to designated coastal waters. This transitional period will give the states and the Northern Territory time to implement corresponding amendments and for the safety case levy to be collected through the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority in the interim. The coalition supports the transitional measures in the safety levies bill. However, the miscellaneous measures bill contains a number of amendments which are of major concern to Western Australia, to Western Australian members of parliament and, most significantly, to the Western Australian government and people of our great state. Part 1 of schedule 1 will see the Commonwealth retain industry registration fees from 1 July 2010 under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006. For practical purposes, the retention of the registration fees by the federal Labor government will see $15.3 million removed from the WA state budget in 201011 and $7.7 million removed in 2011-12. It appears to us that this is just the latest federal Labor government attack on the WA economy as a cash cow to help pay off the government's debt and deficit and, by default, prop up the economies of the failed Labor state governments. We are very well aware of the strength of the resources and agricultural sectors in our state of Western Australia. Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, as you would know very well from your electorate, WA produces 40 per cent of the nation's wheat and exports 60 per cent of the nation's wheat, providing 35 per cent of Australia's export wealth. Agricultural exports have been a key driver and a very major factor in keeping Australia from recession. The Labor government is expecting WA to keep delivering to the federal coffers via the resources and agricultural sectors in spite of providing a mere seven per cent of recent infrastructure spending in WA itself. This compromises the very growth the federal government is relying on to drive the national economy. My electorate, the south-west area of Western Australia alone, needs at least $750 million for immediate infrastructure to deal with capacity and productivity constraints in roads, rail and port facilities. This comes on top of plans by the government to strip $443 million from WA's share of the GST funding next year while-again-the failed Labor state of New South Wales will be rewarded with an additional $277 million, and Victoria with an additional $223 million. Recent data quoted by the WA state Treasurer shows that WA contributes $8 billion more to Commonwealth revenues each year through company tax, personal income tax and petroleum revenues than it receives back from the Commonwealth in grants and other expenditure benefits. As we know, WA has 10.4 per cent of the population but also has the highest growth rate in Australia of over three per cent-well above other states. By majority, this is driven by the major resources sector-something that I believe is not clearly recognised or valued by the federal Labor government. This is why I am also sure that the WA state Treasurer, Troy Buswell, will make very strong representations to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, given the effects of strong population growth on the state's capital works program. The long-awaited Henry tax review that the Labor government is failing to releaseat least prior to the election, it seemsproposes to scrap state based mining royalties and replace them with a federal resources tax. We in Western Australia are very aware that these royalties are really critical ongoing development of local mining communities in our resource-driven state. The next attack on the WA economy by the federal Labor government will come from the proposal to further strip the state of GST to fund the promise on the public hospital system. I note this has come under fire, as reported in the Age by two senior health leaders. John Deeble, the co-architect of Medicare, said the government's $50 billion reform package ‘is largely spin'; and Professor David Pennington, who headed the National AIDS Taskforce, is quoted as saying, ‘The plan would leave many hospitals in dire straits'. I also note that Ken Baxter, the former head of the premiers' departments in NSW and Victoria, has warned that GST would have to increase from 10 to 12½ per cent to pay for the Labor government's health plan. The federal health minister has also agreed that tax increases may be necessary. The resources sector is clearly a driving force in the Western Australian and Australian economies, and as this legislation will have a major impact on the Western Australian petroleum industry it will have a major impact on the WA economy. As the Deputy Director-General of the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, Stedman Ellis, stated in a presentation on 3 February 2010, ‘Petroleum projects cross boundaries from Commonwealth waters, state waters, islands and mainland areas, with industry most affected in WA.' Approximately two-thirds-close to 70 per cent-of Australia's offshore oil and gas resources and over 80 per cent of offshore titles are based off the coast of WA. Data from the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum shows that the state's petroleum sector grew in value by nine per to cent to $21.3 billion in 2008-09. The total sales value of this sector, which includes crude oil, condensate, natural gas and LNG, represents around 30 per cent of the total value of WA's resource industry. The estimated total value of WA's minerals and petroleum resources sector for 2008-09 was $71.31 billion. Projected growth in global energy demands are at least 30 to 40 per cent by 2030, and that will increase this value. We have all seen the $43 billion Gorgon project announcement off the coast of WA. It is Australia's largest offshore LNG find, with an estimated economic life of at least 40 years and with construction due to start next year. And the historic North-West Shelf projects like Pluto, Wheatstone and Browse are significant contributors to the Western Australian economy. The WA Department of Mines and Petroleum was recently asked to comment on the amendments included in this specific legislation. In their response they highlighted their very serious concerns relating to the establishment of a National Offshore Petroleum Regulator, and therefore cannot agree to the proposed legislative amendment for the Commonwealth to retain the registration fees. In addition, the loss of revenue for WA will come at a time when the state is being required to commit funding to infrastructure development for Gorgon and other major projects. Western Australia also considers that the respective functions and powers of the joint authority and designated authority need to be very clearly defined and should remain in the OPGGSA. There is concern that this amendment could diminish WA's functions and powers as regulation changes have less stringent requirements compared to act amendments. However, the Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum is supportive of, and has previously recommended, the inclusion of non-OHS structural integrity of facilities and pipelines as part NOPSA's responsibilities. The WA government, like the coalition, believes that there needs to be further consultation on this legislation-and we believe the Senate inquiry will expose further flaws within the legislation itself. Under a National Offshore Petroleum Regulator industry will pay additional costs to set up the NOPR and will maintain regulatory expertise in the Commonwealth and state regulators. The national regulatory models also remove two very important issues: the states' facilitation role and the local knowledge from regulatory decisions, and will result in a split regulatory regime. Companies will have to deal with a statutory authority and not directly with ministers. Given the significant impacts these implications will have, particularly on the Western Australian petroleum industry, I believe that the WA government and other stakeholders should be given the opportunity to put publicly their concerns on the record about the measures contained in this legislation through the Senate inquiry process. As I said earlier, the inquiry will more fully examine the immediate and longer term implications of the measures contained in this billsomething very dear to both your heart and mine, Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, particularly from a Western Australian perspective.",61
33,Mr SHORTEN,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (12.37 pm)-I rise to support the legislation before the parliament, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) of Amendment Bill 2010. There is no issue at work more important, in my experience, than workplace safety, and for the words I am going to give in support of this legislation I am indebted for the lessons of my time with the Australian Workers Union, particularly for the work of Dr Yossi Berger, David Healy, John Clarence, Stephen Price, Paul Howes, Cesar Melhem, Helmut Gries, Rod Currie, Jim Ward, .and also Tony MCDonald and George Parker, who both recently received well-deserved life memberships of the AWU. For me, the question of the simple things that we can do to ensure that workers on offshore platforms can go home safely to their families at the end of their shifts and rosters should always be at the heart of any debate that goes towards health and safety. We need to recognise that workplace fatalities that occur too often in Australian workplaces can be prevented-and I never use the word ‘accident' when I refer to fatality or serious injury at work. In my work I have, sadly, attended the funerals of men killed at work. They were not just miners killed by man-made tremors, factory workers killed by needless explosions and forestry workers hit by debris by explosions, but hydrocarbon workers burnt by negligent safety systems. Despite the best efforts of many-and I include the best efforts of this government and employers, unions and employees-there is still an endless list of sorrow and heartbreak. There is no consolation for the death of people at work, in particular perhaps for the death of young people in the full bloom of their health. We all know that there is no consolation. None of us believe there is any hope, inspiration or usefulness in it at all. All we can do is try and learn from these tragedies and hope to prevent them occurring again. The bills in this House today result from the government's intention to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator from 1 January 2012 to strengthen the role of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority. NOPSA is something that I and those in the Labor Party from the Maritime Union of Australia, the AWU and other unions campaigned for. It took us 10 years of agitating to have the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority established in 2005. I regret to say that the previous government played games of hide-and-seek, of show-and-tell, of foot dragging and delay. As a direct result of these delays safety on offshore oil and gas rigs and construction projects over water was placed under pressure and we are now dealing with accidents and explosions. Offshore facilities are inherently isolated and dangerous workplaces. There is a history of famous and not so famous tragedies on them, such as the Piper Alpha disaster in the United Kingdom and the BP Texas City disaster in 2005 which killed 15 people. The most recent event in Australia was at the Montara wellhead in the Timor Sea. It fortunately did not kill or injure anyone, but it did ger. pollute the surrounding seas with oil. This incident is currently being investigated independently through the rigorous procedures established by this government and the relevant minister. Under these bills, the government will retain fees raised under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006 to provide establishment funding for the national offshore petroleum regulator. These amendments make sure that NOPSA's existing functions relating to the structural integrity or the soundness, strength and stability of offshore petroleum facilities also expressly cover wells and well related equipment. They also expressly give them the ability to examine non-occupational health and safety aspects of structural integrity. Certain structures, like wells and pipelines, do not usually have people near them, but when they do they must be safe. This bill clarifies NOPSA's powers to ensure the safety of workers. The election of the Rudd government has seen a return of the importance of debate about occupational health and safety in this country. The past Liberal government did not seem to be greatly interested in talking about health and safety. There was much done to soften regulation, to reduce the power of watchdogs and, most importantly, to take the voice of workers out of the safety debate. There was plenty of vague speech of OH&S culture and safety management, of management of acceptable risk and risk assessments of the sort of management humbug that has seen people hurt in the past at work. They did not talk of the practicalities of keeping people safe, of the burning need to keep that principle at the heart of every workplace. There was little discussion of the laws and standards and the punishments for workplaces that put their employees' lives in danOne thing that was not discussed was the need to talk to workers about it. That was a no-go zone; that was a taboo. I recall very clearly their ideological opposition to unions, as typified by the mindless zealotry that was Work Choices. It meant that all too often they could not bring themselves to discuss safety with the people who dealt with hazards every day. As Dr Berger has written: It is difficult to achieve good occupational health and safety standards in a workplace atmosphere bristling with denial and a sense of unfairness. If you look at the record of the 12 years of the Howard government, why did they abandon the farmers? Why did they let dangerous chemicals, such as parathion-ethyl, a close relation of sarin nerve gas, continue to pollute our crops until the union banned it? They killed off Worksafe Australia and dispersed 100 fine researchers who would never again be gathered to do the work that they did so well as a critical mass before they were removed. We are returning some of that capacity through Safe Work Australia, and after a decade of neglect we are trying to bring health and safety back-a decade after those opposite put the wrecking ball through the lot. We are working with the states to harmonise national health and safety laws which will place an unqualified obligation on employers to provide a safe workplace and to enshrine the power for workers to stop unsafe work, a power currently only available to 14½ per cent of the Australian workforce. We want to restore the requirement for employers to talk to employees about work related matters that affect their health and safety. This is common sense to me and it is common sense unless you still wear the Work Choices blinkers, as some opposite do. One thing this government is doing is listening to workers, because they are the ones who see the risks every day. The offshore workers, the ones I had the privilege of visiting and working with over 15 years, particularly those in Bass Strait, worked for 10 years to get NOPSA established. We are not blinded by ideology to the value of the years of learned experience in the workplaces and unions across Australia, to the people who heard the complaints and concerns of workers, who visited the sites and who tried to stop the injuries before they happened. Whatever legislation we pass in this place and whatever good work is done by inspectors and regulators does not change the fact that safety in the workplace depends on us listening to workers. We need to ensure that every platform, every construction vessel and every pipe-laying barge has a strong OH&S committee and that each shift includes workers well versed in OH&S. They must be encouraged to report safety issues to management and to be included in discussions about safety. Risks taken for the sake of productivity should not be tolerated. We can and must do better. Zero harm is not a poster on a wall; it represents not just a desirable but a real and achievable outcome in the workplaces of this country. The struggle for safer workplaces is one that will never end. We also need to act to ensure the gains made in the past and to improve safety in the future. I suggest that good health and safety offshore is often a struggle of memory against forgetting and of remembering the lessons learned and the lives lost. It should be a struggle against the slow spread of complacency and the temptation to take shortcuts. These bills are a small step towards improving the chances that workers in the offshore hydrocarbon and petroleum industries will end their careers alive, with their limbs intact and with the ability to enjoy their retirement. But it would be remiss of me if I did not reiterate on the record that this bill, as with all safety legislation, has no relevance without effective, relevant and accurate inspections and very effective OH&S processes at the site. The former means that we need an experienced and well-supported inspectorate which must be encouraged to regularly inspect for OH&S standards as if their family were working there, not with an eye for not disrupting business. The latter observation about effective safety processes at site means that we must dispense with the blind faith in the regular nonsense that cultural change will suffice. We must dispense with the nonsense that can blind people to the fact that more and more risk is tolerated for the sake of productivity. I have seen first hand the aftermath of OH&S tragedy, where it is admitted with hindsight that plenty of shortcuts were taken by everybody but tolerated because of the various levels of denial. I have seen all too often the astonishment of the distressed manager. Again I am grateful for Dr Yossi Berger, from whom I will quote: ‘The astonished managers have the following or similar expressions of surprise after the tragedy: “I would never have thought”; “Not in my wildest dreams”; “That was totally unexpected”; “Who would've imagined?”; “I'd never have expected”; “I can't imagine why anyone would do that”; “How could you possibly see this happening?”‘ These are all recorded instances after fatality or amputation. Is it appropriate? Is it legitimate? Is and natural to express astonishment at the death or maiming of workers. I suggest it is not. I think it is very important that the regulator, with its new areas in the new legislation, should recognise that we need to take careful note of the opinions and experiences of people working in the offshore industry. The presence of a board alone will not make workers safer. I suggest, for example, an examination of the age of the helicopter fleet currently bringing in and taking workers and material from platforms in the offshore industry. Is the helicopter fleet that serves the Australian offshore industry amongst the 22 or 25 offshore oil production fields around the world one of the oldest helicopter fleets in the world, and does this mean that we are heading for disasters that are not yet being acted upon and, indeed, may not likely be acted upon with these changes? Finally, I also note for the new regulator the benefits of creating a small team of experienced workers or ex-workers-perhaps even the troublemakers-to promote the bad news, to act like OH&S ambassadors or badnews officers all around all offshore facilities. Sharing information like that would be invaluable. In modern organisations it is always easier to get promoted when you pass on the good news. The question in health and safety, I have found, is what the bad news is that is not being passed up an organisation. In the petroleum and hydrocarbon industry, what is the bad news that is not being heard by the regulator or by the employers? I think the challenge is to promote bad news as opposed to just wanting to hear good news. With that, I commend the bill to the parliament.",63
34,Mrs MOYLAN,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"I have listened quite closely to the comments of the parliamentary secretary, the member for Maribyrnong, and I have to say I concur it fair with the concerns that he has expressed about the importance of safe workplaces, especially in such dangerous and remote environments as exist in the oil and gas industry. Like the parliamentary secretary, I believe that there should be no compromise when it comes to the safety of individuals working in this environment, but neither the parliamentary secretary nor the minister in his second reading speech has made a case that would give rise to concern about a high accident rate off the coast of Western Australia. Indeed, the parliamentary secretary quoted major accidents abroad in Texas and in the North Sea. But that case has not been made and I would be very happy to find out more about the accident rate in Western Australia because of its offshore activities. I digress somewhat. I think there are some more covert agendas going on here. Once, the ever-emotive constitutional lawyer, Greg Craven, observed: Across the world, constitutions go down like South American currencies, producing mayhem and revolution … Why am I talking about constitutions in a bill dealing with offshore petroleum regulations? Simple. These seemingly benign issues go to the core of Australia's Federation. Over the past few weeks we have observed what is becoming a trademark of the current government-the, ‘I'll take that, thank you' approach to federal-state relations. Mining royalties, health care and the school curriculum are all being ponderedor should I say ‘plundered'-for a federal takeover. Now this bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2010 and the accompanying Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010, which is the one that I am perhaps speaking more to today, join the list. What does the federal government want? From Western Australia alone it wants $15.3 million in 2010-11; $60 million over a fouryear period. What will WA and the rest of the states get in return? Nothing. That is the situation, at least in the short term. That is because this money is going to be used for the federal government to fund a national offshore petroleum regulator, a regulator that has not yet been created, with no firm indication of when it will be created. The government says it will wait until mid-2012 to create the regulator-yet another layer of bureaucracy. Western Australia already has its own regulator. The West Australian government is understandably frustrated. As I indicated before, there are no firm plans to estabfor lish the regulator, but the federal government will take the money. In fact, it will be taken from July this year. The WA government submitted to the federal government a letter explaining that the loss of revenue will come at a time when Western Australia will be required to commit funding to infrastructure development for the Gorgon development, and Gorgon will be worth $64 billion over 30 years to this country and will employ 10,000 people at peak. Such a blatant tax grab by the federal government may impede important infrastructure projects in Western Australia. Quality infrastructure rationalises resource projects for the stakeholders, which in turn ensures maximum flow-on returns to both the people of WA and indeed all of the people of this great nation. We should not forget the difficulty of providing infrastructure in a state as large as Western Australia. It is the world's second largest subnational administrative division, covering a massive 2.6 million square kilometres. That is roughly the same size as Kazakhstan or five times the size of France, to get it into perspective. The West Australian government is undertaking massive infrastructure projects. Apart from Gorgon, another project is the Oakajee port and rail development. Oakajee is designed to open up WA's midwest, supporting resource development in the area and ensuring long-term economic prosperity for Western Australia and the nation. The project will cost in excess of $4 billion. Twenty-five kilometres north of Geraldton-that is, 445 kilometres north of Perth-there will be a deepwater multiuse port eventually capable of servicing a number of vessels, including iron ore bulk carriers and dedicated berths for export and import of bulk materials and containers. Five hundred and fifty kilometres of heavy haulage railway will be built to fit into existing railways, and 2,300 hectares will be set aside an industrial estate and processing facilities. Think then of the further infrastructure needs of the West Australian public, including roads to service these areas, airports, sewerage, electricity and accommodation for workers. With such massive commitments the West Australian government is understandably troubled by the Commonwealth holding money that would otherwise be distributed to the West Australian public, including to industry. But what will the federal government do with the money? Where is it going? Clause 2 in the schedule of the miscellaneous measures bill simply repeals subparagraph 76 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act, removing registration fees from the list of fees that the federal government normally would collect and then pay out to the states the following month. So the federal government will collect the money but not give it back. No mention is made, however, that the money will go to infrastructure projects. Approximately two-thirds of Australia's offshore oil and resources and 80 per cent of offshore titles are based off the coast of Western Australia. Yet no guarantee is given that any money will flow back to Western Australia. On the contrary, we have just seen the Prime Minister announce-and I will talk about that a little later should time permit-the carve-up of the GST, and Western Australia has been the loser in that carve-up. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association have argued that the industry should not pay any registration fees as it is essentially stamp duty which should have been abolished with the introduction of the GST. While I understand their advocacy for their industry, the massive infrastructure investment required in Western Australia overshadows and outweighs the fees collected. Of course it could be argued that vate industry may invest that money back into resource projects, but we have seen the problems of privately controlled infrastructure already in the north of Western Australia. What will the federal government do with this money? We do not know. The federal government does not seem to worry. It cherrypicks state revenue and responsibilities, removing local decision making to the faraway corridors of Canberra. Pru Goward, the New South Wales shadow minister for community services, wrote in the Australian this month: The home-insulation tragedy demonstrates once more the dangers of federal governments believing their own rhetoric and thinking that they can run the country. She continues, noting: … the further government are from services, the worse they are at delivering. There is nothing like immediate and local accountability to keep public administration on its toes. I say hear, hear to that. Pru is worried about how the federal government, just two hours drive down the road from her, can manage to gas do what is best. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you can imagine how people in Perth, five days drive away, feel. Some people wonder what all the fuss is about. But each time the federal government takes responsibilities away, it is chipping away at the foundations of Australia's federal system of governance. As an example, Greg Craven points to ‘the usefully rich West Australians', arguing: With their small population, they would have little say over their own circumstances in a unitary Australia. Western Australians already feel this is true. For instance, the recent changes to the GST returns I just alluded to mean that for every dollar paid in GST in WA, only 68c will be returned. But New South Wales will get a return of 95c, and Victoria will get 93c. Peopriple in WA feel that the state is being plundered. Premier Colin Barnett-responding to the recent federal carve-up of the GST, where there were large increases to the revenue of other states, whilst the revenue for WA contracted-put it bluntly when he said: This country depends on WA for the future growth of the whole nation ... It's not good for this state but it's not good for Australia. This slowing down the growth part of our economy. We all know that resources are, and will continue to be, the fuel for Australia's economic growth. We also know that they are finite. Ensuring the economic potential is maximised will require much cooperation between the federal government and the states. I stress that cooperation, not compulsion, is the key. If there is disagreement, the Prime Minister needs to communicate more effectively with the state governments, as he promised to do before the 2007 election, and we see little commitment to that. This legislation is a case in point. It is true that the federal government consulted the Western Australian government on this legislation. However, WA was given just one week to comment on the loss of $60 million over a four-year period. Where is the fairness in that? Where is the cooperative spirit so often spoken about by the Prime Minister? Bill Tinapple, the Executive Director of the Petroleum and Environment Division of the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, even made that point in his letter to the government. Writing on the proposed tax grab, he stressed: I do not believe that to unilaterally impose this amendment is in the spirit of cooperative federalism publicly embraced by the Federal Government. Federalism is not perfect-I acknowledge that; it is like democracy in that sense-but it has served us well. Lord Acton, the 19th century British historian and politician reasoned: The true natural check on absolute democracy is the federal system, which limits the central government by the powers reserved, and the state governments by the powers they have ceded. Balance is the key. Increasingly, however, the balance of power is going to the federal government. Michelle Grattan, in her piece ‘Federalism turns on financial carrots and Canberra's big is stick' quotes AJ Brown, a professor of public law at Griffith University who runs a federalism project. Professor Brown remarks that ‘the debate we are not having is what should be devolved, how we are going to get more diversity.' Professor Brown is correct. Where is the debate about diversity? Have we forgotten that our Federation was established to reflect the vast diversity of this enormous country? Why is it always thought that being the same is good? Where is the recognition that the states and their administrations are competent? The wonderful thing about our democratic system of governance is that if the people do not like the way their specific jurisdiction is governed they will sack the incumbents. The state governments go to the polls every four years and the public, the voters, get to have the ultimate say. If the state governments are not administering the affairs of the states fairly and in a proper manner, they lose government. That is the ultimate sanction that the public has a right to impose. If the people are unhappy with the way their state is administered, they can express it at the polls. The question ‘Can Canberra do it better?' does not always need to be asked, but increasingly it is. There is nothing that we have done in this place in terms of administering programs out in the communities that demonstrates that we are any better at it. In fact, I hasten to say that the insulation program can demonstrate that we were much worse than we should have been, and that is costing this nation millions of dollars now to rectify. There is a perception that the federal government is the ‘better' government. With more money, resources and national reach at its disposal, it can appear that the federal government is better equipped to handle significant issues facing Australians. The reality was proven, as I said, by the insulation scandal. The federal government cannot always manage programs effectively, and the cost to the nation can be very high. The tragedy of the insulation program shows us that centralising more power in Canberra should not be the default position. If there are problems with federal-state cooperation, work at it-do not just ditch it; do not just seize power; do not just deny states the revenue for them to be able to govern effectively. We are seeing this in the health debate. It is like shifting the chairs on the deck of the Titanic while it is sinking. This is about inadequate revenue to the states to run the health system effectively. I do not believe that the federal government are going to be able to make any difference by just grabbing the money back off the states and then reallocating it to suit their priorities. That necessarily going to deliver better health care to Australians. But I digress. I just think that we should give the state governments more than one week to comment on proposals that have such an impact on them. It is not a good situation. There is continual talk of cooperative federalism, but I am afraid the rhetoric does not match the actions of the government in this respect. The Western Australian government has raised concerns with this legislation and with the national offshore petroleum regulator that this fee grab is supposed to fund. These concerns are not insurmountable. More consultation is required. The views of the Western Australian government should be heard and should be taken notice of. Listen to the states. Respect the framework of the Constitution. Realise that the solutions do not always lie in Canberra. There is a reason that we do not have the mayhem and revolution described by Greg Craven, which I quoted at the beginning of this speech: our Constitution is well drafted and provides the balance that Lord Acton describes. That balance should not be so whimsically and carelessly upset. There have been mining royalties, health care and the school curriculum, and now there is this blatant tax grab. What are the states getting in return? From this legislation, Western Australia are not getting anything for their money-certainly not at the moment. The federal government, in the minister's second reading speech, indicated that there will be a delay in the appointment and establishment of a regulator. So why start plundering the funds that are currently going to the state government of Western Australia in July this year when there is no intention of doing anything about a regulator until some time in 2012? I think the public have a right to be cynical about these kinds of moves by this government. I urge the federal governis not ment to properly consult with the Western Australian government, to listen to their concerns and to find a solution that is agreeable to all. I know that under the leadership of Colin Barnett, the Premier of Western Australia, a lot of progress was made early on in this. I know that there has been cooperation between the state of Western Australia and the Australian government on establishing the Oakajee port and a number of other infrastructure projects. But I think we have seen in the last year a major breakdown in proper communications with the states and this blatant grab for power and whatever money can be extracted. One has to question how this money might be distributed in the future, certainly given that Western Australia is the loser in the recent re-carve-up of the goods and services tax.",66
35,Mr HAYES,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"I rise today to lend my support to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2010 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Amendment Bill 2010. The fact is that, with 80 per cent of Australia's electricity generated from coal, no serious response to climate change can ignore the need to clean up coal and our coal fired industries. As I, and most people on this side of the chamber, have said in this House before, we as legislators need to ensure that we have the regulatory environment that encourages the commercialisation of technologies that will play a part in our overall energy needs for the future. Central to that is carbon capture and storage, geosequestration-the ability to strip carbon from coal fired power stations and inject that into the ground. That is going to be a central theme if we are going to be serious about cleaning up our industry and meeting our power production needs as they climb and also if we are going to be serious about encouraging renewable energy into this power mix. Carbon capture and storage is essential for the long-term sustainability coal fired power electricity generation and to realise the potential of new industries. I know the Minister for Resources and Energy, who is at the table, has been very passionate about coal-to-liquid technology, which would improve Australia's liquid transportation fuels security. The coal industry is highly significant not only in relation to Australia's economic prosperity but also in relation to the world's current and forecasted energy needs. As I stated a little earlier, coal currently provides 80 per cent of Australia's electricity generation capacity. But, in terms of the world's needs, it provides something like 40 per cent. So coal is not something that is going to disappear. Therefore, we need to concentrate on those technologies that can ameliorate the effects of emissions. One that is central to that is carbon capture and storage. This legislation will do a number of things, but it will not cause people or industries to go out and start investing in carbon capture and storage. What it will do is start finessing some of the regulatory aspects that are going to be essential to improve this aspect of the industry. Like the member for Maribyrnong, I too worked with the Australian Workers Union. Essentially, my responsibilities for a long period of time included the North West Shelf. I represented workers on various offshore facilities, ranging from the North West Shelf of Western Australia up to the Timor Sea. I know first hand the challenges involved in the exploration industry and I have seen first hand the dangers that are apparent in that style of industry. It is a highly competitive industry and it is quite remote from the mainland and certainly remote from the general reach of regulators. I support the call from the member for Maribyrnong regarding our need to work to ensure that safety on offshore facilities is paramount. One of the things that this legislation seeks to do is fiof nesse the regime in terms of, for example, safety around wellheads for people such as derrickmen and tool pushers. This will be absolutely critical for their safety in the workplace. I am talking about carbon capture and storage as a technique for assisting the amelioration of emissions. I have just come from a meeting of climate change scientistsProfessor David Griggs from Monash University and Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg from the University of Queensland. They have also been talking to other membersand, as a matter of fact, they are lunching with other members at the moment. They wanted to talk to us about the science associated with climate change. Due to the regrettable issues associated with one chapter within the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the hacked emails at the University of East Angliacommonly referred to as ‘climategate'these particular scientists are very keen to ensure that members of this House understand the reality of climate science and the fact that it is not being seriously contested amongst the scientists working in the field. I know anyone can go and spend four years at a university and come away with a science degree-and I do not mean to demean people who have science degrees-but not everyone examines the changes that have occurred in the climate. One thing these entists stressed at their recent meeting with me was that the global climate system has warmed significantly over the last century and continues to warm. They sought to bring the evidence forward that increased global temperatures mean that there is going to be lower atmosphere and surface temperatures, an increase in the heat and content of global oceans, and an increase in sea levels. They say these are now matters of fact in terms of the empirical evidence from the scientists in this field; that it is beyond contention. Despite the issue of hacked emails-and, perhaps, scientists being overly bureaucratic-and despite the paragraph that appeared in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this should not deter people from thinking that the reality that climate change is real. It should not be taken that there is some new-found science-and this applies to our colleagues on the other side of the House-that gives weight to the arguments of the climate change sceptics and deniers. We are committed on this side of the House to getting on and doing the job that we were given at the last election-that is, moving to address climate change. I know we are experiencing very serious frustrations in the Senate at the moment. I know a policy change has occurred on the other side of the House that being a climate change denier now is no longer something that should be sneered at. It seems that they have a policy which has gone a long way to accommodate the views of the climate change deniers. But this is not a matter of politics. We must now rely on the best science we have available and use that science to project a methodology that will advance this country and allow us to play our role in terms of a world response to climate change. This bill makes minor policy and technical sci- changes which will, importantly, pave the way for the establishment of a National Offshore Petroleum Regulator, improve the ability of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority to regulate the structural integrity of facilities, wells and well related equipment, and clarify the way a range of provisions regarding titleholders relate to situations where a title is held by two or more titleholders. It is important to recognise that there will be no adverse effects on industry from this legislation. By way of background, all the money the Commonwealth receives from industry fees under the act and related acts is presently paid to the states and territories. In order to fund the establishment of the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator, the is government intends to retain those fees paid under the registration fees act. However, as the minister stated in his second reading speech, he will review the fees collected under the act and associated acts to ensure that the states and territories will be able to continue carrying out their regulatory functions on behalf of the Commonwealth until such times as the regulator is established. The adjustments in this legislation provide another step towards working out a greenhouse gas storage reality. This is something that needs to occur and must occur if we are serious about addressing the issues of climate change, having regard to the fact that we are reliant on carbon based energy sources. I commend this legislation to the House.",70
36,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE,"BatmanMinister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (1.21 pm)-in reply-I welcome the opportunity to make some concluding remarks in this complex debate that is very much central to our future economic opportunities as a nation. In that context, I express my appreciation to the members for Groom, O'Connor, Forrest, Pearce, Maribyrnong, Page, Corangamite and Werriwa for their contributions. I want to respond to a few issues raised by the other side of the House. I firstly go to the comments by the former resources minister, the member for Groom, opposing the removal of registration fees. I simply note that the Commonwealth first proposed the removal of such registration fees in 2002-when, I might say, the current shadow minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was a key member of the government. Perhaps he should reread a little bit of recent history in terms of the previous government's attitude to one of the key issues before the House today. I also acknowledge the member for Groom's comments regarding consultation. I simply say that the need for further consultation is understood by me, as the minister, because we are talking about the future regulation of one of Australia's key future economic opportunities. For example, we currently export about $10 billion of LNG per year. By 2015-16 that could easily grow to $50 billion per year. For those reasons, I will not be seeking to take further action on these bills until after the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has completed its inquiry into the legislaCommonwealth tion and until I have had an opportunity for further discussions with the Ministerial Council on Minerals and Petroleum Resources, which are scheduled for the end of May of this year. The reason I say that is because, in finalising the government's view on the potential need for a national regulator, I also want to consider the context of the Montara commission report. I say that because in the last 18 months I think we have been very fortunate as a nation. We have actually had two major incidents in the petroleum industry-the Varanus incident and the recent Montara accident. I think we should properly inform ourselves of the potential ramifications and potential changes in regulatory regime required as a result of those accidents. For those reasons, I will proceed with caution, because I actually want to get it right. I also believe that is the desire of the former minister, the member for Groom, who is at the table, and of the current shadow minister, Senator Minchin, who is also a former minister. Also during that period I will have further consultation with the relevant stakeholders not only at an industry peak council level through the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association but also with individual companies. I have indicated this to a meeting of members of the council of APPEA this morning. I also go to the comments by the members for O'Connor, Forrest and you, Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan. I simply observe for the information of the House that the fees we are talking about are fees generated by the transfer of property not in Western Australia but in Commonwealth waters and are therefore fees properly characterised as Commonwealth revenues. I think the Commonwealth is entitled to have regard for the proper use of its revenue for the purposes of the regulation of this industry. It is therefore important to note that the proposal with respect to the national offshore petroleum regulator contemplates all revenue raised under the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage legislation being applied to the regulation of this industry with none going into general revenue-which I do not think is necessarily the current case with respect to the activities of state and territory governments. I simply advise the House that this is also what the industry expects: if revenue is collected it is actually used for the regulation of its industry, not for other purposes by state and territory governments. I also refer to your comments, Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, that the case for NOPSA has not been made out. I simply reiterate that if you have got any doubts about the proper consideration of these matters, you should pay close attention to the Varanus report-when it is finally released by the Western Australian minister for mines and petroleum, as it is currently in his hands and we await its release in the Western Australian parliament-and the recent Montara incident. The public hearings by Commissioner Borthwick have now commenced and we will be paying close regard to those proceedings and the eventual report presented to the government by Commissioner Borthwick. In my opinion, the status quo is no longer an option. These bills also appropriately amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Safety Levies) Act 2003. Importantly, they put in place a mechanism to fund the establishment of a new regime for regulating Australia's offshore petroleum industry. For those reasons the government is acting on the independent recommendations of the Productivity Commission review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum-oil and gassector. Whilst there is to be a reference to Senate economics committee, I think the committee should apprise itself of the existing body of work prepared by the Productivity Commission following a detailed process of public consultation and proper consideration of appropriate recommendations aimed at removing the regulatory burden on this key industry. Reducing the cost of regulatory activities and duplication is one of the desired objectives of not only the Productivity Commission but also the industry and the Commonwealth government and, I might say, most state and territory governments. Such a mechanism needs to be put in place, in my opinion, as soon as is practicable. There will therefore be, in establishing such a regulatory organisation, substantial start-up costs, but these new regulatory regimes must come into operation sooner rather than later. As I indicated in my second reading speech, I do not expect to introduce legislation establishing a national offshore petroleum regulator until next year, as discussions regarding the exact arrangements are ongoing with the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources. The ministerial council's consideration of these matters cannot properly be finalised until ministers have had the opportunity to consider any relevant recommendations of the Montara Commission of Inquiry, which is due to report by the end of April. There is an opportunity now for discussions and consultations in the lead-up to that report, but in my opinion the report will very much finalise the government's consideration of the need for this regulatory change. For reasons consistent with this approach, the government will not press for the Senate to give consideration to this legislation until after the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources has had the opportunity to further consider the Montara commission report at a meeting scheduled for the end of the May. That is a commitment I have given to the ministerial council, which I detail publicly in accordance with the undertakings I have given them-volunteered by me as the Commonwealth minister. I go to other small but important amendments, including: the strengthening of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority's functions and powers to more effectively enforce the safety regime; the streamlining and clarification of provisions in relation to multiple titleholders to benefit regulators and titleholders alike; improvements to enforcement and compliance aspects of the regulatory regime; and the clarification of titleholders' occupational health and safety duties in relation to wells. While there is a difference between the government and opposition at the moment on some aspects of the bill, I understand that there is largely a strong sense of agreement between both sides of the House with respect to these matters. In essence, these bills underscore the government's commitment to the maintenance and continual improvement of a strong, effective framework for the regulation of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas activities. I commend the bills to the House, but in doing so I reiterate the undertakings that I have given to the opposition, industry and state and territory ministers with respect to how I will proceed to finalise the government's consideration of these complex matters.

40,Mr HUNT,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,"The opposition supports the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Recreational Fishing for Mako and Porbeagle Sharks) Bill 2010. We support it because we proposed it. We support it because we argued for it. We support it because we ran a campaign through the agency of Senator Richard Colbeck over summer to bring this bill to pass. The bill rectifies another error from the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett. It was patently obvious to everybody associated with recreational fishing in Australia that the government had made a mess of the recreational fishing sector in November last year when the minister listed for prohibition recreational angling for mako and porbeagle sharks. He did that despite there being no evidence that these sharks were facing an extinction threat in Australia. And it came as a result of the government's own attempts to get these sharks listed on an international convention which related to Northern Hemisphere stocks but not Southern Hemisphere and, in particular, Australian stocks. The sult was very simple: a healthy recreational fishing sector was cut off. It was through the agency of Senator Richard Colbeck and through the numerous different fishing associations in Australia, such as the Game Fishing Association, RecFish, TARFish, VRFish and the Fishing and Boating Council, that we were able to get a successful campaign up and running throughout the summer to make it clear that that decision by Minister Garrett was wrong and needed to be overturned. This bill seeks to overturn the decision by Minister Garrett. It was introduced by the minister to rectify his own error. It is the latest in a series of errors which undermine his ability to continue in his portfolio. We have elsewhere made the case that the serious errors that led to catastrophic human consequences in the Home Insulation Program should have been in themselves enough to terminate the minister's ministerial career. This is another error. What we saw was a decision by the minister to operate through an international forum which was carried out with blind disregard to the circumstances in the waters around Australia. A recreational fishing sector which been conducted carefully, which had been managed well, which had operated appropriately, was brought to its knees overnight. The ban was due to come into force on 29 January. On 25 January the minister announced the reversal of his position. This bill now seeks to bring to pass the changes which the recreational fishing sector campaigned for and which my state colleague Neale Burgess MP, the state member for Hastings in Victoria, Sarah Henderson, the Liberal candidate for the seat of Corangamite, and Bob Baldwin also campaigned for. We know that Senator Colbeck led the charge on the campaign, which I helped participate in. These changes should not have been necessary. It was a bad decision. The minister re- should have recognised that at the outset, having made a bad decision. It should not have required public meetings around southern New South Wales and the Victorian coast to have it reviewed. There were 300 fishing folk who came to Hastings, just near my office. They met outside for a public meeting. There were 500 who went to the coast in Corangamite for a meeting organised by Sarah Henderson. There were also meetings elsewhere in Tasmania. It should not have required a major public uprising by the fishing community to show the errors of the minister's ways. However, there is a systemic problem in the way in which the government has gone about managing many environmental issues: snap, unilateral decisions, taken without any understanding of the consequences, have brought about unintended outcomes. We saw that in relation to the Home Insulation Program most catastrophically. We saw that in relation to the Green Loans Program, which has been a financial disaster for thousands and thousands of assessors who relied upon the work of the government. We saw that in relation to the overnight cessation of the sohad lar rebate program, which was put in place by the previous government and mismanaged by the current government. And now we see that in relation to the management of Australia's fisheries and the decision to bring recreational fishing to its knees overnight on the basis of no scientific evidence. Now that the minister has reviewed his position it has been confirmed that there was no scientific evidence as the basis for that decision. So it is very clear that what the public saw, what the recreational fishing community saw, what Sarah Henderson saw, what my state colleague Neale Burgess saw, and above all else what Senator Richard Colbeck and the member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin, saw, was correct: this was a sustainable, well-managed recreational fishing sector involving highly capable and competent people, such as the Game Fishing Association of Australia, RecFish, TARFish, VRFish and the Fishing and Boating Council. All of these groups did the right thing. They helped collect 9,000 signatures. A petition was tabled in parliament opposing the ban. There was a massive phone campaign by those recreational fishing community members. They have done a tremendous job. I am delighted that this bill has been drawn to the parliament's attention, that the bill has been introduced. We campaigned for it, we support it, we believe in it and we will now see that it passes through the parliament as expeditiously as possible. I thank the members of the fishing community who brought it into being. I commend the bill and I condemn the minister.",76
41,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,"The member for Flinders, an eloquent speaker at the best of times, tells a story",78
42,Mr HUNT,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,At the best of times?,78
43,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,"I will give credit where it is due. He tells a story but he never tells the full story. I would like to correct record for those listening and for Hansard. Essentially, what we have in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Recreational Fishing for Mako and Porbeagle Sharks) Bill 2010 is an amendment, required because this government was forced under the legislation of the former government-that is, the government of the member for Flinders made it mandatory-to list a threatened species in our legislation. That is what the member for Flinders did not say: under the legislation that we are bound by, both nationally and through our signing of the convention of 1991 in relation to this, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, it was mandatory",78
44,Mr HUNT,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,Except you guys argued for the listing of the species in the first place!,78
45,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,"The member for Flinders, who wants to make a noise or a squeak on the way out of the House, at least now knows what the full story is. I wish that he would tell the full story. He forgot to mention that members on this side of the House, the member for Braddon-moi, if he has forgotten-and the member for Corangamite, to name two, along with their communities of fishers, were also onto this issue, which arose because we were forced by the former government's legislation to carry out our obligations. That is what a responsible government does. In his frenzied attack on the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, the member for Flinders forgot to mention (1) that the minister himself was bound by the act and (2) that the minister moved quickly. To resolve this issue upon investigation required more than regulatory changes. It also required more than administrative changes. It required a legislative change. Nothing moves quickly in this place. Noththe ing moves quickly unless those opposite are trying to think up a new policy on the run. Nothing moves quickly in this place when drawing up legislation. However, that is what this amendment is designed to do. I am glad that those opposite are going to support this, because we are trying to introduce an amendment to fix up a situation which does not allow enough flexibility and unfortunately has negative consequences for offence provisions under the current act. That is what this legislation is essentially trying to do. I would like to take the House through this because it is an important story and it is going to have a positive result-not just because we have both sides of the House going about our business, as we should, in a responsible way but also because it will allow recreational fishing to continue in a sustainable way in our waters, particularly down Tassie way. We have magnificent waters both onshore and offshore and we have a lovely recreational fishing industry. I encourage everyone to come down and participate in it. I think I am the only person who does not fish up my way. No doubt I will develop the patience to do that. Effectively, as the minister made clear in his second reading speech, the introduction of this legislation is trying to overcome an inflexible provision under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999. It intends to make recreational fishing of shortfin mako, longfin mako and porbeagle sharks legal. Once any species is listed under appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals as being in dire threat or under appendix II as maybe being threatened, under the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 of this country we are obligated to list it as a threatened species. That is what happened. We were obligated under an international convention and our national law to list them. Once that was done, it unfortunately threatened recreational fishing, particularly of the shortfin mako shark. That is basically what the situation is. Rightfully so, fishing groups, particularly recreational fishing groups, were mad about this. That was for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is an important recreational hobby. People have been doing it for a long time and have invested in equipment-particularly boats, reels and so forth-and it is important to them. Secondly, it plays an important part in recreational fishing clubs. Thirdly, in the main, the fishing of mako sharks in particular and most of our recreational fishing is done in a very sustainable way. As the member opposite pointed out, there was no scientific evidence to suggest that the mako shark was threatened in our waters. We acknowledge that. But what the member for Flinders did not point out was that under the 1999 act of the former government and because of our obligations to the international Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals we were obligated to put a moratorium on the fishing of the mako shark. That is the situation. Those opposite will ask why we did not just ring up and say, ‘Hey, forget about it.' The problem is that under those obligations we could not make a regulatory change, nor could we make an administrative change. This required a legislative change, which we now have before this House. We acted a hell of a lot quicker than those opposite ever acted on any other issue requiring legislation. The point is that we are obligated under the current act, the act of the former government, and under appendices I and II of the international convention listing threatened species. Mr Baldwin interjecting",78
46,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,"No amount of catcalling from the member for Paterson is going to change that. It is very sad that the member for Flinders did not tell the whole story in his attempts to run out and attack the minister for the environment. He forgot to mention, too, that those on this side of the House have been working constructively and closely with the fisher groups and also with the minister to get this change. But the member for Flinders did not mention the member for Braddon. He did not mention the member for Corangamite and others. Why would that be? He was not trying to score a political point, was he? Was he really trying to fix the situation or was he trying to ramp up some public meetings and put out another petition, knowing very well that the minister would meet the obligation to introduce legislation rather than regulation and administration to change the current law forced on us as part of the Howard government's legislation? The minister acted responsibly and quickly, and I thank all those on this side who worked with the minister instead of grandstanding in little public meetings, knowing very well that we could do nothing until the legislation was passed. I commend the minister for his action on this. I certainly commend the member for Corangamite-and the member for Braddon, frankly-and all those on this side who tried to do something about it. Shame on the member for Flinders for not telling the full story about what was necessary to change this legislation.",79
47,The SPEAKER,FISHING FOR MAKO AND,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Braddon will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Home Insulation Program",80
48,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and I refer the Prime Minister to remarks made last Friday by the Secretary of the new Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, who told a meeting of 700 staff: It's not like DCC has any expertise in this area. DCC is not a program manager … I know nothing about program design, about program delivery, about program risk management. Given this damning admission, how can the public have any confidence that the government can fix the massive public policy failure of its Home Insulation Program?",80
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, Minister Combet, as the Leader of the Opposition would know, has been handed responsibility for the wind-up of the Home Insulation Program. Secondly, the department which has energy efficiency functions within it has also brought in a new departmental deputy secretary to deal with these matters. Thirdly, I say to the honourable Leader of the Opposition that the minister also intends to engage very closely with industry, unions and regulators to ensure that risks going forward are managed in the best possible way. Furthermore, could I advise the Leader of the Opposition that the minister's department will be guided in design and implementation of the scheme by an independent advisory panel. This will include Dr Ron Silverberg, ex-managing  tional Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union; and Mr Tony Arnel, the Victorian building and plumbing commissioner and Chair of the Green Building Council of Australia. This panel of experts has also been commissioned to advise on the proposed implementation arrangements for the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme. Hospitals",80
50,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the need for reform in Australia's health system after years of neglect and inaction?,80
51,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They had 12 years to do something about the health system of Australia and they did nothing-absolutely nothing. The Leader of the Opposition and I were privileged to be invited to last night's annual dinner of the Australian Medical Association. I listened very keenly to hear a policy speech from the Leader of the Opposition. What I heard again were a number of political oneliners destined for media consumption but not destined for real policy change. I also appreciate the support for the government's plan which we received last night from the head of the AMA, Dr Pesce, who said: We are heading for a once-in-a-generation change to the way health services are delivered and funded and managed in this country. … … … From the top, the Commonwealth must have a greater funding and national planning role. And from the grassroots, there must be more clinician input to decision-making at the local level, to ensure funding meets local needs. That is what the head of the AMA said last night in support of the government's plan. In the months leading up to the release of the government's plan only last week, the Minister for Health and Ageing and I travelled across the country to speak with doctors, nurses, patients and those who are intimately associated with the health and hospital system of Australia. Whether it is in Hobart or in Darwin or in Perth or in Parramatta, right across the country there is one clear message: not enough hospital beds, not enough doctors and not enough nurses. On the question of nurses, in 2008 Access Economics estimated that around 6,000 additional nurses would be needed each year to 2025 over and above the current graduations of 9,000 a year. On GPs, the health department estimated that demand for GP services is likely to increase by around 15 per cent by 2020 on current trends and the current GP training pipeline will not meet this demand growth. These are the workforce challenges that we now face. Of course, if you have an insufficient supply of doctors and nurses, what results is longer waiting times. The NHHRC reported that data indicates that the median waiting time across all types of elective surgery was 34 days in 2007-08, up from 28 days in 200304-getting worse and worse. On emergency departments, 31 per cent of patients presenting in emergency departments in 2007-08 were not seen within clinically acceptable times. This is the direct product of sustained underinvestment in the system by the Australian government and governments across the nation. Back in July of 2006, when a certain Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Health and Ageing, he got a letter from the local head of the AMA warning him and warning the government of the looming crisis in medical training. This is what the head of the AMA had to say to the Leader of the Opposition when he was discharging such a fine set of responsibilities as health minister of Australia. This is what the AMA warned back in 2006: … without urgent action by all governments, Australia will have a new generation of doctors who … will struggle to gain the detailed education and significant clinical skills needed to practise independently. He went on to say that this would: … have catastrophic effects on the medical workforce, our hospitals, and the access to quality health care that patients rightly expect. That is what the head of the AMA wrote to the Leader of the Opposition when he was in the position of health minister of Australia. What did the Leader of the Opposition as health minister of Australia do in response to this representation from the AMA? Nothing. Instead, the then health minister decided to rip out $1 billion from the public hospital system, and that $1 billion is the equivalent of 1,025 hospital beds. They do not like this number-$1 billion ripped out by Tony Abbott when he was minister for health, which is the equivalent of 1,025",80

I am assuming that the Leader of the Opposition did withdraw. He then rose to make a different point, to which I have made comment. The Manager of Opposition Business appears to be aggrieved about my opinions on that. Is the Manager of Opposition of Business rising on a point of order?  not aggrieved by your statements. I simply make the point, as understanding order 91(f), that you have said that it is not your problem.

On the element of his comment-rather than point of order-that of course the behaviour of any member is my problem, I acknowledge that.

That is done at the end of question time, and I think that what we find today is consistent with the way in which the House has conducted its business in the past. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Certainly I was aware, both as Leader of the House and when I was Manager of Opposition Business, that when the Speaker requires a comment to be withdrawn it should be done unconditionally.

70,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the information of the Leader of the Opposition, I draw his attention to the budget papers of 2003-04. On page 179, under the Australian healthcare agreement itemised at that time, for 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, the following figures are listedMrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",83
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar is warned.,83
72,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In 2003-04, minus $108 million; 2004-05, minus $172 million; 2005-06, minus $264 million; 2006-07, minus $372 million. I simply go through those figures to draw them to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. I also draw to the Leader of the Opposition's attention that when he was minister for health, while he may be uncomfortable about his record, he also imposed a cap on GP training places. I can understand full well why the Leader of the Opposition is sensitive about his record as health minister-a sensitivity which is only underpinned and surpassed by his undertaking to the Australian people, that absolute ironclad guarantee, that there would be no change to the Medicare safety net-a rock solid, ironclad guarantee, until after the election. That is the what the Leader of the Opposition did when he was health minister. What we have done in the two years we have been in office through the agency of the minister for health is increase the number of GP training places by some 35 per cent. That is what we have done. From 2009 universities offered an additional 1,094 undergraduate nursing places. That is what we have done. On top of that, in terms of funding to our public hospitals, we have increased our allocation to hospitals in the states and territories by some 50 per cent. If you want three concrete pieces of action, those are they. Those opposite, not content with their cord on health and hospitals reform, which is a dismal record, right now in another place, in the Senate, are seeking to block important pieces of legislation and stand in the way of further reform to the health and hospital system. They are blocking changes to PHI-a blocking which will result in taxpayers paying $2 billion, money which could be better invested in public hospital beds across Australia. On top of that, they in the Senate have refused to pass landmark legislation giving more support and recognition to our midwives and nurse practitioners. This is unacceptable. Those opposite find this to be a passing irritant; they do not think that nurse practitioners and midwives are important. We on this side of the House do. Dental services have been blocked by those in the Senate; they have refused to pass legislation for Australia's first ever preventative healthcare agency. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is time on health and hospitals reform that he just got out of the road, that he actually allowed the government to get on with the business of fundamental health and hospital reform for the future. We intend to get on with the business of bringing about this reform for Australia. I will be consulting with the premiers and chief ministers in the days ahead, prior to COAG in April. We have a plan for the future. I will begin that process with the Premier of New South Wales in Sydney tomorrow. I will travel to every state capital in the country and every territory capital to bring about the needed reforms for our health and hospital system for the future. Home Insulation Progam",83
73,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the government's concession that foil insulation is a potential death trap and that the 50,000 homes installed with it must now fire- nally be inspected and repaired. Given that insulation products installed under the Prime Minister's scheme have so far caused at least 105 house fires, and given that 240,000 homes are likely to have dangerous or dodgy insulation, will the Prime Minister guarantee that all of the more than one million homes installed with potentially dangerous or dodgy insulation will also receive a thorough safety inspection?",84
74,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I also draw the honourable member's attention to a statement delivered in this place by the minister responsible for energy efficiency, Minister Combet, yesterday. Based on advice received by that minister, I would also say to the honourable member who has asked the question that those who have received foil insulation will have the option of having either that foil insulation removed or safety switches installed. That will apply to all the homes he has referred to. This also is based on advice from the Master Electricians of Australia and the National Electrical Contractors Association.

If that means that people think that I will willingly allow them to interrupt proceedings based on raising points of order when they are aware of what I am doing, I will not. I will clearly say to the member for Dickson that, if he looks at his record and the number of times during this parliament that I have had to ask him to leave the chamber at times when he has abused his ability to raise a point of order, he will understand why, based on the precedent of other Speakers since Federation, I have chosen on this occasion not to recognise him.

94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson will resume his seat.,85
95,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"goes to the absolute fundamentals of our health reform proposals, and that is that we must end the cost shifting and blame shifting between the states and the Commonwealth. When we came to government we inherited a Commonwealth-state share of financing the health system which had plummeted to an all-time low because of the irresponsible actions of the Leader of the Opposition. He ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system and what happened is that it got to an all-time low with the Commonwealth contributing just below 35 per cent of the share of funding of public hospitals. The Prime Minister announced last week that our government is determined to take on the dominant funding role from hereon into the future of 60 per cent of the share of pital funding-a major change to the way hospital services are funded and run across this country. The key thing that this fixes is the argument over the Commonwealth doing a negotiation with the states at the start of five-year period, fixing in what they pay for a five-year period, handing it over to the states and then saying, ‘It doesn't matter what happens with changing demographics, doesn't matter what happens with the cost of health expenditure, doesn't matter what happens where the population moves.' We are not prepared to leave our communities in that situation anymore. We are prepared to take on a dominant funding role and to make sure that we are bearing responsibility for a bigger share of the growth both in population and in the cost of providing health care. We must do this. We must get to the bottom of building an incentive into the system that allows cost shifting and blame shifting. We are determined to fix this problem because we think cost shifting and blame shifting are wasting scarce health resources that need to be spent in the system. Unfortunately, not everybody in this place believes that resolving the problem of cost shifting is important. We know that not everybody believes this because the Leader of the Opposition himself, in 2006, wrote in an article in the Australian: ‘Cost shifting is unavoidable. You can't stop it so you might as well just live with it.' What a lazy approach. What a defeatist approach. What an absolutely irresponsible approach to take to the most important delivery of services to our community across the country and that is our health services. Our government is not prepared to just live with it. We understand that we were elected to do the opposite, to fix the problems that the Liberal government handed us for 11 years. In total, over the next decade the Commonwealth will be responsible for billions of exhos- tra dollars of expenditure that otherwise would burden state budgets. In the short term, people are already benefiting from the $20 billion investment of extra funding flowing through to front-line health services. This a is a 50 per cent increase on the position that we inherited when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. This is the 50 per cent increase that the shadow Treasurer, who does not appear to be here today, has said he would not sign onto. He said he did not agree to pay this money to the states and territories-did not agree to the Commonwealth investing more in hospital services. We are going to do the heavy lifting on health. We are going to help ensure that generations to come will enjoy world-class universally accessible health care. The contrast could not be clearer with the Leader of the Opposition, who turned the blame game into an Olympic sport. We are not going to have any more of it and it is time for him to get out of the way and let us get on with the job. Home Insulation Program",85
96,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the project control group which ran his Home Insulation Program, comprising his department, the Deputy Prime Minister's department as well as the department of the environment.

Can I say in response to the honourable member's question that the policy work which led to the establishment of the Home Insulation Program began in August 2008 and continued through to the launch of the full program 11 months later, on 1 July 2009. Furthermore, in August 2008 the government launched a crossdepartmental Energy Efficiency Taskforce. That in turn recommended a national energy efficiency strategy, which in turn had within it a sustainable homes assistance package, worth $2.9 billion. Furthermore, in early 2009 the government developed the Energy Efficient Homes program as part of its Nation Building and Jobs Plan. On 3 February 2009 that package was announced. Between 3 February and 1 July 2009-in response to the member's question-the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts spent five months designing the final policy implementation.  of order.",87

I am further advised that this is the normal practice within government-to establish a project control group or interdepartmental committee to develop and implement major projects.

107,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on Australia's recent employment performance and the need to provide certainty for working families?",88
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that he would have followed today's news that the unemployment number for last month, the month of February, remained effectively steady at 5.3 per cent, in line with market expectations. This unemployment number obviously indicates that our economy has done far better than many would have expected at the start of the global financial sis and global recession, the worse global recession in more than 75 years. These figures show that our economy has outperformed virtually every other advanced economy during the global recession. We know that this performance would not have been as strong if it had not been for the quick and decisive action of this government in investing in our economy and supporting Australian jobs. Without that quick and decisive action, hundreds of thousands more Australians would have been unemployed. This action has helped give Australian families certainty during very uncertain times. But, whilst today's figures are encouraging, they remind us that there is nothing that should be taken for granted. There are 128,000 Australians who have become unemployed since the global financial crisis hit in September 2008. What these unemployment figures are telling us and what we know from around the nation is that many working families face significant pressures and uncertainties as they seek to build a future for themselves. That is why the government is so determined to continue to invest in nation-building infrastructure to stimulate local economies and to support jobs, and it is why our reforms are well designed and costed, because we believe in providing certainty and support for working families around the country. This is a stark contrast to the attitude of the opposition, which is not focused on building the nation; it is focused on saying no to absolutely everything-no to economic stimulus to support the jobs of working Australians; no to the Fair Work Act, because it would rather go back to Work Choices; and then this week we have seen a debate break out about the opposition acting to deny working parents paid parental leave. We know that the risk to paid parental leave in this parliament is the Leader of the Opposicrition, who is shaping up to block the bill to deliver paid parental leave. Out of his own mouth, the Leader of the Opposition has said, ‘We'll be amending it to try and make it our scheme'-his scheme being one that would put cost of living pressures on working families because it would put up the price of bread and milk and the basic groceries that they rely on. I thank the members of the opposition backbench who are nodding their heads in agreement because they understand that. The Leader of the Opposition is a risk to the budgets of working families. This is a man that the former Treasurer Peter Costello viewed as being such a risk to the economy that he would not even have trusted him to be his deputy. No doubt the former Treasurer Peter Costello formed that view because, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for health and he used to be asked about how they were going to fund health policies, he would just shrug his shoulders and say: ‘Peter will provide. He always does.' Well, Peter has gone now and, with Peter gone, the Leader of the Opposition is looking to put these burdens directly onto working families to fund his hastily cobbled together schemes. When I say ‘hastily cobbled together', noone in the Liberal Party knew about it. You really have to try hard to make the member for Wentworth look like a model of inclusiveness and consultation, but that is what the Leader of the Opposition",88

118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I can guarantee to the House 553 that comprehension will figure prominently in the national curriculum. The reason that I am commenting on the policy of the opposition is that it does seem to me a little bit interesting that now they do not want to talk about paid parental leave, as the policy has crumbled before the eyes of the Leader of the Opposition. On Monday he made his big announcement, on Tuesday he thought it was okay and now, of course, they do not really want to talk about it anymore. The problem with their policy is that it is a threat in the Senate to us delivering our paid parental leave scheme. There was no consultation on this policy. There was no consultation with the member who approaches the despatch box. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I also refer to page 553 of the House of Representatives Practice and the part referred to by the member for O'Connor on a point of relevance and your additional comments from that page, when you said: On other occasions such comments have been permitted.

123,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In conclusion, I was asked about certainty for working families and risks for working families. A clear risk is that our paid parental leave scheme legislation will be blocked and we will be unable to pay benefits to people next year. Of course, this is because of the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition-the man who says he will consult with his back bench and then does not; the man who says that there will be no new taxes and then announces a huge, new tax; the man who actually explains all of this by saying-his words not mine: ‘You have to make departures from principles.' I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his straight talk about his lack of principle, but working women will not thank him if he blocks paid parental leave. Home Insulation Program",90
124,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it again relates to his role in the failure of the Home Insulation Program. I refer the Prime Minister to his department's annual report, in which the then head of the Cabinet Implementation Unit states: In little more than three months, the team went from a standing start to having a working system capable of registering thousands of insulation installation providers and processing tens of thousands of individual claims every month with high levels of control and accountability. When did the Prime Minister or his office first become aware that the so-called high levels of control and accountability were in fact resulting in fraud, unsafe insulation, house fires, electrified roofs and deaths?",90
125,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the question of the policy and the design features around it, as I indicated in my response to the member for Flinders before, they were determined by cabinet in February 2009. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, in the period between the taking of that decision by the cabinet and the implementation of the scheme on 1 July 2009, the implementation features were then designed by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. On the development of the program in the period in between then-and the Leader of the Opposition specifically goes to the question of advice back to me as a member of cabinet-can I advise the Leader of the Opposition of this: the Nation Building and Jobs Plan implementation reports were received by the relevant cabinet committee. I am advised that the first implementation report was provided on 18 February 2009 and it was considered by the committee then. The implementation report referred to no safety issues related to the Home Insulation Program, which by that stage had not commenced. A further report was delivered to the relevant cabinet committee on 10 March. The March implementation report referred to no safety issues related to the Home Insulation Program. A third report was delivered to the cabinet committee, which I chair, on 11 June 2009. That report referred to no safety issues related to the Home Insulation Program.

The paid parental leave scheme being put forward by those opposite has at its core a $10.8 billion tax, which will harm the economy and, of course, will risk family budgets. The Leader of the Opposition has spent a lot of time talking about big new taxes-well, this one is a whopper. It is the Big Mac of taxes. Of course it will impact on business, it will pact on employment and it will impact on family budgets. I think we can all celebrate today's employment figures, which were spoken about before by the Deputy Prime Minister. But this big tax is a risk to investment. This big tax is a risk to growth. This big tax is a to jobs. Those opposite are having a few problems coordinating their discussions on economic policy. I note that the Leader of the Opposition said that the shadow Treasurer and the finance spokesman should have known about this scheme because they could have read it in his book-which was published a year ago. We know they do not actually read very often, and this is part of the problem. We know that last December the shadow Treasurer actually missed a very substantial revision to the national accounts-billions of dollars just went past him and he did not notice. So they do not do a lot of reading. But there is some reading they should do-for example, a recent report from the OECD, which said: Corporate taxes are found to be the most harmful for growth ... This is something that those opposite do not appear to understand: the need to invest for growth, the need to invest to employ Australians. They have proven, through what has occurred over the last couple of days, what a serious risk to our national economy they have become. They could not even work out whether the tax is going to be imposed on businesses with a $5 million turnover or on businesses that paid $5 million worth of tax-thereby leaving something like 2,500 businesses in limbo. This demonstrates that they are a risk to investment and a risk to business. What they do not appear to understand is that this tax will be passed on to im- families-passed on at the supermarket, passed on at the petrol station and of course passed on at the local bank. That demonstrates just how out of touch they are. What this is all about is trying to prove that somehow they are pro family-after they supported Work Choices which ripped risk away fundamental conditions for families. On this side of the House, we are proud of the first-ever commitment to a paid parental leave scheme from an Australian government, from the Rudd government-a scheme which is affordable, a scheme which is sustainable and a scheme which does not require a big tax which will cost jobs.",91

132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Hold on. The Leader of the Opposition. Ms Julie Bishop-Can't you count?,92
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not directing that comment to me. I admit that I got confused and I have rectified it straighttions away. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. Home Insulation Program,92
134,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is, again, to the Prime Minister. In light of the Prime Minister's previous answer, is he seriously telling the House that he was never informed about the safety problems, fires and deaths under the Home Insulation Program? Will he now inform the House when he was so informed and who finally informed him?",92
135,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. In my earlier answer to his question, I outlined the government's decision-making process leading up to the commencement of the scheme on 1 July 2009. The honourable Leader of the Opposition asked questions about subsequent safety and compliance matters which arose. Let me provide him with the following information. On 14 August, I received a letter from the then minister in relation to the Home tion Program proposing increased compliance requirements for the program. On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines which included requiring the following: physical site inspections prior to giving quotes, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications, increased compliance communications and processes for suspending and deregistering non-compliant installers. On 27 August 2009, I received a letter from the minister drawing my attention to concerns about new entrants to the market not adequately meeting required standards on work undertaken. The minister proposed changes to the program to require installers to provide physical evidence of qualificaand/or competencies before they were registered. On 28 August, I am advised, these changes to the program guidelines were released and, on 4 September, I wrote to the minister noting that these changes had been made. On 22 October 2009, the relevant cabinet committee again considered the Home Insulation Program and discussed increasing the requirements on installers to increase compliance. On 28 October, the minister wrote to me to indicate the actions he intended to take in response. These included requiring householders to get two quotes and to publish a public list of deregistered installers. On 29 October, I responded to this letter, agreeing to the minister's proposals to tighten the guidelines. On 30 October, Minister Garrett wrote to me in relation to safety issues in the Home Insulation Program, a proposal to roll out an electrical safety testing program for homes that have had foil insulation, a proposed ban on metal fasteners, and a proposal to mandate the use of covers over downlights Insula- and other ceiling appliances. On 2 November 2009, I replied to the minister, noting the package of safety measures which he had outlined. On 30 November 2009, Minister Garrett announced mandatory training or minimum skill requirements would be developed further. On 17 December, Minister Garrett announced increased training requirements: all installers going into ceilings must have either a tradespecific competency, prior insulation industry experience or must have completed a registered or accredited training course. That commenced as of 12 February 2010. On 9 February 2010, Minister Garrett banned the use of foil insulation under the Home Insulation Program and, on 10 February 2010, Minister Garrett announced that every home that had foil insulation installed under the government's Home Insulation Program would undergo an electrical safety inspection. On 19 February 2010, the relevant cabinet committee made the decision to close the program. These are the steps which occurred during the process of decision making leading up to the commencement of the program on 1 July 2009. That, I am advised, is the correspondence between myself and the minister on this matter over the period since then. I would also draw the honourable Leader of the Opposition's attention to the statement made in the House yesterday by Minister Combet, the minister responsible for energy efficiency, and the measures which he has now put in place concerning the wind-up of the existing program and any guidelines which will be developed relevant to a replacement program. Paid Parental Leave",92
136,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the government consider significant new policy proposals from other sources? Why is it important for such proposals to be properly detailed and costed?,93
137,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. The government is always open to considering new policy ideas, whether they be from the opposition or from any other sources. In fact, in my own portfolio I am eagerly awaiting savings suggestions from the opposition. It has been almost seven years since a Liberal shadow finance minister or finance minister advanced a substantial savings initiative. In fact, the 2003 budget was the last time, so I am eagerly awaiting some new ideas on that front. We do not pick up just any old idea or any old garbled bit of gobbledegook that gets thrown at us. We apply a quality control test. Unfortunately, the proposal which the opposition most recently put forward, with respect to paid maternity leave, fails to meet that test. It is interesting today that, after a sudden burst of enthusiasm a couple of days ago, we have had not one single question promoting the new paid parental leave by the Leader of the Opposition. Some of the points I will now advance may help explain why they have dropped it like a stone. To begin with, the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition completely repudiates past positions taken by not only him but also the shadow minister in charge of the program. In government the Leader of the Opposition said, ‘I'm dead against paid maternity leave.' In January this year, the shadow minister, the member for Murray, said that they would be developing a proposal that would not put any tax burden on the business sector. Only about six weeks ago, notoriously, the Leader of the Opposition stated that the opposition committed itself to a promise of no new taxes and no increases in taxes. When confronted with the breaking of that promise yesterday, he said, ‘Sometimes you have to depart from principle.' The flaws in the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition are quite manifest. He did not consult the business community. He did not consult his economics team-the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister-he did not consult his own shadow cabinet and, indeed, one of his own Liberal MPs, when confronted with the proposition by the Australian, described it as ‘a typical 1930s socialist impost on big business' and was then surprised to discover that it was his own leader's proposal. The detail of the proposal also does not withstand scrutiny. There has been complete confusion about the threshold. We know the threshold involves the figure of $5 million, the tax threshold above which the tax slug hits business. We know the figure is $5 million; we do not quite know what it is $5 million of. Is it turnover? Is it taxable income? Is it profit? We do not quite know, because the Leader of the Opposition has had several different positions. Mr Tuckey interjecting Mr Swan-Wilson is clarifying it!",93
138,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see that the member for O'Connor is on the job; it is very good to see. If it is taxable income it is 3,500 companies. If it is tax being paid it is only about 900, 950 or so. There is a big difference between these possibilities. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition cannot quite say when his paid parental leave would start-maybe sometime around 2013. He cannot say whether the tax impost would be permanent or temporary; he described it as a ‘temporary levy'. And he cannot say whether or not he would support the legislation the government is putting to the Senate and to this House to introduce our paid parental leave scheme. He cannot say how he would prevent abuse of the $5 million threshold or unfairness that would flow from it. How would he stop companies from restructuring to avoid the tax? How would he protect companies that are above the threshold, and hit by the tax, from competition from companies that they compete with that are below the threshold? How would he remove the implicit disincentive involved with his tax impost for companies to merge? How would he prevent the tax being passed on to consumers? I note that the head of the Institute of Public Affairs, prominent Liberal Party figure John Roskam, said the following in response, describing his proposal as disastrous because ‘ultimately tax on businesses'-whether they are big businesses or small businesses-‘gets passed through to the consumer, and what we are going to see, as Lindsay Tanner identified, is massive compliance issues'. This is a prominent figure in the Liberal Party agreeing with me. A very prominent figure who has some political and policy substance actually agrees with my assessment and the government's assessment of the policy merits of the scheme. Over the last few months we have seen the Leader of the Opposition out there on the quad bike, in the speedos, in the swimming about pool. No doubt we are going to see him abseiling and bungee jumping and all those other kinds of things in due course. He should start paying some attention to his day job. If he is going to put forward policy propositions that he expects the government to adopt, that involve big slugs on business and that threaten jobs and the economy, and he proposes to block the government's own initiative, he needs to do some very serious homework. This will not cut the mustard, and it means he will be a substantial threat to the economy and to the budget, a risk to the future prosperity of this nation. Home Insulation Program",94
139,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister has informed the House that Minister Garrett informed him of problems with the Home Insulation Program by letter of 14 August, did he warn in that letter of fire, fraud or safety issues, and will the Prime Minister now release that letter? Further, isn't this why the Prime Minister will not sack Minister Garrett: because the buck stops with the Prime Minister?",94
140,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He refers to the then minister's letter to me of 14 August,95
141,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He's still a minister.,95
142,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The then minister responsible for this program. In response to the honourable Leader of the Opposition's question, I received a letter from the minister, tion to the Home Insulation Program, proposing increased compliance requirements for the program. On 17 August the relevant cabinet committee considered these compliance matters raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. Mr Andrews-Yeah, we know that.",95
143,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the question the Leader of the Opposition asked. These contained the following elements: (1) physical site inspections prior to giving quotes; (2) increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications-which goes directly to safety considerationsMr Abbott-I raise a point of order on relevance, Mr Speaker. Did that letter warn of safety problems, and will the Prime Minister release the letter?",95
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,95
145,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answering the Leader of the Opposition's question: this correspondence dealt also with, secondly, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications; thirdly, increased compliance; and, fourthly, processes for suspending and deregistering non-compliant installers. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the relevance of training standards and the relevance of the inspections regime go directly to the question of overall safety considerations associated with the program. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, both in relation to these matters and to the cabinet documents that I referred to before, that these obviously are associated with the cabinet process and will be appropriately protected. Paid Parental Leave",95
146,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Why do Australian families need certainty in relaabout paid parental leave?",95
147,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Chisholm for her question, because she understands very well that couples who are planning to have children are making one of the biggest decisions of their lives. I am sure I do not have to remind members of the House, many of us parents ourselves, what it is like to take that step either to start a family or to have another child. For many families, when they are deciding when to start a family or when to have another child, there are many, many critical things that they have to take into account. They have to think about what they are going to do with their employment, with family matters, and with the various financial commitments that have to be considered. The job that we have, of course, is to support families as they make those decisions, not to make their lives more complicated. In a little over nine months time, Australia's first paid parental leave scheme is due to start, on 1 January. In case the Leader of the Opposition does not get the subtlety here, that is in just about nine months time. I am sure everybody here can do the maths. Mr Swan-He's not very subtle.",95
148,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maybe not. That means any couple who are thinking about or planning to have a baby want to know what is going to happen. Are they going to have a paid parental leave scheme that they can depend on on 1 January next year? That is why they need certainty now. They want to know whether or not the paid parental leave scheme is going to be there for them in nine months time. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is threatening to leave parents with nothing. What they know is that this Leader of the Opposition is the biggest risk to families and their certainty. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to care that families have been waiting decades for a paid parental leave scheme. We know that the Liberals in government refused to introduce a paid parental leave scheme. We know what the views of the Leader of the Opposition are. It has been very well reported that he said over his dead body would paid parental leave be introduced. I must say his comments yesterday demonstrate further that he really has no clue about how his latest thought bubble of a scheme is going to happen. He said that he would be amazed if he could not get his scheme up and running by 2013. I would have to say that I would be absolutely amazed if his half-baked scheme had been given any more than half a minute's thought. There is no question that that applies to some members of his front-bench. If you have a look at Senator Joyce today, the shadow minister for finance, he said: ‘You know, let's talk about it once I've read it. I don't like talking about read.' A sham policy with no detail, no costings, no time line and no deal for Australian families is what the Liberal Party is offering. By contrast, this government has proposed a paid parental leave scheme for the first time that this country has ever seen. It is going be fair for families and fair for business. Families know that this Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted on paid parental leave. Home Insulation Program",95
149,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. What reasons did Minister Garrett give in his letter of 14 August for wanting increased compliance, increased inspections and a process of deregistering installers? I ask the Prime Minister further: did Minister Garrett at any point warn the Prime Minister of the safety issues associated with this disastrous program?",96
150,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that, if you go through the list of correspondence I referred to in my earlier answer, many of them go to training requirements, many of them go to site inspections, and of course these are therefore related to safety and other concerns. The second point I would say is that, as I said to the House the previous time that these matters were debated, there is nothing before me which suggests that the minister did not act in response to the advice that he had received from his department at the time. That is the position I put to the House then; that is the position I put to the House now. Furthermore, I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the work which is currently being done by Dr Hawke in his review of the implementation of this scheme and to the statement which was delivered to the House yesterday by the minister responsible, Minister Combet, dealing with the wind-up of this scheme and guidelines for any rethings I haven't placement scheme. I also say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that we intend to get on with the business of accepting responsibility for the problems which have arisen from the implementation of this scheme. Mr Combet has to outlined the mechanism by which that will be undertaken. We will not shirk these responsibilities. We intend to get on the job. Given the fact that it is Thursday, I presume the censure motion is coming soon. Paid Parental Leave",96
151,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Dr Emerson. Will the minister advise the House of the impact of paid parental leave proposals on consumer prices? A government member-No more Mr Nice Guy.",97
152,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The cheer squad will quieten down.,97
153,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been urged that there be no more Mr Nice Guy. I will do my best, Mr Speaker, to be as nice as I possibly can to the opposition. I thank the member for Lowe for his kind question and his concern for consumers in Strathfield, in Burwood and in all the suburbs in the inner-west of Sydney, including-I understand-the good people of Five Dock, and all those consumers about whom the Australian people and the Labor Party care but, of course, about whom the opposition has no interest and no compassion. In response to the member for Lowe's question, the government's paid parental leave scheme is funded from the budget and involves no increase in taxation to be passed on to consumers. On the other hand, the coalition's paid parental scheme is funded by a 1.7 percentage point slug in the company tax rate for larger companies. As the Treasurer pointed out, this is a $10.8 billion great new tax to be passed on by large companies. This was confirmed today by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, when Greg Evans said that “the impact of a new tax or levy imposed on businesses cannot be quarantined and these changes end up having an impact on overall prices and employment”. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is right and the coalition is wrong. Yet the opposition leader persists with his argument that Australia's largest companies would absorb this great big new tax. Hello, Leader of the Opposition? What planet are you on that you believe that Australia's largest companies-Woolworths, Coles, BP, Shell, Mobil, Caltex-through the goodness of their hearts and in the national interest will absorb this great big new tax and say, ‘We're not going to pass that onto consumers'? Obviously the opposition leader is again treating the Australian people like mugs. Every working Australian and every young mother knows that these large companies will pass this tax hike on in the form of higher consumer prices, higher grocery prices, higher petrol prices and higher department store prices. We know that, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry knows that-and guess who else knows it? Well, it is my melancholy duty to advise the House that the member for O'Connor knows that, because he said today that it is a tax on profits and that if Coles and Woolworths intend to put up their prices they will increase their profits and they will therefore pay more tax from that particular arrangement. I do not quite understand what he is going on about. It is sort of ‘Abbottonomics' but as I far as I can understand, he says there will be this perpetual cycle of tax increases, inbig creased profits and then further price increases. But his neighbour sitting there, the member for Triton, has actually come in and supported, as he should, the member for O'Connor because he said today that it is an impost on industry and that, any impost will ultimately flow through to consumers. That is a fact. I do not often agree with the member for Triton but on this occasion he is",97
154,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,98
155,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Tangney; thank you, Mr Speaker. On this occasion the member for Tangney is right: of course it will be passed on to consumers. By conceding that grocery and petrol prices will go up, the coalition's mad uncle and the member for Tangney have let the cat out of the bag. They have let the cat out of the bag again-and what a dirty, smelly animal it is! The Leader of the Opposition's paid parental leave scheme is nothing but a great big new tax on everything. This is an opposition leader who feigns concern for working families and mothers. It is a funny way to show your concern for working families and mothers-to whack them with a great big new tax on everything. The government's paid parental leave scheme is affordable and it is responsible. If the opposition leader was fair dinkum he would support our responsible, affordable paid parental leave scheme instead of his great big new tax on everything.",98
156,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that the minister table that document so I can better read his interpretation of my comments.",98
157,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the minister quoting from a document?,98
158,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I pretty well winged it, Mr Speaker. Climate Change",98
159,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. With a reported 1,000 homes at risk from coastal erosion at Old Bar in the Manning Valley, can the Prime Minister provide a status report on government's response to the tripartisan and seminal report delivered last year by the right. Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, chaired by the member for Throsby, and provide a reassurance that with recent changes to ministerial responsibilities this issue has not been lost in the rising sea of political challenges that the environment portfolio has faced in recent months?",98
160,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. Since the release of the House committee report the government has sought to work actively on these questions. In November last year the government, through Minister Wong, released the first national assessment of the implications of climate change for Australia's coasts. That report was entitled Climate change risks to Australia's coasts. It was the first attempt at continent-wide mapping of the risks posed to residential buildings as a consequence of climate change. The report also went to the challenge that this sort of coastal erosion would present to infrastructure, services and industry. We all know that a number of our road networks hug the coast very closely. The honourable member also asked a question about further action by the government on this matter. What we have done is create a Coasts and Climate Change Council, to be chaired by Professor Tim Flannery. It is designed to engage with the community and local stakeholders in the lead-up to what will be an important climate change and coastal impact forum which is to be held. Can I also say in response to the honourable member's question that we take seriously this challenge for the future, as we do the overall challenge of climate change. The government has released a comprehensive adaptation policy that identifies the role of the federal government in adapting to climate change. It identifies the following priorities: how we deal with natural systems of national significance; how we deal with prevention, preparedness and response, particularly with regard to natural disasters impacting on a weakened coastline; and the impact on agriculture, water and more broadly on coastal management. The member should be assured that the government takes this challenge as one of the adaptation implications flowing from climate change very seriously. It potentially affects residences right across Australia. It potentially affects a whole range of infrastructure projects and existing infrastructure right around the country. Therefore the government will have further to say on our action for further preparedness in this area. This is one of the costs of climate change. It is not unique to Australia. If we go to other countries around the world we see them wrestling with the impact on their coastlines caused by the change in the climate and by the increasing level of the sea. We know in particular of our near neighbours in the Pacific and the impact that it potentially has on the very survival of a number of island states, such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and elsewhere. So, while this is a challenge for Australia, it is also a challenge for the region and the world. The government will continue to discharge its responsibilities in this area.",98
161,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Tourism. Will the minister update the House on the recovery of the Australian tourism industry following setbacks such as the global financial crisis and swine flu?,99
162,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate the question from the member for Lyons, a person who represents a large regional seat that is very much dependent on the vibrancy of the tourism industry. With that context I acknowledge the resilience of the industry in the face of many challenges, yet again, over the last 12 months. I also remind the House that, as we come out of the global financial crisis, the industry yet again confronts a huge challenge in the context of the strength of the Australian dollar. We should also have regard for the fact that there are actually good value holidays in Australia. Rather than thinking about having a holiday overseas as we regain confidence economically we should have regard for staying at home, supporting Australian workers and also supporting the Australian government's No Leave, No Life campaign, which has broad industry support, given that we currently have accumulated 123 million days of leave, worth $33 billion. But what of the resilience of the industry over the last 12 months? Last year the industry had to confront a situation in which the global economy actually contracted for the first time since World War II. That effectively meant in normal circumstances a very tough year for an industry that directly employs half a million Australians and represents just under four per cent of Australia's GDP. During the course of the year, international tourism in terms of arrivals worldwide actually fell four per cent. Interestingly, visitor arrivals were down six per cent for Europe, five per cent for the Americas and Tourism two per cent for the Asia-Pacific. I am pleased to report to the House that the Australian tourism industry actually outperformed the rest of the world with international visitation, which is very important to jobs for ordinary Australians, meeting an arrival rate in 2009 virtually equivalent to that of 2008, at 5.6 million. Perhaps more importantly it is not just about numbers. Visitor arrivals increased by six per cent and visitor expenditure increased by five per cent. It is this performance on the international tourism front in association with the government's decisive action in underpinning the Australian economy through our response to the global financial crisis that has done the industry well in securing and supporting Australian employment. By way of example, domestically, Restaurant and Catering Australia estimate that at least $80 million was injected into the restaurant and catering industry from the stimulus package, and they have appropriately given full credit to the government's economic stimulus package. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has also reported that in the 11 months to November 2009 we saw a 9.5 per cent increase in turnover for restaurants, cafes and take-away food services compared to the same period in 2008. In terms of employment, I also express my appreciation to the industry itself. Whilst we have done exceptionally well internationally given the global financial crisis, there was a sharp decline, for example, in visitor travel in the Australian community. Yet, despite the global financial crisis, the Australian tourism industry achieved an overall increase of 36,000 jobs in the 12 months to November 2009. I do acknowledge in that context that some of those jobs were changes from full time to part-time employment because the industry on this occasion resolved, having invested in the training of their workforcemany of whom are women-to go out of their way to retain their employment given the challenge of actually keeping people when we think about the better wages and conditions that are currently available in competitive industries such as the resources and energy projects around Australia at the moment. I also note in passing that this is an indushave try that represents a huge number of jobs for women workers. They are not historically highly paid workers and they are a group of workers that will be tremendously disappointed if the opposition does not get out of the government's way when it comes to putting in place a guaranteed minimum opportunity for paid parental leave in Australia. It is about time the opposition understood not only the importance of the tourism industry from the point of view of employment in Australia but also the importance of the safety net for women workers in the Australian tourism industry, who have long sought decisive government action to extend to them paid parental leave, just like we extended superannuation, in a previous government, to workers who historically did not have opportunities for what the better off in the Australian community expect as part of their employment packages. I simply say to the Australian tourism industry: thanks for a job well done in supporting the Australian government initiatives to shore up employment in a tough global situation. Hospitals",99
163,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister say that the efficient casemix price of public hospital procedures will be set by an independent body under his health reform policy while also maintaining that government funding for public hospitals will not need to increase over the forward estimates period? How can the Australian people trust the government to fix public hospitals when the government cannot successfully manage to give away pink batts for free?,100
164,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is pretty interesting when the Leader of the Opposition asks a question about health and demonstrates that he does not understand the first thing about casemix funding. He does not understand the first thing about activity based funding. I would thought that, having been the Minister for Health and Ageing for four or five years, he would demonstrate an elementary level of understanding. I will say to the Leader of the Opposition that why we are bringing about fundamental reform to the health and hospital system is as follows. We will not in the future be providing blank cheques as he did to state and territory governments in the hope that something might happen in the actual delivery of services on the ground. We are proposing to introduce, by contrast, activity based funding which enables the government to directly pay local hospital networks for actual hospital services that they deliver. This is a reform which working families want on the ground because it enables them to respond to this certainty of budgetary supply in order to increase the hospital services delivered on the ground. The Australian people have been saying to the government that they do not have enough hospital beds, doctors or nurses and that they are sick and tired of the waste, duplication and overlap that currently characterises our system. One of the reasons we have this waste, duplication and overlap-something which the Leader of the Opposition, if he were faintly interested in reform, would have done something aboutDr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was about the independent umpire and the hospital funding over the forward estimates. The Prime Minister has not addressed this in his answer.",100
165,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,101
166,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is always good to hear from the member for Boothby and we hope to see him back on the front bench before long-once he has a reconciliation meeting with the Leader of the Opposition. I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question about casemix funding that we are about providing funding to local hospital networks which actually provides support for the hospital services delivered on the ground. We will not support in the future the system he backed for five years which provided a blank cheque, a block grant, to state and ritory health bureaucracies to spend wherever-maybe not even on health. This is the fundamental nature of the reform that we are bringing about. The second point I would make to the Leader of the Opposition is that if he were really interested in health reform we might the have heard just an element of his alternative policy when he addressed the AMA last night. Instead, we had one exerciseDr Southcott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is the same point of order on relevance-casemix, independent umpire, public hospitals",101
167,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister is aware of his responsibilities to be relevant to the question. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,101
168,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The response we have had from the medical profession, from nurses right across the country, has been to get behind this reform for the nation because they want more resources to go to front-line health and hospital services, not into bureaucracies in state capitals across the country. That is what the people of Australia are calling out for. In response to the member for Boothby's intervention, coming on top of the Leader of the Opposition's question, can I say as follows: (1) bring in activity based funding and (2) make sure that the Australian government takes on its shoulders, for the first time in Australia's history, the burden of becoming the dominant funder of the public hospital system of Australia. We are for the first time in our history becoming the dominant funder of the capital needs of Australia's public hospital system, for the first time becoming the dominant funder of the equipment needs of Australia's public hospital system and for the first time becoming the dominant funder of the research and teaching needs of the ter- public hospital system of Australia. People want an end to business as usual. The Leader of the Opposition, who had five years as health minister, is content with the status quo. He is content with not changing a thing. He thinks the system is just good enough. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the member for Boothby: (1) we take on this reform to deliver money directly to the coalface, (2) we take on our shoulders burden of long-term growth in the system and (3) as the minister for health and others have indicated, we have further say on additional growth in the system in the future as well. This is in stark contrast to a Leader the Opposition who ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system of Australia and stands here and pretends that he never, ever did it. Small Business: Superannuation",101
169,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Financial Services, Superment annuation and Corporate Law. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the government's small business superannuationMs Julie Bishop interjecting Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has been warned, should be asked to withdraw that comment.",102
170,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There was an earlier comment that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will withdraw. Ms Julie Bishop-I withdraw.,102
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,102
172,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the government's small business superannuation clearing house measure? Minister, what risks are there to this important election commitment being rolled out to help relieve small business of a significant compliance burden?",102
173,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his long experience as a small business person. In opposition, the Labor Party promised to reduce the paperwork burden for small business in making payments to superannuation the funds and we are acting on that commitment. Currently small businesses often have difficulty in making their payments to superannuation funds when they have to make payments to various different funds for various of different employees, creating a red-tape nightmare. Pending passage of legislation that will shortly be before the Senate, a free superannuation clearing house will operate from 1 July, implementing that election commitment. Medicare has been chosen by the govern to run the small business clearing house because it is well placed, as one of the government's best service delivery agencies with significant electronic and payment processing capacity, to deliver that service while ensuring the privacy of information and the security of funds. If we get this legislation implementing the election commitment through the parliament, then we will be helping to ease the compliance burden for small business and letting them do what they do best, which is to get on with the job and employ more Australians. When I announced last year that Medicare would run the small business superannuation clearing house, it was a decision which received strong endorsement from the superannuation and small business sectors. The chief executive of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Pauline Vamos, said: This will lower costs for both employers and funds and allow more employees to exercise choice. Just last week, the CEO of COSBOA, the small business peak group, said: We think the legislation will improve the efficiency of business-to-government dealings and, as I said earlier, will help improve small business compliance with their super obligations more generally. Even today we saw a significant agreement being announced between three of Australia's largest superannuation administrators to make it easier to roll over funds between different superannuation funds. The administrators make it clear in their statement that the agreement flows from the opportunity created by the government decision to appoint Medicare to run the small business clearing house. So this is a good policy-a pro-small business policy. It has important flow-on benefits for efficiency and employment. I am asked what risks there are to implementing this policy and the risks lie opposite. It might seem hard to believe that the opposition would block a small business measure, but they are planning to do so in the Senate. A pro-small business measure is being stopped by the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite. The business community has the right to ask what they have done to deserve this Leader of the Opposition. One day he is whacking a tax on business and the next day he is standing in the way of a measure to reduce small business compliance costs. On this issue, the opposition have reached new heights of hypocrisy. Yesterday in this House, my shadow minister, the member for Cowper, criticised the government for taking so long to implement this superannuation clearing house and then said he would oppose it in the other place. They cannot even get their stories straight in one sentence, let alone one speech or one day. They criticise us for taking too long and then say, ‘By the way, we're not going to support it.' This all appears to be part of the Leader of the Opposition's cunning plan. He has got it all worked out. They are going to use their numbers in the Senate to block our implementation of election commitments and then criticise us for not implementing election commitments. He has got it all sorted! He must take the Australian people for mugs. The Leader of the Opposition takes the Australian people for fools. The former Prime Minister, John Howard, promised to reduce the red-tape burden on small business by 50 per cent, and he failed. He did not achieve that election promise. But it is not too late for the opposition. They can get out of the way and they can support the government in supporting small business. They can get out of the way and let the government implement this election commitment. If they do not, the small business community of Australia is entitled to conclude that the Leader of the Opposition puts his rashness, his obstructionism and his cheap politics in front of the interests of Australian small business. Building the Education Revolution Program  the Minister for Education. I refer the minister to the case of the Tyalgum Public School in New South Wales, which received a library off the back of a semitrailer, under Building the Education Revolution, at a cost of $850,000. When the library was offloaded it did not fit the foundations that had been laid for it and was, and remains, unusable. How can the Australian people trust a government that cannot deliver to a school a prefabricated library that fits its foundations to reform Australia's public hospital system?",102
174,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for education for his question. I would note, of course, that since the launch of the national curriculum the shadow minister for education has not inquired about it. Maybe that is because he is aware that teachers across the country are blogging about the hollowness of his response to the national curriculum-about how truly galling it was to see someone treat a major national reform with such contempt that all he did was have a staff member work out the word ‘Indigenous' and then criticise the curriculum.",103
175,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will address the question.,104
176,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the shadow minister's question, can I say this and say it very clearly to him. I do not think you, Mr Speaker, are going to be surprised when I say this, although maybe the shadow minister is going to be surprised, but I do not myself deliver demountable buildings. I do not myself lay concrete foundations. That is true; he is correct in that. I am not individually building each of the 24,000 projects around the country. What we as a government are doing, through our guidelines and our auditing systems, is monitoring the rollout of Building the Education Revolution. When there are problems-and there was a problem with the construction of the foundation at the school that the shadow minister mentions-then, of course, they are rectified. That problem is being rectified by the contractor who made the error. That is being rectified at no additional cost to the government. That is what one would expect a contractor who has made an error to do. That would happen if one was engaged in Building the Education Revolution, if one was a businessperson engaged in building a commercial building or if one was a householder who was building a home renovation. An error was made and that error is being rectified without an additional cost to the government. It does seem to me to be really bordering on the pathetic that, on a day in which this nation received unemployment numbers of 5.3 per cent as a result of the economic stimulus that enabled hundreds of thousands of Australians to go home at the end of a working week with a pay packet in their hands, the best the opposition can do is point to one error by one contractor, out of 24,000 projects in more than 9,000 schools, that is not costing one extra dollar. It says everything about the shadow minister for education, everything about the hollowness of this opposition. They do not care about jobs. They do not care about health. They do not care about education. They do not care about cost pressures on families. And of course their greatest achievement this week is Tony's new tax on everything a family buys.",104
177,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister will in future refer to members by their titles. Parliament,104
178,Mr HAYES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Leader of the House. Would the Leader of the House outline the importance of orderly processes in ensuring the timely passage of legislation through the parliament?,104
179,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Werriwa for his question, and indeed I am pleased to inform the House that the division that we had just before question time, where once again those opposite opposed the legislation-this time put forward by the Minister for Resources and Energy-was the 44th piece of legislation passed through this House this year already. Indeed, last year this chamber passed 207 pieces of legislationthe highest number of bills this century, setting a new benchmark for this century at its beginning. But it is not surprising because this government has a big agenda for the nation. However, when bills pass this House we do have a problem getting them adopted by the parliament as a whole. Indeed, some 37 bills have been rejected by the Senate. Thirty-seven pieces of legislation have been either directly rejected or passed with amendments that were unacceptable to the House of Representatives. And that does not include the 18 bills that we had to reintroduce into the House of Representatives and which had to go back a second time to the other place. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party have the most obstructionist attitude in the Senate in three decades. Indeed, it is a fact that last year the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party blocked four times as many bills as in any year for 30 years. That is what is occurring from those opposite. I went into politics to make a difference. In 2007 the government promoted a program of making a positive agenda. Tories go into politics to block-particularly those opposite. They are only defined by what they oppose. In government, the current Leader of the Opposition ripped a billion dollars out of hospitals, he froze places for GPs, and now that he is in opposition he has been elected on a platform, in his own words, of simply opposing. He told 2GB on 11 January: Now sure, come election time people are entitled to know what we would do differently but at this stage of the political cycle our job is to ferociously criticise and where necessary oppose the Government. I mean, if in doubt our job is to oppose. PHI-oppose. Dental reform-oppose. Midwives-oppose. CPRS-oppose. Youth Allowance-oppose. Electoral reformoppose. Paid paternity leave-oppose. NBN-oppose. Those opposite are simply led by the Dr No of Australian politics; they are simply defined by what they are opposed to. That shows how petty and how untrustworthy the Leader of the Opposition ispetty, untrustworthy and bloody-minded in his opposition to the reforms of this government.",104

This morning, when I debated the Manager of Opposition Business on Sky News and this issue came up, he said on the CPRS, ‘Why didn't you negotiate with the Greens?' Well, we negotiated in good faith and did a deal, in good faith, with the other major political party in this country. They walked away from it on the basis that the Leader of the Opposition was elected by his party on a platform of not standing for anything, of not worrying about policy but simply of opposing for opposition's sake.

190,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,WORLD VISION," Mr Speaker, I want to take the opportunity on indulgence to condemn the brutal and senseless attack on World Vision in Mansehra in Pakistan yesterday. Yesterday, gunmen entered the offices of World Vision and, in execution style, shot six staff members, all of whom were Pakistani. World Vision Australia is of course very well known and regarded in Australia for its good work in our region and internationally, and there are close links between World Vision Australia and World Vision International. There are a small number of Australians who work for World Vision in Pakistan. Fortunately, they were not involved in this terrible event. We extend our sympathy and our condolences to the families of the slain individuals. We extend our sympathy and condolences to their friends in World Vision International and World Vision Australia. Development assistance workers, whether they are government officers, whether they are officers from non-government organisations or whether they are employed by international institutions like the World Bank or indeed United Nations agencies, do good deeds in dangerous circumstances, often at risk to themselves, seeking to help people who are less well off than themselves and help nations who are less well off than we are. Any attack on development assistance workers is contemptible. We condemn this brutal attack. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the families of the slain, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan and we stand shoulder to shoulder with World Vision and international development assistance workers generally.",106
191,Ms JULIE BISHOP,WORLD VISION,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I rise to add my remarks to those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the brutal and senseless killing of World Vision workers in north-west Pakistan. The execution style killings have been rightly condemned around the world. Six aid workers were killed, including two women, and others were injured. World Vision workers have been in this region since October 2005 as a result of an earthquake that occurred at that time. The Geneva convention protects humanitarian workers, yet we have seen in the last decade an increasing number of brutal attacks on aid workers. That should be condemned. The opposition joins with the government in offering condolences to those affected by this tragedy and condemns these senseless acts. NA Question Time",106
192,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have two questions for you. The first goes to your ruling in question time today in relation to a denial of the call I was seeking. I ask you whether understanding order 86 there is an obligation on the Speaker to acknowledge a member or whether that is a discretionary call. I would ask you to respond to that. Secondly, I would ask you to review the tapes of question time today. A consistent point of order that we have taken has been the delay in your asking the Prime Minister to resume his seat when a member of the opposition has risen to make a point of order. Clearly, it facilitates a completion of the answer by the Prime Minister and delays a call being sought by a member of the opposition, and I would ask you to review the tapes to see whether or not that is a practice which is occurring. I am sure it is not a conscious practice, but nonetheless it is one that has been noted on a number of occasions. I wonder whether, once you have reviewed those tapes, you could report back to the parliament.",106
193,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"As I have indicated from the outset of the parliament, it was not my intention to take questions about procedural matters that had occurred, but it would appear that it might assist if I were to make some remarks about the two matters that have been raised by the member for Dickson. Not giving him the call is something that is rare. It is not something that I would intend to use to a great extent but sparingly. I will not be reviewing the tape about the incident that he raised because my actions were as he has outlined them. As I have indicated in the past, if I believe that when somebody is rising for a point of order-and on this occasion it was the member for Flinders-the minister with the call answering the question is likely to be finishing the answer, I will allow that. So he is correct. I do not have to review the tape. That is what happened on this occasion. But I simply say to him that, even if I took the point of order, the answer would still be completed and there would be disruption and there would be delay. I am very comfortable in the way in which I have protected members' rights to rise and make points of order. As I said, I hope my action towards the member for Dickson will continue to be very rare, but they have precedence in this place, where I believe that we can continue the business without value adding by getting into a procedural debate when I was confident that I had upheld the standing and sessional orders and the precedent. The member for Dickson will remember that I had a response to a tweet of his about this particular point. I do not believe that I am giving any advantage to somebody who is completing their answer because, after the point of order is raised, it is very difficult for me then to prevent that answer being completed. Chamber Photograph",107
194,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I also have a question for you, Mr Speaker. Has your attention been drawn to an uncharitably titled article in today's Sunshine Coast Daily which reads ‘Slipper denies speech snooze' and the accompanying photograph. In particular, the article claims: A photograph of Mr Slipper, taken from a mobile phone on the Opposition side of parliament, was sent anonymously to the Daily yesterday afternoon.

227,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Four young men dead, 105 house fires, 1,000 electrified roofs and probably many thousand more, 240,000 dangerous or substandard insulations, up to 30,000 lost jobs, hundreds of small businesses heading for liquidation, three companies so far charged with fraud and hundreds more to come, at least 21 explicit warnings of danger ignored, a $450 million bill to fix up the mess, and estimations of compensation claims perhaps as high as $1 billionthat is the tragic tally of personal, environmental and economic disasters created by just one of the Rudd Labor government's programs. And the government expect the Australian people to give them a second term, to give them more opportunities to administer programs in this kind of shoddy way! They expect us to give them more opportunities to affect the lives of thousands of Australians in an adverse way. They criticise us for obstructing their islative program. They expect us to support their other grand plans, like the uncosted National Broadband Network-what a debacle that is! Before the election it was going provide, for $4.7 billion, a high-speed broadband fibre-to-the-node system to 98 per cent of Australia. The first connections were going to be made by Christmas 2008. Now it is only 90 per cent of Australians who are to be served. Two million people have been excluded, mostly in regional areas, including every town under 1,000 people, and the cost is $43 billion. What is more, nobody wants to build it. There is no plan. All they have is a plan to belt up Telstra to a pulp. The reality is that this government has failed. It cannot administer programs. It has failed to deliver, and Australians are suffering from its incompetence. I do not think I have ever in my life seen a program more poorly managed or so disastrously administered as Labor's Home Insulation Program. Yet not one person has actually lost their job over this appalling debacle. The Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts is still drawing the same wage. So is the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery. So is the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. So is the Prime Minister. The minister for the environment has been asked to take the rap. This ‘first-class minister' has been hit with a supercharged feather, but all he is doing is playing in a smaller chook pen. The reality is that he has had to take the blame, and he must be looking with angry eyes at the ministers sitting alongside him who are getting off scot-free. The blame certainly lies higher up, amongst ministers who were part of this so-called project control group that had responsibility for the devising of the program early in the piece. In question time on 24 February, when asked about the government's insulation proleg- gram, the Prime Minister acknowledged that ‘in the early part of 2009 an initial risk assessment was done for the cabinet'. So cabinet arranged to have a risk assessment to done-according to the words of the Prime Minister-inFebruary 2009. There was an additional assessment in April-the Minter Ellison report, which has been ignored. In fact, the minister said that he did not even see it for 10 months, in spite of weekly reports from his department on the progress. The project control group should have been well and truly aware that they were acting with a program which had considerable got dangers. In fact, on 24 February in this House, the Prime Minister said, in commenting on the insulation program: I also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that in 2008, against an industry that at that stage was rolling out something in the vicinity of 50,000 to 75,000 retrofitted insulations each year, the number of fires was, I am advised, something in the order of 83. The Prime Minister was talking about 83 fires in the insulation installation; yet here he was ramping up a program 10 times bigger100-fold-and no measures were taken to ensure that there would not be 100 times more fires as a result of the program they were implementing. The government are culpable in this area. They were warned. They knew that there were serious issues associated with the development of a program of this nature, but the Prime Minister and other senior ministers took no action to intervene. Now there is a tally of death and destruction which is plain for us all to see. It is also a major disappointment that there has been such a trashing of confidence in the roof insulation industry-a legitimate trade which has effectively been ruined. Stefanie Balogh, commenting in the Courier-Mail, wrote: The Rudd Government's $2.45 billion home insulation program ended up turning into a magnet for every cowboy in town. It was certainly a magnet for rorts. Let us look at a few of the rorts that have so far been identified-and there are undoubtedly many more. There were really no quotes below $1,600 ever given, even though the average cost for roof insulation was only $1,200. The government woke up to that months and months later and reduced the amount of the rebate. But, again, there was never going to be a quote below that number because the government were prepared to give out $1,600 without even asking any questions. The government have clearly paid scores of claims-maybe hundreds-for jobs that were never done, for households that do not even exist. Two quotes were required but often they came from the same company. There was quote collusion between companies to share the jobs between them. Quotes were made by using Google Earth. People did not even bother to inspect the houses; they just found the house on Google Earth and then sent a quote in the mail. They used substandard insulation-batts cut in two. Companies were passing themselves off to householders as being government agencies. Fly-by-night installers were leaving botched or difficult jobs incomplete. No-one took any action to intervene. And the companies responsible for dodgy insulation are now being told that they can inspect their own work and repair it. The opposition brought to the attention of the House in question time a couple of weeks ago the plight of the Smith family of Gympie. Mr Smith said that the installers cut rolls of fibre insulation the wrong size and left the cut rolls uninstalled in his roof cavity. He said that the installers fell through the plaster ceiling above his bedroom wardrobe, that they behaved in a threatening manner when he became upset and that they suggested that they sort it out at the pub when his wife ordered them out of the house. Two months later, the installers had not been in contact to repair the damage. The Smiths called the police, who were also called to investigate another incident, apparently involving the same people. This is the kind of behaviour that the government was subsidising through its ill-considered and inappropriately supervised program. Electricians had been warning for ages that the use of foil insulation in homes could be dangerous. Kyle MCKennon said that he always believed the use of foil insulation in homes was a disaster waiting to happen. He said: From the moment I heard about this the alarm bells started going. David Benjamin, from Kawanna Electrical at Buddina, said: The whole concept of putting a conductor in a ceiling cavity is absurd. Mr Benjamin went on to say that he had received numerous calls from people who had had foil insulation installed and were now concerned about their safety. Is it any wonder? One suggested that the minister might like to get up in the roof and put his finger on the insulation to test for himself whether or not their roof was electrified. Stan Dennis, an electrician from Nanango with 50 years experience working in the electrical industry, said that if anyone has aluminium foil in their ceiling, they should get rid of it immediately. David Elston, an electrician from Cooroy, called my office to warn that rodents chew cables in the roofs of homes. He stated that even if there was an inspection done one day and considered okay, the next day a cable could be chewed by a rodent, making the house unsafe. An article in the Sunshine Coast Daily reported: Charlie Gardener ... said he was angered visiting several retirement villages where dents' homes had been fitted with the potentially dangerous foil which he believes “doesn't even work”. Several months ago he wrote to the Federal Government about his concerns, but never received a report. The government were asleep at the wheel. They were not on watch. They were not doing what they should have been doing when supervising a massive multibillion dollar program-a program which has had such disastrous consequences. The editor of the Fraser Coast Chronicle wrote in an editorial: Before the program was introduced I got a quote to insulate my home in Grafton and it came in at $1700. After the rebate scheme was announced I got new quotes. Both were more than $2200. The rorts were happening every day and the government were doing nothing about it. Now, of course, the government have set up a complaints inquiry line. You can ring a number to get some assistance. Caulfield man David Wise, 78, was reported in the Herald Sun as saying that when he rang the government hotline yesterday he was told it could take five years to get his insulation checked. And the minister made some similar comments this morning when he said that he had no idea at all how long it was going to actually take to inspect all of these roofs and all of these insulations. The government has now passed this program on to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I do not think that department has the kind of record that would give you any confidence it was going to be able to fix the mess. Today, the parliament has given the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency another $20 million for office space. Some of that is going to be taken over by the people who are supposed to fix this bungled program, but it after is also going to house 150 bureaucrats who resi- have been employed to administer the government's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. What Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? It is not there, yet 150 bureaucrats are moving into $20 million worth of new office space so they can administer the program. The Treasurer acknowledged on 4BC in Brisbane that the legislation was not going to pass. We have had other ministers going around the press gallery saying that the CPRS is dead. The public servant who heads the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency really belled the cat. The Canberra Times reported that he was blunt when talking to the staff on hearing the news that he was to administer this program and said that the public servants responsible for dealing with this insulation debacle have been through hell. He said: You have not had ... the resources that you needed to do the job and even if you had, there are inherent policy design flaws ... He said that he did not feel he could do much better and said: It's not like the DCC has any expertise in this area. DCC is not a program manager ... The government have now handed the responsibility for fixing the mess to a department that says straight out: ‘We've got no expertise in this area. We know nothing about it.' This has been a bungled program from beginning to end. Mr Garrett has taken some of the heat but the reality is that the whole government are culpable for incompetent administration and they are showing no signs yet that they are actually going to do anything to fix things. But that is not the end of this government's inabilities. A government which could not give away home insulation during a heatwave is now asking us to trust them to run the hospitals. The New South Wales Labor government have already produced a list of 117 district hospitals, community surgeries, psychiatric facilities, multipurpose hospitals and nursing homes that they believe will close as a result of the Rudd Labor government's new hospitals program. New South Wales have named their hospitals that are on Labor's closure list. Why don't Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory do exactly the same? We need to know who is on the hit list. Which hospitals are going to take the hit because of Labor's proposed new arrangements? Labor's health plan will not produce one extra dollar for health. Simply rebadging some of the states' GST money and calling it federal money does not make the amount of money available for hospitals any greater. And they are going to set up an extra level of bureaucracy. What hospital services are going to be cut? We were told yesterday that the Prime Minister is going to reward hospitals that produce good results. Where is that money coming from? What services are going to be cut to enable those rewards to be paid? No-one should ever have any confidence in a health scheme administered by this Prime Minister. When he was running Queensland, to use his own words, as chief adviser to the Goss Labor government, he abolished local hospital boards-the very boards he is now proposing to build. He also closed hundreds of hospital beds across the state. He has form. He has a record in managing hospitals and it is a disastrous record. He began the demise of the great Queensland health system and he should not be trusted with the national health system. (Time expired)",109
228,Ms MCKEW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (4.18 pm)-It has been a most interesting contribution to this MPI from the Leader of the National Party. We have had a tirade of, I think, 17 or 18 minutes against the government's comprehensive plans to deal with the problems that we have outlined in the Home Insulation Program and about three minutes on health which I suggest gives us a very good idea of the opposition's priorities when it comes to one of the most important reform agendas before us today. As the Leader of the National Party knows full well, about this time yesterday afternoon the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency provided the House with a comprehensive ministerial statement of how he plans to deal with the problems in the Home Insulation Program. In his usual forensic fashion, he comprehensively went through all of the problems and was completely open and direct about the number of houses that will be inspected as a result. Interestingly, just in the last couple of days I spoke to an installer in my area in northern Sydney-a legitimate operator; someone who has been in the business for about 10 years-who runs a company called Safe and Sound Insulation. He talked about some of the problems that he has had and it was encouraging to hear him say to me, ‘I want to be part of the solution.' I have passed that information on to the minister's office. This is what we intend to do: work with those legitimate players in the industry and deal with the problems in the Home Insulation Program. I think that the Leader of the Nationals has kept us here on false pretences. What is the title of this matter of public importance? The title is: The Government's failure to properly manage its health and infrastructure programs. Maybe this is accidental, but I think there is word missing from the title of this debate and it is ‘former'. I think it is as clear as that when we talk about a ‘failure to properly manage health and infrastructure', it is the former government that is inexplicably linked with abject failure to manage health and to manage infrastructure. You know, it is a failure we on this side of the House have to contend with every day in government. It is a failure that those opposite should reflect on. As I have said before, I think the members opposite should reflect long and hard on the sorry legacy of their 12 lazy years in government. While the bounty rolled in from the years of prosperity, members opposite sat lazily on this side, of course, and did not do the heavy lifting on infrastructure. I will come to that issue first. I do think the Leader of the Nationals has a hide to bring up this debate today when job figures show our unemployment rate effectively holding steady at just over five per cent. The national rate of unemployment is 5.3 per cent, while many of our major trading partners struggle with an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. The United States has 9.7 per cent unemployment, the United Kingdom has 7.8 per cent and in many of the European countries-the Euro zone-it is 9.9 per cent. If we look at the figures for full-time work, today's ABS figures show that full-time employment actually increased by 11,400 jobs. That is full-time employment. As the Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out, our steady result in the move to full-time employment shows something very important. On this side of the House we all give employers great credit. Employers around the country who worked with their staff and unions to keep people in jobs can now begin to raise the number of hours available to workers each week. This is what I hear across the country from employers. It has been an extraordinary collective effort by them. It just goes to show, on a day such as this, how out of touch the opposition are when they can day come into the House today and try to make a lie of those figures by denying that the Rudd government has kept our economy growing by investing in infrastructure-and, foremost, it has kept Australians working through the global financial crisis. There is not a shred of a premise for the Leader of the Opposition in this misguided, muddle-headed debate that he has brought on this afternoon when today's job figures show the national unemployment rate is 5.3 per cent. That is positive news in relative terms, but of course we do not for a minute take for granted the more than 128,000 Australians who have become unemployed since the onset of the global financial crisis after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008, nor do we forget the total number of unemployed Australians still sits at just over 615,000. As the Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out, there are still pockets of very high unemployment in Far North Queensland and in western Sydney. The government has many programs that are addressing problems in those areas and indeed in the other 20 priority areas where we have local employment coordinators working intensely with partners to ensure that there is a good employment plan and people are able to get access to training programs. The Rudd government continues to support jobs with stimulus and with priority employment programs in all of these areas. Indeed, when I crisscross the country and I talk to local government shires across the country, mayors, deputy mayors and councillors say to me just how vital the stimulus has been at every level. Whether it is the regional and local community infrastructure program, whether it is the $1 billion we have provided to every shire across the country, or whether it is the stimulus infrastructure funding we have provided to largeand medium-scale projects right across the country, the result is a continued endorsement by employers of the government strategy to provide stimulus to the Australian economy during the GFC-a strategy which is being gradually wound down as the economy improves and as jobs growth returns. I have talked on this topic before when the Leader of the Nationals has led off in a debate. I do not think he gets infrastructure, because the last time he brought on one of these debates on infrastructure I reminded him of his own failure in his electorate of Wide Bay-specifically for those people travelling on sections of the Bruce Highway, a dangerous stretch of road if ever there was one, and the Leader of the Nationals of course studiously ignored this during his years in government. ",113
229,Ms MCKEW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right; indeed he was. This is in spite of his own admission: ‘This is a dreadfully accident prone section, rated the worse piece of the highway'Mr Truss-You said this last time!",115
230,Ms MCKEW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am reminding the Leader of the Nationals,115
231,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Leader of the Nationals has had his turn.,115
232,Ms MCKEW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am reminding the Leader of the Nationals, because there seems to have been a little bit of amnesia. I think this tradition of his-his somewhat silly Thursday afternoon debates. I do not want to sound repetitive, but let us say that those sitting opposite need to be told things a few times before they sink in. I am sure it will a case of deja vu all over again. I am pleased to tell the House that, since the last time. I spoke on this, I have been in Gympie to open the $70 million upgrade of the Bruce Highway that goes through Gympie. The Leader of the Nationals is nodding and saying, ‘That's right.' Mr Truss-Thank you for coming!",115
233,Ms MCKEW,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"My pleasure, and a lovely part of the world it is. The works were finished three months ahead of schedule. Let us go to unemployment again. I have just talked about the fact that we have an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent. Why do we have that figure? The widening of the Bruce Highway in Gympie generated 164 direct and indirect jobs during the construction phase, and that upgrade is just one of any number of projects funded as part of the Rudd government's record $2.6 billion investment in the Bruce Highway. While I was there, I took the opportunity to inspect the progress on the Cooroy to Curra, section B component, of the Bruce Highway upgrade, and the earthworks there are quite something to behold. The builders there, as the Leader of the Nationals would know, are the large construction group the Abigroup. They have made huge progress. This is a $613 million upgrade that is jointly funded with the Queensland government. As you know, that is one of the busiest stretches of highway. It currently carries around 15,000 vehicles a day, and these works will ensure that the highway can meet increasing demand. In contrast to the opposition, the Rudd government is determined to improve safety is a on the Bruce Highway. I know the Leader of the Nationals will be interested in this, because we have just heard from him about the importance of safety and he has talked to us about a tally of death and destruction. As the be Leader of the Nationals well knows, there is a tally of death and destruction when it comes toConsideration interrupted. NA",115
234,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Banjara Medical Centre",116
235,Mrs MAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I was delighted to open the Banjara Medical Centre in my electorate of MCPherson, a specialist amphetamine treatment clinic. The centre is located at Mirikai-a name synonymous with innovation and excellence in the drug and alcohol sector and run by the Gold Coast Drug Council. Mirikai means a ‘place of peace' and banjara means ‘good' or ‘feeling well'. The centre received a grant of just under half a million dollars under the Amphetamine Type Stimulants Grants Program of the Department of Health and Ageing. The grant has expanded the capacity of Mirikai to provide services and facilities for a medical serdelivery vice and support team to treat both drug misuse and coexisting mental health conditions. It supports the treatment of amphetamine type substance misuse and its complications, in particular the mental health conditions come from misusing these substances. An increasing number of clients are presenting themselves to Mirikai with amphetamine type stimulants as a primary or secondary drug of concern. In 2008-09, statistics showed that 31 per cent of residential clients identified amphetamines as a primary drug of concern and another 25 per cent identified amphetamines as a secondary drug of concern. Statistics from the new Complex Needs Assessment Panel, which is housed at Banjara, indicate that more than 50 per cent of its client group with complex needs indicate amphetamines as a primary drug of choice. Many clients presenting have other medical or health issues as a result of drug use, and it became clear to the Gold Coast Drug Council that treatment and counselling support were dependent on having available a GP to address the medical concerns and make the necessary referrals to specialists. The Banjara Medical Centre now makes that possible. As mentioned previously, Mirikai has an excellent reputation, which is something I have witnessed repeatedly as the local federal member over many years. But Mirikai's reach extends beyond the electorate of MCPherson and, indeed, beyond Gold Coast City itself. It was recently announced that the Gold Coast Drug Council has been chosen to deliver a new drug and alcohol rehabilitation service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Cairns and its surrounds. When announcing the Cairns funding, the Australian government recognised the efforts of the Gold Coast Drug Council and said: … it demonstrated the strongest capacity for best practice drug and alcohol rehabilitation service and good financial management through an open tender process. The Gold Coast Drug Council's programs and services are emulated by other rehabilitation services. It has also been recognised that by the Institute for Healthy Communities Australia, one of the very few nongovernment organisations to receive such accreditation in Australia. There is no doubt that Mirikai is a success story, but the reason for its success is its people: the staff, the volunteers and those requiring rehabilitation. The CEO of Mirikai is Mary Alcorn. Mary is highly regarded in the Gold Coast community. She has been with Mirikai for 23 years and has played a huge role in making it the cutting edge organisation it is. That is what makes Mirikai special-the dedication and professionalism of its staff and all its volunteers, the innovativeness of its programs and its emphasis on lending a helping hand to those in need. The going is tougher for people with addictions and mental illness, but with the right treatment there is nothing stopping them from leading full and enriched lives. Over the years, I have met numerous graduates of Mirikai and attended their graduation ceremonies. These are young people who have had addictions and have suffered from mental illness. Many of them are exceptionally talented. I have shed a tear or two with their families as they have gone through these programs, come out the other end and become productive members of our society, particularly as part of our community on the Gold Coast. They are very brave young people, they are very talented and they have something to give back once they have gone through those rehabilitation programs. I applaud Mary and all her team for their passion, their commitment and their dedication to the programs that they are delivering on the Gold Coast. I am proud to have been associated with them and to have assisted them over the years I have been the federal member for MCPherson. Road Safety",116
236,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak about an issue that I think all members of the House are concerned about, which is the number of fatalities and injuries that occur on our roads right around Australia. Of particular concern to me are the fatalities and serious injuries that occur in South Australia and in my electorate of Kingston. Last calendar year in South Australia there were 119 fatalities and over a thousand serious injuries. This year alone-and we are only two months into the year-there have been close to 20 fatalities on South Australia's roads. We are seeing people involved in crashes that result in death, cutting short their lives. We are seeing deaths and injuries that could be avoided. There are a lot of things that contribute to fatalities and serious injuries on our roads. These include vehicle speed, drink-driving, inattention, complacency and fatigue. Improving safety on our roads is not just the role of road users-although their role is significant-and not just the role of governments. There needs to be a whole-ofcommunity approach to reducing fatalities and injuries. I have spoken to a number of people in my electorate who have survived a road crash but have had significant injury. It can be debilitating for a person's entire life. Their stories have moved me significantly, and I believe this is a serious issue that we need to give some attention to. That is why I was very pleased that the Prime Minister visited my electorate a couple of weekends ago to announce a joint federal and state government commitment of $18 million to construct a bypass at the intersection of MCLaren Vale and Victor Harbor Road. This is a dangerous intersection that has seen close to 35 crashes in the last few years and we have seen a fatality at that intersection. MCLaren Vale is growing in popularity for tourists and approximately 18,000 cars use that intersection corridor to the city on a daily basis. This is a very important commitment. It is an example of the state and federal government working together to look at where the problems are-this was previously a Tjunction-and how we might go about addressing them. The contribution from the federal government is $14.4 million and the contribution from the South Australian government is $3.6 million. Also, improving this intersection will support 120 local jobs. This has been one of the very important initiatives in my electorate and hopefully the federal government can contribute in improving the safety of our roads. As I started off saying, road accidents are a concern of mine, and I think everyone in this House should be concerned that close to 181 young people between the ages of 16 and 24 were seriously injured on our roads last year. Young drivers only make up 11 per cent of the total population but they account for 34 per cent of all road fatalities and 25 per cent of serious injuries. They are overrepresented in this area and we all need to take this issue very seriously. We need to work with young people to continue to improve our roads and to make sure that we do something to drive down the number of fatalities and serious injuries on our roads around the country, specifically in my electorate of Kingston in South Australia. Gambling",117
237,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to raise a concern that many Australians share about the prevalence of gambling. I would particularly like to draw attention to the Productivity Commission's report about gambling in Australia-a number of its recommendations-and the incredible hypocrisy of some federal Labor members to call upon state governments to take action. There is no question that there is a need for state and territory governments to be active and engaged on this topic, but what is not so well-appreciated in this parliament is that the federal Labor government could take action if it chose to. The Rudd Labor government has chosen not to lift a finger on one of the fastest ing and most troubling areas of gamblinginteractive online gambling. It falls right within the jurisdiction of the federal parliament. There is legislation already available where action could be authorised. Instead, while the Prime Minister runs around claiming there is a war on gambling, he will not lift a finger to take any action whatsoever about a pervasive and insidious form of gambling taking hold of communities and households around our country-over which he has a full opportunity to influence. He will not take that responsibility. It is completely within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. I call on the Rudd Labor government tonight to stop talking about a war on gambling and to call off the federal Labor members of parliament who think that their job is to go around jaw-boning and gobbing off at state and territory governments to do all they should, and actually turn their minds to where they are responsible-and that is the area of interactive gambling. There was some work done in this chamber, back in 2008 when I introduced a private member's bill, that drew attention to this opportunity, in which international analysis of gambling investment opportunities pointed squarely to interactive online gambling. We have the growth of this activity in our country. It is an activity that is bringing many students in United States universities to their knees: where they can all get around some technology, have all the sounds, sights and stimuli of race day, and gamble to their heart's content. They can consume alcohol. They can do this in their own homes. They can lose their own home without leaving it and lose their shirt without even having to put one on. This is the reality of gambling. It is a growth area that we should tackle now. Instead of going around putting out big stategrowments about what everyone else should be doing, the Rudd Labor government should do what it is able to do, what it is responsible for and what is right within its jurisdiction. There are technologies around that could possibly open the way for conditional approval of this activity but with some of the safeguards that are so regularly talked about in poker venues. These poker machine venues-and I must declare a picayune interest-bore me witless; but for those people who get pleasure out of them they are a part of the social fabric of many communities. But they are incredibly supervised. They are in venues where there are dress codes. They are in locations where your activity is observed. They have got restrictions on alcohol consumption. There are even now further measures on how you can update your access to cash, the size of the bets you can place, the amounts you can lose and the constraints you can impose on your own behaviour in a venue that is public with all of those accountabilities and checks and balances. Yet debate in this parliament from Labor members focuses more on that heavily regulated, highly observed and highly supervised form of gambling. But it blissfully and conveniently ignores this insidious form of gambling that is in your home, away from any observation, away from any constraints on how your update through EFTPOS the funds that you are gambling, no limit on the technology use in terms of the value of the wagering, the cost of your betting session, the frequency with which it is updated, no caution or concern about losses that might be recorded and no-one there checking to make sure you are not incredibly inebriated while you pour enormous amounts of money into this technology. Why is this such a blind spot? Why won't the federal Labor government and Prime Minister Rudd, if he has got a skerrick of genuine concern and a slither of authentic belief that gambling is a problem, lift a ger? Why will he not lift a finger to tackle an area of gambling that is one of the fastest growth areas over which the Commonwealth has complete jurisdiction? Conveniently, and I think incredibly disappointingly, the Rudd Labor government just turns its back completely on this area. I urge people to turn their minds to this opportunity. I invite the government to pick up my private member's bill from 2008. I encourage the Labor members opposite to stop telling everyone else what they should be doing, to look to themselves and their responsibilities as federal legislators and to urge the Prime Minister to take action. He talks a great game about this but does absolutely nothing in an area that is completely within his court. If he is serious the Prime Minister should tackle and seek to regulate interactive gambling with all the checks and safeguards that are imposed on other forms of gambling. (Time expired) Leukaemia Foundation",118
238,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak this evening about the Leukaemia Foundation, which has a vision to cure, a mission to care. Leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma are blood cancers. In 2009, it was projected that 9,792 Australians would be diagnosed with one of these three diseases, the equivalent of one every hour. Of these, half were expected to be diagnosed with lymphoma, a third with leukaemia and a fifth with myeloma. It is estimated that someone loses their life every two hours from one of these insidious diseases. Leukaemia is the most common form of childhood cancer. People with acute leukaemia are typically required to begin treatment within 24 hours of diagnosis. This weekend the Leukaemia Foundation will be undertaking the World's Greatest Shave. Like some in this place, I am follicly challenged, but this weekend in the Riverlink fin- Shopping Centre, the biggest shopping centre in the federal electorate of Blair, the Ipswich Mayor, Paul Pisasale, will be undertaking the task of being a hairdresser. In other words, he will get the clippers out and shave my head. I am expected to join about 125,000 Australians in doing that this weekend. Last year my 18-year-old daughter was in fact the pin-up girl for Shave for a Cure Queensland. Thank goodness she is good looking like her mother and does not look like me! The Leukaemia Foundation is expecting to raise $13.5 million across the weekend of 11 to 13 March. They have got about 35 per cent of that so far. I want to commend the Leukaemia Foundation, particularly in Queensland, for the work they do. I would urge all individuals, businesses, organisations, families and friends across my electorate to get involved in this project. People have pledged to shave or colour their hair any time from 11 to 13 March. The World's Greatest Shave is one of Australia's biggest fundraising events. People of all ages can get involved. There will be hundreds of people at Riverlink this Saturday. Paul Pisasale is a good friend of mine, but I urge him to do the right thing by me and many others. I am sure Paul will undertake the task with diligence, capability and enthusiasm. I want to commend Peter Johnstone, the CEO of the Leukaemia Foundation in Queensland, for the great work he does. He is a very hard working individual, a very capable man. I also commend his offsider, Wayne Gaddes, who is a jack-of-all-trades and coordinates many events across Queensland. Leukaemia is an insidious disease. My daughter Jacqui decided to do this last year on her 18th birthday because her great uncle suffered terribly from leukaemia and she saw what it did to him. Leukaemia affects many people. It affects children, and as anyone who has seen a child suffering from leukaemia, the tragedy of it and the implications and consequences of it for their family would know, it breaks your heart. It breaks your heart whether they are a young Australian or an older Australian, because no-one should suffer from this disease. We just do not know in what causes it and we need to undertake research. We need to spend more money and we need to be aggressive in our campaign to rid our country of this scourge. This is an awful disease that respects no-one. It attacks the rich and the poor, Catholics and Protestants, gays and straight people, and people in rural and regional areas and people in the cities. Many of us in this House have had our loved ones or friends affected by leukaemia. I would urge all people in my electorate to get behind the Leukaemia Foundation, to get behind the World's Greatest Shave and to contribute, donate and participate. Let us rid our country of this insidious disease and its associated diseases. Coptic Christians",119
239,Mr MORRISON,ADJOURNMENT,"Cook) (4.49 pm)Recently I had the pleasure to meet with the Coptic Orthodox Bishop of Melbourne, Bishop Suriel. There are 70,000 Coptic Christians living in Australia today and the history of the Christian Copts in Egypt is one of a fragile co-existence punctuated by periods of persecution and violence. There are around eight million Coptic Christians living in Egypt and they do face persecution as a religious minority. The most recent massacre of Coptic Christians occurred on 6 January 2010, when six Christians and one off-duty police officer were gunned down and killed as they left church following a celebration of Christmas mass in the city of Nagaa Hammadi in Upper Egypt. During the funeral of those murdered, government security forces used tear gas to silence protesters that had gathered. This deadly attack follows years of communal violence and clashes between Copts and Muslims where churches have been fire bombed, Christian shops torched and systematic discrimination and human rights abuses have been documented by credible human rights associations including Amnesty International. Amnesty condemned the attacks and has called on the Egyptian authorities to initiate a credible investigation and to take greater measures to protect religious minorities in Egypt. Egypt is obliged under international law to ensure the protection of racial and religious groups and individuals. According to the US state department's religious freedom report, however, the Copts' ability to exercise their basic right to free worship is frustrated by Egypt's complex and frequently arbitrary requirements for building and repairing churches. Religiously discriminatory laws and practices apply to Copts concerning conversion, marriage, parenthood, education and clergy salaries. The reported abduction and rape of young Copt girls is particularly upsetting. I refer to a story in the Washington Times which details an incident which occurred last October. The article states: … Samria Markos, a single mother living in Alexandria, said her 17-year-old daughter, Amira, disappeared while on her way to work at a plastics factory. She got a call from “Sheikh Mohammed” who told her Amira was converting to Islam. When she showed up at a local mosque to look for her daughter, she was told to keep or her 9-year-old son would be killed. The woman and her son fled the area. Amira has not been heard from since. The government of Egypt has also effectively restricted Christians from senior government, political, military and educational positions and there is increasing discrimination in the private sector also. Copts are increasingly marginalised in the political system. There are currently only six Christian members of the assembly-none of whom are directly elected but are appointed by the president, to whom they are politically beholden. Whilst the Australian media and several world leaders have condemned the most recent attacks, the Australian government has not done so. Members of the US congress wrote to President Mubarak after the incident, urging Egypt to better protect the Coptic Christian community. The European parliament passed a resolution seeking for the Egyptian government to: … guarantee that Coptic Christians and members of other religious communities and minorities enjoy the full range of human rights and fundamental freedoms … The Italian foreign minister has stated that: The violence perpetrated against the Coptic Christian community in Egypt is a cause for horror and censure. The Canadian Minister for Foreign Affairs has also strongly condemned the attacks and called upon the Egyptian government to: … continue its efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice and restore calm and order to the area. We call on the broader Egyptian community to work together to end sectarian violence. In government, the coalition worked to resettle in Australia around 100 Coptic Christians each year who were persecuted for expressing their religious beliefs in Egypt. It is our silent understanding from what has been reported to us by the Copts in Australia that this arrangement no longer exists under this government. These people were resettled in Australia under our humanitarian program and it is disappointing to see that the Rudd Labor government is no longer providing assistance to these people, particularly working in concert with the Coptic Orthodox Church here in Australia. The coalition is concerned that the Egyptian government's failure to protect its minority groups will lead to an escalation in sectarian violence, and we call upon the authorities to ensure that security forces provide Coptic Christians with appropriate protection. We also call upon the Australian government to end their silence and join the calls of the international community in expressing our concern as Australians over the recent violence and continued repression of religious freedom in Egypt and to reopen access to our humanitarian visa program to Coptic Christians. Paid Parental Leave",120
240,Ms REA,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to address the debate that is currently occurring around the very important issue of paid parental leave. I do so because under ordinary circumstances, as someone who has been a working mother since I was in my early 20s and as someone who has been all my life a champion and campaigner for the rights of women and the rights of working people, to have the privilege to stand in this parliament and be part of a debate around the issue of implementing paid parental leave would be something I would welcome and be proud of. But I am a little bit concerned about the debate that is occurring at the moment because we have before us two very clearly different policies around implementing paid parental leave and I am concerned that the debate is not about implementing paid parental leave but is in fact about building up reasons to block it. I will outline that little later. We have two policies before us. One comes from the Rudd Labor government. There was a very clear election commitment by the Australian Labor Party that when a Labor government was elected it would move towards implementing a policy around paid parental leave. It is a policy that has been rigorously scrutinised and is the result of much consultation and discussion and its recommendations come out of a year-long inquiry that was conducted by the Productivity Commission. Therefore, it is a policy that is fiscally responsible, affordable and already budgeted for by the government. It is clearly one that provides equal access for all working women in this country to what is a reasonable weekly salary or wage to assist them and their families when they are at home taking time off work to look after a newborn child-a weekly equivalent of the minimum wage at around $544 per week. This builds on the tradition of the Labor Party and Labor governments, which have always been the champions of working families and the rights of working people in this country. Job security, income security, conditions of work and conditions that support working people to enjoy a lifestyle that enables them to bring up their families in a comfortable economic environment are things that we have championed over the last hundred years. On the other hand, you have the opposition presenting what has been eloquently described as a thought bubble policy that is financially irresponsible. It imposes a great big tax on everything by asking big business to pay-and it is a significant amount. Indeed, the Treasurer is saying it is around $10.8 billion. We know it will be passed on to consumers. It will become a tax on everything, not just for those who can afford to pay but for those who are least in a position a to pay. This is because it will be passed on through consumption rather than being a responsible policy funded by the government. It is also inherently unfair. It does not provide equal access to maternity leave. It says, ‘Your worthiness as a stay-at-home mother for six months is dependent on the salary that you are earning.' It does not treat and acknowledge the need for women to be able to stay home or cover their costs and supplement their income as does the government's policy. It says, ‘If you earn $150,000 then that is what you will get and if you earn $30,000 then that is what you will get.' It does not acknowledge the inherent inequality in that policy. It says that those who are the most vulnerable in this community will pay for that inequitable policy through an increase in the goods and services that they procure, because we know that big business will pass on that cost to those people they are providing goods for. I believe that this debate is not about which is the best policy on paid parental leave; it is about the opposition leader reinforcing his position that he would see paid parental leave over his dead body. He is going to argue that he will block this in the Senate. He will ignore the campaigns of the last 30 and more years of women in this country to get fair and equitable paid parental leave. He wants to block it and say he is blocking it because his policy, although irresponsible, is better. (Time expired) Question agreed to. House adjourned at 5.00 pm The following notices were given: Mr Sullivan to move: That the House: (1) recognises the importance of the Australian Defence Force Reserves (ADFR) to Australia's overall defence capability; (2) acknowledges that ADFR service requires significant sacrifices to be made on the part of Reservists, their families and their civilian employers; (3) values the contributions made by ADFR personnel during deployments with Army, Air Force and Navy colleagues; and (4) expresses appreciation to the Army Reserve personnel deployed in the Solomon Islands under Operation ANODE as part of Australia's contribution to the Pacific Island Forum's Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. Ms Parke to move: That the House: (1) recognises that 24 March is World Tuberculosis Day and notes that 9.4 million people developed tuberculosis in 2008 and that nearly 2 million people die each year from this preventable and curable disease; (2) notes that 50 per cent of new tuberculosis cases occur in the South East Asia and Western Pacific regions, and that these regions also contain half of the 22 high-burden countries for tuberculosis; (3) acknowledges the important work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria which since its inception in 2002 has disbursed over $10 billion to combat these three diseases, including providing 63 per cent of all global aid resources for the fight against tuberculosis; (4) commends the Global Fund which, through 2009, provided treatment to 6 million people who had active tuberculosis and which has been critical to the decline of prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in many countries; (5) notes that with continued and increased support for the Global Fund, the world will stay NOTICES on track to meet the international target of halving tuberculosis prevalence by 2015; and (6) recommends that the Australian Government consider committing further significant funds to the Global Fund at its replenishment meeting to be held later this year, for its ongoing and vital work to fight tuberculosis as well as AIDS and malaria. Mrs Hull to move: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) before the 2007 election the Labor Government promised to the Australian people that if elected, it would provide fast broadband to 98 per cent of households; (b) ten per cent of the population has now been left out of the Labor Government's current National Broadband Network (NBN) proposal, which equates to almost two million Australians, who largely live in the regions; (c) towns with less than 1000 residents will not have access to the same services as those from larger towns and cities; (d) if regional areas are consigned substandard access to new and emerging telecommunications options they will suffer serious economic and social impacts; and (e) small communities must be able to access internet services which allow for business and services to prosper; and (2) calls on the Government to immediately outline details of any planning for the provision of affordable and effective services for the 10 per cent of the population who are beyond the NBN footprint.",122
