1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. John MCLeay) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. CANBERRA RENTALS. Mr JR FRASER presented petitions1. From certain citizens of the Australian Capital Territory praying that the Governtold ment will take immediate action to defer implementation of rental increases government-owned dwellings in Canberra and conduct an inquiry into Canberra rentals at which evidence may be taken both from individuals and from community organizations. 2. From certain citizens of the Australian Capital Territory praying that the of government-owned dwellings in Canberra will remain as it is and the recent rent increase will not be levied. Petitions received and read. MOTION OF WANT OF CONFIDENCE. larly",11
2,Mr ALLAN FRASER,Unknown,"I address a departmental question to the Prime Minister. inform the House that he would abstain from voting on the motion of want of confidence in himself? In explanation, let say that I am doubtful whether I heard rectly, because this would mean that the Prime Minister was depriving himself of the vote of one of his greatest admirers, but question I ask is: Is this indeed what pened? Or, did the Prime Minister vote for himself on this motion, as shown by of "" Hansard "", by following his usual tice of pairing with the Leader of the sition? If this was so, was it by accident, or was it yet another policy switch on part of the Prime Minister?",11
3,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I can accept no reeach such instance. sponsibility for the vagaries of the honourable member's mind. AH that I know is that when the motion- I think it was termed an amendment-abou t myself was about to to be put to the vote, I said to my colleagues in the front bench: "" I do not think it is quite decent for me to vote for this motion. I will leave."" And I walked out. That F.2778/61 - R -[37 ] seemed to me to be not a very extraordinary circumstance. I walked out. Mr Allan Fraser - Did you pair?",11
4,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,I think that on most matters I have a standing pair with the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Allan Fraser - So that you voted on Petitions. the motion?,11
5,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"This is very cleverl No doubt I should have gone around and the Leader of the Opposition. I plead the guilty. I should have told the Leader of of the Opposition. But as my colleagues know, being an uncomplicated characterunlike the honourable member for Eden Monaro-al l I did was to say to my colleagues, "" I do not think it seems very proper for me to vote for myself,"" and so I walked out. And out I was! rent level CONTRACTS FOR COMMONWEALTH WORK.",11
6,Mr STOKES,Unknown,"In view of the existing credit restrictions, I ask the Minister for the Interior whether he will consider expediting the payments of accounts of private contractors to the Commonwealth, particuin cases where delays are caused by challenge of minor items only Did he in the overall account.",11
7,Mr FREETH,Unknown,"I shall be happy to conme sider the honourable member's request, but corI should point out that where queries are raised in relation to only minor items in an account, those matters are usually provided the for in what are known as retention moneys. hapMost contracts provide for progress payments and the withholding of a percentage the contract sum in the form of retention pracmoney, and any minor items that are Oppoqueried are usually paid for out of those funds. But if there are any instances which the the honourable member can bring to my notice in which he claims there is undue delay, I shall certainly be happy to examine SALES TAX.",11
8,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"I address a question the Treasurer. It relates to representations made to him in recent years not only by me, but also by interested organizations in connection with the present heavy incidence of sales tax on students' text-books and other essential education requirements. Does the Treasurer consider that this heavy indirect tax is imposing an additional burden on some parents, especially those in the lower income group, in providing for the education of their children? If he does consider this to be a fact, will he now consider the representations which have been made to him with a view to obtaining some relief as early as possible or, at the latest, in the next Budget proposals?",11
9,Mr HAROLD HOLT,Unknown,"I answered this next month. question, I think, in substance last week when it arose from another quarter, and I have no doubt that there are many honourable members around the House, irrespective of their party politics, who feel that sales tax on text books might, with adwish vantage, be removed in order to give some relief to parents. I pointed out when answering a question on this matter previously that the Government has instituted a policy arangement under which a deducaware tion, which has grown in size from time to time according to decisions of the Goposes vernment, could be made by parents in respect of school children dependent them. I also said that this matter would be considered in the preparation of the forthcoming Budget. I repeat that assurance to the honourable gentleman, and I shall that what he has said is also taken into account. E?4PL0YMENT.",12
10,Mr WIGHT,Unknown,"I direct a question to the increased? Minister for Labour and National Service. Has there been some fall in the number of persons unemployed in Queensland since the last statistics on unemployment were released for publication? Does Minister expect that during the course this month there will be a further heavy fall in the number of persons registered Queensland as unemployed? When the sugar season opens in the following month, will there be further dramatic falls in the number of unemployed, and will the emof ployment situation in Queensland lock far healthier at the end of those two months than it does now?",12
11,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"I cannot give precise ngures along the lines mentioned by the honourable member; but I can say that the meat killing season is now open in Queensbe land, and one would expect that large numbers of persons would from now on become employed in most of the meat works thoroughout Queensland. Secondly, the sugar season will open shortly and large numbers of persons will be employed in that industry, both for cutting and refining. So, Sir, without being quite as dogmatic as the honourable gentleman, I think it can be well said that in normal circumstances one could expect quite a substantial drop in the number of those registered for employment in Queensland this month a-.d HOUSING LOANS.",12
12,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"1 direct a question to the the Treasurer. By way of explanation, i to inform him that the cost of constructing a brick home of ten squares, including the cost of land, is approximately £5,000. The cost in fibro or in timber would be slightly lower. Is the Treasurer that the maximum loan advanced by the Commonwealth Bank for housing puris £2,500, which means in effect that any young couple contemplating building or on purchasing a new home needs to have in hand an amount of approximately £2,500, a virtual impossibility for many young couples? In view of the grave disparity see between the amount of loan available and the cost of a house, will the right honourable gentleman confer with officers of the Commonwealth Bank with a view to having the maximum loan for housing substantially",12
13,Mr HAROLD HOLT,Unknown,"The Government is concerned, of course, to see that building costs do not get out of hand, and it was the the movement in building costs and the of pressure on resources in the building industry that led to one of the major elements in of policy adopted in November of last year. The honourable gentleman can be sure that while we are concerned in this way, at the same time we noted that last year building housing units was conducted at a level of about 100,000 units in the course of the year. So, apparently, the financial problems to which he has referred did not deter a great many people from finding the necessary finance to bridge the gap. The honourable gentleman has raised a policy matter of some significance, and consideration will given to it; but I cannot at question time supply an answer on a matter of policy. AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.",12
14,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I address my question to the Treasurer. A recent statement issued by the Commonwealth Statistician shows that motor car registrations for March rose 40 per cent, above the February figures after the lifting of the additional sales tax on motor vehicles. Does this trend confirm the Government policy and confound the critics who claimed that credit restrictions would have been sufficient?",13
15,Mr HAROLD HOLT,Unknown,"It is a fact that registrations of new cars in March represented an increase of 40 per cent, on the February figures, but of course it would be misleading to argue from the figures of any particular month. For example, to accept the March figures as a monthly average would give a total for a year of 280,000 registrations, which figure has been surpassed only once in the history of this country, and that was last year. Undoubtedly the higher figures in March owed something to the fact that there had been a bank-up of people who had not bought cars, in the reasonable expectation that once the Government's measures had produced suflicient effect on the car industry the sales tax would be removed. When the sales tax was removed they proLabour ceeded to purchase their cars. I think the honourable gentleman's deducAustralia? tion from these facts is correct, and he talks about confounding the critics, I am always happy to join with him in confounding the critics of this Government. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.",13
16,Mr COPE,Unknown,Is it a fact that the Prime Minister stated in London recently that the recognition of red China was inevitable?,13
17,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,The answer is that I did not say that or anything like it. KNITWEAR.,13
18,Mr WHITTORN,Unknown,"In view of the diffithe culties being experienced by knitwear manufacturers in Australia, has the Minisngures, ter for Trade taken any action with regard to this industry?",13
19,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The answer is, "" No No request has been made to me or to the Department of Trade for any action to be taken presumably in respect of imports of knitwear. This section of the textile industry is well organized. It knows, as does the organization of which it is a member, the Chamber of Manufactures, that there exists a system of industry groups which appoint panels to present their case to the Department of Trade. I understand that there has been no approach to my department along these recognized lines for at least six months. Indeed, in Sydney recently, I met one spokesman for the knitwear industry on the textile council, and it was not then put to me that imports were a problem. But I give the honourable member these figures in relation to knitted underwear: In the last complete year there were imports of 7,000 dozen items of knitted underwear and a local production of just on 2,000,000 dozen items. In the first seven months of this year the import rate rose to 14,000 dozen a year but local production increased 260,000 dozen to an annual rate of nearly 2,300,000 dozen. UNEMPLOYMENT.",13
20,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Do the Minister for and National Service, and the Government, not feel deep concern at the ever-increasing number of unemployed in What does the Government prowhen pose to do to rectify the position?",13
21,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"It is true that there have been extensive transfers of labour from one industry to another. In fact, about 40,000 people have transferred from one industry to another during each of the last three months. That was one of the purposes of the economic and financial measures adopted by the Government last year. I think it is not untrue to say that those measures have left the country in a much stronger economic position than it has been in for some time, and that the objectives of the Government in taking those measures have been realized. As to political aspect of the honourable member's question, we watch the unemployment of course, with the greatest care. We look at them as frequently as is necessary. The honourable member has asked what action the Government intends to "". take. That is a question for the whole Cabinet to consider, and it is a question of policy. I can assure the honourable member that the whole problem of employment will be looked at by the Government within next few weeks. HYPODERMIC NEEDLES.",13
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Unknown,"My quesclear tion is directed to the Minister for Trade, who will recall that I have previously made representations regarding Everett Products Proprietary Limited, a company established in Portland, which is the only Australian manufacturer of hypodermic needles. Will the Minister undertake to make the spread resources of his department available to this company to assist it in meeting the challenge, as the company believes, of imports? If necessary, will the Minister have his department assist the company in they come. preparing a case for emergency hearing by the Tariff Board?",14
23,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The officers of the Department of Trade are at all times willing to give their best advice to Australian industry, and this certainly applies in the monwealth case of the company mentioned by the research? honourable member for Wannon. If the industry concerned has a case for protection, this would become apparent to departmental officers when discussing with the company's representatives the problems confronting the industry, and they would, of course, give advice on the best course to be followed. TAXATION.",14
24,Mr BEATON,Unknown,"I direct a question to the Treasurer. Has the Government received a request from the Premier of toria, resulting from a report made by an ail-party Distribution of Population Comvey mittee in the Victorian Parliament, for major extension of regional tax concessions for the purpose of assisting in the establishaccommodation ment of industries in country areas? view of the undoubted success that such houses? concessions would achieve in inducing industry to set up in industry-starved country centres and the possibility such extensions would add to our export earnings, will the Government favourably consider the proposal? I assure the Treasurer that if he has not already received such a request, he will receive it in the future.",14
25,Mr HAROLD HOLT,Unknown,"I have seen public references to this matter, to the effect the either that the Premier of Victoria was sending a request of this kind to the Commonwealth Government or that some formal letter on the subject had already reached the Prime Minister. I am not on the details, but undoubtedly the Premier of Victoria intends to make some representation's of the kind suggested by the honourable member. For our part, we are very conscious of the importance of providing, in the years ahead, for a wider of industrial activity outside the major capital cities of the Commonwealth. We shall look with interest, and not withcheap out sympathy, at requests of this kind which may reach us, from whatever State FORESTRY RESEARCH.",14
26,Mr FORBES,Unknown,Can the Minister for the Interior say whether any decision has yet been reached on the question of Comparticipation in forestry,14
27,Mr FREETH,Unknown,"I hope, with the leave of the House, to make a short statement on this matter after question time. I think the honourable member for Barker will find that my statement will satisfy him. HOUSING.",14
28,Mr BIRD,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister, before the next Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is brought before the Parliament for discussion, consider having the VicCommonwealth undertake an intensive surof the overall housing position in Ausa tralia, for the purpose of determining, amongst other things, whether sufficient is being made available to In those people who can afford only to rent",14
29,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The department of my that colleague, the Minister for National Development, is constantly engaged in making such a survey and in bringing it up to date. I have no doubt that we shall have all the advantage of that when we are called near on, in Cabinet, to consider what we ought to do about the renewal of the agreement. CATTLE RESEARCH STATION.",14
30,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister in charge of the Commonapplicants wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. Have arrangements been made for the establishment of a new cattle research station and research laboratory Queensland? If so, where will these units be established and how will they assist important cattle-export industry?",15
31,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"As the picture. honourable gentleman will know, there are already several very important research stations established by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization directly concerned with the cattle industry in Queensland. There are such institutions as the Cunningham Laboratory in Brisbane, which deals with what I might call the environmental side of the problem, that is, the question of pastures. There also the National Cattle Breeding Station at Rockhampton where experiments are progress in developing the best type of cattle to be used in tropical Australia. It is posed that the next step will be the estab Mr. lishment of a further station at Townsville, and in fact preliminary steps have already been taken and plans laid for the developthat ment of this station. The exact time which it will be possible to proceed setting it up will depend upon questions such as the availability of requisite staff, but the preliminary steps have been taken and this will be the next stage in the development of a very intensive programme of research which will be of great benefit to cattle breeding in Australia. UNEMPLOYMENT IN QUEENSLAND. give",15
32,Mr RIORDAN,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Labour and National Service tell me what steps the Government proposes to take to deal with the serious unemployment situaNonetheless, tion which exists in Queensland and which is daily growing worse? I ask this question in view of the fact that it will be May before the meat works open and lune before the sugar season gets under way.",15
33,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"It so happens that already the meat season is under way and Rockhampton has opened; and I understand that Gladstone will open today. I have now been assured that Gladstone will open today. So it is expected that there will be a considerable reduction in the number of for employment in Queensland during the next few weeks. A little later, the sugar season will commence. I have nothing else to add to the answer I gave into the honourable gentleman from Bonython that this matter constantly engages the the attention of the Government, and in the course of the next fourteen days we will be having a look at it in the general economic UNEMPLOYMENT.",15
34,Sir KENT HUGHES,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service. What percentage of the unemployment figures is due to seasonal workers who register in case there is a job which suits them in the offis season? What percentage of the registrationfigureswould be the hard core of those in who through age, physical or chronic disabilities are very difficult to employ? Does prothe Minister agree with the statement by Monk, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to the Australian Citizenship Convention on 24th lanuary, 1.5 per cent, is due to the seasonal by figure, and with his statement, which I with quote, "" We do not want to get panicky over a minor percentage of unemployment finance and the in this country ""?",15
35,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"If I can take the first and third questions together, we do not keep separate records of seasonal employment. Naturally enough, this month I have had a special review made of the meat and sugar industries in Queensland and I can the honourable gentleman estimated figures of seasonal employment up there, but we do not keep detailed records of seasonal employment throughout Australia. I thought that the recent statement by Mr Monk that 1.5 per cent, of the Australian people might be temporarily unemployed for seasonal reasons was very moderate and sensible. I have no reason to disagree with what Mr Monk has said. As to the second part of the question relating to persons temporarily unemployable, my department looks at this matter in a subjective way because we like to think that all people are employable and we try to find jobs for them. Nonetheless, one very well-known and accurate commentator has recently mentioned a figure for persons temporarily unemployable with which I would not like to disagree. As to Mr Monk's comment that we should not panic because of the percentage of unemployed mentioned by him, again I think that Mr Monk was being temperate and sensible, and I feel that I can certainly agree with that part of his statement. TIMBER.",15
36,Mr FULTON,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Trade state whether all the negotiations and conferences in relation to the state of the timber industry have been concluded? If so, is there any hope that this industry will operate as it did before the recent restrictions so as to relieve the unemployment in Queensland, particularly north Queensland?",16
37,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I said last week that, within a few days, I expected to reach a decision on the representations of the timber industry. I am scheduled to have discussions before the day is out with the officers of my department who have been working with the timber industry. Perhaps, tomorrow, I will be able to say something further on it. TRADE WITH CHINA.",16
38,Mr IAN ALLAN,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Primary Industry in a position to say whether the recent large sales of wheat and other grains to mainland China and eastern ports are Ukely to be repeated in future? In other words, do these sales represent the opening up of a new and valuable market for the export of primary commodities?",16
39,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,When the general manager of the Australian Wheat Board was in Hong Kong recently it was indicated to him that mainland China would be a likely buyer of Australian grains in subsequent years as well as this year. That is the only information that I have concerning possible future sales. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,16
40,Mr DALY,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for Territories been directed statement by the South African Prime Minister, Dr Verwoerd, to the effect Australia was practising the same racial policy in Papua and New Guinea as South Africa was practising at home? If so, will the Minister state whether or not this statement is correct? If it is not correct, will the Minister deny the truth of the statement, outline the policy being followed and, at the same time, assure our Asian friends and the nations of the world that Australia in no way supports the inhuman racial policies of the South African Prime Minister and his Government?",16
41,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"I will not comment on Dr Verwoerd's statement because I have not seen the authentic text of it. I will be very pleased to state on behalf of the Government the policy which we follow in Papua and New Guinea. First of all, we have declared publicly, again and again, that in our anticipation the future of Papua and New Guinea is a future in which the indigenous population, which far outnumbers the immigrant population and will be the dominant element. When we talk of self-determination we recognize quite clearly that the major factor in self-determination will be the indigenous population. That is the prospective situation. To turn to the current situation, we have announced on several occasions-the latest being at the opening of the Legislative Council for Papua and New Guinea last week-that we have embarked on a course of removing all forms of discrimination from the laws of the Territory. The policy directive given on that particular subject is that unless it can be definitely shown that a law is necessary either to respect the customs of the indigenous people or to protect them from injury, there is to be complete equality before the law for all inhabitants of the Territory. PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM PACKAGES.",16
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Unknown,"Is the Postmaster-General aware of the habit of manufacturers of film of supplying to the purchaser of film a packet in which the film is to be returned by mail for processing? Does he know that the purchaser must enter his name and address on the place provided on the packet, and that apparently confusion is caused while such to a packages are being handled in the post, with the result that undeveloped films are that often returned to the users, because mail sorting staff cannot decipher, due to the position of the sender's address on the package, which is the correct destination intended? Will the Postmaster-General the department to confer with film manuundertaken facturers with a view to having the packet improved in design so as to avoid confusion?",16
43,Mr DAVIDSON,Unknown,"The matter substand mitted by the honourable member for development Wannon has not been brought to my attento tion before, but I am aware of the practice of certain film manufacturers of providing a packet for the return of film for processappropriate ing, complete with a label addressed to film processor, on which the user of the film inserts his name and address. It appear from the honourable gentleman's question that the name of the person returning the film is so prominently displayed on the package as to cause some confusion among postal staff who handle hundreds of thousands of articles, sorting them very quickly. I shall certainly make some inquiry into the point raised and, if necessary, direct the attention of the facturers to the honourable gentleman's statement. RUSSIAN SPACE ACHIEVEMENTS.",17
44,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister considered sending congratulations to the Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on recent space achievements by Russia as, so it is reported, has been done by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Macmillan, and the President of the United States of America, Mr Kennedy?",17
45,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I took the opportunity, in Adelaide the other day, in the presence of a representative of the Scientific Academy of the Soviet Union, to express our appreciation of the great work that has been done, and to congratulate them upon it. AIDS FOR THE BLIND.",17
46,Mr CLEAVER,Unknown,"My question is has directed to the Minister for Health. honourable gentleman aware of the progress made at St. Dunstan's Home for the Blind in the United Kingdom in respect of the use of an optophone instrument which converts printed words to a sound alphabet of under musical notes? As this opens up attractive prospects for the blind people of Australia. I ask the honourable gentleman whether the ask necessary research and experiments may be by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories where, possibly, these instruthis ments could be manufactured.",17
47,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"I underthat there has been considerable in this field since the machines which the honourable gentleman referred were first produced. I am not sure that the acoustics laboratory would be the place for the investigation of the these machines, but I will give the matter some consideration and let the honourable would member have an answer to his question. GOVERNOR-GENERAL.",17
48,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,I ask the Prime Minister: Was there any particular reason why he did not recommend a native-born Australian for the post of Governor General?,17
49,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,No . I recommended a manugentleman whom I believe to be the most suitable in all the circumstances. SHIPBUILDING.,17
50,Mr STOKES,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. When the Minister is reviewing the tenders for the proposed construction of a Commonwealth survey vessel, will he give special consideration to the tender submitted by the Williamstown shipyard and thus help to promote continuity of employment there and also save at least £300,000, which represents the 10 per cent, profit margin on a contract of approximately £3,000,000 which would have to be paid if the job were given to other shipyards?",17
51,Mr OPPERMAN,Unknown,"I have taken note of the figures that the honourable member has given. I did not thmk that such comparisons could be made until tenders were submitted, but since the honourable gentleman brought the matter to my attention, I Is the shall have a look at it. CANBERRA HOUSING.",17
52,Mr JR FRASER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for the Interior: Has the Government consideration any proposal that it sell to a private firm of estate agents or to any other private financial group a number of govern meat-owned dwellings in Canberra? The Minister may remember that I asked a question about this some eighteen months ago. I ask the Minister also: Alternatively, is the Government considering handing over to a private firm the collection of the rents of a number of government-owned houses in Canberra?",17
53,Mr FREETK,Unknown,"Some very strange rumours originate in this city. I can assure the honourable member that there is no foundation for either of these rumours. Indeed, I go further and add that ! do not think it is remotely possible that any private estate agents would be interested in anything as unprofitable as are Canberra rents. UNZAIPLOYMENT.",18
54,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"1 direct my question to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Is it a fact that the Leader of the Opposition, in a television interview in Brisbane early in Fehruarv. predicted that in March 150.00U would be unemployed? Is the Leader of the Opposition half-right or half-wrong? If he is half-wrong, is not that better than usual?",18
55,Mr MCMAHON,Unknown,"It has been reported that the Leader of the Opposition made some very extravagant statements. But, after all, this is only to be expected of him. As to whether he is half-right or half-wrong, frankly, 1 do not know, but it would be exceptional if we were ever to find the day when he turned out to be correct.",18
56,Mr UREN,Unknown,"I address my question to the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs. Last Tuesday, I asked him which government Australia recognized as the legal government of Laos, and he stated in reply that he would deal with that matter in his statement to be made on the evening of that day. However, the right honourable gentleman did not indicate in his statement which government was recognized by Australia, and I now ask: Which government does the Australian Government recognize-that of Prince Souvanna Phouma, which is recognized by the United Kingdom Government, or that of Prince Boun Oum, which is recognized by the Government of the United States of America?",18
57,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"If the honourable member is interested in anything quite so irrelevant, having regard to the recent developments in Laos, 1 will be happy to have him put his question on the notice-paper. UNIFORM COMPANY LAW.",18
58,Mr MACKINNON,Unknown,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Will he inform the House whether any progress has been made in discussions between officers of the Attorney-General's Department and officers of the corresponding departments of the States in connection with the preparation of a uniform company law for Australia?,18
59,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,I understand that the officers and the Attorneys General themselves have completed their deliberations and that the bill is practically complete. FORESTRY AND TIMBER BUREAU.,18
60,Mr FREETH,Unknown,"Forrest-Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works - by leave - The Government has decided to establish a Forest Research Institute to strengthen and extend the work of the research sections of the Forestry and Timber Bureau. The institute will function as a division of the bureau in close association with the Australian Forestry School and appropriate divisions of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. LAOS. An Australian Forestry Council will be created under the Forestry and Timber Bureau Act to serve as a national advisory body on forestry matters. The advice of the council will be used by the bureau to ensure that its work is co-ordinated with related activities in the forest services of the Australian States and Territories, in CSIRO., in the universities, and in the timber industry. The final composition of the council will require further consideration, but it will contain representatives of the forest services of the Australian States and Territories, the timber industry, CSIRO.. the universities, and, if considered desirable, other appropriate organizations. Through the Australian Forestry Council, the Forest Research Institute and divisions of the Forestry and Timber Bureau, the Commonwealth Government will extend its activities in the field forestry and thereby give added assistance to the timber industry from a long-term point of view. This long-term it should be pointed out, is entirely separate from the detailed examination of the immediate economic stresses being felt the industry, which the Government is currently undertaking. In essence, the task ahead is to assist bringing Australia's forest estate to dition of maximum productivity. The annual growth of the forests in 1955 was estimated as 6,216,000,000 super, feet. Against this increment, we meanwhile sities harvest for annual use 6,132,000,000 super, feet of timber, waste over another 1.200,000,000 super, feet in the process, and lose another 1,716,000,000 super, feet to borers, insects, and fire present, therefore, our annual debit in timber exceeds the replacement capacity of the forests by a figure of no less than 2,832,000,000 super, feet-o r more half the volume actually harvested. Even rhat fails to convey the full gravity of situation because the above losses do not include arrested forest growth due to State periodic defoliations and other injuries following bushfires, disease and insect attack. Loss of potential growth on this account adds up to at least another 6.000,000,000 super, feet a year. After allowing for some unavoidable waste in harvesting, the 9,000,000,000 super, feet or so of forest growth at present many) and being lost every year would, if it could saved, be worth, at present-day prices, about £25,000,000 standing in the forest. If research resulted in a saving of only mere 10 per cent, of this loss the value of that 10 per cent, at mill door in the form of logs and pulpwood would be around the £7.000,000, and in the term ^hreboard and paper its final value at consuming centres would be about £30,000,000. The return from the increased production would more than cover any extra cost all : ncurred in growing it, and it is confidently believed that scientific research can, within a few years, result in a much greater saving than 10 per cent, of the present losses. One of the main activities of the Forestry other and Timber Bureau during the past 35 years has been the development of the Australian Forestry School. This school was of established by the Commonwealth at the request of the States, to provide a national centre of forestry education to graduate approach, or post-graduate level. Graduate forestry training in Australia by is celebrating its jubilee year. The Australian Forestry School started as a Commonwealth activity in Adelaide in 1926, when it took over the degree course in in forestry established by the University of a conAdelaide in 1911. The University of Adelaide generously agreed to forgo a field which had been allocated to it by the vice-chancellors of the Australian Univerin favour of a national school which could be staffed at an acceptable international standard. The course at Adelaide had been built up by staff trained at the forestry schools of the Universities of damage. At Oxford and Edinburgh. To develop further a suitable Australian course in forestry, the Commonwealth Gothan vernment created a Board of Higher Forestry Education under the Forestry and the Timber Bureau Act. This advisory board consists of representatives of the Australian universities and forest services. With the advice of this Board, the Commonwealth appointed staff trained at leading forestry schools in Europe, America and New Zealand. The lecturing staff has included graduates from the Australian States, New Zealand, Oxford, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, London, Yale (United States of America), Nancy (France), Dresden (GerCopenhagen (Denmark). be Features from all these institutions have been incorporated in the Australian Forestry School course and adapted to the a Australian scene. As a result, the school has been accepted as a major forestry training centre and its ex-students now make up greater part of the graduate staff of our of sawn timber, forest services. This system of co-operation and co-ordination will be used to make the work of the divisions of the Forestry and Timber Bureau fit the requirements of Australian forests and its timber industry. During the past 35 years the bureau has carried out a great deal of research work in the fields of forest management and assessment, timber supply economics, bush fire control, introduction of suitable exotic conifers and other trees, tree breeding, forest soils and nutrition, forest botany and tree physiology, ln carrying out this work the Forestry and Timber Bureau has co-operated with the forest services and other institutions, but the research sections have not had the type of support given to the Australian Forestry School by the Board of Higher Forestry Education. The advice of the Australian Forestry Council will be used lo assist the Forest Research Institute and other divisions of the bureau to develop and coordinate their work with appropriate institutions in Australia and her Territories. At present, successful students of the Australian Forestry School can only graduate at the universities at which they carried report. out their earlier training. The Government realizes that the development of the School of General Studies within the Australian National University might provide a more suitable means of graduation for Forestry School students, particularly post-graduate field, if use could be made of the various fields of research in Canberra which deal with problems influencing the growth and use of timber. Conferences will be invited between the Australian National University and appropriate authorities to see if a mutually satisfactory association of the Forestry School with the University could be developed, which would retain the present collaboration between the institutions which support the school and on which its students must depend for later employment. In addition to research and education, the Forestry Timber Bureau Act 1950-1953 gives the bureau functions of advice, the awarding of forestry scholarships, the collection, publication and distribution of statistics and information on forestry and timber, and the management of forests placed under its control. The Government has received strong representations from the timber industry to strengthen the bureau so that the effectiveness of its work can be increased. Measures which might properly come within the functions of the bureau and which might assist the development of the timber industry are being considered. I lay on the table the following paper:Forestry and Timber Bureau-Ministeria l Statementand move That the paper be printed.  adjourned. NA COMMITTEE.",18
61,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown," by leave-As honourable members know, I have had under consideration for some time the report of the Copyright Law Review Committee. Before the Government makes any decisions on the report, an opportunity is being given to members of the public to make comments and submissions regarding the recommendations contained in the The report evidences on its face the careful and thoughtful work of all the members of the committee, to whom our thanks are due for their thorough investigation and consideration of a difficult field of law, and in the one which has so many more practical applications than we are apt to realise. I mention this aspect of the matter not only for the purpose of publicly recognizing the value of the work of the committee, but also to emphasize that, while the Government still has to consider the report and I have to decide what advice I will give to Cabinet on the various recommendations of the committee, I do not propose to embark on anything like a ministerial re-hearing of all the submissions made to the committee. However, it is proper that some opportunity should be given to the public, and to the interests most affected by the issues raised in the report, to make representations to me. Some have already done so. I ask that any submissions should be made to my department by 31st May if possible. Persons making submissions will naturally do so in the form that they think best. It would help me considerably, however, if submissions did not reiterate information or arguments put to the committee. I shall have that material already before me, and will take it into account in considering each of the committee's recommendations. 1I have arranged that every member of Parliament shall receive this week a copy of the report. If after members have had an opportunity to consider the report it appears that a debate is desirable, I will arrange for the formal tabling of the report and for the moving of a proper motion to enable the debate to take place.

VOTING RIGHTS OF ABORIGINES. Appointment of Select Committee.",20
62,Mr FREETH,Unknown,"Forrest-Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [3.29] I move1. That a select committee be appointed inquire into and report on(a) whether the entitlement to enrolment the right to vote presently conferred the Commonwealth Electoral 1918-1953 on persons referred to in section 39 of that act should extended with or without qualificanatives tions, restrictions or conditions to(i) all aboriginal natives (ii) aboriginal and, if so, (b) the modifications, if any, that should made to the provisions of that relating to enrolment or voting vide for enrolment and voting by aboriginal natives or any particular classes of aboriginal natives. 2. That the select committee consist of members, four to be appointed by the Prime Minister and three to be appointed ot the Opposition. 3. That every appointment of a member of the committee be forthwith notified in writing to Speaker. 4. That the chairman be one of the members appointed by the Prime Minister. 5. That the chairman of the committee from time to time appoint another member the committee to be deputy chairman, and that the member so appointed act as chairman of committee at any time when the chairman is present at a meeting of the committee. 6. That the chairman or the deputy chairman, when acting as chairman, shall have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of voting, a casting vote. 7. That the select committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, to during any adjournment of the House, and move from place to place. 8. That the committee report to the House not later than the 31st day of October, 1961. 9. That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the Standing Orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders. The existing laws of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia give full franchise to aboriginal natives by virtue of the fact that the voting laws of those States confer on natives full voting rights. But, of course, most of the nomadic natives are in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and in those areas the governing authorities have not seen fit to grant full voting rights to natives. In Western Australia, provision is made for those natives who live according to our ways, and who have some knowto ledge of reading and writing, to obtain citizenship rights. In the Northern Terriand tory, all natives except those who are by declared wards of the State, are deemed Act to have citizenship rights; but there, of be course, a large proportion of the nomadic are declared wards of the State. In Queensland, natives of half aboriginal of Ausblood or more have no voting rights unless tralia, or they are specifically exempted by the natives of Australia Government. included in particular classes, and, if so, what classes; This is an extremely difficult problem. It was discussed in 1946, although very be briefly, by a Premiers' Conference when the act then Premiers of Western Australia and to proQueensland indicated that they did not think it practicable to give full voting rights to aborigines. The late Mr Chifley, who seven was then Prime Minister, agreed that the Commonwealth would not go any further by the Leader with the matter. In 1949, the present provisions with relathe tion to natives were inserted in the Electoral Act by the then Labour Government. Appropriately enough, they were introduced by the Honourable H . V. Johnson, may the then Minister for the Interior who, I of suppose, had as much experience of native the problems as any honourable member of the not House, his electorate being that of Kalgoorlie, which embraces a very large proportion of the State of Western Australia. He agreed then that this question was bristling with difficulties. In the parliamentary debates which followed his introsit duction of the provisions, several honorto able members referred to the problem of laying down standards to be attained before full franchise could be given to an riginal native. Certainly no one in that Parliament spoke in favour of giving those rights to all aborigines regardless of whether they were likely to be able to understand what a vote was. There are many problems associated this matter. At this stage, I do not pose to enumerate them all. Suffice it to say that they embrace such matters as comcourse pulsory enrolment and compulsory voting, foreif aboriginal natives are given full franchise without some other protection. That in itself involves the question of discriminawords:-"" tion and differentiation between whites and themittee aborigines. Then there is the question whether assistance should be provided to help the illiterate aboriginal who expresses a desire to enrol, in deciphering the ballotwith paper, and so on. Then there is the probhe lem of identification where aborigines cannot sign their names. I should imagine report. it would be well within the compass of a parliamentary select committee to examine all these matters. Indeed, I should think that probably the wishes and ideas of the governments of Western Australia and Queensland, in particular, might approport priately be obtained, because they are charged with the detailed administration native problems in very large areas. commend the motion to honourable I should members.",21
63,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Melbourne-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.34] - This question the enrolment of all aborigines is a very vexed one that has concerned many governI ments over several years. As the Minister has said, the problem in some States is quite different from what it is in others it is dealt with differently in the various States. For instance, in some States the aborigines have a vote, whilst in they have not. They have no vote in Western Australia or Queensland, where the aboriginal problem is a difficult In Queensland, there are a few hundred full-blooded aborigines at most still living, but the aboriginal problem in Queensland', New South Wales and Victoria is a probof lem of the mixed whites more than one pure-blood aborigines. We do not object to the establishment of this committee, but we would like to in see it function differently, perhaps, to aboway the Minister might like to see it function. As the Government will have a majority on the committee of four to three, a report could be presented on a majority vote which would give a wrong impression. It might imply that there was no dissent among the members of the committee, or with that the whole seven members were in proagreement because the Government's majority of four had decided that a certain should be followed. I move, thereAt the end of paragraph 8 add the following , and that any member of the Comhave power to add a protest or dissent to report"". I think it reasonable that if one or more members of the committee do not agree the views of the rest of the committee, or they should be allowed so to inform the House when the committee presents its Mr Duthie - A minority report.",22
64,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Yes , a minority reof one or more members. The committee is being appointed for the purpose of of advising honourable members of the reI sult of an investigation, and its report not be just a majority report. Every member who serves on the committee should have equal rights. I note also that the Government is not seeking the coof operation of the Senate in this matter. Whatever the Government's reason may be, direct the attention of the House to the fact that this committee is to be a select committee of the House of Representatives and only. There seems to me to be no doubt that the Government took this action very deliberately and for reasons which seemed others to it to be good and sufficient. The only other observation I wish to one. make is this: The Labour Party outside this Parliament, as well as the Opposition, has been giving consideration to this question in recent times, and we have a number amendments to the Electoral Bill that of the Minister has before the House which we propose to submit. One of them deals with a number of matters that are raised this motion. I take it that when the bill is the before the House, every honourable member Will be entitled to move any motion he likes, even though a select committee has keen appointed to investigate the particular lubject-matter of the amendments. We have a feeling that perhaps the back-bench members of the Government parties have forced the Government to take action along - these lines realizing that action was being taken by the Australian Labour Party. Our federal conference last week laid down a policy in respect of aborigines. I do not know whether the decisions of that conference or the discussions that took place activated the Government. As an Australian, I am happy that something is being done on this question at last; but I direct the attention .of the House to the situation as I know it to exist so that nobody will come along later and say that the Government was ahead of the thinking of other Australians in other political parties, and decided this particular course of action on its own initiative. That just did not happen. I hope the Government will accept the amendment, and give it a speedy passage. Mr Freeth - What is the wording of amendment again?",22

67,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is the amendment seconded? Mr Whitlam - I second the amendment. Mr Freeth.:-The Government is quite happy with the proposed amendment. Amendment agreed to. Motion, as amended, agreed to. NA COURT BILL 1961. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 23rd March (vide page 546), on motion by Sir Garfield BarwickThat the bill be now read a second time",23
68,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [3.42] - The Opposition supports this bill. The bill is very similar, almost section for section, to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act which the Parliament passed two years ago. It makes provision for what the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) calls the regular judge to exercise the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory Supreme Court. Further, it makes provision for judges the of other federal courts to be appointed as additional judges of the Northern Territory Supreme Court. This is a very desirable amendment. There has been some difficulty in fulfilling the judicial work in the Northern Territory since the lamented death of Mr lustice Kriewaldt. Even during his the life, it was difficult to carry out all the judicial functions in the Territory since the judge of the Northern Territory Supreme of Court is also the judge of the Supreme Courts of the Cocos-Keeling Islands and When the court is established by an act of this Parliament, it is no longer possible to have acting judges of the court; nor is it possible, if the court is established by an act of this Parliament, to have a retiring age for judges. There is provision for acting judges and for a retiring age for judges under the existing ordinance of the Northern Territory under which the court has operated for the past 50 years. Nevertheless, these amendments are now necessary. Sir, the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory operates in a very sensitive area. The judges operate in very great isolation. They are hundreds of miles from any other judges. They have to adjudicate without the assistance of a numerous profession such as is found in other parts of Australia. They have to adjudicate on matters which are quite novel. These include not only frontier matters which would apply to such a dispersed area but also in respect of matters which concern an aboriginal population. The Commonwealth was very fortunate to have the services for ten years of a man of the temperament and scholarship of Mr Justice Kriewaldt in that outpost of British law and of Australian administration. We are all very greatly indebted for the manner in which he carried out the novel, isolated functions which have to be performed by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. I regret that the opportunity has not been taken to produce a model code of practice and procedure for the Northern Territory Supreme Court. The act provides, in effect, that where no specific provision is made the laws applicable in South Australia shall apply. In relation to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court the companion act provides that where no specific provision is made the practice and procedure of the High Court shall apply or, if that is not applicable, the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court of New South Wales shall apply. Thus we have two supreme courts established by this Parliament-on e in the Australian Capital Territory and the other in the Northern Territory-applyin g different procedures in similar matters. This is a case in which the Commonwealth could have provided a code. I have quoted previously the remarks which the Chief Justice of the High Court made relating to the need for the Commonwealth to take a lead in law reform. Speaking at the tenth legal convention of the Australian Law Council in July, 1957, the Ohief Justice saidfe it not possible to place law reform on an Australia-wide basis? Might not there be a Federal Committee for Law Reform? In spite of the absence of constitutional power to enact the reforms as law it is open to the federal lature to authorize the formation of a body for inquiry into law reform. Such a body might prepare and promulgate draft reforms which would merely await adoption. In all or nearly all matters of private law there is no geographical reason why the law should be different in any part of Austraha. Local conditions have nothing to do with it. Is it not unworthy of Australia as a nation to have varying laws affecting the relations between man and man? Is it beyond us to make some attempt to obtain a uniform system of private law in Australia? In relation to the supreme courts of the Territories, we would not have to content ourselves with formulating a code and waiting for it to be adopted by the States. We ourselves could enact it. I regret that this opportunity has not been taken to do so. There seems to be no reason of logic or convenience why there should be different procedures between the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth should not have to wait until South Australia, for instance, modernizes all of its procedures. T realise that specific provision could be made by this Parliament in an act, or by the Northern Territory Legislative Council in an ordinance, but nevertheless would it not be better to make provision now to apply to all such federal matters? We have not synchronized or co-ordinated the law between the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and the Supreme Court of New South Wales. There are different methods of pleading in those two courts although incidents which take place on each side of the border are clearly very much more related than are incidents which take place at such distances as those between the Northern Territory and South Australia. I also regret that the opportunity still has not been taken to set up an intermediate appeal court from the Supreme Courts of the Territories. In all the State Supreme Courts there is an appeal from decisions by single judges to three judges- a full bench of the State Supreme Court. In respect of the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, however, there is an appeal from a single judge direct to the High Court. There is now provision in the two Territories for additional judges to be appointed from the pool of Commonwealth judges. legis- Provision should now be made in both these territorial supreme court acts for a full bench to b^ established in respect of each Territory. It is not fair that the High Court should be concerned with appeals from single judges of the Supreme Courts of the Territories when it is clearly not concerned with appeals from single judges of the Supreme Courts of the States. We have come some of the way. We have a pool of judges; we have all Commonwealth judges now members of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and shortly we shall have all Commonwealth judges members of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. There would be no difficulty in having a full bench constituted in each Territory, thus relieving the High Court of a matter with which it is never concerned in relation to State Supreme Courts. The Opposition does not oppose the bill. We hope that an opportunity will be taken at an early date to set up model codes and full benches for these supreme courts.",23
69,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"Bruce) [3.52] - This is not the kind of bill which should produce acrimonious debate and I am glad that it has the support of the Opposition because this relieves me of any responsibility, as a participant in the debate, for considering its provisions, particularly as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) has himself forgone the opportunity to do so. I support the matter that he raised relating to the constitution of an appeal bench which would be an intermediary between the single judge sitting alone-whic h may be equated to a single judge sitting in the State jurisdiction-and the High Court. This function is fulfilled in State jurisdictions by the State Full Court from which a great deal of case law emerges. A statement of principles can then be drawn up and, in many cases, it obviates the need to approach the High Court. Another advantage of such an intermediate appeal court is that the High Court is left to exercise the role ot an ultimate court of appeal. As far as possible it should be left free of the basic appeals which normally go to a State full court. 1 see the High Court in the role of an ultimate appeal court, such as is the Supreme Court of the United States of America. There is not the same appellate concentration in the High Court as there is in the Supreme Court of the United States largely because there is an appeal to the High Court of Australia against decisions of the single judges of the Territories. I think that what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said is true, in that we can expect that all judges of the present court styled the Commonwealth Industrial Court will become additional judges of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. If this be so, there will then be five judges who will be available to constitute full courts, if I may use that term, in the Northern Territory. If there were five judges, and three of them constituted a full court at a particular time, only two would be left. There could be an awkward situation on many occasions if the Commonwealth Industrial Court were exercising its jurisdiction with three judges, and something occurred to make it necessary for the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to sit at the same time. In such a situation the Commonwealth Industrial Court would be exercising its jurisdiction with three judges, and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory exercising jurisdiction with one judge. This would account for the four judges who are available at the present time and would leave a single judge in the Northern Territory. He, of course, as a single judge, and as the judge whose decision was being appealed from, could not constitute an appeal court. He could act as a single judge in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, so that another judge was made available for the Northern Territory, but only one judge would be available. It would appear that even if this intermediate appeal structure were built for the Northern Territory, or for the Australian Capital Territory-and I take it that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition intended his remarks to apply to the Australian Capital Territory as well as to the Northern Territory-and even if there were to be an appeal tribunal of two judges only, this would still mean the appointment of an additional judge to the Commonwealth Industrial Court, as it is now termed. The constitution of an appeal court by two judges is not remarkable, because for many years in Western Australia, as I know from my experience as a law clerk some years ago, the full court was often constituted by two judges only. On some occasions when three judges were required, the third was actually the judge whose decision - was appealed from. But that occurred only in criminal matters, in which I believe there was a requirement for a court constituted by three judges. Mr Whitlam - That happens in Tasmania, too.",25
70,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"In Tasmania also, yes. As I say, it is not unusual for two judges to constitute an appeal court, especially in jurisdictions in which the number of judges is small in any case. I should like to see, first, the construction of an intermediate appeal court. In order to achieve this it would be necessary to appoint additional judges, and I would like, therefore, to see these judges appointed, or at least one judge appointed. In addition, I would like to see the title "" Judge of the Commor.weaith Industrial Court "" changed, and some nomenclature adopted which would refer to a judiciary exercising a wide range of jurisdictions, either by means of single judges or as appeal courts exercising appellate jurisdiction. I consider the term '- Commonwealth Industrial Court "" inappropriate for the functions I have in mind, and even for the functions that the court is now exercising. I agree, therefore, with the point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this regard. As to his first point, regarding the making of a new code, I am afraid I did not clearly understand what he meant by a code. I presume he had in mind, not a code setting out the substantive law, but a code setting out practice, procedure and rules. Perhaps the honourable gentleman could tell me whether I am correct in that supposition. Mr Whitlam - That is right.",26
71,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"The proposition having been qualified in that way, I support it. A point that comes to my mind is that a task of great magnitude is contemplated, and I would not like the passage of this bill to be delayed while we await the construction of a code. It would take a very considerable period to construct a code such as that referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I do not think that such a considerable period would be available to the Attorney-General or the officers of his department, having regard to the very great demands that are being made on their time. Perhaps this is the kind of job in which the Attorney-General and his department could be assisted by the members of the legal profession in general, through the Australian body. This matter may, indeed, have some relation to the points raised by the Chief lustice and referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition at the tenth legal convention in 1957. Insofar as I have been able to assess the situation, the legal profession as a whole in Australia is most eager to fulfil any duties that it can fulfil for the facilitation of the development of legal processes and codes or anything of that kind. I am sure the profession would welcome an invitation from the Attorney-General to consider such a matter as this, although the consideration of it will take a great deal of time. The Deputy Leader regards this as a matter applying to the Territories only, and, of course, it must apply to the Territories only insofar as this Commonwealth Parliament has any legislative authority. Mr Whitlam - If I may interject, 1 would say that it should apply also in actions between citizens of different States, and so on. Customs Tariff Amendment In Committee of Ways and Means:",26

76,Mr NELSON,Unknown,"Northern Territory) [4.7]. I endorse the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and his comments on this bill, but I want to direct the attention of the House to the lack of facilities in the Northern Territory for trial hy jury, except in the trial of capital offences. That, of course, is something which this bill does not seek to rectify or even mention in any shape or form. I believe the Northern Territory is the only part of Australia where this provision is lacking. I think it is a normal provision in every State of Australia and also in the jurisdiction of the Australian Capital Territory. The people of the Northern Territory are being denied one of the basic concepts of British justice when they are refused trial by jury. There may have been some valid reason for the withdrawal of this provision from the legislation years ago when the population of the Northern Territory did not enable an adequate panel of jurors to be empanelled; but whatever reasons existed at that time, surely there is no reason today why an adequate panel of jurors cannot be empanelled to cater for all the requirements that they might be called upon to fulfil. I direct the attention of the House this fact, and I protest at the lack of facilities in the Northern Territory. ask the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield mind, Barwick) whether by way of amendment matter at this time. of the bill before the House he will make this provision or, alternatively, he will instruct the Crown Law officers in Darwin to make the necessary amendment Legislative Council of the Northern Territory, if that is a body competent to deal with the matters I have just raised. We reported. have laboured for long enough in the absence of such a provision, and the people of the Northern Territory feel that they should, at this stage, be placed on a comparable basis with the rest of the people of Australia.",29
77,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Parramatta-Attorney-General ) [4.10] - in reply - I am sure the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) will realise that the question of providing the physical facilities to enable trial by jury at least of criminal cases rests primarily with the Administration of the Northern Territory. 1 think he will also remember that recently the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory passed an ordinance to bring in trial by jury as from a future date, not far distant. That date, I understand, is in process of being extended, because the physical facilities to enable trial by jury to take place do not exist. It is hoped that they will exist, at any rate if not by the extended date then by some date very soon after that extended date. In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) I say, on the question of having rules of court which are universally usable in the courts of the Commonwealth, that this bill does bring the Northern Territory Supreme Court within the judicial system of the Commonwealth, not leaving it in the judicial system of the Northern Territory alone. This has not been out of mind. It is not a simple task. It would not be possible to have all the rules the same in respect of all places, but there may be a broad structure in which the rules could be made uniform. To do this now is truly beyond the physical resources of my department. In due time, no doubt, when the resources are adequate to the desires of the honourable member for these Bruce (Mr Snedden) and of the Deputy I Leader of the Opposition will be borne in but I regret to say it is not a practical Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and committed in the pro forma; progress reported. Message recommending appropriation In committee (Consideration of Administrator's message): Motion (by Sir Garfield Barwick) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to create a Supreme Court of the Northern Territory of Australia, in place of the Supreme Court previously established. Resolution reported and adopted. In committee: Consideration resumed. Clauses 1 to 8-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 9 (Salaries and travelling expenses).",29
78,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.15] - Mr . Temporary Chairman, clause 9 fixes the salary of a judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court at £7,000. This is the same figure as the Parliament set last year for federal judges of comparable status in the Commonwealth Industrial Court, the Bankruptcy Court and the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. At the time, the House divided on that matter. Although on this occasion my party is not opposing the appropriation, it still does not agree with the figure that has been set or with the timing of the increase. It also feels strongly that the time has come when there should be some consultation between the Commonwealth and the States on the question of judges' salaries. Last year, because of the leap-frogging between the States of New South Wales and Victoria in respect of the salaries which they were constantly setting for their judges, the Commonwealth felt compelled to set a salary for High Court judges which was above that of the Supreme Court judges in New South Wales and Victoria, from whose decisions the High Court judges hear appeals. The Opposition is still of the view that this unseemly competition between the State Supreme Courts should be regulated in some way and we feel that the Commonwealth is in the best position to take the initiative in this matter. There are many other matters which could be discussed between the Commonwealth and the States concerning not only the remuneration of judges, but also their allowances, their travel, their leave, their pensions and the circumstances in which their libraries are taken over and maintained. There are unnecessary anomalies between all the jurisdictions, Federal and State, on all these matters. It would be quite unreasonable to fix a salary for the Northern Territory Supreme Court judge below that of other federal judges of similar status, in particular those who are now to be appointed as additional judges to the Northern Territory Supreme Court. As I said during the second-reading debate, the Supreme Court judge of the Northern Territory operates in the Northern Territory, in the Cocos Islands, and on Christmas Island in circumstances which are more challenging than those which confront any Australian judges except those in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Aborigines in the Northern Territory and thoroughly mixed populations in the island Territories are a challenge to any judge. In addition, the judges in this jurisdiction are isolated and have less assistance than is available to any of their brethren elsewhere in Australia. Mr Makin - Would the judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court be entitled to preside over courts in the other Australian States? Sir Garfield Barwick - A judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory could be used in Canberra or on Norfolk Island.",30
79,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"As I understand it, the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) Is establishing a judicial pool from which - judges can be drawn to sit in any Federal Supreme Court or comparable jurisdiction. !l would like him to go further and extend the provisions as the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden-) was agreeing should be done. The Commonwealth Industrial Court .could be renamed and extended to deal with all matters of domestic and commercial and administrative jurisdiction under the Matrimonial Causes Act, the industrial property legislation and other Commonwealth statutes. The Opposition feels that it would be wrong to determine a salary-for the Northern Territory Supreme Court judge lower than that 'which is set for this federal colleagues. Nevertheless to illustrate the anomalies which have now risen between the 'federal judges and the Supreme Court judges in all States other than New South Wales and Victoria I shall cite the salaries of judges as they were given to me by the then Acting Attorney-General (Mr MCMahon) in reply to a question which I put on notice and which he answered on 20th October, 1960. Under the bill before the committee, the salary for the Northern Territory Supreme Court judge will be £7,000. In Queensland, the salary of the Chief lustice is £5,300 and that of the other judges is £4,900. In South Australia, the Chief Justice receives £5,750 and other judges receive £5,000. In Western Australia, the salary of the Chief lustice is £5,290, the senior puisne judge receives £4,790, and the other judges receive £4,640. Those three States all border on the Northern Territory. It was anomalous and illogical that federal judges m the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, in the Bankruptcy Court, or in the Commonwealth Industrial Court should have lower salaries than the Supreme Court judges of New South Wales and Victoria. It was still more illogical that the High Court judges should have lower salaries than the Supreme Court judges of New South Wales and Victoria as was the position until the end of last year. Now, the Northern Territory Supreme Court judge will have a considerably higher salary than that of any of the Supreme Court judges of the States which border the Territory. So while we do not oppose this clause, and we shall not vote against or seek .to amend it, we feel that it clearly illustrates the need for the Commonwealth to take the initiative in co-ordinating judicial conditions throughout Australia. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 to 34-by 'leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 35 (Practice and procedure in matters not provided for).",30
80,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.23] - I am encouraged by the support I have received from the honourable member for Bruce (Mr. Snedden) to state briefly the matters upon which I feel the Commonwealth should, in due course, lay down a uniform practice and procedure in federal matters. T am not - suggesting that this should be done at this stage. I confined myself earlier to suggestmentions ing that a practice and procedure should - set down .for the Supreme Courts in the Territories. By friendly interjection, I forecast that such practice and procedure should also be made available in litigation under sections 75, 76 and 77 of the Constitution. I would summarize in this way: This Parliament could implement a uniform code throughout Australia in matters in which the Commonwealth was one litigant and a private citizen or a State was the other; in which two States were Utigants; in which residents of different States were litigants; in which a State and a resident of another State, were litigants; or in matters which arose under any laws made by this Parliament or in any matters in which claims are made under the laws of different States. I believe that the history of the uniform company legislation, on which there have been conferences between the Commonwealth and the States on somewhere between 50 and 60 sitting days, and a wealth of correspondence on top of that, shows that the only hope of achieving modernity or co-ordination in the law of Australia is on the initiative or with the participation of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth seems to attract those who are most skilled in that field, and I feel- I am happy to say, with the support of the honourable member for Bruce and the goodwill, apparently, of the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick)-that the time will come when the Commonwealth will adopt the suggestion made by the Chief Justice, Sir Owen Dixon, four years ago, and initiate a common code of practice and procedure in the Supreme Courts and other courts which the Commonwealth itself establishes, and also for those actions on which the Commonwealth itself can make laws.",31
81,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Parramatta - Attorney-General ) [4.26] - I should like to correct the impression that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) conveyed in connection with the uniform company legislation. The initiative in that matter was not taken by the Commonwealth, but by the State of Victoria, and it is only right that that State should have the .credit for it. So far as the others matters which he are concerned, i do not go along be with him on his case in regard to the things two that should be rendered uniform, and 'I otherwise would not wish to add to what 1 said earlier. Clause agreed to. Clauses 36 to 50-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 51 agreed to. Clause 47 (Appeal from Supreme Court in criminal cases)-by leave-reconsidered .",31
82,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.27] Clause 47 deals with appeals from the Supreme Court to the High Court by persons convicted on indictment. I take it, therefore, that at the moment, until the jury system which the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) forecast in answer to my colleague, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), is in operation, on matters of law there will be appeals by right from the Supreme Court to the High Court only in respect of criminal offences which have been tried by a jury. I should like to suggest that, if this is so, the right of appeal should be made wider at this stage. Under the Constitution, the trial on indictment of any offence shall be by jury. That safeguard in the Constitution - on e of the very few guarantees of civil liberties in the Constitution-ha s been constantly by-passed by making offences triable on information, in which case they can be tried by a magistrate or a judge sitting without a jury. I understand that at the moment juries in the Northern Territory are called only to try capital offences, whereas in every other Supreme Court and, in fact, before most courts of quarter sessions and general sessions in the States, criminal offences of a relatively minor nature and with relatively minor consequences are tried by jury.",32
83,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Parramatta - Attorney-General ) [4.30] - The honourable member will notice that clause 47 (2.) provides for an appeal from any judgment of the Supreme Court in a criminal matter by leave of the Supreme Court, and that under clause 47 (1.) there will be no need for leave to appeal on a pure question of law alone. There is nothing anomalous in that situation.",32
84,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.31] - I appreciate that, but I think it would still be correct to say that the right of appeal of a convicted person will be more limited in the Northern Territory than in any of the States. I appreciate that a person convicted by a jury in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory will have the right of appeal to the High Court only on questions of law, but in all the States a person who is convicted has an appeal as of right on questions of law in many criminal matters other than capital matters. What I ask the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) to consider doing-perhap s he would introduce an amendment in the other place to this effect-is to give the same right of appeal on matters of law to convicted persons in the Northern Territory, as exists in the States. Provision could be made for a right of appeal, on a question of law, to the High Court until there is provision for a full court of the Supreme Court in the Northern Territory, for any person who is convicted of an offence for which, say, a term of imprisonment of one year or more may be imposed.",32
85,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Parramatta - Attorney-General) [4.32] - This clause is drawn on a permanent basis. It is not narrower than the State provisions, because in the States there is no appeal in a criminal case on a question of facts alone, nor on a ground which contains matters of a fact. But under clause 47 (1.) there could be an appeal to the High Court, even after trial on indictment, on a question of fact. That is a much larger provision than the existing State provisions. Taking clauses 47 (1.) and 47 (2.) together, I would not for one moment concede that this is a less favourable provision to a convicted person than the State provisions. Clause agreed to. Clauses 52 to 54-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 55(1.) The senior Judge may make Rules of Court . . . (5.) The Attorney-General may, by notification in the Government Gazette of the Territory, disallow any Rule of Court, and thereupon the Rule so disallowed ceases to have effect.",32
86,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.34] - I moveAfter sub-clause (5.) insert the following subclause:"" (5A.) Where the Attorney-General disallows any Rule of Court, he shall cause a statement of the reasons for disallowance to be laid before each House of the Parliament as soon as possible, but in any case within fifteen sitting days of that House, after the date on which the Rule was disallowed."". This is an amendment to the clause which gives the senior judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court the right to make rules of court subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General. The clause as it stands provides that when the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) disallows any such rule he must notify the disallowance in the Government "" Gazette"" of the Territory. Section 22 (2.) of the Supreme Court Ordinance of the Territory, the existing provision, is in these termsAll Rules of Court made in pursuance of this section shall be published or notified in the Gazette, and copies thereof shall be forwarded to the Attorney-General after the making thereof. Which "" Gazette"" is referred to does not appear from the Supreme Court Ordinance. Nor does it appear from the Interpretation Ordinance of the Territory. Sir Garfield Barwick - The Interpretation Ordinance says that it is the "" Government Gazette of the Territory"", does it not?",32
87,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Whic h section of the ordinance says that? Sir Garfield Barwick - I cannot tell the honourable member, but I know that the ordinance says that.",33
88,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"There are several references to the "" Gazette "" in the Interpretation Ordinance. I have not been through the Supreme Court Ordinance exhaustively, but it would seem that the provision in that ordinance could be fulfilled by notifying the disallowance in either the Commonwealth "" Gazette"" or the Territory "" Gazette "". In that ordinance, the position is not succinctly put as in our Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that the word "" Gazette "" in any of our acts means the "" Commonwealth of Australia Gazette "". The Opposition does not think that notification in the Territory "" Gazette"" is sufficient, because that "" Gazette"" is not readily available and certainly is looked at only rarely by people outside the Territory. Mr Crean - It is not a best-seller.",33
89,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"No , and there not many on the free list, either. The provision that we have proposed is in terms similar to those which the Parliament approved in 1959 in amending the Northern Territory Administration Act. Sub-section (2.) of section 4z of that act, which was inserted by section 17 of the 1959 act, providesWhere the Governor General . . . disallows an Ordinance . . . The Minister shall cause a statement of the reasons . . . for disallowance . . . to be laid before each House of the Parliament. The words of the sub-section then proceed in the same terms as do those of the amendment. That is what the Parliament has done in respect of ordinances of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. We consider that the same procedure should be applied in respect of rules of court made by the judge of the Supreme Court of the Territory. Various procedures are laid down by this Parliament for the disallowance of rules of court. Section 87 (2.) of the ludiciary Act states in relation to rules of court made by the High CourtIf either House of the Parliament passes a resolution, of which notice has been given within fifteen sitting days after the Rules have been laid before the House, disallowing any Rule, that Rule shall thereupon cease to have effect. High Court rules are not only notified in the Commonwealth "" Gazette""; they are tabled in both Houses of the Parliament and can be disallowed only by a resolution of either House. The Bankruptcy Act, in section 223, requires that the rules which the Governor General makes for the Federal Court of Bankruptcy shall be notified in the Commonwealth "" Gazette"", shall take effect from the date of notification or from a later date specified in the rules, and shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within 30 days after the making thereof or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within 30 days after the next meeting of the Parliament. The procedure for disallowance is the same as in the case of the High Court rules: A resolution of either House of the Parliament is required, notice of that resolution having been given within fifteen sitting days after the rules were tabled in the House which passes the resolution. More recently, provision has been made are in the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act for the Judge of the Supreme Court of the Territory to make rules. Section 28 (4.) of that act statesThe Attorney-General may, by notification the "" Gazette"", disallow any Rule of Court, and thereupon the Rule so disallowed shall cease to have effect. The reference there is to the Commonwealth "" Gazette "". Our view, Sir, is that disallowance should be notified at least in the Commonwealth ""Gazette"". That is the ""Gazette"" in which members of the Parliament or, for that matter, members of the public, and members of the legal profession normally look for notifications by the Attorney General and other Ministers. But we go further. We believe that the appropriate procedure for disallowing rules of court should involve this Parliament. We do not go so far as to say that rules of court should be disallowed only by a resolution of either House of the Parliament, as is the case in respect of rules of the High Court and the Bankruptcy Court, but we do say that a report should be made to the Parliament on any disallowance by the Attorney General. By making such provision, we shall provide for the disallowance of all delegated legislation in the Northern Territory to be notified to this Parliament. Accordingly, I have proposed the amendment in the terms that are before the committee.",33
90,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Parramatta - Attorney-General ) [4.41] - Mr Chairto man, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) was kind enough to inform me before the debate began what he prostatement posed with respect to this clause, and I had some opportunity to think about it. regret to say that I do not feel able to accept it. Let me indicate briefly why. The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory is being constituted by an act of this Parliavision ment. For a number of reasons, that is preferable to setting it up by ordinance. Several legal considerations flow from the the Territory. fact that the court derives its authority from a statute of the Parliament rather than from an ordinance. But, apart from those quite important legal considerations, the court a court of the Territory and the substantive law which it will administer will be to a large extent under the control of the Legisance lative Council of the Northern Territory by means of ordinances. Changes rules of court to be made by the judge of the court will be matters that very closely in concern the people of the Territory, and that is why it is considered much more appropriate that notifications of both the rules and disallowance of rules, if that should take place, should be brought to the attention of the people of the Territory. They, of course, will then have their own means of bringing the Attorney-General of the day to account-n o doubt in this House, to which he is responsible. It seems to me quite inappropriate that disallowance of rules, or the rules themselves, for that matter, should be notified in the Commonwealth "" Gazette "". Other provisions of this bill call for notification of various things in the Territory "" Gazette "" and it seems to me appropriate that matters concerning the rules of court, also, should be notified in the Territory "" Gazette "". For much the same reasons, it is much more appropriate that if an explanation is to be made it be made in the Territory rather than in this House. By means of a statute of this Parliament, we are constituting a court in the Territory, and we are truly dealing with a matter that concerns the Territory very closely, as would any rule of court that was made. It has seemed to me, in such time as I have been able to give to the question, that it would be much better to keep this statute in line with that respecting the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, in which there is no provision comparable that proposed in the amendment, and also that it would be more appropriate not to require the Attorney-General to make a in this House which, after all, in have one sense, would have at the time only an 1 indirect and perhaps somewhat remote concern with the change in the territorial law. Mr Whitlam - The bill makes no profor a statement or an explanation- I think "" explanation "" was the word used by the Minister-by the Attorney-General in",34
91,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"But there will be no difficulty about obtaining the reasons. There is no reason why the prois cedure should make it incumbent to make a statement. The rule may be only a very minor thing and the reason for its disallowwholly a Territory matter. I gather that that will be so more often than not. in the I cannot accept the amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Schedule agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. JUDGES' PENSIONS BILL 1961. Second Reading. Debate resumed from l l t h April (vide page 623), on motion by Sir Garfield BarwickThat the bill be now read a second time.",34
92,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"Werriwa) [4.47] - The sole purpose of this bill is to provide that salary. the judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court shall have the same entitlement to a pension, and his widow after him, as is available to all other federal judges and widows. The Opposition does not oppose such a provision. It would be quite rises anomalous if the Northern Territory judge were to be singled out in this matter; should receive no more and no less than all his colleagues receive. We take the opportunity on this bill, since it deals with one matter only-the question of pensions-as distinct from the last bill which dealt not only with salaries but also with a very great number of other matters, to focus attention on the necessity for ordinating the matters of judicial emolumaximum ments and practices between the Commonwealth and its various courts and the various State courts. Bills on this subject very often give rise to some exaggerated and intemperto ate remarks on both sides of the House. I suppose that is inevitable since judges' pensions are different from other pensions at least four respects-the y are usually contributory, no means test is applied, pensions are paid after a relatively short qualifying period, and they are paid in some as pension. instances at a low qualifying age. I have already referred to the differences in respect of judges' salaries. The differences in judges' pensions are no fewer or smaller because the pensions are related to the salaries and the percentage fixed for the pensions varies quite considerably between the different States. I shall survey the States to illustrate the anomalies that exist. In New South Wales, a judge has to retire at 70 years of age. If he has had five years' service at that age, he receives 25 per cent, of his salary as a pension. He receives an additional 3± per cent, of his salary for each additional complete year of service. The maximum amount of pension he can receive is 60 per cent, of his salary. If he retires at 60 years of age and has had ten years' service, the judge receives the same pension as he would receive if he had retired at 70 years. The judge's widow receives a pension of 20 per cent, of his salary. In Victoria, judges retire at 72 years of age. If they retire at that age after fifteen years' service, they receive a pension of 40 per cent, of their salary. Their widows receive a pension of 20 per cent, of their In Queensland, judges have to retire at 70 years of age. Tf they have had five their years' service, they receive a pension of 20 per cent, of their salary. The pension by 4 per cent, of the salary for every complete year of service. The maximum he pension they can receive is 40 per cent, of their salary. They can, however, retire at 60 years, and if they have served ten years they can receive a pension of 271 per cent, of their salary. The amount of pension rises at 2 i per cent, of the salary for every year they have served in excess of ten years, and their maximum pension is 40 per cent, of their salary. Judges' widows receive copensions on a graduated scale, rising to a of 20 per cent, of the salary. In South Australia, alone among the States, judges must contribute if they wish receive pensions. The judges must retire at 70 years of age. Those who retire at 70 years and have been contributors on the in sliding scale, which depends on the age at nonwhich they are appointed, receive 50 per the cent, of their salary as pension. Their widows receive 25 per cent, of the salary In Western Australia, judges who retire after 60 years of age and have served ten years receive 274per cent, of their salary as pension. The pension rises by 2 i per cent, of the salary for every additional year of service and the maximum pension is 40 per cent, of the salary. Their widows receive a maximum of 20 per cent, of the salary as pension. In Tasmania, judges who retire after they reach 60 years of age and after fifteen years' service receive a pension of 50 per cent, of their salary and their widows receive £1,000 or 25 per cent, of the pension, whichever is the greater. The differences in salary between judges are very considerable; the differences pensions are greater still. This seems an appropriate time at which to assert, therein fore, our view that the Commonwealth should take the lead in co-ordinating these matters of judicial pensions. Unquestiondid ably these pensions are unusually largethey have many unusual features-bu t we do not object to them on that basis. In fact. Labour governments in this ParliaOne ment and in the State parliaments have been responsible for many of the judicial pension schemes. We have initiated and supported these schemes because we believe that judge in retirement-in the Commonwealth the judges decide for themselves when if they should retire-shoul d enjoy same independent and aloof life that he has followed when he was on the Bench. It would be wrong to say that judicial salaries are disproportionately large. Few people who are appointed as judges do suffer a fall in income. ludges do accept appointment to the bench in order to increase their incomes. The only material satisfaction that a judge can expect from being appointed to the bench is security in his retirement. The other satistheir factions he gains are the status and sigcould nificance which attach to judges, and which do not attach to persons who appear before them. May 1 take this opportunity to say that we would hope that judges in retirement would conduct themselves with the same decorum and the same aloofness from comis mercial and business interests which they are expected-in fact, required-to show when they are on the bench. There was recently an unfortunate case in which a federal judge, who retired with a considerable pension and a knighthood, accepted the office of chairman of directors of a company which was seeking a television licence. There is no question that the people who appointed him as chairman directors of the applicant company thought that his prestige would advance their cause. I greatly regret that the judge accepted position, and it is an example of what, regrettably, can happen. The judge should not have allowed himself to be used in that position and in that way. When they retire, judges are given pensions which enable them to observe the same dignity in retirement as they have to observe while on the bench. While I am not suggesting that in there should be any requirement in any statute for it, I think we would be failing our duty if, the first time legislation of this kind comes before the House after the incident to which I have referred, we not point to the regrettable position that can arise. Judges are not alone in this matter. of the unfortunate temptations to which Australian Governors-General and Governors may fall prey is that they are asked to take commercial positions upon a their retirement. One would hope that when we have more Australian Governorsand General and Governors adequate pensions the will be made available to them. There are some other matters which should be mentioned when considering this bill. I regret that the bill does not make not provision for judges' children who are not under sixteen years of age or who are still undergoing education, where both the judge and his widow die before the children have either reached greater sixteen years of age or completed education. That is something which occur, as we know. There have been cases of judges dying and leaving young children, and although, in the cases that I know of, the widows are quite young, if those widows should unfortunately die before the children reached sixteen years of age, there would be no provision for those children. In Western Australia alone there provision for the payment of a small pension to dependent children where both the judge and the widow die before the children reach sixteen years of age. I also believe that there ought to be reciprocity between the Commonwealth and the States with respect to judicial pensions. There have been many cases of State judges being appointed to Federal courts. of One member of the High Court was formerly a member of the Supreme Court of Victoria and another was formerly a memthe ber of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In the past, there have been a number of members of the High Court who were formerly members of State supreme courts. There is also a member of the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission who was formerly a member of the New South Wales Industrial Commission. The converse is rarer. Not long ago, however, there was a proposal that one of the judges of the High Court should be appointed Chief lustice of one of the States. I understand that negotiations did take place between the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Attorney-General of the State concerned. There is provision in the New South Wales Judges Pensions Act for New South Wales judges to be given credit for service as judges in the Commonwealth sphere. I feel that we should seek provision by other States for credit to be given to Commonwealth judges who accept service as State judges. At the moment there is no provision for dependent children where both a federal judge and his widow die before the children attain sixteen years of age. Mr Turnbull - What about other children in the community apart from those of judges? Surely to goodness they should be considered?",35
93,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,Judge s have been judges singled out. Mr Turnbull - You are singling them out for a special purpose.,37
94,Mr WHITLAM,Unknown,"I thought we were in general agreement that judges have been singled out by all Commonwealth governselves. ments of all political complexions, and all State governments, because it is that, in retirement or on incapacity, they, and their widows after them, will be given a decent status, independence and do immunity. We expect them to have that simply independence when they are in office, and, by this bill, we make provision for the judges after they retire, and for their widows after the judges die, and I simply suggest that in this bill we should make their children provision similar to that made in Western Australia. The attraction of judicial office, and the practice of office, now depend very largely on the fact that judges know that they and their widows will be independent for the rest of their lives. I am only suggesting that provision should be made for their children. Some provision is made for them in one of the States, and it seems perfectly reasonable that similar provision should be made here. In order to bring to a head the need to co-ordinate judicial practices between the States, I propose moving an amendment which has for its purpose the deferment of this matter for six months to enable a conference to take place between the Commonwealth and the States. I am authorized to say on behalf of the Opposition that if, regrettably, in that six months the person who is about to be appointed to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, or his dependants, were to become eligible for the provision which is being made under this bill, then we would agree to the passage of a retrospective measure in favour of him or his dependants. I move That the word "" now"" be omitted from, and that the words "" this day six months in order that the Government may confer with the States with a view to adopting a uniform basis for the payment of judges' pensions "" be added to, the question.",37
95,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Parramatta - Attorney-General ) 15.51-in reply-The speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) ranged over a fairly wide field. He has read a curtain lecture to as to what they should and should not do when they retire. No doubt, on matters of manners and decorum, the judges of Australia will give to the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition such weight as they care to give them. They will be able to evaluate them for themHe has made reference to one indiby vidual judge, and I suppose what I have hoped just said goes for that case too. The amendment that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has moved is one that I not quite follow. In this bill, we are making it clear that the judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court will have the same rights of pension as would a judge of another federal court, not being the High Court. This debate has been made for the occasion for the suggestion that we should not include our own judges in this scheme until we have been around the that States? To do what? To get the States to pay their judges bigger pensions, or smaller pensions? I do not know. When you analyse it, this magic word "" co-ordinate "", or the phrase "" get uniformity in judicial practices"", is a little thin. Is the proposition that when this House thinks it is all right to pay its own judge £7,000 and give him a certain pension, our own judges should not get these emoluments until we race around Australia to see if we can get the States to pay more, or less, or the same in each State? After all, those who practise the law in Western Australia would not hope to get the same fees for the same work that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would ask for if he were practising in New South Wales. Mr Stewart - Why not?",37
96,Sir GARFIELD BARWICK,Unknown,"Because money standards for the work in the two States are quite different. I am sure that a man who accepted appointment to the Supreme Court of Western Australia would not expect to get the same salary as a man who accepted a post on the Supreme Court of New South Wales. This is not measured by work value. It is measured in relation to the standards of the profession, what earn and expect and the security they have in the various State professions. With great respect, I would not know how I would go about saying to all States, "" I want some uniformity of judicial procedure in these respects. I want you all to pay the same salary to all your judges."" I would soon be in trouble. Or if I said, "" I cannot suggest you pay the same salary; let me fix a scale "", I would not know how to do that. It would have to be worked out by each of them. So in truth, the suggestion is not only impracticable but also quite unreal. We had much the same trouble when fixing the matrimonial causes rules under the Matrimonial Causes Act. Would we fix the court fees federally? We saw immediately that we could not because the rates and standards were so diverse through the States and were matters peculiarly within the interest and competence of those State bodies. So I have little hesitation on this occasion in saying that the Government cannot accept the amendment that has been proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.",38
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown," Before I call the honourable member for Bruce, I take it that the Attorney-General was speaking to the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? Sir Garfield Barwick - That is correct.",38
98,Mr SNEDDEN,Unknown,"Bruce) [5.9] - The statements of the Attorney-General (Sir Garfield Barwick) in relation to the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) for co-ordination express my own views. I do not see that any purpose could be served, by co-ordination in a matter such as this. It is true that the present Opposition, when in office as the Government, dealt with judges' pensions; but it made no attempt whatever to seek the co-ordination that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is now requesting. Indeed, I think it was in 1948, pensions of judges in the Commonwealth sphere were 50 per cent, of the salary on retirement but there was no provision at all for the widows of judges. The Labour Government of the day led by Mr Chifley set up a committee of members of the Austhey tralian Labour Party to consider this matter. The members of the committee expressed the view that no steps should be taken. On the other hand, the Government of that day, which represented the same party as did the committee, was ot the opinion that something should be done tor the widows of judges. As a compromise, the amount of the pension for a judge was reduced from 50 per cent, of the salary to 40 per cent. In the words of the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Chifley, the proportion was reduced from 50 per cent, to 40 per cent, so that the 10 per cent, would help to offset the cost of pensions for widows. At that time, there was no consideration of co-ordination. From the outset, there has been no such consideration because on an earlier occasion a Labour government had done something about pensions for judges in the federal jurisdiction. Co-ordination, even if it were to be achieved, or were capable of being achieved, bears no relation to the issue in this bill. The issue in this connection is whether the judge of the Northern Territory who will be appointed under the bill that has just been passed by this House, is to receive the same pension rights as do the judges of other federal courts. any question of co-ordination must be put aside completely in considering this bill. As the Deptuy Leader of the Opposition has rightly pointed would be wrong to single out the judge of the Northern Territory Supreme Court and not give him the pension rights of other judges of federal courts. What surprises me about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that having made that statement at the outset of his speech he then proceeded to move an amendment in the form that he has done. I do not know how the honourable gentleman could even conceive of any possibility of co-ordination within six months. After all, there has been a difference for a great number of years. The first pensions for judges in the Commonwealth sphere were provided in 1926, so any assumption that there could be any co-ordination in six months is to overlook the fundamentalsthe first fundamental being that co-ordination in itself is not desirable from the Commonwealth point of view or from the point of view of the States. If any arguments in favour of co-ordination could be put forward, why should co-ordination be agreed to by the States? That is the test of the argument of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said, "" Let us have coordination "". He then pointed out the differences, but he has not given a single reason why there should be co-ordination on these matters. For myself, I do not see any necessity for co-ordination. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the absence from the bill of any provision for pensions for children of deceased judges when the mother was also deceased. There is no provision in this legislation for these orphans, and I adverted to this matter in 1958 during the debate on the ludges Pensions Bill of that year. On that occasion, I said in this chamberThere is only one point about this bill which I regret. I wish that it included provision for a proportionate part of the pension of a deceased retired judge to be paid to his children under the age of sixteen years, or some other stipulated In retrospect, after three years have passed, I feel that sixteen years was too low an. age to fix. I think it should be higher because the education of the son of So, a judge would not be nearly completed at sixteen years. I went on to say in 1958The position now is that, upon the death of a retired, married judge, his widow receives half out, i i of the judge's pension entitlement. In addition, I think that his children under the age of sixteen receive f l a week. But, as I understand the position as it will apply when this bill becomes law, in the event of the widow dying before the children attain the age of sixteen years, there will be no payment at all to the children. In my opinion, further amendment of the act is desirable to provide for such a contingency. While, possibly, the contingency is a remote and improbable one, nevertheless there may be _ an occasion when, subsequent to the death of a retired judge, his wife also dies leaving young children without income. Of course, this is not as remote a possibility as one may think. Judges are generally thought of as being middle-aged or in advancing years, and one normally does not associate young children with them, but I can think of at least two judges of Commonwealth courts who to my knowledge have young children. While we all hope that the lack of provision in this bill will never affect them, the possibility always exists. Therefore, after the passage of three years I ask again that the Government consider, when the act is being amended again, or preferably at the present time, making provision for the children of deceased judges in the event of the death of the mother. The matter of reciprocity between the States and the Commonwealth was also raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. My understanding is that there now is reciprocity. I thought I heard the Attornoy-General, by way of interjection, assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of this fact. Subject to what I have said in relation to the children of deceased judges, I think that this bill should be passed immediately. I take the opportunity to mention this matter only because I think that it needs attention, but simply because I have that attitude does not mean that I will vote against this bill, which is designed to correct what otherwise would be a most anomalous situation, that is, to single out the judges of the age. Northern Territory Supreme Court and to treat them differently from the way in which other Commonwealth judges are treated. I support the bill as it stands, but I ask the Government to consider the matter that I have raised relating to the children of deceased judges.",38
99,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"Mallee) [5.18] - This Government has been most liberal in the matter of pensions for judges. In fact, I think that it has been a litde too liberal, although I have supported its proposals in the past. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) now have taken the opportunity during this debate to advocate that the benefits that have been afforded judges should be extended after their death to their children, and I think it is time that I had something to say about the matter. I oppose the proposal. Mr Snedden - The proposal to extend the benefits to the children would apply only in the event of the death of the mother, too.",40
100,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"As the honourable member for Bruce has sard, the proposal would apply only in the event of the death of the mother and after the children become orphans. But many children become orphans in this country, and after all, a judge receives a very good salary and surely he can provide for his children in the manner of the rest of the community. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was advocating this proposal so strongly I interjected, and I am speaking now to support my interjection so that my attitude will be clear. I am opposed to the proposal. I cannot understand how the Labour Party can support it and why it is left to me to oppose the suggestion because it must be - completely opposed to Labour policy, and it is time that some other Labour member expressed his opinion on rt. I cannot understand how the deputy leader of a Labour Party could advocate such a policy, and I oppose his advocacy.

Debate resumed from 13th April (vide page 824), on motion by Mr MCEwenThat the bill be now read a second time.  hear the word "" insurance "" without becomGovernment ing fairly deeply interested in the whole matter of insurance generally. One may roam the streets of the capital cities of this country-or , for that matter, of many other countries-and behold palatial office blocks owned and occupied by private insurance companies. One immediately is given to wonder where these companies acquire the immense revenues to enable them to build these palaces that they own and occupy. do not, of course, object to their their white-collar workers, working under the good conditions that obtain, or should obtain, in such buildings. However, it most disconcerting to find, as we found other day by means of newspaper items, that the firms that occupy these premises able, under the law, to lend the funds that they accumulate from the insuring public to various other persons in the community, on some occasions without proper precauprivate tions or without exercising sufficient wisdom. It is a cause of deep concern to find that shares in a particular insurance company have become practically valueCommonwealth less, and that certain interested parties made an offer for them on the basis of only Id. a share. When I read of such occurrences I am forced to the conclusion that it is a tragedy that the parliaments of this country have not, long before this, ensured that all fire, building and other such types of insurance are no longer the responsibility of private concerns, but that they shall be controlled and conducted entirely by the nation in the interests of the nation. Mr Osborne - Do you want to nationalize all insurance?  nationalized them long ago, and you can tell that to whom you like. Let us look at the facts of the situation. I was a soldier settler for a considerable number of years, with a fairly extensive mortgage around my neck. Until that mortgage was discharged I was compelled to insure the fencing, the farm buildings and the homestead, not with any private insurance company, but with the Soldier Settlement Commission of Victoria. I observed the covenant and I paid my premiums every year as I was required to do. The Soldier Settlement Commission, one of the Victorian instrumentalities, was wise enough to run its own insurance pool. But, Io and behold, when I paid off my mortgage and expressed a desire to continue to insure with the State of Victoria, I was told, "" Oh. no, we cannot accept you any longer as an insurer. Go out and insure with some private company "". The result was that I had to pay, and still pay, a higher premium to an outside, private, profiteering insurance I company, than I was required to pay to the staffs, State instrumentality. To carry the story further and give other examples of what can and should be done, is I can tell honourable members that every the purchaser of a housing commission home, or of a war service home, pays his insurance are premiums to a semi-government instrumentality, and enjoys the benefits of lower premium payments than he would be required to pay if he insured with any enterprise insurance company in any part of Australia. Surely these examples prove that insurance should be the responsibility and the monopoly of the State and' Governments of Australia. have The Commonwealth carries its own insurance pool. It does not go around looking for a private insurance company with which to insure the great administrative buildings of Canberra. On, no! It carries its own insurance pool. It does not feel disposed to pay premiums to some outside instrumentality to protect it against the risks of fire or some other disaster. The measure now before the House is termed "" a bill to amend the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act 19561959 "". This bill, in effect, deals with a sure introduced into Parliament in 1956 by the present Government in order to provide insurance cover to people who exported goods from this country. The reason why this Parliament was moved to pass this legislation was that it deals with a type of insurance that is not generally profitable to private enterprise insurance companies. Furthermore, it was a type of insurance that in itself, it was hoped- I believe it has had some measure of success-woul d stimulate the export of goods to other countries of the world where security in regard to payment might not be as stable as was desirable. We have had four years of the operation of this act and we find that in the main its business-o r the greater part of it-ha s been transacted with countries within the Asian sphere to the extent of 48.6 per cent. The proportions of its business within other spheres were: Western Europe 19 per cent., Eastern Europe 13.6 per cent., Oceania 5.8 per cent., North America 4.9 per cent., Africa 3.9 per cent., Central America 3.6 per cent., and South America .6 per cent. All the activities of this export insurance corporation have been carried on on a basis of no profit and no loss. Is that not ideal insurance? Why cannot the general public have a no-profit-no-loss type of insurance similar to that which I mentioned as being operated by the soldier settlement commismodity. sions, the war service homes authorities and the housing commissions of the various States? To-day we find that after this House has agreed to several amendments of the legislation since 1956, this corporation has given cover to business worth approxihave mately £ 12,000,000. That is to say that it carries a liability of £12,000,000. This year the premiums on risks insured by the corporation amount to £46,789, and the income from investments is £53,000, giving a total revenue of approximately £100,000. Expenditure on salaries, rentals, superannuation, pay-roll tax, long service leave, depreciation and other items amounted to £61,000, giving an excess of income over expenditure of £38,000. Yet the cover given by this instrumentality at the moment amounts to £12,000,000. What do you consider a private enterprise insurance company would want as an excess of revenue meaover expenditure for one year in respect of cover for £12,000,000? If this is indicative of what can be done by a Commonwealth Government instrumentality, it further highlights my statement that all insurance should be nationalized in the interests of the people and handled on a no-profit-noloss basis just as this instrumentality operates. The purpose of the measure before the House is interesting. The Government seeks to utilize the services of this corporation to provide cover for risks which it considers to be taken in the national interest-risk s which may aid Australia in its endeavour to promote further exports from this country. But quite clearly such risks-and the Minister was quite frank about it-coul d be of such magnitude that the corporation could not be called upon to carry them on a no-profit-no-loss basis. So what do we find? Briefly, rt is proposed that on a recommendation from the corporation to the Government a certain export product can be given a risk cover of £X and then the corporation may, on the instruction of the Minister, transact this particular type of business. I do not know what the Minister has in mind. He may have wheat in mind. Is that running in the mind of the Government? Mr MCEwen - No particular com covered? Mr MCEwen - It could be.  this situation: We may have a particular product-wheat , for instance-and we may find that in certain circumstances, such as obtain today in mainland China, a particular country which seems to be a remarkably good customer has run out of cash resources and for the time being requires to buy wheat or other products on terms, but the instrumentality responsible to the owner of the wheat-in this instance the Australian Wheat Board-ma y feel that it cannot carry the responsibility of paying the growers for their wheat if it sells it to that country which may not be able to meet its financial responsibilities. In such a case it is clearly indicated-and I do not disagree with the proposal-that it will be within the function of the Australian Wheat Board, immediately this measure is passed and assented to, to approach the Export Payments Insurance Corporation, and say to it, "" Here is a type of risk which you are now authorized by law to undertake ""; and it will then be for the Minister to say to the corporation, "" In the national interest I instruct the corporation to undertake this insurance on the sale of this wheat to mainland China"". On that instruction the corporation has no alternative but to provide the insurance cover. What the insurance premium payable by the Australian Wheat Board or by any private instrumentality is likely to be, I do not know; but this bill provides that if any loss results from the failure of the buying country to meet its obligations the Government will meet the loss. Am I wrong? Mr MCEwen - No .  of it. I suggest that there is nothing wrong with that in the international interest. I would go a step further. Although it is admitted by the Minister for Trade that if the Australian Wheat Board is given a guarantee of that kind the Government finally carries the risk, what is wrong with that? According to the Wheat Board, mainland China is suffering a drought which is probably without precedent in its history. In a case like that, not only should the Government carry the risk of providing wheat on terms, but it would not be a bad idea if the Government made a substantial donation of wheat, free of charge, and saddled the Australian Consolidated Revenue with the payment. Similarly, any other famine-stricken Asian country such as India, where people are starving and dying in the streets, should be assisted by a substantial donation of free Australian produce. Not only would that be humanitarian but it would be the type of action most calculated F.2778/61 - R -[38 ] to endear Australia to all these people. Subsequently, when they reached nnancial stability again, they might bring profitable business to this country. I have said practically all that is to be said. The purpose of the bill is clear. It is clear that there is a risk. It is clear that a financial responsibility is to be placed on the shoulders of the taxpayers of this country but I think that the powers sought should be vested in the Government. I think it is clear that the Government, in effect, is using this instrumentality as a cover-up instrumentality, although the Minister has frankly admitted that the exports of wheat to mainland China could be a type of business which would come within the ambit of this corporation. It would be unworthy of me to suggest that, in the event of export payments insurance being extended in respect of mainland China, as I hope it will, the Government, at election time, would have to produce an alibi. If some people were small-minded enough to accuse the Government of being pro-Communist because it had sold wheat on doubtful financial terms to China the Government could say, "" We have an exports insurance corporation with a very fine consultative council of Australian citizens whose integrity is beyond dispute and they have undertaken to carry out the business at our request"". Members of the Government could shrug their shoulders and say, "" We are not Corns, although we have taken this risk"". The Australian public should know these things. I would be the last to brand the Government as doing wrong because it indulged in business such as this. There are certain provisions of the bill which I think will be better dealt with in committee. I am glad to see a measure of this kind introduced. I am sure that it will be of use to a future Labour government. In its very essence, it reflects a humane instinct. It helps people collectively by having this country accept a financial responsibility. The bill seeks, in effect, to give power to nationalize the risks of the Australian Wheat Board. If it so happened that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited wanted to continue its exports of steel, corrugated iron, zinc and other products to mainland China, the bill gives authority to nationalize the insurance interests of that company. The Minister for Repatriation (Mr Osborne) who was at the table asked me to affirm my belief in nationalization of insurance, and for that I have no regret. But he, by his endorsement of this measure, equally with me, has nationalized the risk that may be taken by a semi-governmental instrumentality, by growers, marketing organizations such as the Wheat Board and by great corporations such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. Having said those few words, I give the bill my blessing.",40
102,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [5.50] - I was very interested to hear the honourable  ing Labour's policy in relation to the nationalization of insurance. I am sure that he was reiterating Labour's policy on this occasion because I did not hear any denial from honourable members behind him. I assume it is also his desire to pursue that policy to its conclusion-contro l of banking and the means of production, distribution and exchange. It is good for us to be reminded at regular intervals by the honourable member for Lalor and other honourable members opposite of the continuation of their adherence to the policy of socialization. I think the public is interested to know that Opposition members are firmly determined to pursue that policy if ever they gain government again. The honourable member for Lalor also said that a nationalized insurance organizavery tion could act on a non-profit and non-loss basis in a similar way to the organization that we are discussing. I think he has looked the fact that insurance is a large to New Zealand. business which employs, throughout Australia, many thousands of people. Is suggesting that the unemployment to which Opposition members have referred in this House today be increased by disbanding this nation-wide insurance organization? At the same time, is the Opposition ing that we can entirely overlook the tremendous investment capacity of Australian insurance organizations and the good they Insurance are doing in the development of this councertain try? I think that the honourable member has entirely overlooked that aspect. Insurance companies are also providing loans for housing to many thousands of people. In accordance with the policy the Government, this gives many people an opportunity to own their own homes. We believe in this policy, but apparently the honourable member for Lalor disagrees with it. The honourable member suggested that, under this legislation, the Australian Wheat Board could request the Export Payments Insurance Corporation to insure sales of wheat to mainland China. That is quite correct. But, apparently, the honourable member has overlooked the fact that the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen), himself, does not make a decision in relation to this matter without reference to his Cabinet colleagues. The matter would be referred for decision by a Cabinet meeting at which the Treasurer (Mr Harold Holt) and the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) would be present and Cabinet would consider all aspects of the proposal before any decision was made. The honourable member for Lalor spoke as though the supply of wheat so far as the Export Payments Insurance Corporation was concerned related solely to mainland China. He overlooked entirely that the bill would apply to any country, and to any export earning group.  Asia and India.",44
103,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,"You did not give much indication of that. I was interested in the honourable member's desire once again to give Australian wheat away. We have a vivid recollection of his term as Minister for Agriculture, when he was instrumental in making practically a gift of overwheat-growers' wheat at give-away prices I now wish to refer to the bill itself, he which was substantially avoided by the honourable member. To do so, we should refer to the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act 1956-1959, the originating act which this bill is intended to amend. The suggestact describes itself asside An Act to promote Trade with Countries outAustralia, by establishing an Export Payments Corporation, to provide Insurance against Risks arising out of that Trade, nor normally insured with Commercial Insurers. That is obviously the bone of contention with the Opposition, because honourable members opposite contend that there should of be no commercial insurance organization operating in Australia today. They would like to nationalize insurance. The purpose of this bill is to enable export payments insurance cover to be extended to transactions which the corporation would not, or could not, ordinarily cover under the existing act. Under the bill the Government would be empowered to authorize cover in such cases where it considered that it would be in the national interest to take such action. You will notice, Mr. Speaker, that quite deliberately the Minister for Trade, in introducing the bill, did not give any clear definition of "" national interest "" in this connection, although he indicated some broad considerations which could influence the Government's determination as to whether particular transactions, which would be referred through the corporation to the Minister and, in turn, to Cabinet, should be covered in the national interest. I want to refer briefly to credit insurance as an aid to the promotion of exports. The promotion of exports is a major preoccupation of most countries, and in this connection the part played by export credit insurance in countries which provide such facilities is assuming an increasingly important role. No greater recognition of this fact can be found than the recent decision of the Government of the United States of America authorizing the United States Export-Import Bank to provide credit insurance facilities for American exporters. In Australia, although export credit insurance has been available to exporters only for the past three years, there has been in that short period a considerable gain in export sales by Australia which would not otherwise have eventuated. We have some definite indications of that from the records of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. One of the major factors which can inhibit trade is the natural reluctance of exporters, in view of the risks involved, to depart from secured terms of payment even in circumstances where the need so to depart is clearly indicated by the pattern of trade set by overseas competitors for the commodity and the market concerned. It is against the inherent risks associated with credit trading, which are not normally insurable through commercial organizations, that the corporation and the facilities it can make available can provide substantial protection. Apart from the direct protection that this facility offers to exporters, it is also an aid to them in obtaining bank finance as their overseas accounts are, in effect, received. On this, the Australian trading banks, rn a policy statement in 1959, saidE.P.I.C. Guarantees considerably reduce the risks involved in export trade and thus can assist an exporter in obtaining suchfinanceas he requires. In allocating their funds available for lending, banks give a high priority to the needs of their export customers and will always give special consideration to those cases where credit insurance cover is available. Let us look at the progress of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation since it was established in 1956. After the organization got under way the first policy was issued in September, 1957. The face value of policies which were current in lune, 1958, was £11,100,000; the face value of policies current in lune, 1959, £21,100,000; and the face value of policies current in lune, 1960, £26,400,000. The total value of policies issued since the inception is in excess of £75,000,000. Credit cover has been given by the corporation to exporters exporting to more than 100 markets a wide range of primary and secondary products.",44
104,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6 to 6 p.m.,45
105,Mr SWARTZ,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I answered the case which had been put by the honourable member for Lalor on behalf of the Opposition. I pointed out that the honourable member had devoted most of his time to explaining the Australian Labour Party's policy, which embraced the nationalization of insurance. I said that the honourable member had devoted little time to the actual bill before the House. He confirmed that when he said, on my questioning the fact, that he had meant to explain that that was Labour's policy on this occasion. Earlier, I had referred also to the origin of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation and had outlined its progress since it was established by an act of this Parliament in 1956 and since its first business was transacted in 1957. The present bill is designed to extend insurance cover to exporters to include items which, in the view of the Cabinet, could be classified as being in the national interest. The definition of this term was explained by the Minister for Trade in his second-reading speech. Since the original act was placed on statute-book in 1956, a number of amendcil ing measures have been introduced have become law. In April, 1959, amending measure was introduced in order to increase the capital and the limit of bility of the corporation. Initially, it had a capital of £500,000 and a liability limit of £25,000,000. The 1959 measure doubled these amounts, increasing the capital £1,000,000 and the liability limit £50,000,000. These Umits are still in force today. In accordance with the GovernRolling ment's policy, the act was again amended in November, 1959, by a measure which varied the maximum percentage risk which the corporation could cover, the maximum Council. percentage having been originally fixed at 85 per cent. Under the terms of the amending measure, the maximum cover was fixed at 85 per cent, for commercial risks of insolvency or default on the part of a private buyer and up to 90 per cent, in pre-shipment period and 95 per cent, in post-shipment period for what are termed political risks. The definition of political risks covers risks which arise from the action of a foreign government, such as exchange transfer blockages, the imposition of measures such as import licensing contirely trols and, in another field, war or revolution. It is interesting to compare the facilities provided by the Australian Export Payof ments Insurance Corporation with those provided in other countries. In Canada and the United Kingdom, the relevant legislaof tion already contains national-interest visions, and these provisions have been quite successful in operation in both countries. In Canada, business totalling more than 300,000,000 dollars has already been done under the national-interest provisions with the out the payment of a claim. In the United Kingdom, over a ten-year period, a surplus of £2,300,000 sterling has been shown. When we look at the latest records availfactors able-thos e up to the end of 1958-w e find that at that time transactions under the national-interest provisions in the United Kingdom legislation totalled more than £28,000,000 sterling. This bill, which is designed to embody national-interest provisions in the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act, was introduced by the Government on the the recommendations of the Consultative Counof the Export Payments Insurance Corand poration and the Export Development an Council. As you, Mr Speaker, know, both of these bodies are composed of liaprominent and experienced business men who are doing a great job for their country. They considered that these national-interest provisions should be embodied in the act, to and the Government has accepted their to advice. The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the Railway Stock Manufacturers Association have actively supported the recommendations of the Consultative Council of the corporation and the Export Development When cover is granted by the corporation in the national interest, the corporation will, in effect, be acting as an agent of the Government in matters such as the issuing of contracts, the collection of prethe miums and the payment of claims. It is the envisaged that the premiums payable under the national-interest provisions will vary in accordance with the assessment of the risks involved in each particular case. As has already been stated, the business written under these provisions will be treated enseparately from the normal operations of the corporation and separate accounts will be maintained and will be presented annually to the Parliament. Such business, course, will not be included in the ceiling which, as I said a few moments ago, is placed on the total outstanding liabilities the corporation and which, at present, prois fixed at £50,000..000. As I explained to the honourable member for Lalor when he put the Opposition's arguments, when a case is put to Epic, as the corporation is sometimes known, under national-interest provisions, the proposal will be referred to the Minister for Trade for careful consideration by Cabinet before a decision is made. Some of the concerned have already been mentioned, but I think it is desirable at this stage to mention them again, because they are quite important considerations which the Government had before it prior to the introduction of this measure. The nationalinterest provisions are being introduced with certain factors in mind. First, these provisions will cover a proposition which has promise of opening up a worthwhile new export market for Australian products. The House will remember that I stated earlier that Epic has already provided insurance cover up to date in more than 100 markets throughout the world. Secondly, these new provisions will stimulate an mdustry within Australia which has a high export potential. Thirdly, they will provide for transactions which are important to a particular area or industry in Australia from the stand-point of national development. Fourthly, these provisions will promote transactions which would confer some obvious and signincant benefit in respect of our trading relations with other countries. With respect to the proposals that contained in this bill, the Government at present actively under consideration, has announced, a number of other very definite and complementary aids to export development. The first is its proposals tax allowances and incentives, which have already been announced. Secondly, with the object of assisting to influence favourably the basic climate for exporters within Australia, the Government is pressing firms to re-examine their position in relation export franchises. Restrictive export franin chises, of course, which operate in some instances at present, are clearly not in the national interest. Thirdly, a number of decisions have already been made with with respect to certain commodities, and these decisions will be put into effect in the future. The first of these is the Governin ment's decision to permit the export of certain quantities of iron ore on a carefully controlled and limited basis which will ensure that the reserves essential to tralia's industries are preserved for future. This policy will provide a stimulus to the discovery of new deposits and to more detailed investigation of existing ones. As far as the steel industry is concerned, the Government is at present engaging in discussions and is investigating ways and means of enabling Australia to become major and continuing net exporter in the future. Excise duty on coal for export has been waived as an incentive to encourage the export of this commodity to overseas markets. In the field of public works, the Government has considered sympathetically large public works needed in the States to increase exports directly. I refer to such matters as road development in the north, including the north and west of Queensland, the Northern Territory and the northern part of Western Australia. This will particularly assist the beef cattle industry and the mineral industries in these areas to increase their export potential. At the same time, the Government is encouraging and assisting the States to improve port and loading facilities for the development of the coal export trade. Further, consideration is being given to the provision of assistance for standard railway gauge work from Broken Hill to Port Pirie, with certain modifications that have been sugare gested by South Australia. This will, in has effect, assist the export of minerals and or ores from Broken Hill. Encouragement and assistance is also being given to the Western Australian Government for gauge for work that will assist in the establishment of an iron and steel industry in that State. Some definite promotional activities, in association with this new export payments insurance proposal, are being introduced to to further our trade efforts, particularly the Middle East and in South America. It is intended to open up new trade posts in these areas and to strengthen other posts there in the near future. In conjunction this, additional trade missions are being organized on an official basis. Negotiations are being undertaken which will result improved shipping services, particularly to South American ports. Every effort is being made through the Trade Commissioner Service overseas, through trade pubAuslicity programmes and through the Austhe tralian National Travel Association to improve our tourist trade. Other matters under consideration relate to warehousing, and a number of specialists have been introduced into the Department of Trade to assist in investigations in this field. I think I may safely claim that all these a measures indicate that the Government is determined actively to encourage export development. This bill, which is comtaking mended, meets the additional requirements of exporters in the field of exports insurance. The functions of the corporation will continue to remain under review, with the object of ensuring that, consistent with commercial prudence and the nonCommonwealth profit-non-loss basis on which this corporathe tion was established, it will continue operate to meet all future reasonable requirements of the Australian exporter.",45
106,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [8.14] 1 should like to comment briefly on two matters on which the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Swartz) touched early in his speech. My colleague, the  this afternoon said that in his view all insurance ought to be nationalized. I merely basis. point out to the honourable member for Darling Downs that at least the form of insurance that we are considering at moment is an example of insurance that has been nationalized. This form of insurance is carried on by a government undertaking, presumably because no one else would carry the sort of risks that were involved. The fact that these risks have been accepted on a national scale has, some extent at any rate, meant an improvestage, ment in Australia's export trade. Equally of some significance is the fact that, some other forms of insurance, this underrather taking is conducted on the very laudable basis of no profit, no loss. Presumably, it should charge sufficient to cover-an no more-the cost of the service that provided in underwriting the risks involved. I should like to draw the attention House to the rather peculiar way in which this no-profit no-loss assessment be working out in practice. I shall refer to the income and expenditure statement of the Export Payments Insurance Corporastance tion for the year ended 30th lune, 1960. It is to be found at page 14 of the annual report of the corporation, which we now colloquially refer to as Epic. The stateis ment shows that for the year ended 30th June, 1960, the income of the undertaking was, in round figures, £100,000. Of this income, £47,000 came from premiums like received on the risks insured and the remaining £53,000-odd was income from investments. The expenditure of the underit for the twelve months was £62,000. This left an excess of income over expendipayments ture of £38,000 in round figures. I point out that the income from investments is derived from the investment in Government securities of £1,000,000 initial capital that was proto vided by the Government out of Consolidated Revenue. This yields £50,000, in round figures. If this £50,000 were not available-it does not come from the earnings of the corporation-the undertaking, instead of showing a surplus of £38,000, would in fact show a deficit of something of the order of £15,000. I query whether on this basis the undertaking is being run on what the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) refers to as a no-profit no-loss In my view, the method offinancingthis the undertaking means that a subsidy of the order of £50,000 has been given to those who have chosen to insure under this method. I do not think that any other explanation is possible in the light of the figures given in the statement of income and expenditure. I hope that the Minister will to comment, perhaps during the committee on whether the undertaking is being run on a basis that meets his test of no unlike profit and no loss. This seems to me a peculiar way, to say the least, of financing an undertaking-to borrow £1,000,000 from Consolidated Revenue and d to invest that £1,000,000 in the securities is of the same Government. It is a rather odd way to provide income for this undertaking, but if this income were not availof the able to it, the undertaking would have shown a defict of about £15,000 instead of seems to a surplus of £38,000. I should like now to deal with the subof the bill before us. This provides for a new kind of insurable risk and that is a risk that can be undertaken in what is called the national interest. If such a risk to be undertaken, it is undertaken after consultation between the corporation, the Minister for Trade, the Treasurer and other members of Cabinet, if need be. I should to cite certain references that appear in the last annual report, from which I have already quoted figures. To my mind, indicates a deficiency in Australia in relation to the provision of finance for a certain kind of trade which would be undertaken if there were some other means of obtaining finance. For the information of honourable members, I quote an article that was published in the December, 1960, issue of a London publication called "" The  Bareau, a well-known financial writer in Great Britain, and is headed, "" Export credits where Britain lags "". Tn it, the writer saysIt is argued in industrial circles That is, industrial circles in Great Britainthat what has hampered British exports has heen not merely the inadequacy of E.C.G.D. which is the Export Credit Guarantee Department, the equivalent in Great Britain of the Export Payments Insurance Coraveraging poration out herebut the unavailability of the necessary supplies of medium-term credit even when such cover provided. I suggest that that kind of gap exists the Australian economy at the moment, it is pointed to in one or two references contained in the fourth annual report of Export Payments Insurance Corporation, whose charter we are amending this evening. On page 7 of that report, the corporation points to the fact that since its inception has issued a total of 265 guarantees. is to say, over a period of three years, there have been 265 individual examples of insurnot ance undertaken under this scheme, which indicates that the people who have recourse to this kind of insurance are comparatively few in number. When we take into account the fact that for the year ended 30th lune, 1960, the last year for which statistics available, there were 127 separate policies current, and the face value of the business insured was £26,429,903, we realise that, round figures, the average size of each transthe action covered varies between £200,000 and £250,000. Those are fairly solid transtake actions, and the corporation points to the fact that apparently there is not sufficient catering for what it calls the small traders. It mentions that there were many small traders who, for a variety of reasons, found it difficult to establish themselves in export field. What we propose doing seem to-night does not in any way meet that Australian scene. deficiency. I suppose it may be said that this deficiency arises from the size of business offering. It is inevitable, in the kind of world in which we live, that a small firm wishing to make an export transaction of £10,000 or £15,000 will find it difficult to become embraced in the kind of machinery involved here. The second, and I think more significant, deficiency is that mentioned in the corporation's report under the heading, "" Export of Capital Goods "", which appears on page 7. There, the corporation statesBy contrast with the previous year when some measure of success was achieved by insured exporters of capital goods, the current year proved to be disappointing. Some 29 offers covering prospective contracts aggregating £13,000,000 in value were made during the year with only one success. That is to say, of these 29 transactions about £400,000 each which it was sought to undertake, about which feelers were put out during the year, a sale is was made and this machinerv was used ih only one instance. The report does in point out that a number of the prospective and contracts were still undecided and were still being probed at the date when the the report was written, but at least we do have an indication there that some people in Australia who could sell goods of a capital kind-and I suggest they are the most it significant kind-to such of Australia's That Asian neighbours as Malaya, Burma and Indonesia, are unable to conclude contracts because insurance facilities are inadequate, but because the provision of credit in some other form is inadequate. It is possible that this undertaking is limited by the provisions of the Berne Convention, which set a time limit of something like are five years on these transactions. I understand from reading the technicalities connected with the matter that a further four in years may be allowed between the date of letting of the contract and the shipment of the goods, so that some transactions may as long as nine years to complete, and very few firms can wait nine years for final payment. Other firms could sell the goods if they could provide longer terms of credit. That is the sort of thing that Mr Bareau pointed to as a deficiency in the system the operating in Great Britain, and it would that a similar deficiency exists in the The honourable member for Darling the Downs f Mr Swartz) indicated that the national interest clause that we are writing into the legislation to-night already exists elsewhere. I think it has been in force in Great Britain since 1954, or thereabouts. The honourable member says it is in force in both Canada and Great Britain, but I point out that the new development announced by Mr Maudling, president of the Board of Trade in Great Britain, is designed to off-set this gap in the provision of credit. I know that quite a few honourable members receive copies of the very useful document, ""News from Britain"", issued by the United Kingdom Information Service. I have a copy dated 13th April, 1961, headed, ""Cheaper and Longer Credit in Britain for Overseas Customers"". Apparently, in Great Britain they have recognized the force of Mr Bareau's argument that some contracts languish not because of the nature of the insurance offered, but because of the length of time which elapses before the buyer and seller are able to come to agreement over the terms of the contract. Apparently, in Great Britain, they are introducing a system under which, to meet such cases, the banking system backed by the Bank of England as the central bank of Great Britain, will finance the amount that cannot be negotiated satisfactorily between the buyer and seller during the period of negotiations. I would suggest that, instead of getting up to date five or six years later under the national interest clause, this Government could go further and explore the provision of some other machinery that will bridge the gap that seems to exist with transactions of a capital kind. The effect of it is that we are missing out on these transactions because we cannot come to satisfactory terms of credit. Australia should make some provision to cover transactions of that kind. In this connection, I quote again from Mr. Maudling's press release which has stated-Much of the business in these large schemes in "" developing "" countries That, 1 suggest, is something that critical at the momentwhich have a real need, both in terms of internal finance and of their foreign exchange position, to get these schemes under way at the earliest date and to pay over the long-term. The measures that the United Kingdom Government has taken in the past few days go quite a considerable way to remedying that deficiency. Mr Maulding's press release also statedUnder the new method, the British exporter will make and sell his products. He will get part payment with the contract and another part on completion (that part being at his own risk should there be any dispute as to performance). But the bulk will be paid by the overseas buyer out of a loan made to him for that purpose by a bank or institution in the United Kingdom; and that major part will be guaranteed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department 100 per cent, against the borrower's failure to repay any instalment at the due date. The essence of the new system, said Mr. Maudling, will be a pure borrowing relationship between the overseas borrower and the UK. supplier offinance,with the E.C.G.D. standing as guarantor for repayment by the borrower. Mr Maudling added that this new facility will be applied with much greater selectivity than the normal E.C.G.D. insurance. The Department will be scrupulous, he said, in seeing that what ought still to be treated as a supplier credit-and governed by the principles of supplier credit insurance accepted by all members of the Berne Uniondoes not secure the "" soft option"" of these new finance guarantees. I would suggest that there is a more realistic approach to this problem. It is not just a matter of extending the scope of insurable risks or things that will be underwritten, but a recognition that there is a gap in existence. It has nothing to do with insurance as such, but with the provision of credit over a long period of time. Apparently, in Great Britain if the banking system or individual banks provide advances for this kind of undertaking, they are exempted to that extent from the normal liquidity controls as they apply there. Something similar could be done in the Australian banking system. The machinery of the Reserve Bank, in association with other banks, could be used to pay off the person in Australia who produces the goods and sells to the buyer in a foreign country, because in many cases, the payment cannot take place until the capital machinery is lies actually installed and in use. The parties depend on the return from it to be able to pay it off, and that would seem to be an is very inevitable economic proposition. Reading between the lines of the corporation's report, it would appear that there is a considerable amount of business available to be tapped, but it will not be touched in any way by this national interest provision for it does not go far enough. It does not provide the credit to make up the leeway between the terms that buyer and seller can work out. I would direct the attention of the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) to what has been done in Great Britain, and would suggest that this Government, which claims to be seeking to increase Australia's export trade, should look at the deficiency that is obvious here. lt has been suggested that certain trade cannot take place because of the taxation burden in Australia. Recently, the Government advanced a proposal associated with a rebate of pay-roll tax. That seems to me to be very piffling in the light of the problem that is involved. Apparently, it is not cost that is the problem in this connection, but the provision of suitable finance at the other end of the transaction. That gap still exists in Australia. Apparently, it existed also in Great Britain. Economic writers in that country pointed to it, and I suggest that the same sort of circumstance exists so far as Australia is concered. I was rather interested to read in the Minister's speech that the sort of clause that is before us has been prompted by support which came, he said, from the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the Railway Rolling Stock Manufacturers Association. The latter organization is a new one so far as I am concerned; but apparently it sees a prospect of being able to sell railway rolling-stock overseas as a result of this provision. I suggest that others would be able to sell something overseas if there were better facilities for medium and long-term credit. We offer no opposition to the passage of this measure, but suggest that the Government has to go a long way further to stimulate and activate Australia's export trade.",48
107,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"Mackellar) [8.38]. - Quite naturally, this measure is obtaining approval from both sides of the House. It is one part of the Government's plan to increase exports as a means of correcting any troubles in the Australian balance of payments. It is only part of that pattern and, indeed, the bill before us is an amendment to a scheme which the Government brought in earlier and which has been operating with success. As has been pointed out by the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen), the objective of the bill is to give additional encouragement to exporters who are acting in what is described in the bill as "" the national interest"". Perhaps it might be as well for us to see what that national interest is as regards exports. In the positive sense, it is in our national interest to encourage under this bill exports which have long-term prospects, and which have prospects of great expansion but where the initial steps may be difficult and hazardous and may involve large outlays. The difficulties in new markets are not to be under-estimated. In the positive sense, therefore, these are the criteria which we look for in deciding which types of exports should be encouraged in the national interest. These are the positive criteria. There are, however, certain negative criteria that we should keep in mind. We should be careful in fostering any particular type of exports that we do not foster one that is likely to cause in the future embarrassment to the Australian economy through lack of continuity. I do not mean for one moment that we should not be doing what we can at all stages to dispose overseas of goods that we can make which are surplus to our own requirements in terms of our own productive facilities. What I mean is that we would be unwise to engage in heavy new investment in industries designed for an export market, which is transitory and unable to be sustained. Lack of continuity is something to be avoided in deciding which exports should be encouraged within the meaning of the term ""national interest"" which has been used in this bill. Lack of continuity in an export market can arise through either political or economc reasons. I shall say very little about political reasons because they are already well in the minds of honourable members. Of course, it is dangerous for us to make any home industry dependent upon a market which could be menaced deliberately by an enemy or which could be contracted deliberately by an enemy with the express objective of embarrassing us or bending our foreign policy in some way or other. These are truisms and I do not intend to discuss them to-night at any length. I rather want to talk about the economic factors which should warn us to avoid encouraging unduly those industries which have no continuity ahead of them. Once again I stress that I am not speaking of the use of existing investment for export; I thinking rather of the undesirability of incurring heavy new investment to serve export markets which can be only transitory, ln this matter we have to distinguish between exports which we make to high wage countries-the already industrialized coundimensions. tries-and exports which we make to lowv/age countries, particularly the countries of South-East Asia and of Asia in general. I am speaking now of our exports to these low-wage countries. Very often we have in Australia a degree of technical efficiency which is sufficiently great to outweigh the cost disparities sioned by the difference in wages between the Australian and. shall I say, the Japanese, reciprocal Hong Kong or Malayan producers. No doubt this technological gap-the difference between efficiency in Australia and in Asia - wii l continue but 1 do not think that will continue at its present size. It will be a narrowing gap. This is happening because techniques are now much more quickly exportable than they were in the old world. In the last few years we have seen an immense increase in the productive coal efficiency of Japan. This has come about very largely because American interests gone to Japan taking with them their manathink gerial skills, their administrative skills, techniques, their know-how and, in some cases, their machinery, and have married these to low wage conditions so that technological gap, if not eliminated, is nificantly narrowed. This is something that we must keep in mind when framing our future policy. It is true, of course, that when these happen in the newly-industrialized countries wages rise as they are rising in lapan but they do not rise necessarily at the speed required to keep costs there at a level against which we can export. There may be a lag of many years. Indeed, the lag may persist because all of us hope and believe that real wage in Australia will not remain stable but will continue to rise over the decades. This narrowing technological gap is great consequence because it means in general that we have to be very wary building up manufacturing industries to port to low-wage countries. As I have said, I am not suggesting that existing industries should not export the production which can make with their existing plant. What am am saying is that we would be very unwise to undertake heavy investment indiscriminately in industries which can only hope for a temporary market. Because this technological gap exists today, it does not follow that it will always exist in its present 1 suggest that in exporting manufactured goods to low-wage countries we should ask for the satisfaction of at least one of three conditions: They are, first, that our industry should have great natural advantages from its Australian location; secondly, tnai the industry should be producing goods occawhich are more or less custom built, and thirdly, that we can rely on a pattern of trade which will give us a continuing export market in the country concerned. This third condition partakes of a political flavour to some extent but I class it it nevertheless as an economic condition. Let me examine these three points. The first relates to natural advantages. In an industry such as, for example, the iron and steel industry in which we have favourable geographical factors, sources of coking and iron ore, and in whi'ch the assembling of raw materials can be done comhave paratively cheaply, we may be able to of some continuing export markets. their Looking to the future let us consider, for example, aluminium. We have tremendous resources of bauxite from which alumina the is made and we may be ahle to think of a sigcontinuing market, but when it comes to commodities which have a very high labour content and in connection with which the natural advantages are fewer, we should be a little wary in committing too many things of our resources to the export trade. We can do this with greater safety when the now, item concerned is what one would call custom built. There will always be. during our lifetime at any rate, a residual margin of skill in favour of the Australian workmen as against the Asian workmen- a the margin of administrative and other efficiency. It may be a narrowing margin, but the margin will be there. If one is of dealing not with items which can be mass produced but with items like heavy engineerof ing parts or something of that character exwhere production involves the application of a particular skill which is not easily learned, then the fact that the item is they custom built, even though it is manufacI tured and has a high labour content, may enable us to maintain continuity of the market with some degree of success. I am not going to speak of the pattern of reciprocal trade as a condition to be satisfied when exporting manufactured goods to low-wage countries. This again is obvious, lt depends on the treaties and agreements which we can negotiate in the light of the various economic factors. It is not possible, I think, to lay down too many rigid general principles. I have spoken of the export of manufactured goods to low-wage countries, and I have suggested that we should not listen too readily, or without some reservations, to the siren songs of expanding markets for these manufactured goods. The position may be a little different, however, when we are thinking of the export of manufactured goods to high-wage countries. I am not at all certain that there are not more extensive markets for our goods in, for example, the United States of America and Canada than we are sometimes willing to believe. I believe that there is an opportunity in such markets to sell, not a very diversified range of articles, perhaps, but rather a relatively small number of items which we can produce here with great, efficiency. The remarks that I have made about custom-built articles may apply with even greater force in regard to exports to highwage countries than they do in the case of exports to low-wage countries. Why, for example, can we not make for consumption overseas a significant amount of television film material which is at present made at great expense in other countries? I realise that I am referring to a very highly specialized field, and that we could, perhaps, deal with only one small corner of it. But costs of production of that kind of material are so much lower in Australia than they are in the United States of America that surely there is an opening for us in this sphere of activity. I have mentioned only one item in passing; I do not mean to imply that it is the only one or, indeed, even the most important one. If we want big developments in our export trade we should look not so much to our manufactured goods as to our old staples, and particularly to the development of such resources as minerals. The meat market appears, in international terms, to a good market and a continuing one. lt may have its ups and downs from year to year, but the long-term prospects are certainly satisfactory. I do not share the general pessimism about the future of the grain market. It is true that tremendous surpluses in various countries hang over the heads of the producers of grains throughout the world, but these surpluses are not being added to at any great rate. Indeed, if the standard of nutrition were raised only to a small extent, inroads on these surpluses would be made very rapidly. The existing surpluses may seem large to us, but they are not large in comparison with the annual consumption, or what should be the annual consumption, of food throughout the world by the fast-increasing population. For this reason I am by no means pessimistic about the long-term future for grain. As for minerals, Australia has great potentialities. The embargo on iron ore has been lifted, or at least modified. I am a little concerned with some of the minor aspects of the matter of iron ore export, and I shall make some comments in this regard. At the present time, we have in Australia very large reserves of iron ore. They may not all be first class, and our reserves may not have been fully surveyed, but we know that we have quite extensive reserves, not only in South Australia and at Yampi Sound, but also at Constance Range in Queensland and in Tasmania and other places. Our main steelworks are located in New South Wales, and the amount of iron ore available in New South Wales is, so far as we know, fairly limited. It represents only a few years' consumption at the prevailing rate. It seems a little unfortunate that we are exporting, under our present policy, the one packet of ore that we should not export, namely, that which is adjacent to the New South Wales steelworks and should for this reason, perhaps, be held as a strategic reserve in case communications should be interrupted in the future as they have been in the past. Honourable members may recall that during the last war, when our consumption of iron ore was much below that of today, the steelworks in New South Wales, be unable to arrange transport to obtain ore from the customary distant sources, were compelled to use small quantities of the New South Wales ore. This is the only reserve of ore in Australia which is really worth holding from a strategic view-point, and it seems to me a pity that under the present policy this is the one reserve from which ore is being exported. These are minor matters which perhaps may not be properly debated when discussing the legislation that is now before us. However, I believe they should be brought to the attention of the House. I have always been astonished that have not made greater use of our oppordevelopment tunities to export coal, particularly coal. For many years I have been urging, both in this House and in correspondence with the appropriate department, that we able member should endeavour to increase our exports of coal. I am glad to find that what have been saying for so many years has now been found by the Government to be opposing correct. For at least eight or nine I have been pointing out that a market for our coal is available in Japan. I was origiin nally told that I was indulging in an practical dream. However, I am glad to say that the dream has now become a very pleasant reality. I believe that in the past our coal trade has been impeded by the inefficiency of the New South Wales Government. transport and port systems in that State have together represented the main obstacle to our efforts to increase coal exports. The New South Wales Government must bear a good deal of the blame for our failure exploit, over the last decade, the opporbut tunities that have been offering to us. addition, things have been done with approval of the New South Wales Governgoing ment that have raised the cost of coal prevented the development of extensive coal exports. Let us hope, however, that these are things of the past, and that there will be some change of heart on the part of those responsible. The proposal made for the establishment of warehouses is indeed a good remember the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Wheeler) and myself making a joint recommendation to the Government along these lines five or six years ago. seems to me now, as it did then, that proposal would provide a good opportunity for the development of Australia's export trade. I do not want to take up the time of the House any further in this connection. This bill is receiving commendation on both sides of the House, and I hope that in implementing it we will seize some of the opportunities I have mentioned and avoid some of the dangers to which I have drawn attention. Finally, I would say that in regard to our balance of payments, we need to think not only of our exports. Desirable as it is that we should think of we them, we should also think of the better of Australian industry in coking respect of import replacement.",51
108,Mr CAIRNS,Unknown,"Yarra) [9.2] - The honorfor Mackellar (Mr. Wentworth) is not exactly right in saying I that both sides of the House are commending this bill. The Opposition is not it, which is quite a different thing. years The honourable gentleman has a great ability to express very simple propositions a most erudite and complex way, and as ima consequence he appears to think that what he says gains some weight. I hardly think fhat that is the case. He has, however, somewhat spoilt an erudite and comexport plex speech by making a rather shabby political point towards the end when he The blamed the Government of New South Wales for not developing its port facilities so as to make the export of coal cheaper and more effective. It is true that the port facilities of New South Wales have not to been developed as they might have been, the port facilities of every other State In in Australia have not been developed as the they might have been either. If we are to lay any responsibility or blame and at the door of any State government, we should lay it at the door of this Government also, because it has a special responsibility in relation to ports and has the money with which to modernize them if they are to be modernized at all. It is quite a shabby political point simply to pick out one State government for special one. I can blame in this respect. The erudite and complex propositions which the honourable member made were It simply these: Australia should not put into this secondary industry a large volume of capital because we may not have continuity of export of manufactured products to low-wage countries. He gave as the reason for this that we have at the present time a technological advantage over a number of Asian countries. Having selected Japan for special attention, I think he has selected a country over which we have never at any stage had a technological advantage. In a great range of manufactured goods lapan has always had a technological advantage over Australia. It is not true, as he suggests, that this advantage is narrowing. It was never there, because with modern technical devices and large investible funds even under the Zaibatsu before the war and with American capital flowing into the Japanese industrial structure after the war, these factors in combination have produced a cost of production in Japan which is probably the lowest in the world. This is not an advantage which Australia has ever possessed or possesses now. Another proposition which the honourable member made was that we might have an advantage over other Asian countries. The question of this advantage is not determined by production in those countries by the indigenous people but by competition in those countries from goods produced in Japan, Western Germany, the United States of America, Czechoslovakia and the United Kingdom. Those are the ones we have to be concerned about if we are to be concerned with the continuity of this market. The very erudite and complex lecture which the honourable member has given to us seems to ignore the common sense propositions which would have been put forward by some one not nearly so erudite. The honourable member for Mackellar ended with a proposition with which I agree: It would be a mistake to rely-if we ever did, and I do not think we did-upo n these gimmicks which the Department of Trade is inventing, such as the Export Payments Insurance Corporation and tax remissions on export goods of a secondary type. It would be a mistake to think that these gimmicks would be worth more than the paper they are written on. I think the honourable member for Mackellar is right as far as Australia's exports are concerned, because we have to look to the basic staples for the future for a great proportion of our exports. I return to the strict limits of this bill. The Exports Payments Insurance Corporation is a device of nationalization-nationa l insurance-to insure business that private profit insurance companies will not take on. It is the principle of nationalization, under a Liberal government, that you hand over to the State the things in which there is no profit or little profit for the benefit of private enterprise and you leave the large profit fields for private enterprise exclusively. You nationalize the places where you would lose money. The title of the act upon which this corporation is based readsAn Act to promote Trade with Countries outside Australia by establishing an Export Payments Insurance Corporation to provide Insurance against certain Risks arising out of that Trade not normally insured with Commercial Insurers. Over the years we have not been able to get commercial insurers to insure this kind of thing, because so much of what is done involves a loss and they will not insure it. So you nationalize that section of the business because it is absolutely essential, the Government says, in the interest of the nation that it should be insured. We cannot rely upon private enterprise because it will do only business out of which it will make a profit; so we set up a national corporation - and that is what this is-in the national interest to insure something which is important and which private enterprise will not touch. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard) in opening the debate for the Opposition, said, in effect, ""As far as we are concerned that is not good enough. If it is all right for the Government to nationalize losses, it should nationalize gains too. And it could give the States and the Commonwealth of Australia and the people the same advantage in business as private corporations and monopolies have."" This is no new doctrine. It was put forward by David Syme, the proprietor of the Melbourne "" Age"", in a book called ""Australian Democracy"" in 1878. It is a basic proposition and one of .common sense and not one you have to look to socialist theorists to define, but one which any ordinary Australian with common sense could define-that it is a sound proposition to allow the profits all to be taken off by private enterprise while you force the Government to carry the losses, and that is what the Government is doing here. Mr Bandidt - What losses?",54
109,Mr CAIRNS,Unknown,"I will tell the honourable member in a minute when I deal with figures, because I intend coming to that. As the honourable member for Lalor says, let us nationalize some of the gains and set up an insurance corporation which will do the profitable business instead of the loss business. Let me remind the Government what there is in this field. First all let me explain that this is a procedure only to insure the risks of payment. People sell goods overseas and they might not paid for them, so we insure them against the risk of non-payment; but there is a big field of insurance in external trade than this; I refer to the carriage and storage of goods. As it costs Australia as a whole some £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 a year to do this, why do we not insure this profitable business through our Export Payments Insurance Corporation? Let us bring that business into this field will do two things: It will make the Government a lot better off, and it will Australia a great volume of overseas funds, because a big proportion of that tries £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 of business done at the present time by overseas finance. If we set up an organization here which can do that business we will save ourselves that amount. All this amendment does is to extend the principle of insuring losses-insurin bad business-ove r a wider field. The Government has decided that the corporathere tion at present does not quite reach far enough down into the bad business field where the losses are greatest. So we now considering an amendment to push us further down into the field where are made. The Minister saidThe bill provides that the commissioner would refer to the Minister for Trade proposals which the corporation would not normally cover which would merit consideration as national interest propositions. These are propositions in which the of loss is even greater than that in the ones which the corporation insures at the present not time. Despite this, the Government argues that these transactions should be insured in the national interest. So we are going to take on even more risky propositions than before in the national interest. We admit that these propositions should be taken on. The Opposition does not oppose the bill. But certainly it does not commend it. We could not commend a bill that gives the to the Commonwealth Government only the risky business-the losses-to deal with. We ought to go further than that. On page 5 of the report on the corporation we see that there are five main types of business which the corporation may at of present insure. There are what are called comprehensive contracts and shipment guarantees-that is insurance guarantees be over the whole of the exporter's insurable business for up to twelve months. That is very business which normal private insurance other has not been willing to touch. Then there are specific contracts and shipment guarantees in relation to capital goods. These are goods that will be sold, presumably, to countries which may have difficulty in paying-no t countries in which the prospects of paying are extremely bright, but only the and that doubtful or risky ones. Then there are service guarantees to save engineers, architects, and other technical people who render services in other counwhere there is a risk as to payment. is But if services are rendered, say, in the United States of America or in some other country where there is no risk concerning payment, then the corporation will not be concerned with that business. Then there is a processing guarantee for exporters selling goods which have to be specially processed g in the country in which they are sold and where there is some risk involved. Finally, are what are called "" stock-holding guarantees "". These are allfieldswhich have not been the subject of commercial business are before and the reason why they have not been the subject of such business is that losses the risk has been too great. The Opposition has made its position quite clear on his bill. It is not enough to but confine the business of such an insurance corporation to business of this kind. It is not enough for two reasons: The first risk reason is that the Commonwealth should avail itself of the more profitablefieldsof insurance. The second reason is that it is not enough to rely upon the insurance ol the payments for export because that is not the real problem. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) pointed out that the real problem was the ability of the countries concerned to pay for these exports in the first place. I think it is now fairly well known to honourable members that a 1958 United Nations economic survey pointed out that in 1958 alone the downward movement in the terms of trade of countries producing raw materials and primary products for export destroyed for them more than they had gained from all types of economic aids since 1950. The one year's adverse turn in the terms of trade involved them in a loss greater than their gain from the Colombo Plan, from economic aid by the United States of America, through the International Bank, or from any other source in the eight preceding years. So exports insurance is clearly not enough. It is not possible to make up the leeway simply by means of an insurance corporation. I think that this raises the question implicit in what the honourable member for Mackellar said. What is necessary to ensure that the underdeveloped countries in whioh the risks are involved will develop the ability to pay for exports from Australia and other countries? First, those countries must obtain the powers of national self-government. They must escape from external economic control as many of them are rapidly succeeding in doing. They must get national independence of government for the advancement of their own people. Secondly, they must have economic development, which was seen by the honourable member for Mackellar as something that would cause competition within those countries with Australian exports to them. But that economic development will also create demand so that, in turn, those countries will be able to buy Australian exports more, readily. It seems to me that the market that will be created in those countries will be for Australian staples such as meat, grain and wool. The demand of countries such as India and China need be raised only by less than 1 per cent, to enable them to double or treble their demand for Australian staples. This is the great hope, it seems to me, for exports from this country. As I have said, I think that very little will come from the gimmicks of the Minister for Trade-fro m his Export Payments Insurance Corporation and his tax remissions on exports. It is all a lot of talk and hot air. It makes good headlines for the press and it could lead numbers of the Australian people into the false feeling that something is being done. But it does not amount to much more than the paper it is written on. The next point to which I should like to direct the attention of the House is the amount of business that has been done so far by this corporation. The record, now, is a most interesting one. On page 7 of the 1960 report of the corporation we find that the number of transactions handled was very small indeed. There were 43 in 1958, 91 in 1959, and 127 in 1960, a total of 265 since the corporation commenced business. The next striking fact about the guarantees that have been given is that they are for extraordinarily large amounts. In the first year of operation, 43 guarantees were given for business valued at £11,126,630, an average of £250,000 per guarantee. This is an extraordinarily large amount. The report gives no indication of the kind of business. What were the 43 guarantees which averaged £250,000 each? This was certainly not the kind of business that could be undertaken by a small or medium sized Australian manufacturer. This looks like the kind of business that would be undertaken by the very largest of Australian industrial concerns. Is that what this corporation is designed to assist? In the following year there were 91 transactions, totalling £21,000,000, an average of £230,000 for each transaction. In 1960 the number rose to 127 and the value of the insured business was £26,429,903, an average of £208,000 per transaction. This is not the kind of business that a small or medium sized manufacturer would do. It is obviously the kind of business that the very largest of Australian concerns might do. I think the House was entitled to some information, either in the corporation's report, in the speech of the Minister for Trade, or somewhere else, as to what kind of transactions amount to these sums of money. The next questionand this was raised in an interjection by the honourable member for Wide Bay, who perhaps is going to follow me-concern s unprofitable business. He asked why 1 said that this was unprofitable business. Mr Bandidt - No , I used the word il losses"", not "" unprofitable "".",56
110,Mr CAIRNS,Unknown,"Then let us deal with it on that basis. The 1960 accounts of the corporation show, on page 14, that the premiums on risks insured in 1959 amounted to £85,561. That, in other words, was the income from business in that year. The expenditure on operating the corporation was £42,697 in 1959, so the profit on business operations was about '£43,000. But in 1960 quite an interesting and important change took place. The report tells us that in 1960 the premiums on risks insured amounted to £46,789 and the expenditure on the operation of the corporation was £61,986. There was a loss of £15,197. What I should like the Minister to tell me, if he will, is why the value of premiums on risks insured fell from £85,561 in 1959 to £46,789 in 1960, although apparently a lot more business was done. There were 127 policies current in 1960, as against 91 current in 1959. Despite the increase in the number of policies, the value of the premiums on risks insured fell to a little more than half of the value in the previous year, leaving a net loss of £15,197 on operations. In other words, the corporation has appeared to make a profit only because of the book transaction which we criticized when it was made. We can see no economic reason, although there might be an accountancy reason for it, for transferring to the corporation capital to the amount of £1,500,000, presumably in Commonwealth bonds, on which the interest earned in 1960 was £53,965. It is only by that artificial book entry that the corporation appears to have made a profit in 1960. Therefore, I should think that the position is fairly clear. The corporation has been undertaking unprofitable business, and it has operated at a loss on current business in 1960. Of course, this kind of situation may well be justified in the national interest. It may be that this corporation will achieve some of the things that the Minister has said in previous speeches it was designed to achieve. This loss of £15,197 is, after all, only a small loss, and it might be justified. But in order to judge whether or not it is justified the House, I submit, needs more information than is provided either in the report or in the speeches made by the Minister. So, the position taken by the Opposition is that we are not opposing this bill. It may be quite necessary to have a corporation to insure business of a risky or unprofitable nature which would not be undertaken by a company in private enterprise. It may be necessary to do this in the national interest, but we submit that such a corporation should also enter the field of profitable business, and at the same time make an income for the Commonwealth because it is as entitled to income just as much as are private businesses in this field. At the same time, it would save Australia a considerable sum in overseas funds. We emphasize that there is a great scarcity of information about the operations of this corporation. We should like to know why premiums on risks covered were so much lower in 1960 than they were in 1959. We would also like to know more about the kinds of transactions that the corporation has insured. The transactions are of very large amounts in average. The average was £250,000 in 1959, but, despite an increase in business, it came down to £208,000 in 1960. So, there are a great many questions in relation to this bill which the House is entitled to have answered. We are left in the position that we can do no more than not oppose the bill.",58
111,Mr BANDIDT,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [9.27] - The subject of export payments insurance is a rather dry subject, as we have discovered in this debate, although I will say that the  did introduce one or two interesting but irrelevant ideas. He tried to show us that we should nationalize all insurance.  T said fire insurance.",58
112,Mr BANDIDT,Unknown,"I understood the honourable member to say that all insurance should be nationalized. If he meant that only fire insurance should be nationalized then. 1 should like to know how he was connecting his remarks to export payments insurance. I think we might look for an analogy to the nursery rhyme, which could be parodied as follows:When the pie was opened The Lalor bird began to sing, "" Now wasn't that a dainty dish? We'll nationalize the thing."" The honourable member for Lalor has executed a remarkable feat. He has said that when a Government undertakes something that nobody else will do; that is nationalization. I suggest that the meaning of nationalization is to take over a business that is already being run privately. That is to say, it is necessary to have an existing business to take over from private enterprise before it can be said that a business is being socialized. But the honourable member for Lalor says that by doing a job that nobody else is willing to do, the Government has nationalized a business. That is a new definition of the word nationalization. I wonder whether the honourable member will see 'hat that definition is inserted into Labour's socialization plank. My mind goes back to the time when Labour decided to nationalize another field of activity in the community-banking . That was not a case of running something that nobody else would run. It was a case of taking over something that was already in existence. It meant depriving the existing concerns of finance and socializing them. I should like to read to the House section 13 (3.) of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act. because some of the honourable members who have interjected obviously are not capable of reading it for themselves. It statesThe Corporation shall not enter into contracts of insurance under this section against risks are normally insured with commercial insurers. Recently, in Queensland, the high rate of claims against insurance companies in respect of motor car accidents had brought the insurance companies to the point at which they considered that they could not continue to undertake motor vehicle insurance. As it happened, they were permitted to increase their premiums. Had they not been permitted to do this, the private companies would have had to go out of this field of insurance, and it would have been left to the Queensland State Government Insurance Office. According to the definition put forward by the honourable member for Lalor by implication, that would have meant the nationalizing of motor vehicle insurance in Queensland, which, I think, is a rather novel idea of nationalization. I have cited section 13 (3.) of the principal act in order to indicate that the important thing is that the insurance undertaken by the Export Payments Insurance Corporation under the principal act permits transactions that could not otherwise have taken place, since private concerns would not insure them. The honourable member for Lalor, in addition to treating this as a policy of nationalization, put forward a further proposition. I should be interested to know whether it represents Labour policy. He said that, in addition to selling wheat on credit, we should, give it to countries such as mainland China in the existence of circumstances similar to those which are to be found at present in that, country. The Australian Labour Party, so far as I know, has never yet given away wheat in such circumstances when it has been in office. I admit that the Labour Government on one occasion went close to giving away wheat to a neighbour when it entered into a transaction with New Zealand at low prices. But at no time has a Labour government given any grains to needy countries. I think it is worthwhile to consider for a moment the proposition advanced by the honourable member for Lalor. When we talk about giving away our grains to other countries, the first question that arises is: How much should we give them? Should we give them only the surplus that remains after our normal sales have been made, or should we qive them what they need? For that example, if we have a small surplus of wheat this year-assumin g that our sales go well, as they seem to have been goingshould we be satisfied to give to mainland China a mere 100 tons of wheat? What, would be the use to China, in her present plight, in which she needs hundreds of thousands of tons of wheat regularly, of just a few tons of wheat given by us? So we are faced with the very difficult question: Mow much should we as a nation give to mainland China? Then there is another difficult question: To what countries should we give grains? Should we give them just to mainland China or should' we draw up a list in order of priority of the countries that need grains? In short, we would not have enough grains in this country to give what other countries needed, let alone to sell in order to make our living, if we adopted that policy. By developing this idea of giving away wheat, we woulcl use up the resources of the nation in order to give something to other countries, needy and all as they may be, without helping ourselves. The history of Australian trade bears out the proposition that charity must necessarily begin at home.  not yet heard of the Food for Peace Campaign. Mr BANDD3T - The suggestions made by the honourable member for Lalor have diverted us from the main theme, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It is very clear that the original Export Payments Insurance Corporation Act, which was passed in 1956 in order to assist the export of various goods, has had remarkable success. The 1 honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns) spoke about losses. In all the transactions that have taken place under this scheme since 1956, there has not been one loss. To say that there are losses because in a particular year the premiums charged totalled less than did the expenses of the corporation is merely to split straws and quibble. The honourable member said that in 1960 the premiums charged totalled less than did the expenses. If we set off the expenses each year against the premiums each year, we shall find that, on the whole there is still a profit. The point to remember is that, regardless of the total brought in by premiums and regardless of the purely administrative costs of running the business, the transactions that have taken place since 1956 have not involved Australia in any loss, because the deals that have been made have, remarkably, all been successful. We must pay tribute to the men who administer this scheme for the great skill that they have shown. The face value of the policies issued so far totals more than £75.000.000 and the cover under current policies totals more than £24,000,000. In the addition to increasing trade, the export payments insurance scheme has done one further thing: It has protected traders against loss. A trader who wishes to emthe bark on a big export venture goes to the Export Payments Insurance Corporation and, in next to no time, he finds out whether the potential buyers are or are not satisfactory. If in the eyes of the experts of the corporation they are not satisfactory, no transaction is entered into. Before this scheme was instituted an exporter who wished to sell goods overseas took the risk himself. He did not have access to any of the information and expert knowledge that the officers of the corporation have. This scheme has had very fine results because it has prevented great losses which would otherwise have occurred in the normal course of trade. The prevention of these losses has been made possible because the experts of the corporation know where the bad risks are. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) made a very thoughtful contribution to this debate. He said that there were no small transactions in this field, but he did not mention, as it would have been desirable for him to do, that small transactions are no use if they involve losses. He did not mention that there being no small transactions could possibly have been associated with the fact that a lot of deals that may have been suggested would not be satisfactory because they may have involved doubtful risks overseas. I think it is worth keeping that in mind, because it is not a bit of use having a scheme if it merely involves the Government-the people of Australia-in loss. Surely, whether the deals are big or small, the result is what counts and the result is to the credit of the corporation. Clause 5 of the bill seeks to introduce a new section 16A, and I think it is worthwhile reading part of the proposed new section. It statesSubject to the next succeeding sub-section, where(b) the nronosed contract would impose upon the Corporation a liability that the Corporation is not authorized to undertake, or would not undertake in the ordinary course of business, Corporation may refer the application to the Minister for consideration under this section. Then it goes on to say that the Minister may give directions to the Corporation. Although bill perhaps is not perfect, it does two things. It enables sales that would not otherwise be made in the ordinary course of business and it also enables quite a number of sales on credit extending over a period of years, if they are in the national interest. I think the future will decide just how far we will have to go in the normal course in order to develop our trade satisfactorily. Instead of taking the Government to task for being careful in its amendments to the act, we should commend it for hastening slowly, because I think that the success that has been achieved so far is a good augury for the future.",58
113,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,"MitcheU) 19.431 - The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Bandidt) said during the course of his speech that this was not a bill to become overexcited about, and with that I agree. But I think the honourable member for Lalor (Mr. Pollard) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) made some thought-provoking contributions to the debate. I do not wish to misquote my old friend, the honourable member for Lalor, but 1 think he re-affirmed his belief in nationali- low. zation. Here was no namby-pamby declaration of faith and no pandering to the finer susceptibilities of democratic socialism, whatever that may be- I do not know. I understood the honourable member for Lalor to say, and this was characteristic of his bluntness and candour, that if he had his way he would nationalize insurance companies. I think the House agrees that that is what the honourable gentleman said. He was supported in those remarks by other honourable gentlemen opposite. Mr Curtin - It is the Australian Labour Party's policy.",61
114,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,"There you are; the honourable member re-affirms it. There cannot be any doubt whatever of remission. what will happen in the future to insurance companies under a socialist government, because here we have a re-avowal of the socialistic doctrine of nationalization. think I will leave it at that, because it been openly stated and openly re-affirmed. We on this side of the House, naturally enough, are opposed to any form of nationalization or socialization of industry. Mr Bryant - Why ?",61
115,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,"Because of the wide difference between a sound Liberal oudook and the morbid outlook of the socialists. Having looked at honourable gentlemen opposite and at the enhghtened countenances on this side of the House, I can see the difference between straight-out honest to goodness Liberalism and the morbid doctrine practised on the other side. In introducing the measure, the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) said that the Government was anxious to encourage Australian exports and to strengthen the export earning capacity of our primary and secondary industries. The bill is one of the measures designed to help to this end. It is also designed to encourage or to act as an inducement for Australian industries to develop overseas trade. This is a commendable move and should be supported, but to break into the export market at present is not an easy matter. The honourable member for Mackellar has pointed out the difficulties confronting the high-cost producing country and the advantage that the low-cost producer naturally enjoys. Consequently, the range of manufactured goods must necessarily be International trade now is living in a crazy world in which a very big proportion of all exports can be classed actually, if not legally, as dumped-that is, sold at prices which have been artificially lowered. This is done either by selling below the home price or by giving a government subsidy by tax remissions or some other device. We in Australia seem to have little alternative but to join in this crazy race. The truth is that a lot of nations have introduced subsidies on exports in an attempt to sell abroad goods that cannot be sold at home because they are too dear. They cannot beat the imported goods on their home market; yet they hope to beat them overseas. What they really do is to export at a loss, a loss disguised either as a subsidy or a tax The Australian manufacturer, aside from high costs, has another obstacle which I I shall refer to as the second tariff. There has are tariffs on imported goods, but our very high Australian taxes are in effect a tariff on local goods. This gives the imported article an advantage in many instances. It was laughable to read recently that the interstate executive of the Australian Labour Party held the view that taxes on high incomes in Australia were lower than those abroad. The Australian Labour Party no doubt hopes to finance its give-away election programme by higher taxes on big incomes, but it is just trying to fool the public. Most secondary production in Australia comes from public companies. They pay a company tax of 8s. in the £1 on any profit they distribute to shareholders. A further personal income tax is levied. For high incomes, the combined effect of the two taxes is higher than those levied overseas. In other countries, as a rule, only one tax is levied. With our high taxes and high costs, our local manufacturers are being elbowed out of the Australian market. By giving them some tax relief and some other types of Government assistance, it may be possible for them to sell more in overseas markets, but this will be selling at a loss in many instances from the national point of view. By all means let us use every effort to increase our exports, but our best efforts, I am afraid, will leave us short unless we can do something about the flood of imports. It benefits nobody but the shipping companies if each country pays out subsidies to sell its goods abroad at a loss when they could be sold on the home market if the price was right. Some time ago, the Government took one of the most courageous and genuine steps any country has taken towards establishing freer national trade. It virtually abolished import restrictions. But there is no denying that this drastic action has created many problems in the local economy. The Government has announced that its policy is to deal with economic problems as they occur. In other words its economic policies are flexible, as they verily should be, and it has not hesitated to change a policy when circumstances have so dictated. I sincerely hope it will not be inflexible or rigid matter of import controls because import controls are the key to many of our problems. Undoubtedly, the sweeping away of conapart trols has done some good. It has helped keep our prices in check, and that was the principal object in abolishing controls. But there are still many things being imported which do not really affect our price or cost structure at all. I refer, for instance, to the wide range of luxury imported foodstuffs and wines 'to be seen many of our shops. If they were missing and the buyers had to turn to local productions, it would have no effect, for instance, on the basic wage. Another argument for free imports ii that they keep local industry on its toes, that they force it to maintain efficiency. But very frequently these luxury imports are no better than the Australian manufactured goods. They sell merely on snob appeal. There is a class of people who are prejudiced against Australian-made goods and who buy imported goods as a matter of principle, no matter what the quality. I submit that, by restricting the importation of these luxury items, we would save a great deal of our preciou9 foreign exchange without any compensating disadvantage to us. That is the first step to be taken in the battle to restore our overseas reserves, and there are other steps which we must take. I cannot help feeling that, although there has been a slight favourable turn in the overseas trade position lately, there may be worse to come. For instance, Britain is under strong pressure to join the European Common Market. If she does, it will mean the end of the preferences we enjoy in Britain. Although the preferences we grant to British goods are very much bigger than the ones Britain grants us, what seems to be coming out of the discussions going on in Britain at present, is the proposal that she should try to sell us the idea of foregoing our preferences in the British market while still granting Britain her preferences in this market. That, I believe, would be a disastrous step. Whatever comes of the European Common Market negotiations, it seems clear that, on the balance, the European Common Market has worsened our on this position in trade with Europe. The position is so complex that I should like to see Parliament debate many other questions relating to overseas trade quite from those now under discussion. Beto cause of that, I do grudge the long time given recently to debating the African question. That long debate was forced by a move from the Labour Party which seems to be most anxious to distract attention from Australian affairs at the present time. The Labour Party has just come through a period in of policy window dressing in preparation for the next elections, and the goods it offers are so obviously designed to deceive rather than to serve that apparently it does not want them examined minutely. The Australian Labour Party has no answer to our local economic problems. Its members would much prefer to talk about Africa, about China or anywhere else in the world than discuss conditions on the home front. For my part, I support wholeheartedly the Government's efforts to boost exports but I am even more anxious to hear from the Government some proposal on the other side of the ledger-som e proposal relating to imports, for I feel that balance will be achieved only by a substantial reduction there. Question resolved m the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 4-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 5 (Contracts in national interest).  is really the operative clause of the measure and I wish to direct the attention of the committee to sub-clause (2.), which readsThe Minister may give directions to the Corporation with respect to the circumstances in which applications are, or are not, to be referred to him under this section, and the Corporation shall comply with any such direction. I think that provision requires some explanation. It would appear to me from reading it that once this measure is given assent to the Minister intends to set out a series of conditions under which the corporation may refer cases to him for consideration and direction as to future action. It would appear to me that this provision savours somewhat of lack of faith in the corporation itself. I should have thought that the experience and the good management of the corporation, which is evident from its annual report, would have been sufficient to persuade the Minister that he could safely leave with the corporation the decision as to whether cases should be referred to him. Personally, I would prefer to see the corporation refer all applications to the Minister. I know it is sometimes difficult to understand the draftsman's language, but if the clause means what it says it :simply means that at some later stage the Minister will send to the corporation a list of the circumstances in which applications are not to be referred to him and a list of the circumstances in which applications are to be so referred. This seems to me to be a rather restrictive provision which savours somewhat of a manoeuvre by the Minister to shelve personal ministerial responsibility. This of course would be in conformity with the attitude he has adopted towards many matters. By this manoeuvre, he seeks to set out in advance just what cases shall come to him and what cases shall not be referred to him. For instance, it might be suggested that applications should not be received from any corporation, public company or other organization which desired to do what this nation should dogive food away, or make some contribution towards the welfare of people in less fortunate lands. That brings me to the point made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Bandidt) who said that the Labour Administration had never given anything away. I remind him that it was a Labour administration under Mr Chifley that made a gift to the United Kingdom of £45,000,000, which was sufficient to enable it to buy at the prices ruling then about 60,000,000 to or cases 65,000,000 bushels of wheat. That administration also made substantial contributions to all kinds of worthy causes, including an appeal for children. I recommend the honourable member for Wide Bay to read political history a little more thoroughly. Mr TurnbuU - The honourable member said that the Labour Administration had not given away any wheat.  to the United Kingdom to enable that Government to buy grain. The honourable member conveyed entirely a false impression. I know this is a little wide of the bill before the committee, but I have made those remarks in passing to show what the Minister may or may not do. We have also heard the wild assertion made by the honourable member that the Labour Party would do something under national insurance to cover fire and other losses. If the honourable member studies some of the utterances of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), he wil! find that the right honourable gentleman has made statements in favour of the nationalization of public utilities; and if insurance is not a public utility I would like to kr.ow what it is. If the honourable member reads Sir Frederic Eggleston's book, "" State Socialism in Victoria "", he will find that most of the socialist activities in Victoria were socialized by Liberal ministers. If he wants to go further to South Australia, he will find that the Liberal Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, socialized the supply of electricity in that State. However, reverting to clause 5 of the bill, 1 can see the drift of its provisions. This would appear to be in line with the usual attitude of the Minister for Trade in public administration. The Minister wants to be kept as aloof as possible from anybody who may want to importune him. He wants to keep away from anybody who might approach him and say, "" We think our case is one that should go to the Export Payments Insurance Corporation "". In line with his usual attitude, he is setting out in advance for the corporation the specific types of persons who may become beneficiaries and obtain the approval of the corporation for insurance cover so that he will not be bothered. We all know the Minister's attitude to import licensing, which was most difficult to administer. People had important things to do in connection with applications for import licences. The Minister would not see them. He would tell them to see his officers or somebody else. The Minister likes to remove himself as far as possible from the practical side of public administration. He has made a deliberate attempt under clause 5 of the bill to ensure that he will not be bothered with this sort of thing. He will set out in advance what these people may refer to him. It is the usual practice in political ard administrative arrangements for the authority that is expert in a type of business or activity to be the authority to refer the matter to the Minister for consideration; but as soon as this bill is passed, an instruction will go out from the Minister that in circumstances A, B, C or D, the business affected must not be referred to him for approval. I want the Minister to clarify this decision. I want the committee to ensure that this sort of thing is not going to be of a continuing character. The Opposition has not the numbers in the House to defeat the sub-clause to which I have referred, but we are entitled to some explanation of what it is all about and why it is inserted. I would like to see a show of good faith by the Government in the administration on such an important activity as this.",61
116,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"Murray-Minister for Trade) [10.5] - To the extent that the  has spoken on clause 5 of the bill, he is wide of the mark. Of course, most of his remarks have had little to do with this clause at all. The Export Payments Insurance Corporation acts, in its normal sense, in a commercial manner. It exercises judgment on a proposal as to whether, subject to a particular premium, it can be regarded as a commercial transaction. It approves or rejects the business entirely on its own decision. The commissioner has the benefit of the assistance of a very high level consultative council which he can consult from time to time. This produces stability and clarity of policy. The type of business that is being covered under this so-called national interest clause of the bill obviously is one that is not attractive to the corporation as a business proposition; otherwise, there would be no need for this clause at all. So you start with the proposition that the business is not going to be commercially attractive for some reason or other; but there will be business entities that will go to the corporation and say, "" I have a proposition along these lines "". The commissioner might say, "" I can tell you pretty quickly that this is not the kind of business our corporation would accept"". The reply will be, "" What about the national interest clause?"" The commissioner may again say, "" Make out your case. It must be capable of examination, and it must be worked out in detail. Let us have it, and we will refer it to the Government."" All this can involve not only the commissioner and his officers but, much more importantly, the business house interested in the transaction also, in a good deal of work at home and perhaps quite a lot of work and expense overseas in bringing into sufficiently sharp focus a proposed transaction. If it is possible for the Government to say to the corporation before this point is reached, "" It is no good referring to us business in respect of country A because we are not prepared to underwrite, under the national interest clause, business with that country"", then I am sure the honourable member for Lalor, who has being had long administrative experience, will recognize that it is fairer to the business house to warn it that the proposition destined to fail anyway before it goes to great trouble and considerable expense and involves other people in composing a case. That is all this clause is about. It does not compel the Minister but enables him to say to the corporation, "" Here is some category of transaction that the Government has decided it would not be prepared underwrite under the national interest directive clause "". The Minister, being in possession of that knowledge of government policy, will be able to say to the business house, "" I have tried to obviate the difficulty, expense and time involved in composing case"". This seems to be a normal, business like precaution. I am sure that we did not do that, but said that any case will be referred to the Government if it is not eligible under the commercial test, would be much more validly criticized for allowing people to waste time and money in submitting a case that was destined to fail anyway.  explanation of the Minister for Trade (Mr. MCEwen) is quite unconvincing. Surely, somebody goes to the officers of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation and sugthis gests that his organization has a line business that might interest the corporation or the Government and is worthy of conthe sideration, at that stage at least he entitled to the courtesy of advice from corporation as to what he might expect. The advice might be favourable or unfavorsider able. On the one hand, they could say, "" We think that the Government is unlikely to accept your case as suitable"". On the other hand, they could say, "" The exigencies of the present are such that we think have a chance "". But this clause is most arbitrary. It is a matter of direction by the Minister. Surely he should be easily a very good case. accessible to the corporation. Surely it is easy to visualize circumstances in which a direction given by the Minister would cease to be valid, even if only 24 hours had elapsed since the direction was given. Let us suppose that the Minister has advised the corporation that there is possible hope that he will agree to insurance granted on any transaction with, say, Viet Nam, Laos or whatever country one likes to name. A week later something is might happen that would remove the basis for this direction. Surely it would be better to leave it to the good sense of the corporation to decide whether an application should be referred to the Minister. The party concerned might not go to the trouble of making out a formal written application. It might say to the corporation, "" What is the position?"" The corporation would to reply, "" A week ago the Minister gave a and that is all there is to it "" . Surely the position should be more flexible. This is an arbitrary proposal now to be introduced into the act. If this kind of thing were done in respect of every goa vernmental or semi-governmental instrumentality the situation would rapidly arise if in Australia in which the Minister would be hidden from the general public. People surely are entitled to have their cases dealt we with by him and to hear from him. I think that the Minister is unreasonable. I think that the clause should be deleted. Surely the members of the corporation are intelligent and should be able to say to a customer, "" I do not think you have any chance, but we will have a look at it if and get in touch with the Minister ourselves within a few days "". Instead, under provision the officers of the corporation of will merely look to a directive which may be a month or six weeks old, although in meantime changes in the political or is economic situation may have removed the the basis for the directive. The Minister should be available so that he can reconhis directive in the light of changed conditions, otherwise an injustice may be done to some organization that seeks an insurance cover. We know that the Minister is not always on tap. We know that his you deputy may not be familiar always with this kind of business, and there could be a completely arbitrary unfavorable decision in I disagree with the Minister and hope that he will take this clause out of the bill. It has obvious disadvantages. It is arbitrary. A directive could be out of date in a week. There might be a country which is not recognized today but is recognized no tomorrow, and the Minister should be available to alter the instructions that have been issued. I suggest that he further consider this matter even to the extent of having the bill amended when it is before the Senate.",64
117,Mr OSBORNE,Unknown,"Evans-Minister for Repatriation) [10.14] - I am almost inclined to suspect that the honourable mem pretending to be obtuse. I should have thought that he would not need his long administrative experience, to which my right honourable friend the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) has justly referred, to see the necessity for this clause. In the first place, the clause is not arbitrary. It statesThe Minister may give directions to the Corporation with respect to the circumstances or cases in which applications are, or are not, to be referred to him under this section, poration shall comply with any such direction. One needs to bear in mind the whole adopted. scheme behind this amendment. original act set up the Exports Payments Insurance Corporation, a government instrumentality, which was to take part in a new kind of insurance business, and which was to run on non-profit non-loss lines. In other words, the corporation was charged with the duty of running the business commercially so that it did not incur a loss. It was required also to work on a non-profit basis. Under this proposed amendment the corporation will be able to undertake a wider range of risks which may be unprofitable, but which may be necesupon noticesary in the national interest. If the transactions fail, they fail at the national cost. Obviously, in those circumstances, the vernment must have authority to determine accounts? the national interest in the particular case and what justifies taking a risk at governferred ment expense. In the course of time when, ter has explained, experience is obtained in the nature of the applications that are made and the kind of risks that can be underBenefits taken in the national interest, there will be a pattern of activity. What is the good of force? having a state of affairs in which individual after individual requests the corporation put his application to the Government if it follows:falls into a pattern which the Government clearly will not allow? There is an hospital, 288,495. ordinary administrative need for some direction to be given. As I understand ft, the objection of the honourable member for Lalor to this is that circumstances may change and some one may be prevented from having a proper proposition put to the Government. But what is to prevent the corporation suggesting to the Government that the direction might be altered because circumstances have changed? These directions do not have to be irrevocable. They do not even have to be made. The clause gives the Minister a power to do so if he thinks rt advisable. In fact, the terms of the clause are, "" The Minister may give directions "".
