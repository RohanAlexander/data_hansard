0,NA,Unknown,"$£ousc of IVrprrsnrtatibrg. Thursday, 3 November, 1004. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.3c p.m., and read prayers. SUPPLY (1904-5),. COUNT OUT : RESUMPTION OF COMMITTEE.",12
1,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown," I desire to ask the concurrence of the House to submit a motion which will enable the Estimates to be proceeded with today. Honourable members will recollect that, unfortunately, last evening we were just short of a quorum, with the result that the Estimates lapsed, and Supply has fallen from, the business-paper. . It is quite competent for the House, upon motion, if it so desires, to restore that business to the notice-paper, when it will occupy the same position as it did last night when we were dealing with the Estimates.",12
2,Mr MAHON,Unknown,What is the number of the standing order which relates to the matter ?,12
3,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"We can, with the concurrence of the House, deal with any matter without notice. Of course, any honourable member can object to granting me the necessary leave to submit a motion without notice. Under the circumstances, perhaps I had better seek the concurrence of the House first.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is it the pleasure of the House that the Treasurer have leave to move-a motion without notice?,12
5,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I object.,12
6,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"Then I desire to move That standing orders Nos. 108 and 235 be suspended, in order to allow a motion to be made for the resumption of the Committee of Supply without notice. This motion will require the support' of thirty-eight honourable members to give it any effect.",12
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would point out that the motion which the Treasurer has submitted will simply suspend the Standing Orders so far as notice is concerned. It it be carried, the Treasurer, I imagine,' will then move' the motion which he desired to submit just now.",12
8,Mr WATSON,Unknown," It seems to me that, the ordinary course under the Standing Orders may very well be followed upon the present occasion. That course renders it necessary' for the Treasurer to give notice of his motion for tomorrow. There will then be no objection-to restoring the'lapsed business to the paper. The count-out last night was solely the fault of the Government.",12
9,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,There were more members of the Opposition present than there were Government supporters.,13
10,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I do not see why the Ministry should not follow the ordinary course prescribed by the Standing Orders.,13
11,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That will involve a waste of time.,13
12,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Why was not the right honourable member present last night?,13
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Honourable members who interject across the Chamber are grossly disorderly.,13
14,Mr REID,Unknown," I did calculate upon the concurrence of the Opposition in facilitating the despatch of public business by adopting the shortest possible method of averting inconvenience which has arisen from an accident. Many such accidents might have happened upon former occasions if the present tactics of the Opposition had been followed. However, I . am perfectly satisfied to leave the matter to the objection which has been raised by the leader of the Opposition. I . recognise that we can only carry the motion with the concurrence' of the Opposition, because thirty-eight honourable members are required to give it any effect Consequently, I advise the Treasurer to withdraw the motion, and to give the usual notice.",13
15,Sir JOHN,Unknown,"FORREST - Le t us divide the matter. Mr MALONEY'(Melbourne),-In order Sovereignty to expedite the despatch of public business, Government I do not see why we should not restore the Estimates to the business-paper today. I do not see why we should not proceed with the consideration of Supply simply because, made owing to a ball which was given by the nation Governor General, a count-out occurred last evening. I think that we ought to proceed .with the-work'which yet remains to - be Personally I care very little who occupies the Treasury benches so - long as - we perI f form some good service. I hope that House 'will see its way clear to allow the Ministry to proceed with business.",13
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the Treasurer have leave to withdraw his motion? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear. Motion, t y leave, withdrawn.",13
17,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," I think that caught your eye, sir, before leave to withwishes, draw ' the motion had been granted. I ' wished to advance reasons, why the Treasurer should not be' allowed to withdraw the motion.",13
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It was quite competent for the honourable member to object to the withdrawal of the motion, but I had certainly put the question before he rose.",13
19,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I had risen, I think.",13
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable and learned member Had risen I could not have avoided seeing him, because he occupies a seat directly in front of me. I can assure him that I had obtained the leave of the House to withdraw the. motion before he rose. ADMISSION' OF HINDOO RACES. Mr HIGGINS' - I wish to ask the Prime Minister, in his capacity as Minister of External Affairs, a question having rethe. ference to an answer which he' was good enough to give me some little time ago. Upon the occasion referred to I asked him whether he could find a trace of any pledges given by the British Government to the Hindoo races regarding their admission to all parts of the British Empire- L pledges which are contained in proclamations or otherwise. He replied that he was not aware of any such pledges having been given. I based my question upon a despatch from Sir Arthur Lawley, Governor of the Transvaal, to Sir Alfred Milner, who is practically Governor General of South Africa. The following is a sample upon passage from that despatch:When bringing the Indian Peninsula under the of the British Crown the Imperial pledged itself to make no distinction in law either in favour of or against any races or colour. Pledges such as those contained in the Proclamation of Sir Charles Napier were athad a time when large sections of the British not come into touch with coloured races as they have today. May I ask whether the right honourable done. gentleman will be good enough to make further inquiry into the matter? need be, I shall be glad the to supply h:m with a copy of the despatch in ' question, as it is reported in .the newspapers dated the 13th April of .the present year. It is important, and it would be'of interest to the House, and to the country, to know what pledges have been given in this connection.",13
21,Mr REID,Unknown,"With ' every desire to do I what my honourable and learned friend it does not appear to me that it is - incumbent upon this Government to make any inquiries as to any pledges, real or .imaginary, which may have been made in - some other part of the Empire. I do not myself feel called upon to investigate whether or not such pledges exist. All that I am concerned with is to see that the legislation of the Commonwealth is respected. . STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES - which",13
22,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I should like fo ask. the Prime: Minister, without notice, a question having reference to' the important constitutional case of Lyne and Deakin v. The Commissioner of Taxes of Victoria, with respect, to the taxation of Federal agencies. I draw the attention of the right - honourable gentleman to the fact that the Chief Justice of the High Court has stated that only a fragmentary portion of the judgment has been published in the press, and I would ask whether the right honourable .gentleman will confer with the Attorney General, and consider whether arrangements should not be made for the publication of the full text of that important judgment for the information, not only of Parliament, but also. of. public men and. citi zens. generally throughout the Commonwealth ?",14
23,Mr REID,Unknown,"I shall be glad to facilitate the full publication of that very important judgment. I think that probably the shortest course would be to procure a copy of the full text of the judgment, and lay it upon the table, of the House.",14
24,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Are not all records of the High Court's decisions being published ?,14
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Yes ; there are full Commonwealth Law Reports^ published.,14
26,Mr REID,Unknown,"That would be a somewhat indirect method of attaining the object of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. I think that what is desired would be better met by the special step to which I have referred"". DEFENCE ADMINISTRATION.",14
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Defence, without notice, whether the scheme of defence which he placed so clearly before us yesterday has 'been reported on by the General Officer Commanding. If so, is the report to be placed before . honourable members; and if there has been no such report made, can the Minister inform honourable members whethei the scheme wEich' he has put forward"" is in accord or otherwise with the views of the General OfficerCommanding? Mr MeCAY - Before coming to any decision on the matter referred to, I naturally asked for the opinion of the 1 General Officer Commanding, or; to be quite accurate, I asked for his opinion on the schemewhich, was prepared by a committee under the authority of my predecessor, and was, very nearly the same; and. involved the same principle as that which I explained,, and the General Officer Commanding reported adversely to it. I have no. objection, to honourable members seeing that report, and I shall see that it is laid on the table. LIBRARY COMMITTEE. Mr SPEAKER laid on the table a report from the Joint Library Committee. PAPERS. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papersMemorandum by the honourable member for Kooyong as to a proposal to establish a Council of Finance for the Commonwealth. Memorandum by the Minister of Defence on the administration and control of the Defence Forces. Memorandum by the General Officer Commanding on the result of the deliberations of a. Committee held upon the command and administration of the Military and Naval Forces of the Commonwealth.",14
28,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I should like to ask the Treasurer if he is prepared to lay on the table all minutes or statements which may be submitted to him by private members similar to that which has been prepared by the honourable member for Koovong ?,14
29,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,If the matter dealt with be of importance I. shall certainly have no objection to do so. ,14
30,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Who is to be the judge ?,14
31,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,I am prepared to leave it to the House.,14
32,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman is not leaving it to the House in this-instance, because he has had the paper printed.",14
33,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"My honourable friend is wrong there. I have not had the paper printed. It was suggested to me that, as the matter in question is very important, it would the well that these proposals of the honourable member for 1 Kooyong should' be included as part of the records of the House. I saw no objection to following that course, and in any similar case I shall have no objection to having important proposals included amongst the records of our proceedings.",14
34,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Any honourable member may .bring forward a report in the same way.,15
35,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,I shall be very glad to consider every case of the kind.  Treasurer by what authority the paper which has been referred to has been already printed ? - I notice that its contents have been circulated this morning in the press.,15
36,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I cannot answer that question. All I can say is that the printing was not done by my authority, or by the authority of my Department.",15
37,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I suppose the honourable member for Kooyong paid for it.,15
38,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Grey will give notice of the question for tomorrow, I shall have necessary inquiries made from the Government Printer.",15
39,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I desire to ask the honourable member for Kooyong by what authority the paper has been printed?,15
40,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"After consultation with Mr Speaker, I went to' the Government Printer, andmade myself personally responsible for all expenses connected with the printing of the paper,",15
41,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,It is very irregular for all that.,15
42,Mr KNOX,Unknown,The Government Printer will be found quite prepared to verify what I say. ENGLISH MAIL. CONTRACT.,15
43,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime ""Minister whether he is now-in a position, or when he will be in a position, to let honourable members know what' has been the result of the mail tenders ?",15
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I was going to ask the same question.,15
45,Mr REID,Unknown,"As honourable members have, I think, come to know, the result of the second effort to obtain suitable offers for carrying out the ocean mailservice, under the new condition of things brought about by the enactment of a certain provision in the Post and Telegraph Act, has been that one tender has been sent in by the Orient Steam Navigation Company. That tender is for a sum of £150,000, which was also the amount of the tender received on a former occasion, but there is this difference, that whereas in the former tender there weie certain provision for refrigerating chambers incidental to the service, the new tender which we have received omits all reference to those highly desirable conditions. In the new offer there is no proposal made for any accommodation for perishable products, consequently the second offer received is distinctly more unfavorable than the first. In the circumstances, the Cabinet had no hesitation whatever in deciding as they did today to reject the tender.",15
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Following upon the' answer given by the Prime Minister, I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he has yet elaborated a scheme for the carriage of mails from the end of the year, or whenever the present contract runs out?",15
47,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The question of the mail contract' was considered by the the Cabinet only today. I may say that the details of the action which will be taken by the Government in the future have not yet been determined upon. The Government are quite prepared to deal with the question, and to do the best they can int the public interest. I admit that there is not much time to spare, but it must be remembered that although the matter has been under consideration for a considerable period, we have not been in office very long, and the matter only came under our notice quite recently. The tender was rejected on the ground mentioned by the Prime Minister, and the whole question is now being looked into, with a view to arrive at the best possible arrangement.  ment to which the Minister has referred?",15
48,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"In view of the fact that we have not received a satisfactory tender, it becomes the duty of the Government to ascertain what other means there are of carrying on the mail service in the best interests of the Commonwealth.",15
49,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The Prime Minister, in his reply, referred to certain new conditions that had been imposed, consequent on the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act relative to the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers. I should like to ask whether there was any indication in the tender submitted by the Orient Steam Navigation Company that the increased price asked for was due to that provision?",15
50,Mr REID,Unknown,I was referring to the fact that the provision mentioned prevented the co-operation between Great Britain and the Commonwealth which had been in force prior to its enactment.,16
51,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister lay the tender upon the table of the - House ?,16
52,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not think there is any objection to bhat. If my honourable colleague the Postmaster-General consents, I have no objection.",16
53,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,I would ask the Postmaster-General if he has any objection to lay the tender on the table ?,16
54,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I see no objection. . ITALIA N BOY IMMIGRANTS.,16
55,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I desire to. ask the Prime Minister whether he will cause inquiries to be made with regard to the conditions under which a number of Italian boys are being introduced into Victoria. These boys are making profit for some one, by acting as flower-sellers and street musicians, and are not only troublesome to the police authorities, but constitute a menace to the morality of the community.",16
56,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not know whether this matter comes within my province as Minister of External Affairs. I suppose it does, but I have not had the matter brought before me in any shape up to the present time.",16
57,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It has been before the Police Courts.,16
58,Mr REID,Unknown,"- I have not had time to read the records of the Police Courts. I am obliged to my honourable friend for showing an interest in these matters, and I shall endeavour to obtain some information on the subject.  sirr.ilar to that mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports prevails in South Australia, where a large number of Italian boys have recently been introduced. These boys cannot speak a word of English, and some curiosity has been manifested as to how they obtain admission to the Commonwealth, seeing that they could not possibly pass an examination such as would be required under the Immigration Restriction Act. I shall be glad if the Prime Minister will make inquiries in this regard, which will cover the whole of the States.",16
59,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not mind making inquiries on the subject. 10 p LETTER-BOX CLEARANCES.,16
60,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, ufon notice I. Who constitute the board appointed to consider the early evening clearance of mails in Melbourne and suburbs? 2. Will he place on the Library table all documents bearing on the question being investigated by this board, so that the board's report may be considered by honourable members in the light of the information to be obtained from the papers ?",16
61,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The board is constituted of Mr Jackson, Acting Senior Inspector of the Postmaster-General's Department in Victoria, and Mr Young, who, as an officer of somewhat similar standing in New South Wales, has an intimate knowledge of the system of clearances m Sydney and its suburbs. They are assisted by Mr Brain, of the Victorian, and Mr Douglas, of the New South Wales branch of the Department, who have a complete knowledge of the details of the methods in both Melbourne and Sydney. The scope of the inquiry embraces, not the evening clearances only, but the whole system as in operation both by day and by night. 2. The documents bearing upon the question are now in the hands of the board, but when returned with the report, all will be placed on the Library table for the information of honourable members. NA MAIL STEAMERS.",16
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"the Postmaster-General, ufon noticeW ill he kindly furnish the number of coloured men employed by the Orient Company on their Australian mail boats?",16
63,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows : There is no information in the Department as to the number of coloured men employed by the Orient Company on their Australian mail boats; the manager of the company has, however, in answer to an inquiry, stated verbally that the number of coloured men so employed varies from So to 100, according to the size of the mail boat. COUNCIL OF FINANCE.",16
64,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," J move That, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable1. To establish by Act of Parliament a Council of Finance of the Commonwealth of Australia composed of representatives to be appointed by the Commonwealth and by the States. 2. That such Council of Finance shall be constituted for the purposes following :(a) To manage the public debts of the States and the Commonwealth. (b) To effect the consolidation, conversion, or renewal of the existing public debts of the States of the Commonwealth. (c) To undertake the flotation of new loans authorized by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth or the States of the Commonwealth. (d) To undertake other work being incidental or cognate to the foregoing purposes. 3. That the Treasurer invite the approval and co-operation of the States, with the view of obtaining through the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States the necessary constitutional and statutory authorities to give effect lo the foregoing. I recognise that I am extremely fortunate in being able to ask honourable members to consider this motion so soon after having given notice of it. I should like to express my thanks to the Treasurer) who has voluntarily - certainl y without my knowledge-bee n kind enough to lay upon the table as an official paper the memorandum prepared by me. When I issued the memorandum in the form of a circular, I desired to place in"" the hands of honourable members in as condensed and connected a form as possible a statement of my views on this important matter, and consequently was only too glad to undertake any expense that might be entailed in doing so. When I was in London at the beginning of last year, steps were being taken to float a Victorian conversion loan, and I was very much impressed by the fact that it would have been greatly to the advantage of that State if the Commonwealth or some other authority had been appointed to undertake the conversion. Had steps been taken in that direction some two or three years ago, in the earlier days of the Commonwealth, it might reasonably have been expected that the imprimatur of the Commonwealth would have possessed considerable value, whereas at present I am afraid that no special advantage would follow from the Commonwealth instead of an individual State undertaking the operation. I wish to say at once that I can add practically nothing to the very able memorandum which the Treasurer submitted to the Conference of States Treasurers. The right honourable gentleman dealt exhaustively with the whole of the difficulties that surround the very important matter of the transfer of the States loans to the Commonwealth. I shall not unnecessarily go over ground which the right) honourable gentleman has so ably covered; but inasmuch as I disagree with his opinions upon two very important points, I wish to state the nature of mv disagreement. In the first place. I do not take the sanguine view which he holds of the willingness of the States individually or collectively to submit themselves entirely to Mr Knox. Commonwealth control and authority. In the second place, I think that the difficulties of the situation are very great. Every one who reads the right honourable gentleman's memorandum, together with the reports of the discussions at the Conference, and makes an examination of the whole question, will see that it is surrounded with complications and difficulties requiring for their settlement some such authority as that which I am now suggesting. The Treasurer has indicated that he thinks, that the Commonwealth Treasurer should be that authority; but I differ from him. there, because I believe that we should have an independent authority, since the States will not entirely surrender their control, and submit themselves to the Commonwealth. I ask the attention of honourable members to section 105 of the Constitution, which gives the Commonwealth power to take over the debts of the States. It is as follows :The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof, according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall indemnif y the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency of the whole amount shall be paid by the: several States. Then section 51 provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to :(xxxvii.) Matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whoseParliaments the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law.. It will be seen that section 105 gives the Parliament an arbitrary power, whereas under paragraph' XXXVII. of section 51 the debts can be taken over with the approval of the States. I should like to recall to honourable members the history of the consideration of this matter. It was first dealt with so far back as 1891 by the - Convention which then sat in Sydney. The members of that Convention were firmly of opinion that one great object of union was the consolidation of the debts of the States. Then in 1897, in. Adelaide, to quote from monumental work of Quick and Garran on view, the ConstitutionThere was much diversity of opinionupon whole subject. Mr Reid had nothing to say, so long as no compulsory proposition was made. Sir George Turner would have liked a compuldently sory taking over of all the debts, but, in view of Mr Reid's strong objection, he did not press this. Still, he thought that the power should to take all the debts of the States, and he objected to the consent of the States being required. Holder and Mr MCMillan pointed out that compulsory consolidation meant making a present of Encyclopedia the Federal security to the bondholders; but approved of giving the Parliament power to without the consent of the States. Some thought that the power should be limited to existing debts; others thought that it ought to extend to future debts. Some thought that future State borrowloans, ing should be restricted; others that this was possible. Eventually, on Sir George Turner's motion, the requirement of the consent of the State Parliaments was omitted, on division, twenty to fifteen, and the power was limited "" the whole, or. a rateable proportion of lic debts of the States as existing at the lishment of the Commonwealth."" The provision requiring any savings made to be tion of interest, was negatived, and Mr Higgins added a declaration that the "" rateable proportion "" should be calculated on a population basis. . . . . At Melbourne, Mr Glynn moved an amendment providing for compulsory consolidation of debts, each State indemnifying the Commonwealth for any excess of its debts over the average indebtedness. This, after a long debate, was negatived. Mr Holder, for Mr MCMillan, then moved to insert, after "" Parliament,"" the words "" may take over the whole or any part of the debt of the State, subject to the consent of the State."" On this, Sir George Turner moved the substitution of "" shall"" for "" may,"" which was carried by twenty-five votes to eight; a division, w'hich, coming as it did after the rejection of the guarantees, signified a desire on the part of the Convention to make some definite provision with regard to the threefold problem of the debts, the railways, and the guarantees. Mr. Holder lamented this "" unfortunate vote,"" on the ground that it would at least put our worse securities on a level with our best, and would make apresent of millions to the bondholders; whilst Mr Reid (who had been absent when the vote was taken) objected on the ground that it dictated a high Tariff. The Convention, after some debate, showed a disposition to reverse the effect of its vote. The amendment was consequently amended by the omission of all words after ""shall take over;"" but t-he proposal to insert these words in the clause was negatived on division. I wish to place this information on the records, as establishing the fundamental fact that there existed in the minds of the representatives of the States at* each of the Federal Conventions, including the Convention held as far back as 1891, an appreciation of the very great difficulties which surround this question. Having 10 s 2 the impressed honourable members with that I shall proceed to quote certain figures which I have collected, and which I think the will be found very interesting. It is held by one important financial authority that borrowing, as long as it is justly and pruundertaken, is one of the great indications of industrial progress throughout the be world. I have ventured to believe that the House may be interested in a table, which I Mr have taken from the latest edition of the Britannica, showing the they principal public debts of the world in 1900, act but I do' not propose to weary honourable members by elaborating the figures. In 1900, the world's debt, in t'he shape of public amounted to £6,152,841,525. It is imsignificant that, according to this authority, New Zealand, at the date named, had .a by total debt of £47,874,452, and stood, so to far as capital responsibility per head of its the pubpopulation was concerned, at the very top estabof the list, its public debt amounting to spent in reduc- £ 5 8 12s. per head.",16
65,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Par t of that debt was contracted through the Maori war.,18
66,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I intend to refer to that fact at a later stage. I do not desire to make any unfair comparison, and shall be glad to have my attention drawn to any statement which, in the opinion of honourable members, may be erroneous. The Australian States are second on this table, to which, although it is not quite up to date, I intend to adhere, in order that we may have a uniform comparison. The total debts of the Australian States is set down at £195,324,717, or a capital responsibility of £52 13s. per head of the population. 'We know, however, that the public indebtedness of Australia has been largely increased since 1900, and that it now amounts to over £222,000,000.",18
67,Mr KELLY,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"To over £230,000,000.",18
68,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"The table shows that at the date named, Canada had a debt of £53,254,689, showing a capital responsibility :of only £ 1 0 per head of the population, that the United Kingdom is eleventh on the list, with a responsibility of £ 1 5 7s. 6d. per head of the population, or a total indebtedness of £628,978,782 ; and that the United States of America had a responsibility of only £ 3 15s. 6d. per head of the population, their total debt being £292,216,265. I do not intend to'make any further quotations from this table, but I shall be pleased to hand it to honourable members, because I think that it conveys some significant lessons which we might well take to ourselves. I have no desire to overlook the fact that portion of the indebtedness of New Zealand was contracted during the Maori war in the early days, nor do I think we should fail to recognise that, as against our capital responsibility per head of the population, we have a magnificent asset to show in the shape of our railways, which, with one or two exceptions, have been constructed by the States. It is true there are a few privately-owned railways in the States, but speaking generally, Australia's large indebtedness is represented by a magnificent public asset, which is revenue producing. If we deducted the railway expenditure of the different States, and placed them on the one basis, we should probably present a very much better position than we have hitherto done. The people of other countries do not take the trouble to inquire what led to our incurring this large indebtedness. They do not stop to inquire what were the special circumstances of its creation. probably assume that it has been incurred as the result of wars and various social disturbances; but the people of Australia know that the system adopted by the States of building their own railways has been mainly responsible for it. I intend now to deal with later figures, relying chiefly upon Coghlan, and upon statements' submitted to the Treasurers' Conference by my right honourable friend, the Treasurer, whose memoranda, I would repeat, afford us all the mation we require upon this subject. - I find that the total indebtedness of Australia is.£222,871,765.",18
69,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Thos e figures are more than twelve months old, now.",19
70,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That is so. Of course the Treasurer will understand that in order to make comparisons, I am obliged to accept statistics as they existed upon a common date; and for that purpose, I have adopted the figures which are presented in the last issue of Coghlan, page 829. There I find that the indebtedness of Australia is made up of £212,028,000 worth of inscribed stock and debentures, and a floating debt of £10,843,000. It may be interesting to honourable members to know that at the period to which I refer, the States bore an annual burden in the shape of interest of £8,090,788, equal to £ 2 is. 5d. per head of the. population.",19
71,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That is the gross amount of the interest, without taking into consideration the earnings of the different public works.",19
72,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Certainly . As the Treasurer points out, that is the gross amount of interest which has to be paid to the bondholders, irrespective of the revenue which we receive from various public works. Perhaps I may be permitted to direct special attention to the enormous increase which has occurred in the public indebtedness of these States. Between 1861 and 1871, there was an increase in that indebtedness of £ 1 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; between 1871 and 1881, an addition of £ 3 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and between 1881 and 1891 an increase of £89,000,000. The last-named decade was one in which the whole world seemed to incur large liabilities; and an Victoria it was known as the great "" boom "" period. Between 1891 and 1902-3, notwithstanding the adverse conditions which succeeded the boom, Australia increased her indebtedness by £67,000,000. We all hope that such a gigantic addition They to our liabilities will never be witnessed again. Had there been an adequate increase in our population, that increased indebtedness might have been justified. But what do I find? That in 1861 the population of Australia was 1,153,000; during the next ten years it had increased to 1,668,000; in 1881 it aggregated 2,252,000; in 1891, 3,183,237 ; and in' 1901-2, 3,773,248. Thus between 1861 and 1881 we doubled our population; and between 1881 and 1902 we increased it to 3,773,000. But unfortuinfornately our national indebtedness per head increased in a much greater ratio. For example, in 1861 it was £ 9 13s. Sd -. in 1871 it had increased to £ 1 7 13s. n d . ; in 1881 to £ 2 8 ios. 9 d . ; in 1891 to £ 4 7 14s. i d . ; in 1901-2 to £ 5 5 3s. i o d . ; and in 1902-3 to £ 5 7 is. 5d. Thus - the burden upon the people increased enormously, whilst our . population advanced slowly. I would point out that in New Zealand the national indebtedness is ,£55,899,019; but in this connection, as in others, that country has shown a good example fo Australia by accumulating a sinking fund of £2,313,239. I have no means of ascertaining how that fund is being administered, or whether it is meeting with the same unsatisfactory treatment which has been meted Out to similar funds by some of the Australian States. But what is our position in Australia? As against our enormous indebtedness of £222,000,000 we have a total sinking fund of only £2,139,021. I do not wish to differentiate between the States, but I fail to discover' any evidence that their sinking funds have been properly protected. My object in quoting these figures is lo support my statements in regard to the enormous task which will have totoeundertaken by one authority, that authority being either the Commonwealth or the independent tribunal which I propose. There is only one other set of figures-affecting as it does the constitutional powers of the House-wit h which I shall trouble honourable members. I have already pointed out that the total indebtedness of the States exceeds £222,000,000. The loans existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth totalled £198,722,854, all of which can be taken over under the provisions of the Constitution. Upon the 30th June, 1903, the ""new "" loans which can be taken over by the Commonwealth only after an amendment has been effected in the Constitution, or, provided that the States unite in requesting the Commonwealth to adopt that course, amounted to £2*4, 000,000 odd. Subject to correction by legal members of the House, that is the position as I understand it.",19
73,Mr HUME COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,The latter way would be much more simple.,20
74,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That is so, but there would be more difficulty in securing unanimity in favour of the adoption of that course. Strange to say, if the States debts are taken over as a whole, there need be no consideration as to individual inhabitants of the various States-and this is where the inconsistency comes in-becaus e if we decide to take over only a portion of the enormous debt we are bound to do so on the per capita basis of the population of the respective States. The matter is so complex that I may be pardoned for quoting a few words from my own memorandum on the subjectThe effect of this limitation does not appear to have been f u l ly realized by the framers of the Constitution, for the indebtedness per capita at per State is so unequal that considerable amounts must remain with the States; otherwise, the per capita capital obligations, and per capita interest payments would be quite unfairlv apportioned as between the States. Moreover, the rates of interest vary, and the 'per capita incidence would be also unequal and unfair.",20
75,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,But does anybody propose to pay interest on loans on a per capita basis?,20
76,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Assuming that all the debts were taken over?,20
77,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Yes .,20
78,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"No ; I Hold and I trust the Treasurer will agree with me, that we can never arrive at an equitable basis for the transfer of States debts until we have had an actuarial report of the position of the debts at any one given date, and at, say, a 3 per cent, rate of interest. The right honourable gentleman is aware that these loans vary considerably in respect of the rate of interest at which they have been secured. Of the total indebtedness of the States, £47,7.16,774 have been borrowed at 3 per cent; £67,216,369' at 3^ per cent.; £89,649,503 at 4 per cent.; and £5,075,100 at 4J per cent. Without discriminating between the various States, f wish to show that these varying rates of interest at which money has been borrowed constitute a diversity in the claims of the different States. That is why I say that we shall never be able to equitably adjust the position without some actuarial consideration of the whole matter on some common basis. That view is unimportant, probably, compared with the future control and management of the debts, inasmuch as we are all one people and are operating for the one object. As to the new loans to which I have referred, I would point out that while the pre-, sent position of affairs is allowed to continue, without some decision as to control of borrowing, the complication of the question of the transfer of States debts will increase from year by year. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the additional liabilities incurred by . the States by way of loans ' amount, as I have said, to £24,796,963, and there is this difficulty that New South Wales has borrowed no less than £13,000,000. as against £11,000,000 borrowed by all the other States put-together. It must be quite clear, that as time goes on, unless there is a common authority controlling the matter on a common basis, we shall only be increasing the complications in the way of bringing about an equitable agreement as to the amount to be transferred, and the responsibility which is to be assumed by the Commonwealth Government.",20
79,Mr DEAKIN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Is the honourable member putting it as an increasing difficulty for the Commonwealth or for the States?,20
80,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,For the Commonwealth.,20
81,Mr DEAKIN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Is it not a much more serious difficulty for the States?,20
82,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Of course it is a serious difficulty' from the point of view of the States, but my object is rather to suggest that it is going to be an increasing diffiview culty for - whatever authority is constituted for the control of the transferred debts, whether it the the Federal Treasurer or the authority which I have had the honour to suggest for the consideration of the House. I have' not ventured in any way whether the States have been justified in their borrowing. The matter is one for the consideration of the '.Parliaments of the various States. Loans have been assented to by the States Legislatures, and the manner in which; they have been put the market has been a matter for the sideration of the States Governments connothing cerned. I am endeavouring to point out the great work which is before the controlrevenue, ling authority, however constituted, and I possess. am trying to show that the difficulty in the way of that authority is being increased the longer the determination, of the ter is delayed. Now, as to future borrowproposed. ing, the matter also presents difficulties. The Treasurer took up the position at the Conference of insisting that the whole of . the borrowing of the future should be done absolutely through the Commonwealth. As I have pointed out, we differ as to the authority that should be constituted ' to confinancial trol the matter. My right honourable friend says that it should be the Commonwealth, and I submit that it should preferably be a competent; independent authority. I entirely agree with him that whatever authority is constituted should have trol of - all future borrowing. I desire point out that one of the great troubles the States now have to contend with, and which will be accentuated in the future, arises from the growing competition between those who desire to borrow money upon London market - We find different States deliberately offering .all-kinds of ments to investors to take up their bonds. One State is undertaking to repay the principal practically wherever holders like, and increased facilities are being offered for the transfer of bonds, minimum. and for the payment of interest. Therefore, the interjection made by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat merits serious consideration. In my memorandum which has been handed to honourable bers I have indicated the difficulties complications that are increasing year year, and I now desire to direct honourable members' attention to the position occupied by the States. I have already stated that I cannot join the Treasurer in the sanguine which he takes of the probable outcome of the forthcoming Conference of the Prime Minister with the States Premiers. The right honourable gentleman, the Treasurer, hopes that he will be able to bring all the Stares Treasurers into line with the to say views which He has expressed.",21
83,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"The only real question between us is as to future borrowing, and we ought to be able to solve that properly difficulty somehow.",21
84,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"If the States agree that the on whole of the future borrowing shall be left conin the hands of the Commonwealth, I have more to say; but my belief is that they will not give up much more of their or of the powers which they now",21
85,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"They agreed to hand over the gross railway revenue to matthe Commonwealth upon the conditions I There was no objection to that, but. my stipulation with regard to future borrowing was the rock upon which we split.",21
86,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"If the States, agree to allow the interest payments to become a floating charge upon the railway revenue we shall be greatly assisted. I do not think, however, that they will surrender the control of the .States railways to the Commonwealth, or that they will place the gross railway revenue in the hands of the Federal Treasurer. The Treasurer, however, states that they agreed to that.",21
87,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Yes , just towards the conthe end of the Conference; but it was to understood that the .Federal Treasurer that would not take over the railway revenue until the necessity arose, and that a fair opportunity would first be given to the States to pay over the money .for which they were the liable in regard to interest charges.",21
88,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I understand that the induceFederal Treasurer would not ask for the money until it was absolutely necessary. It seems to me that the States Treasurers the bondmust go that far at least.,21
89,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Yes , that is the",21
90,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"(The States of the Commonwealth are' in 'a favourable and strong position, owing to the value of the assets which they possess in the shape of the railmemways and other revenue-producing public and works, and it is unlikely that they will hand by over the' sole control of the railways to the Commonwealth unless special inducements are offered to them. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has been given the conmember trolof the duties of Customs and Excise, lation ? and may be relieved of the necessity of giving over three-fourths of their revenue to the States at theexpiration of the years' period. To the extent to which the States are deprived of their Customs re has venue the value of the securities to their bondholders has been decreased, and it pears to me that the States can best protect themselves by transferring to the Commonduced wealth a sufficient amount of their loan gations to absorb in interest payments three-fourths of their Customs revenue which, at the end of the ten-years' period, might otherwise be devoted by the monwealth to other purposes. If the State loans are taken over by the Commonwealth the States will be in a position to deliver a Commonwealth bond in place of a State bond. You, Mr Speaker, gave us the benefit of a most important paper, representing the advantages attached to the issue of monwealth bonds. I am unable to agree with you to the full as to value that will attach to a Commonwealth bond as compared with a State bond. At the same time, itmust be manifest that a us harm. Commonwealth bond would be a better security than a bond issued by any individual State, because the bondholders would have their loans practically guaranteed by six underwriters instead of one. It appears me that the additional value that would tach to a Commonwealth bond is one of the principal inducements to the States to conbut sent to the transfer and conversion of. their loans when the proper opportunity presents itself. - Sir GEORGE TURNER - The States would be able to obtain a better price for future loans if they borrowed through the Commonwealth, because of the better security that would be offered.",21

105,Mr HIGGINS,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"No doubt, as soon as the High Corfimissioner is appointed, our stocks will go up 10 per cent.",23
106,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I hope so, though I do not think it is likely. The remaining reasons why I think that the establishment of a Council of Finance will induce the States to consent to the transfer of their d'ebts are that by the establishment of a Commonwealth authority, competition amongst the States in borrowing will be superseded by friendly co-operation and common understanding; the States will secure a highly competent central authority, fully informed and created for this great financial objective, and with a uniform policy; and, lastly, they will be represented in this authority. Let me now show the advantage to be gained by having this separate and independent Department. During the past seven months we have had as Treasurer, first, the right honourable member for Balaclava, then the honourable member for Bland, and then the right honourable member for Balaclava again. Surely, considering the enormous interests involved, whichrequire such complete knowledge and detailed management, there should be some consistency of policy. The control of so great and important a work should be placed in the hands of some one above all party considerations-som e one who would not care whether the right honourable member for Balaclava or the honourable member for Bland was the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, but would be actuated only by a desire to do the very best for the people of the Commonwealth, in dealing with all our loans. Surely lhat is a business in itself. It is unnecessary for me to say that the work is one which requires to have the highest skill and ability brought to bear upon it. No one appreciates more than I do the work performed by the Treasurer, as a member of the Victorian Legislature, as well as a member' of the Commonwealth Parliament; but if he were at the head of such an independent body, as I suggest, he would be in an infinitely better position than he is as Federal Treasurer. In his capacity, as a Minister, he has to attend in this House day after day to answer questions, and deal with various phases of Government business, whereas the magnitude of the special work which devolves upon him as Treasurer of the Commonwealth really demands consistent and constant attention.",23
107,Sir GEORGE TURNER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Is the Council, which the honourable member proposes to create, to be only advisory, or is it to have absolute control, independent of Parliament? That is the point which troubles me.",23
108,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I shall deal with that matter in the course of a few moments. In OTder that I may conclude my remarks as speedily as possible, I shall pass over one or two matters to which I had intended to allude, and deal with the constitution of the Council. I propose that there shall be one representative appointed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and also a representative appointed by the various States. I have already shown that the last-named representative could be properly appointed by a conference of delegates selected for that duty, and I have ventured to suggest that if it were possible it would be desirable in the first instance to appoint the Chief Justice of the High Court, as the highest Judicial authority in the Commonwealth, to act as Chairman of the Council. I recognise that under the Judiciary Act, that distinguished jurist is precluded at present from accepting such a position.",23
109,Mr JOHNSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,He may not be a great financial authoritv.,23
110,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"The question of his being a great financial authority does not concern me so much 'at the present time as does the desire that we should have as Chairman of the Council, in the first instance, a gentleman who would be able to act in a judicial capacity in laying down the precedure as between the States and the Commonwealth. The Chairman would be practically called upon to interpret the instrument upon which the authority had been established. I do not fail to realise that the very interpretation of the authorities under which he might be acting as a member of the Council, might conflict with his duties as a Justice of the High Court; but I feel impressed with the importance of having the whole machinery of the Council placed on such a sound and equitable basis as would commend it to the States individually, and to the people, of the whole Commonwealth. It is absolutely necessary that we should have an impartial and judicial chairman.",23

118,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That is where we require a council. - Mr KNOX - The financial circle in Lona don is a very limited one, notwithstanding that we find there the greatest financial centre in the world. A few men- a few firn.s-practically control the whole of the financial operations of the market. The Treasurer must know from experience that these large financial operations are exin tended over a number of rriarkets, and that the Colonial market is handled the by a few astute, able gentlemen-mostl y Scotchmen-wh o might be interviewed in the course of an afternoon. Our reprenot sentative in London would be in constant touch with these men, and if he were in need of advice or guidance would merely have to send for them. They would be only too glad to give him the information and assistance he sought, knowing that the ness which he contemplated would necessarily fall to them. As the Treasurer is aware, the Bank of England acts for one of the States in the matter of the flotation of loans, and the London and Westminster Bank acts for Victoria and other States.",24

122,Mr KNOX,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"My honourable friend must remember that even if we appointed the highest competent financial authority as High Commissioner, he would find Court life too short to allow of his breaking down the general system on which great financial operations in London are conducted. The prospect of his breaking through their. would be alto1 gether too remote to allow of his attempting The High Commissioner, whoever he may be, will have to seek advice assistance in the projection of any large loan. Let me remind the House of the position in regard to the last Victorian loan floated in London. The men who underwrote that loan are still carrying a very large proportion of it. It has not been dithe people have not absorbed it, and the underwriters consequently have not been able to get rid of it. The Victorian Government pay a certain commission amounting, I think, to \ per cent, to the London and Westminster Bank, and another commission of \ per cent, has also to be paid , while an agreement 1 is usually made to grant the underwriters discount of, say, 5 or 6 per cent., according to the state of the market. While I think that the office of the High Commissioner will be the centre of all Australian financial operations for many years to come, that official will be unable to ignore the conditions at present obtaining London. He will still have to make use of existing agencies there to assist him in flotation of our loans. Some honourable members entertain the idea that we can dispense with the aid of the banks, but I do share that opinion. We shall require their assistance for very many years. I do hope that at the outset it will be possible to devise some method by ""which we can utilize the services upon this Council of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Ausbusitralia, although I am aware that n.any objections can be urged against the fied adoption of that course. The Treasurer has questioned me as to the . funchim tions of. this tribunal. He wishes to know whether it is to be merely an advisory board or a body possessed of authoritative great Goschen conversion. powers. I have designedly termed it a ""Council"" of Finance, because a Council is an advisory body. But I would point out that it must possess specific executive authority, and it will be necessary to endow with originating powers in respect of future loans. It will not be long before New South Wales and Victoria will require undertake further conversions. Within the vidual State, and upon prospects of appre next three, five, or seven years loans will ciation. mature which will require to be rearranged. Of course we are all aware that, practically, national loans are never liquidated, because new investors merely take the place of the old bond-holders. I repeat that the authority must primarily be of ah advisory character.

""That statement is the more to appreciated because there appears to have been some doubt as to whether any authority was conferred by the Constitution for establishment of an Agricultural Department under Commonwealth auspices, and the honourable and learned member has been good enough to present to us what I conceive to be a very fair and clear exposition of the law relating to the powers of this Parliament. I think,, too, that his history of the development of agriculture is deserving of the attention of honourable members.

It is true the honloss orable and learned member for Bendigo indicated that he did not wish the Commonwealth to launch out upon the same large scale as have the United Statesand I would point out, however, that in connection with' all new departments there is a. strong tendency to increase exthe penditure, to amplify the scope of the work, and to create and multiply, the reasons for its extension. I think, that we might achieve .the end the honourable and learned member, has in view by means of the alterproposal presented in the Opposition Alliance' programme,, namely, by the establishment of a Standing: Committee of Trade and ' Agriculture. No great expense would be involved, and I believe that a Committee would accomplish much more than the honourable and learned member contemplates-. It would be able to take steps in the direction of. promoting not our primarv industries, but also our secondary industries, and, by harmonizing order the work, in these directions, attain better results, than could be achieved by a special to authority created to deal solely with agricultural matters. Almost at the outset of the consideration of this question, we are called, upon to recognise that the States have already devoted a large amount of and money to the development of their agriculpertural resources, and that in almost everv State there is a Department of Lands and also Agriculture, supplemented by agricultural may colleges, agricultural, farms,- laboratories, and other aids to landed pursuits. Unsparbe ing, efforts have been made to promote the primary industries of the States by the States themselves, and I do not think that we the should be justified in taking over; at. one sweep, the whole of the work performed; for the most part very well, by these Departments. Although in this respect toria may not be quite so far advanced as are some of the other States, much ful work has been done, and great benefits have been conferred upon our agrian culturists. Under these circumstances, seems to me that possibly it would be better to endeavour to bring about a sion of the work between the States the Commonwealth under such conditions as would prevent any conflict between two authorities, and yield greater benefits than are conferred upon, our producers the present time. I think the States be asked to continue to perform a very large portion of the work they are doing, and that they might also be called about, then. upon to furnish to the Commonwealth authority, however constituted, informawould tion as to the areas of land availbutter able - for settlement, the the soil, and the purposes for which such land might be used. They might also prepare for the use of the central authority information with regard to matters connected with water rainfall, irrigation, means of communication, facilities for transport, and the ness of the lands available to centres population, whether large or small. In my judgment, all these matters might very well be left to the States. The Commonof wealth must naturally deal with the ter more from the business point of view. It is our function to frame the Tariff, and to determine some at least of the conthat ditions under which agriculture shall be carried on. It is also our business to obtain information with regard to the markets, whether foreign for inter-State, available for our producers. The Honorcentral able and learned member for Bendigo pears to rely wholly upon foreign markets, but my aim would be to facilitate the operations of and offer to our prowith ducers as large a market as possible within our own boundaries. I believe . it par.t of the duty of the Commonwealth to afford all the information possible to our producers upon the subject of the markets available to them. It might also be garded as within our province to supply particulars with regard to means of transagement port, freight rates, and shipping conditions. All these are business matters with which Commonwealth could, deal. I read or heard it stated recently-I do not know whether by Dr Rowan, who has recently returned Mr Hume Cook. States from there, or by another-that a Govern1 Vicment guarantee is worth a great deal in the. South African market, and that American usemanufacturers have, to use their own term, ""scooped the pool""-that is, have found immense sale for their goods there, beit cause their importations, whether of meat, fruit, or other articles, have been branded diviand certified to toy the American Governand ment as of a certain quality. We, in Australia, have not yet devoted much attention the to such matters as branding, packing, and a Government certificate; but it seems to me at that it would be a very good thing to have might a Commonwealth brand for our products. now Mr SALMON - It should not be left lying",26
134,Mr HUME COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I hope that it be better looked after than were the brands used on behalf of the Gocharacter of vernment of Victoria.,27
135,Mr TUDOR,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"The Victorian brand must have been regarded as of value, or exall porters would not have taken the trouble supply, to try to duplicate it.",27
136,Mr HUME COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"The fact that there nearwas bad management in regard to the exof port of Victorian butter does not detract from the inherent goodness of the scheme. On the scientific side, there are a number n,atters which the Commonwealth might mattake in hand. 1 acknowledge that some of the States laboratories have done an immense amount of good work, but I think original research in connection with the preservation of products, the right use of manures, fertilization, and cross-fertilization, variation of crops, and other scientific questions would be better undertaken by a Commonwealth Department. If that apwere done, the Governments of the States would attend to matters which are purely local, while the Commonwealth would deal matters of wider concern, such as the markets and facilities for transport on the is business side, and with original research and analysis, on the lines I have indicated, on the scientific side. An investigation of methods of preservation of produce might rewell be undertaken by the Commonwealth, more especially in connection with the manof the cool storage arrangements of the shipping companies, and the general the regulations respecting shipping and transport. I think that the Department might go a little further, and endeavour on behalf of producers to prevent the severe losses which now occur in the export of Australian produce to London, by establishing there a receiving agent, under the High Commissioner, or some other duly constituted authority, who would look after goods as they arrived. The Agent-General for Victoria, it is stated in today's newspaper, has made ,that suggestion.",27
137,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,He made it some months ago.,28
138,Mr HUME COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"It did not come under my notice until this morning, though personally I have advocated the proposal for some time. I think that it would pay handsomely to appoint such an agent, London being our chief market. Goods might be sent to him, and their sale might be managed and controlled by him. This, and the other matters of which I speak, are subjects for the investigation of Commonwealth officials, who would obtain the latest information, and disseminate it amongst those who are engaged in our various industries. Turning to another phase of the question, I wish to say that I have experienced the greatest satisfaction from reading the publications of the Agricultural Departments of Victoria, and more especially of New South Wales, which contain a vast fund of information on a great variety of topics, and I have obtained from them a great deal of useful knowledge in regard to fruit-growing, in which I am more particularly interested. If the collection and publication of this information could be centralized and co-ordinated, it would be of incalculable advantage fo all who are interested or concerned in the industries to which it relates. A central Commonwealth Department might also deal very advantageously with new primary industries. Victoria has made various intermittent experiments in this direction, in. connection with such industries as tobacco growing, scent farming, and silk culture; but I do not think that those experiments were backed up by the latest scientific knowledge obtainable, or that the best areas were chosen in which to carry them cut. Had there been a central Commonwealth Department to give up-to-date and reliable information to all Australia, the probabilities are that new industries of permanent benefit would have been established. We have heard a great deal about the wisdom and necessity of growing cotton in Australia. I have no great knowledge on the subject, though I have a sincere desire to see something done in that direction; but were I thinking of engaging in the industry I should like to be assured by - such a competent and reliable authority as a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture should be, that I could obtain from it the latest information as to methods of production, and could learn how to successfully conduct my operations. I mention the cotton growing industry only by way of example, because the possibility of increasing our primary industries is almost unlimited. Silk growing is another industry which might be established here. It is a domestic industry, in a sense, and, if one may believe all that is written about it, an exceedingly profitable one, which would enable numbers of persons whose capital is limited to obtain a good livelihood. Now, the motion has been admirably debated from almost every point of view, and 1 should hardly have ventured to occupy time in discussing it had I not wished to em= phasize the need for a division of labour in this matter between the States and the Commonwealth, so that we may achievewhat we desire without friction or overlapping. I ask the House to proceed cautiously, by the adoption of some such proposal as that of the Opposition for a standing committee of trade and agriculture.",28
139,Sir JOHN QUICK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That would be only an advisory board. ' Mr HUME COOK - What is intended is something more than an advisory board. We wish* to do something of permanent benefit for those connected with the primary industries of this country, without excessive or unnecessary expenditure, and without conflict with the States.",28
140,Mr STORRER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,On e Commonwealth Department would be cheaper than six State Departments.,28
141,Mr HUME COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Yes ; but until we have persuaded the States to transfer to the Commonwealth what they are now doing in regard to agriculture, which we cannot do off-hand, we had better undertake operations of which the States approve, and in regard to which we n.ay expect their co-operation. The proposed Standing Committee would, in the first place, take cognizance of our trade relationships, and would deal, not only with agriculture, but with all the industries of Australia, endeavouring to build up, not merely our primary industries, but also our secondary_ and manufacturing industries. We should avoid over-specialization, and the notion that it is only in foreign markets that we can sell our products. The Committee would do this work in a thorough and reliable fashion, and would give those who are now engaged in industries, as well as those who are thinking of embarking in them, information both accurate and scientific. We need more population, but it is utterly idle for us to endeavour to secure further settlement upon the lands unless we can assure those who settle on them that there will be a ready and profitable sale for the goods they will produce. That is, of course, a truism; but if we are to do the right thing by Australia, we shall require to attract population of two classes-thos e who are to be primary producers, and those to be engaged in manufactures and secondary industries: If this is to be done, we shall need the inter-Sfate markets of which I have spoken; but with these requirements satisfied, and such incontrovertible scientific information as this Department would collect, given to our agriculturists, we should be alble to proceed with the work with satisfaction to ourselves and satisfaction to those for whom we are about to legislate.",28
142,Mr SALMON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," After the very admirable series of speeches which have been delivered on this question, very little remains to be said; but I have so great an interest in this subject, believing it to be the most important that, could be considererTiby the Parliament, that I desire to make a few observations in regard to it. I should like, first of all, to express the gratitude I feel to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo for the manner in which he submitted the motion. In introducing it he gave not only the House, but the whole country, information of a far-reaching and valuable character, and placed'it on a plane so far above party considerations that it may be considered with no other object in view than that of the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. When the proposal has been brought to a successful issue, as I hope it will be in the near future, I trust that the efforts of the honourable and learned member will be remembered with gratitude by the whole of the people. It was pointed out by the honourable and learned member that it was not his desire that the Commonwealth should launch into anything like so great an undertaking as is the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America. Although he quoted telling instances of the magnificent assistance which the bureau has given to the advancement of the United - States, he wisely recognised that it would be better for the Commonwealth to found the Department on moderate lines, and to allow it to grow as the needs of the Commonwealth should direct. In the United States of America over 1,000,000 per annum are spent in connection with the work of the Agricultural Bureau, and the Federal Government do not look for any immediate return from this outlay. They realise that the value received from it filters back through so many channels-man y of them wholly unobserved-that it would be unwise, and, indeed, useless, to attempt to make any computation of the actual gain derived. I think that we can best follow in their steps if we profit by our knowledge of the enormous waste in this direction which is at present occurring in the Commonwealth. The laudable efforts made by the Agricultural Departments of the several States have resulted, and are resulting, in very substantial progress, but the saving in energy and money which would be made if the work were brought under Commonwealth authority would more than justify the adoption of the motion,, and action being immediately taken upon it. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in enumerating the various branches of work carried out by the Agricultural Bureau of the United States of America, dealt with them in such a way as would appeal, I think, even to those who have had no connection whatever with the agricultural industry of Australia. But I prefer rather to call attention to the good work that might be accomplished by a fusion of the forces at present operating in the Commonwealth, and to the saving of expenditure which might in that way be effected. I need only point to one matter in which uniform action would be of immense value. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent within the last few years by the several States in endeavouring to secure an effective system of quarantine; but the work could be carried out to much greater advantage by a central authority. I need only allude, to the disastrous outbreak, known as tick fever which attacked' the herds of Queensland a few years ago, to recall to the minds of honourable members the enormous losses which accrued to Australia as the result of an incomplete observance of the necessary precautions in regard to the quarantining of stock. From time to time, arbitrary lines were drawn by Queensland; but after the precautions laid down by regulations had been observed for a certain time, alterations in the boundary lines were made for some reason or other, and, in short, marked inefficiency was shown in carrying out what otherwise would have been a verylaudable and desirable work. ""Varying regulations were also drawn up by New South Wales and Victoria to cope with the same outbreak. The southern States were affected by it in no small degree, and had to take precautions against the introduction, not only of infected stock, but also of infected hides from the northern State. dealing with this pest, there was a great waste of. effort, and even - if the Commonwealth took over only this branch, a great saving would be secured. I need not allude to the various insect pests from which the orchards and cultivated lands of Australia have suffered from time to time, nor to the different measures which have been taken by the several States to deal with them. These pests have had a marked effect upon our markets abroad, and the fruit industry, of Victoria more especially, has suffered seriously owing to the want of a proper uniform system of dealing with them. It seems to me that the Commonwealth 'Department now proposed to be created would be able to do much which individual State agencies cannot do in opening up foreign markets. We ought to have not only in the United Kingdom, but on the Continent, and especially in the Far East, accredited agents thoroughly familiar with all our branches of production, and prepared to open up markets, not for the benefit of a single State, but for the advancement of the whole Commonwealth. At present the representatives of the different States frequently come into competition with each other. We know perfectly well that when competition between commercial travellers takes place, one invariably proceeds to praise his own particular line, and to decry the products of his competitor, and such proceedings jOn the part of the representatives of the different States cannot fail to have a very bad effect upon the products of the Commonwealth as a whole. We require to send representatives of the whole Commonwealth abroad, whose business it will be not to take advantage of the misfortune of anv one State, but to endeavour to open, up markets for the producers of Australia as a whole. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo dealt at length with the matter of transport, and I would remind the House that in Victoria we have recently had an illustration of what may be done, and what ought not to be done in regard to transport arrangements. The Department which it is proposed .to create would undertake the work of making transport arrangements for our produce its own special care. We should then have an assurance of a regular system of transport, of which aid our producers would be able .to take full advantage, instead of their being placed entirely at the mercy of those who trade upon the seas. Arrangements In in regard to freights could be made much more advantageously by the Commonwealth than by the individual States. Hitherto the States which have been doing a large business with the great ocean-going steam-ship companies, have been able to secure much better terms than have the smaller States. Tasmania, for example, has not been nearly so well treated as has the larger State of Victoria, and Queensland has also had some very grave cause for complaint in this regard. Under a Commonwealth system this varying treatment would be abolished. We should have uniform rates, the producers of the Commonwealth would be placed on an equal footing, and we should get rid of 'that cut throat competition which has had such prejudicial effects upon our primary industries. There is no doubt that those who have settled upon our lands are in need of assistance. I entirely approve of the suggestion that we should endeavour to secure the settlement of a great population, provided that we take care to place the people on land which will yield them a livelihood, but I am specially anxious in regard to those who are already settled on it. We have primary producers who stand at the very forefront of their calling for laborious industry, and for the intelligent handling of their land and its products, and it seems to me that it should be our aim to assist them by giving them advice with regard to the constituents of the soil which they are endeavouring to work, and as to the products for which it is best suited. I have to admit, with deep regret, that in Victoria we have lagged far behind so far as this matter is concerned, but in Queensland a magnificent system is in force, 1 under which chemistry is brought into the very home of the farmer. An opportunity is afforded him to obtain information regarding the nature of the soil which he tills such as, I venture to say, is ngjt given in any other State in the union. I should like the Commonwealth to take up this work, and to establish laboratories all over Australia, so that those engaged in tilling the soil may be able to obtain full information as to what can best be produced on their land. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House, because I feel that we are all at one as to the desirableness of carrying this morion. It is only because of the deep interest which I take in agriculture, having been connected with it from my earliest youth, that I venture to address myself to the question. It is our bounden duty not merely to pass the motion, but to impress upon the Government the necessity to take active steps to carry it into effect. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo and those who have so ably followed him have expressed a desire that this matter should be treated as one of the very first importance. It affects every member of the community. It affects the city worker just as intimately as it does the individual upon the land, because the former is one of the first to benefit from the increased production which the adoption of improved methods of agriculture insures. The individual who resides at Port Darwin is just as much interested in these matters as is the resident of the southern extremity of Tasmania. Therefore, I feel that' the . Government should not be permitted to allow this motion to be relegated to the limbo of forgotten resolutions, but that there should be some practical outcome of this most interesting and instructive debate, in the direction of placing the producers of the Commonwealth, and those who are dependent upon them for their food supplies, in a very much better position than they occupy at the present time.",29
143,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"New England) There is no doubt that this motion is one of very great interest to the people of this country, because upon our primary productions our prosperity must, to a very large extent, depend. Whether the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture, by combining the existing State Departments, would prove a greater success than have the latter institutions themselves, is a question which can only be determined by experience. Personally, I do not hold the opinion that we always derive the very best results from centralization. If each State of the union administered its Department of Agriculture in a proper manner, there can be no doubt that the farmer would be benefited verymaterial ly. In New South Wales most valuable object lessons have been afforded the producers by the Department of Agriculture-objec t lessons which should enable them to conduct their operations in future more successfully than they have done hitherto. For example, the Government farm at Wagga, which is situated in dry country, has produced by cultivation a very much larger yield of wheat than have the surrounding farms. Upon the outside farms the wheat was sown broadcast, and weeds were permitted to grow up with it, whereas upon the Government farm the seed was sown by means of drills, and the weeds were kept down. The result was that the extra yield considerably more than compensated for the additional amount of work involved. In this way Government farms feave afforded object lessons to our agriculturists regarding the best methods of production. Of course, we are frequently assured that we need a large population, and there is no doubt that we do. If we numbered a few more millions we should not constantly need to trouble ourselves about the development of our manufactures. These would develop themselves. Our difficulty is that we have not a sufficient demand for that which we can produce, and until we secure the necessary population, we shall always experience that trouble. Sometimes I feel amused when I hear honourable members clamouring about the necessity for obtaining foreign markets for our produce, because these very gentlemen are constantly condemning the importation of foreign products. They frequently counsel the Government to send commercial travellers into the Far East, and to every other portion of the earth, for the purpose of gaining trade for Australia, and to enable us to dispose of our products there. If they understand anything about trade relations they must know that if foreign countries purchase our goods, we must be satisfied to accept their products in return. If we sell our commodities to the despised races of the East, we must import the goods of these cheap labour countries in return. I say at once that we must trade everywhere, but it is amusing to listen to the arguments advanced by some honourable members in favour of the development of a great trade outside our own borders. If the individuals to whom I refer advocated the retention of all our own products, so as to exclude those of other countries, I could understand their position. Surelv they must recognise that there is only one way of obtaining payment for our exports, namely, by accepting imports in exchange. I have heard a good deal recently in reference to the hard cash which we have to pay away.",31
144,Mr WILKS,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I should like to see a little of it.,32
145,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"So should I . I have heard it stated that the British Empire pays away £800,000,000 annually in hard cash for its imports. The gentlemen who talk like that cannot understand that when England exports goods it must accept the goods of other countries in return. If the value of her imports exceeds that of her exports the difference represents ""so much profit to her.",32
146,Mr JOHNSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,T-A large proportion our exports represents interest upon loans.,32
147,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I have heard something to the effect that if Great Britain offers Australia some trade advantages, our loyaltv is so great that we are prepared to concede her similar advantages, but not otherwise. Yet individuals like myself have been charged with dislovalty. sonally, I am in favour of the establishment of a Department of Agriculture. believe in giving the primary producers every assistance, but I should like those who advocate the development of foreign markets to realise that if we do a large trade with Japan, or with any other country, we must accept its goods in exchange. cannot obtain gold from them. We are producers of gold. If we send our wool, or wheat, to Japan, we must accept goods from that country in return.",32
148,Mr JOHNSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Good s are paid for by goods.,32
149,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Of course they are. There are many ways in which the farmers can be assisted. In this connection I read two very good articles which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Saturday last.,32
150,Mr STORRER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,That journal does not know everything.,32
151,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Thos e articles dealt with the question of the advancement of agriculture. They contained extracts from scientific contributions upon the subject. One extract described how the productiveness of land can be wonderfully improved by means of bacteria. It explained that the free nitrogen of the air can be attracted to the earth by means of bacteria. Scientists have succeeded in so developing these organisms, that they can be cultivated by the farmer for the purpose of enriching his soil. As honourable members are aware, nitrate manures are very expensive, but this method of increasing the productiveness of the land is a very inexpensive one. Incidentally I may mention that a German scientist formed a company to place this product upon the market, but soon ascertained that the bacteria did not successfully serve the purpose for which it was cultivated. A scientific agriculturist in America thereupon took the matter up, and.he has made of it a success. It now appears that the German scientist had treated his bacteria too well. He fed them too luxuriously, and likeall things which are being constantly supported, they did not properly discharge their functions. The American scientist, however, has developed in these of organisms a strength which has added to the. productiveness of the soil in the way that was desired. We sometimes indulge in too much ""coddling,"" and the bacteria cultivated by the German suffered in that way. I do not know that I need say much more upon this motion. I realise that anything which we can do to assist our agriPer- culturists, when they cannot assist themselves, is a step in the right direction. I Nevertheless, we ought to avoid any suggestion of too much ""coddling."" By so doing, we shall develop a better class of citizens. It is indisputable that industries which have been established without anv artificial aids, have flourished much better We than those which have been constantly afforded those aids in the form of State 3.s s 1 s t eince.",32
152,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I do not think that there is an honourable member of this House who does not sympathize with the object of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. Even the most anti-socialistic Governments in the past have exhibited a desire to ""coddle "" the farmer. Personally, I think that that coddling has been quite justifiable. It has been recognised that in Australia our conditions differ materially from those of the older parts of the world, so that it is necessary for would be agriculturists to unlearn the knowledge which they have acquired elsewhere. For some years, a large proportion of the farmers of New South Wales were engaged in sheep raising, and, consequently had no opportunity of studying the agricultural conditions obtaining in their own country. These circumstances, in my view, t if y to the full the efforts put forward by various Ministries in the past to inform our agriculturists of the latest and most scientific developments, and as to how far it is possible for them to adapt themselves to the conditions natural to Australia. I give way to no one in my anxiety to exercise the functions which we are called upon to discharge by the Constitution by the direct agency of the Federal ment. I believe that we should to .control, by the decision and action of the Federal Parliament, whatever has been handed'- over to us. This, however, is one of the matters that has not been handed over. Therefore, it seems to me that while in other respects we are not justified in attempting to shoulder the responsibility of the States Governments, we shall in this matter also, which has been largely retained in their control, be justified in seeking to co-operate with them rather than in attempting to supplant them. I think every one who has studied the growth of administrative Departments will admit that whenever a new Department is . established, there is danger of its functions and of an abnormal growth being encouraged, especially by the officers who are placed in control. ' They naturally seek to magnify the importance of the work in which, they are engaged, and the tendency of the Departments is to grow abnormally. This is especially the case where a Department is in charge of a Minister has not the tactical knowledge cessary to enable him not only direct' in the best possible work that is being engaged in, but also to check that desire for expansion which is so characteristic of public servants. feeling with regard to this specific proposal is that we do not need to overlap the work in which the States engaged. There are, however, ' some features of that work which I think could be managed more economically, much more satisfaction if they were under the control of one central authority. think that the States Governments very well be approached with a view to ascertaining how far they are prepared to authorize the Commonwealth-and plenty of power under the Constitution to enable them to do that-to take up that portion of the work which is not peculiar to one State, but common to.all:. I refer parMr Watson. ticularly to the encouragement and control jusof exports generally. So far as the analysis of the soil and the application of methods to particular conditions are concerned, I think that while the Agricultural Departments remain under the control of the States such matters may very well be left to them. Local conditions differ so much throughout Australia that it would be unwise for us, at the present stage of development anyhow, to attempt to take over Parlia- general control of the Agricultural Departattempt ments as they exist in the various States: Whilst very temporarily occupying office some time ago, I had brought under my consideration the suggestion put forward by the Victorian Agent-General a few months ago in regard to establishing a Federal depot in London. Whilst circularizing the various States Premiers, with respect to the office of High Commissioner, I took advantage of Mr Taverner's suggestion to lay before them the possibility of their allowing the Federal authorities, in conjunction with the High Commissioner's office, to take' in hand the matter of controlling the disposal of the exportable produce of Australia. I dare say that by this time my overlapping, successor will have formed some idea of the feeling of the States authorities in that regard. Perhaps, however, it may be one of the matters that the Prime Minister' proposes to discuss at his conference with the States Premiers, which I understand is to be held in February next. It seems t'o me. in that regard there is the possibility, with' who the assistance of the States Governments, ne- of substantially helping the producers of to Australia. It appears to me to be a mistake way the to permit exhibits of Australian produce to be scattered over the metropolis of the world - the metropolis, at least, so far as the My markets of the world are concerned-and that it would be a great advantage if these exhibits could be concentrated under the are control of some central authority, with a continuous idea as to the line of policy to be pursued. With that authority from the and with States, we might go a great deal further than is - now proposed with respect to the I disposal of our produce. Sufficient evimight dence has been adduced in connection with the Butter Commission in Victoria to convince honourable members and the community there is generally that there is need for some better and more effective method of supervision, not only in regard to butter, but, over every commodity we send from Australia.",32
153,Mr HUME COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Every perishable product, at least. '",33
154,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Exactly . Possibly it wasbecause butter is a perishable product that matters were arranged to the advantage of' the middleman in the fashion indicated by. the evidence given, before the Commission. I certainly think that the Commonwealth, could undertake, the general supervision of all our .exports, insist that proper brands and proper descriptions shall be used, and that the grading-of those which permit of grading-shal l be done in such a way as to facilitate their disposal. I would go to the full extent of appointing a State agent, and doing away with the middleman altogether so far as these perishables are concerned. I do not suppose that all honourable members will concur in the idea that we should attempt, per medium of State or Federal officials, to eliminate the middleman as between the producer and the consamer. But, personally, I should be prepared to go any distance in' that direction with a view to insure that the producer should get the full - value of what he is able to export. I am quite in sympathy with the general object of the motion, but I should not care to have it thought that 'we were going to establish a Department of Agriculture in regard to which there would be a risk of our overlapping the various Departments of the States.",34
155,Sir JOHN QUICK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I carefully guarded myself on that point in my opening speech, in which I urged that there should be no duplication. That would be a matter for the Government to arrange.",34
156,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I quite. admit. that. 'Having that always in. view, I think there pan be no harm in passing the motion. The question whether we should establish a Department, pure and simple, is a matter for detailed consideratiori later on. meantime I would strongly commend to the Government the necessity of endeavouring to make some arrangement with the States in regard to this matter, which has not been specifically handed over to us, with a view to facilitating, so far as we can, the dis. posal of our products in the mother country.",34
157,Mr LEE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"- I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion, which I think is a step dn the right direction. Department of Agriculture, under the control of the Commonwealth, would be in a position to afford very valuable assistance to cur farmers. In New South Wales we have agricultural farms, by means of which information of a technical and practical character is furnished to our settlers. Of course, the work carried on at these institutions ds of an experimental character, and no farmer could afford to carry on his operations upon quite the same expensive lines. They are of value, however, in so far that farmers can see for themselves the way in which work should be done. In the same way that in our technical schools youths are taught the right way in which to proceed about their work - to saw a piece of wood, or to mark out a line-so our farmers are taught, through the instrumentality of experimental farms, . to appreciate the advantage of carrying on their operations according to the most approved methods. Whilst we are considering this subject; we must pay due attention to the fact that our farmers- I speak more particularly of New South Wales-objec t to any State interference in carrying out their work. They are averse to the coddling to which some honourable members have referred, and desire to work out their own salvation. They have hewn out their own pathway to success so far, and all they expect is the assistance of the States in affording them ready and cheap access to the markets of the world. A Commonwealth Department of Agriculture would prove ot # great benefit by working in that direction. 1 I do not for a moment wish to say one word against the methods adopted by the Victorian Government to encourage the dairying industry. No doubt the butter bonus gave a great impetus to dairy farming in Victoria. In New South Wales, however, our dairymen, without any such stimulus, have been able to hold their own and have placed their products upon the world's markets with results quite as satisfactory as those which have attended exportations from Victoria. In the Mr WATSON - Our butter does not bring such a high price as that produced in New - Zealand, where the closest State supervision is exercised.",34
158,Mr LEE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"In - New Zealand they have a d'rastic and very beneficial Dairy Act. I am a strong believer in co-operation, and T am sure that the revelations which have been made in connection with the ButterCommission ' will prove a strong incentive to the A dairy farmers of the Commonwealth lo apply the co-operative principle to a far greater extent in connection with their factory operations, with a view to controlling the industry from the stage at which the eream is separated from the milk until the butter is disposed of in the markets of the world. In New South Wales the co-operative principle has been adopted to a very large degree, and the dairy farmers - there recently decided to conduct their own export business, thereby entirely dispensing with middlemen. I believe that the Victorian dairy farmers will take to heart the lessons taught by the Butter Commission, and adopt a similar course.",34
159,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,There is Export Board in New South Wales.,35
160,Mr LEE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Yes . When the present Prime Minister came into office as Premier of New South Wales, he appointed an Export Board, not for the purpose of supervising or interfering with the export of produce, but with a view to opening up markets, instructing exporters as to the best methods to be adopted, and cheapening freights for thenx. That board in its early days did yeoman service, but it broke down when those appointed to it were persons interested in these matters themselves. I am not a great believer in commercial agents. I know of one case in which a commercial agent telegraphed from Japan that there was a good market there for lead at so much a ton, but when the authorities made the information known to the persons interested in Australia, they said that they - were already supplying Japan at £ 1 a ton more. So far as the dairying industry is concerned, such agents give no assistance to the farmers, whose produce is purchased by persons who come out here from London, and make arrangements for the supply of the home market. What our farmers require are experts in whom they will have confidence, practical men who can show them where they are wrong, and what they should do to be right. I think, however, that the motion is a good one. .There should be no interference with the farmers; but they should be assisted with technical knowledge, which they cannot obtain for themselves, for the development of their industry. Similarly, - other industries, such as siik culture, which has been started on the Clarence River, and olive growing, might be assisted. At the present time, Queensland is using for the raising of cattle land which, if it were under cultivation by intel- correct in saying that ligent farmers, would be producing much more wealth than is obtained from it in its present stage of development. I shall support the motion.",35
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," The honourable members for Cowper and New England seem to be in favour of carrying the motion, but to' be opposed to ' putting it into operation. They wish the farmers to bt left alone. Every farmer in New South Wales, however, would be glad of the information which would be available to him from the experiments of a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. So far as I can see, the Commonwealth cannot deal with this an matter in its detailed branches without the concurrence of the States. If it did so, it would be against the Constitution; but a Federal Department of Agriculture, though the term is almost a misnomer, would be of assistance to our producers in finding markets for our produce outside Australia, and in giving them information as to the channels through which their produce could be best disposed of. In addition, it could inform them of new inventions, and give other information which would assist them. That is what the motion has in view, and therefore it is absurd for honourable members to ride the high horse, and to say that the farmers do not want anything. Some are, at times, very glad to accept seed-wheat and other assistance from the Governments of the States, and are quite justified in accepting it after the terrible series of droughts experienced; and they would be equally glad to obtain information from the Commonwealth which would enable them to increase their production of wheat, potatoes, bananas, or anything else. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo. wishes to establish a Department which will provide our farmers with information which, in their position of isolation, they cannot obtain for themselves. In Canada the work of the Federal Department extends to the work done by the States here. . It is a large Department, and does an immense amount of work. The last Prime Minister opened negotiations with the States to see if they would co-operate with us, and I hope that the present Prime Minister will dosomething more in the matter. If we have only SJtates Departments, one may act in one direction and one in another r but with one central Federal Department harmony of action can be secured. If the honourable member for Cowper is the farmersdo not require assistance, why does the Farmers' and Selectors' Association of New South Wales; which is at all times in correspondence with the Government, approach the Minister after their meetings, and ask for information and consideration ? The establishment of the Hawkesbury College, of the Wagga Agricultural Farm, of the Murray Viticultural Farm*, and of the other experimental farms which are scattered over the State, was due to the agitation of the farmers and selectors of Mew South Wales. At present the farmers can obtain information, not only in regard to agriculture, but also in regard to viticulture, horticulture, and other kindred subjects. The farmers require all the information they can get. The honourable member for New England, speaking of the Wagga Agricultural Farm, said that it produces more than could be produced from any other farm of its size, having the same class of soil. No doubt that is so; but it is because the farm has been worked on scientific lines by very able men. If , however, a farmer who was just commencing tried to work his farm on those lines, he would find it very expensive at first.",35
162,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Mr Valder told me that he could make the Waffga farm a commercial success, and could do better with it than was done by any farmer outside.",36
163,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I do not dispute the truth of that statement. be remembered, however, that that farm has now been in existence for many years. Although the soil is comparatively poor, and the climate dry' . experience has shown the r value of constant working. As a rule, farmers do not plough more than once, or, at most, twice, before sowing their crops; but Mr Valder and his successor have kept the land constantly moving in order to enrich it. Furthermore, they take advantage of the new machinery which is now obtainable for the drilling in of wheat. I represent probably the largest wheat-producing district in Australia, and, - during the last election, I was interested to find on many occasions that, where there were two fields of wheat similarly situated, and with the same soil, on opposite sides of the road, the crop which had been drilled in was sometimes producing two bags an acre more than that which had been sown broadcast. The use of phosphate manures has also increased our production. I should like to remark, however, that so-called manures are being sold to our farmers which are of no value at all, and the States Governments should take the duty. steps for the testing of all manure sold, lo prevent such imposition.",36
164,Mr WILSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Arrangement s for that have been made in Victoria.,36
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Complaint s are still being made in this State.,36
166,Mr WILSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,An amending Bill has been brought in.,36
167,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"It is very necessary to prevent spurious manures from being sold, because the farmers who use them not only lose their money, but their crops and time too.",36
168,Mr WILSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Sometime s half of these so-called manures is sand.,36
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I , therefore, would, strongly impress upon the Governments of the States the need for a thorough inspection and testing of manures. Let inspectors put their mark on manures which are to be sold to the general public.",36
170,Mr WILSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,That is to be done under the Victorian legislation.,36
171,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That is proposed. I believe. Competition is now so keen, and the price of wheat is sometimes so low, that it is essential that our producers should get good results, and they cannot do that if they obtain useless manures, whose vendors, if they know what they are selling, are nothing better than swindlers. I shall support the motion, and I urge"" the Prime MinI t must ister to see if it is not possible to get the States to co-operate with the Federal Government, in order that we mav have united action, that Government establishing a Department to deal with outside matters. I presume that this Department would obr tain information in regard to the latest and most improved agricultural machinery. During a debate in this House a few days ago, reference was made to the harvesters which are manufactured in Victoria, and which, although invented in this State, are also being made in other parts of the world. It seems to me that information that would enable the farmers to secure ""the best machinery of this kind at the cheapest rate would be of the greatest value to them. We know, as a matter of fact, that a class of harvesters which may be purchased in certain parts of the world at about £ 2 0 are imported to Australia and sold for something like .£70 or £ 8 0 each. That is an unreasonable profit for any one to make.",36
172,Mr JOHNSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,That is the result of,36
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"When we have a Tariff which will afford the manufacturers reasonable protection, such machinery will be locally produced at lower prices than those at which the imported implements are obtainable - 'The importers, supported by their strong financial position, can regulate - prices where there is no local competition, but as soon as we secure local competition under a good Tariff the price of agricultural machinery must decrease rather than increase.",36
174,Mr ROBINSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Harvester s are already being made in Victoria, and exported to all parts of the world.",37
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I believe that many are being exported to South America; but how is it that the industry is struggling at the present time?,37
176,Mr ROBINSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Nonsens e !,37
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"It is all very well for a young politician to "" poohpartment pooh "" such a statement, but I can prove it.",37
178,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I saw fortypartments; four trucks laden with harvesters leaving Melbourne a few days ago.,37
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I have seen many leaving Victoria, where the manufacturers were protected to a reasonable extent under the State Tariff, for New South Wales. hesitation Nearly the whole of the agricultural chinery, including ploughs, harrows, and other implements, used in my electorate come from this State. Under the system of protection which prevailed in Victoria, the farmers in my electorate knew that they could obtain good machinery here, and they were able-to buy it at a lower rate in New South Wales, where importers' ""rings:"" were operating. Mr LONSDALE.:-Nothin g of the kind.",37
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I have perhaps been led off the track by interjections, I am always ready to discuss the Tariff question. I desire, in conclusion, to emsuch phasize my opinion that the motion is of the greatest importance, and that on being passed it should' not be thrown the waste-paper basket, so to speak, that action should at once be taken to carry i i into 'effect. I trust that whatever vernment may be in power will not ignore the necessity to do something in this direcreadtion, and' to do it without delay.  press my sympathy with the object of the Government motion,, but I am inclined to think that as it stands it is not calculated to inspire confidence on' the part' of the States culture. or to secure that co-operatiori which we seek. My idea' is - that there should be some co-ODeration between the Governments of the States ando f the ComBendigo monwealth, and that the motionshould' so framed as to 'invite the Federal ment to call a conference of the Ministers of Agriculture in the various States to consider the advisableness of establishing a Federal Department of Agriculture.

181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Does the honourable member suggest that the wording of the motion will offend the States Governments?  the fact that to carry this motion into effect would be to establish a Commonwealth Deof Agriculture. The people of the States already complain that we are duplicating the work of some of their deand whilst I believe that there is some chance of our securing the cooperation of the States in this matter, I think it is necessary for us, at the present time, to approach them in a very gingerly fashion. At one time we might have had no in passing a motion of this k in d ; mabut judging by the opinions expressed by various States Ministers, they are not inclined to part with any of their powers. It must be admitted that we have no power under the Constitution to take over the States Departments of Agriculture, and we certainly should not seek to duplicate them. than We should, at all events, endeavour to make a satisfactory arrangement with the States Governments. If the amendment were worded as I suggest, throwing upon the Government the onus to bring the proposal under the direct notice of the States but Governments; and inviting a. conference, much better results would be secured. At a conference, the representative of the one Commonwealth would be in a position to its disabuse the minds of the States delegates in of any feeling that we desired to usurp but their powers, and in that way much good would be done - I do not propose to move Goan amendment, but I think it would be well to so amend the motion that it would That, in the opinion of. this House, the Federal at an early date should invite a Conference of the States Ministers of Agriculture for the purpose of considering the advisability of establishing a Federal Department of AgriThis would prevent any misconception as to our intentions on the part of the States.

I am not going to vote for the creation a Commonwealth Department of AgriculThe ture until some effort has been made to arrive at an amicable agreement with the that States. There is already too much duplithe cation of work in connection with the Detent, partments we have taken over, and it seems to me that, by consultation with the reprethey sentatives of the States Governments, we matters should be able to carry on some of our which Departments at a much lower cost present.

The very money necessary to enable us to create this Department will have to be kept back from the States. It seems to me that Commonwealth Department of Agriculture might be created to work in unison with those of the States, to their mutual advaninformation tage; but the honourable and learned mema ber's proposal suggests taking the bull the horns. It invites opposition on part of the States .before we take any acno tion. The people of the States are prepared to allow us to usurp any powers which we do not possess under the Constifriendly tution, and in these circumstances, although I am second to none in my desire to everything that is possible in the interests of the primary producers, I shall feel comthe six States. pelled to vote against the mo'.ioh as introduced.",38
183,Mr SKENE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I am in distinct sympathy with the view put ward by the leader of the Onposition and need be aroused. the honourable member for Grey, that we ought to utilize the States Departments Agriculture as much as possible. . When the - honourable and learned member for Bendigo first brought this proposal before the House, in 1901,. his motion was framed in a somewhat different form. ",38
184,Sir JOHN QUICK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That was more than three years ago, and yet there has been no objection on the part of the States.",38
185,Mr SKENE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That is so; but at that and time it appeared to me to be necessary to move such an amendment as has been indiof cated by the honourable member for Grey. amendment which I then moved wasThat the following words be added :- And11 steps should be taken to ascertain whether State Parliaments will co-operate to the exin the meantime, of placing the services of 1 their Agricultural Departments at the disposal of the Commonwealth Department, in so far as may be an aid to the carrying out of those appertaining - to agricultural interests, will shortly come under the exclusive conthan at trol of the Commonwealth."" members will recognise that the the amendment embodied a proposal on the very lines on which the honourable member The to motion now before us is so worded, however, that I think the course proposed may well precede any negotiations with the I am prepared, after careful consideration, to vote for it, as submitted, and I trust that the honourable'member for Grey ill yet see fit to support it. I hope he will that it is quite within our province, without giving any offence to the States, to say that we should now establish a Department of Agriculture. Having arrived at a that decision, we may then request the States Departments to assist us to focus the whole of their work, and the whole of the at their disposal. We may have Conference, if it be thought necessary; but by let us first decide to establish a Commonthe wealth Department of Agriculture.

186,Mr SKENE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"In establishing a central forbureau of this character, no antagonism I am quite"" in accord with the object of the honourable member for of Grey, but I do not think that the holding of a Conference need be antecedent to the adoption of a motion of this' character.",38
187,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I think that the honourable member for Grampians has taken the correct view in regard to the opinion of the honourable member for Grey. The latter has fallen into a slight error if he imagines that the adoption of this motion will be tantamount to establishing a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. In stead, it merely expresses an opinion in favour of the creation of such a Department. It is true that the establishment of that Department will follow as a practical step upon the expression of opinion by this - House. But there will be a sufficient interval between the two things to enable the Government to get into close touch with the Governments of the different States. As honourable members are aware, one of the leading features of the proposals of the present Government is a Conference with the Premiers of the States, with a view to discussing a number of matters of mutual concern-matter s in which, in some cases, the powers of one Government overlap those of the other. I am very sanguine that the overtures which have been made by the present Government will be received in the same friendly spirit in which they have been offered. When we speak of the "" Federal spirit "" we ought to remember that such a spirit involves a just recognition of the rights and powers of the States. Within their own jurisdiction they are just as independent Commonwealths as is the Commonwealth of Australia within its jurisdiction.",38
188,Mr FISHER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Who denies that ?,39
189,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Nobod y denies it, but the point is that we should all strive to act up to it. When we use such a term as "" Federal spirit,"" it should be interpreted to mean the most cordial and friendly desire to recognise the powers of the States, and to work in harmony with them in matters of mutual concern. That has been the motive, I think, of every other human being in the universe, and I am only desirous of adding that it is the motive of the present Government.",39
190,Mr FISHER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,As it was of the last vernment.,39
191,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I included them in the genetunity ral phrase "" every human being in the uniproposal, verse."" I thought that that was wide but no such protest has been entered. enough to include even the late Administradesire tion. Just as I desire to cultivate the most cordial relations with the other States, have no wish to disparage the efforts of previous Governments in the same direcafternoon tion. To the extent that I am following good example. I hope that my hands will be strengthened by those who have conthe trolled the Government in the past. Whether rightly or wrongly, there has been a great deal of sensitiveness on the part of the Governments of the States, and a number of complaints have been made, whether ill or well founded, as to the absence of such a disposition on the part of the Commonwealth Government. I do not for a moment suggest that such views are correct, but as a practical man, my anxiety is-irrespectiv e of whether they are correct or not-to endeavour to remove them. If I thought that this motion was objectionable in any way, I should certainly advise the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to modify it. But I see nothing in it to which anybody can take exception. I accept i i as the Minister of Trade arid Customs did at the beginning of this able arid valuable discussion. The Government accept it as entirely in a line with, perhaps, the greatest work which any Government can perform. It is one phase, and a very important one, of one of the most useful opportunities which can present themselves to a Federal Government. But, feeling deeply that any work of a Federal character which overlaps State jurisdiction will be imperfect unless there is a cordial co-operation between the two authorities, we should use every effort in our power to bring about that harmonious action. I heartily assent to this resolution, and I hope that in the few minutes remaining before the dinner adjournment the House will be able to agree to it.",39
192,Sir JOHN QUICK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I have no desire to make an address in the nature of a reply, because the time at our disposal is nearly exhausted, and I should like honourable memrjers to be afforded an opportunity of coming to a vote upon this matter. This motion has now stood upon the business paper practically for three years. Public attention has been directed to it, and honourable members have had an opportunity of listening to the arguments which have been Goadvanced in its favour. The States Governments have also been afforded an opporof entering their protest against the if they had thought fit to do so, I to express my warmest recognition of the manner in which the resolution has been I received, and especially of the sympathetic support which has been accorded to it this by the leader of the Opposition a and the Prime Minister. It is a motion which all may join in supporting, subject to qualifications which have been expressed upon both sides of the House, and subject to the common desire that, in establishing such a Department, we should avoid duplication and work in harmony with the States Governments to foster those primary industries which are the backbone of Australian prosperity.

194,Mr CARPENTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Why not take the business in .the order in which it appears upon the paper?,40
195,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I would point out to the honourable member that only one-half an ordinary sitting remains to us, and I do not think we could dispose of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill within that period, although I am of opinion that we should be able to finish consideration of the Papua Bill.",40
196,Mr CARPENTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"We could deal with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, and afterwards proceed with the consideration of the Papua Bill.",40
197,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I see no chance of doing that to-night.,40
198,Mr CARPENTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH, I think that the Prime Minister ought not to treat the Bill authorizing the survey of the Transcontinental Railway in the unfair way that he proposes.,40
199,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,It is rather early to accuse me of unfairness. I do not intend to play with that measure. I wish to put it through this House when I take it up.,40
200,Mr CARPENTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That Bill has stood at the head of the business-paper for some time pasf-if we except the Estimates-and consequently it should be the next business considered. The* Government have already adjourned it to allow private members to occupy iGovernment time in discussing a Bill to which the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues are bitterly opposed. When we find that that is the case, we have a right to complain. As the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill stands first upon the business paper, and as no question of importance in it remains to be decided 5 °5",40
201,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I know a great deal more of that than does the honourable member.,40
202,Mr CARPENTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Outsid e of one amendment, of which notice has been given, there is no reason why the measure in question should provoke very much discussion. I repeat that there is every prospect that we should be able to get the Bill through Committee this evening, and then we could devote the remainder of the sitting to the consideration of the Papua Bill. The Prime Minister would have consulted the interests of honourable members, and particularly of those who represent Western Australia, if He had allowed the orders of the day to be dealt with as they stand on the business-paper.",40
203,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I would point out to the honourable member that this is an emergency which Has arisen entirely owing to an accident which occurred last evening. I quite admit the responsibility of the Government for keeping a House together, and, as some of us were neglecting our duty last night, perhaps we deserve to be punished for it. We wish to resume the consideration of the Estimates to-morrowmorning, and as I the came to the conclusion that we could not dispose of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill 'this evening I thought we could probably make the best use of the two or three hours still remaining at our disposal by practically completing the consideration of the Papua Bill. I can assure the honourable member that my desire is just as strong as is his to see the measure to which he has referred passed through this House and sent on to the other Chamber.

204,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," This is a clause which I overlooked on the last occasion. It is of no great importance. It simply provides that the Executive Council shall not proceed to the despatch of business unless summoned by authority of the Lieutenant Governor. ""Then provision is made for a quorum. The provision is similar to that contained in all Constitutions, whether of self-governing or Crown Colonies. Clause agreed to. Postponed clause 281.

So long as the white resident population is less than 2,000 the number of non-official members shall be three; but when the white resident population is 2,000 or more an additional non-official member shall be appointed for each 1,000 of such population in excess of 1,000. Provided that the total number of non-official members shall not exceed twelve. 4.

205,Mr MCDONALD,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," 1 desire to amend the clause so as to provide that the three non-official members of the Legislative Council shall be elected by the white residents. The Legislative Council is to consist of the members of the Executive Council, which is to comprise not less than six persons, to be appointed 'by the Governor General, and of three non-official members. ""I do not know the exact number of white residents in the Territory at the present time, but in view of the dissatisfaction that exists among them, and the manner in which the affairs of the Territory have been administered, I think it is only right that they should have some direct representation in the Legislative Council.

I move That all the words in sub-clause 2 after the word "" as,"" line 6, be left out, sert in lieu thereof the words "" may be elected at any election by adult suffrage of the white resident population.""",41
206,Mr KELLY,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I hope the Committee will not adopt the amendment. Our first duty is to protect the natives of New Guinea; and, as their interests may in many cases conflict with those of the white residents, I .think that it is undesirable that we should provide for the direct representation of the latter in the Legislative Council. Upon the drink question, for instance, as upon this, the interests of the white residents might be absolutely opposed to those of the natives; and we must hold steadily in view the necessity of protecting the natives as far as possible.",41
207,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment. I hope the time will come when some form of election, will be used in connection with the government of this interesting dependency, but as matters stand we have to remember that the great mass of""the people in Papua belong to the native race, and are subject in many respects to the domination of a few white people. We all know that where a small number of white people are living under white institutions with a very large number of black people, the questions which arise between the blacks and the white's often involve a conflict between,, the direct money interests of the whitesj and the just rights of the blacks. In view of the enormous preponderance of the. black population, none of whom will be allowed to take part in the proposed election, I do not think we should adopt the elective principle. The main object of the Government is to exercise the most beneficent influence upon the natives.",41
208,Mr CROUCH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Can the right honourable gentleman furnish us with any example of the way in which the United States or Canada have dealt with similar cases'? Mr Reid' - I am very sorry I cannot do so. It would be very interesting to follow'out the development of cases in which a similar state of affairs has existed, but I am afraid that even if we studied such valuable precedents as 'might thus be presented, we should find that, a number of features in Papua were quite different from those existing in the countries referred to. The white people in New Guinea constitute practically a white aristocracy, and my feeling is that it would not be wise to give them too much power over the immense with a view to inblack population.",41

210,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I do not regard the matter in that light - I look upon this measure as making a start in regard to a very difficult subject, - and I look forward to the time when we shall greatly improve on the Constitution provided for in the Bill. I do not see my way to accept the elective principle at the beginning of this experiment; although it may be worthy of consideration later on. In starting this dependency, I think .that it is safer for us to follow the lines which"" have been carefully thought out by two previous Governments.",41
211,Mr WEBSTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,We are legislating in the dark on this question.,41
212,Mr R,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"EID - That is a difficulty which attends almost any new departure. I should like to mention the latest figures relating to the white and black population of the Territory. According to the Australian Year-Booh, there are 500 white residents in British New Guinea, and 460,000 blacks. In the light of these figures, I cannot recognise the claim of the white population to any special representation which is denied to the half-million of blacks. The theory of the Ministry isand I hope that effect will always be given to it-that the interests of the black people of this Territory shall be safeguarded by a paternal Government. In maintaining our sway over these uncivilized blacks, it would be an odious thing to regard the Government as anything but their friend and protector.  that it has been otherwise.",42
213,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Yes , and the manner in which the blacks have been treated by the dominant whites, constitutes some of the worse pages in history. We can easily conceive that representatives elected by the white elite, whose business interests may often conflict with the welfare of the black races, might really form a body antagonistic to the general interests of trie population. If the few white residents in British New Guinea were granted three representatives in the Legislative Council, they would possess an enormous power. Further, the white population consists merely of birds of passage. No white man settles in New Guinea with the idea of spending his whole lifetime there. I quite appreciate the motive of the honourable member for Kennedy. This Bill , however, follows the lines of all British precedents in the way of colonization, and marks the first stage in an experiment which is surrounded with very great difficulty. I would further point out that the officials have no business interests, as opposed to the interests of the natives, whereas the traders have:",42
214,Mr MCDONALD,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,It is the officials against whom I wish to guard.,42
215,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,If the officials are worthy' of their positions they will not be objectionable.,42
216,Mr MCDONALD,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,The Prime Minister has seen what has taken place from time to time.,42
217,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I have read of one regrettable occurrence, amidst untold instances of humane treatment by the authorities. We know of only one instance of a lapse of judgment, which led to deplorable consequences. An emergency arose which tried the presence of mind of an unfortunate man beyond his strength, and which led to tragic results. But from all I know of the Government of New Guinea, I say that it has been marked by a degree of humanity and consideration for the natives which will contrast favourably with any similar administration elsewhere. The spirit exhibited by the Government has always been a benevolent, paternal, and protecting one. I am afraid, that it would be unwise to give the few white residents of this Territory the proposed share of representation in the local Parliament. I am very sorry that I shall be obliged to oppose the amendment.",42
218,Mr CROUCH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I intend to support the amendment, but, in view of the statements of the Prime Minister, I ask the honourable member for Kennedy to modify it, so as to provide that some of the non-official members of the Legislative Council shall be elected and others appointed. I take it that the non-official members should occupy an independent position. Certainly the Legislative Council should contain some representatives of the white people. I can recall two or three places in the British Empire where there are non-official members in the local .Parliament.",42
219,Mr MCCAY,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Non-officia l members are provided for under this Bill .,42
220,Mr CROUCH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"But they are appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor, and to that extent they are not independent. It necessarily follows that their appointment must be recommended by some resident of the Territory. In order to meet the views of the Prime Minister, perhaps the honourable member for Kennedy might modify his amendment so as to provide for the election of one non-official member of the Legislative Council.",42
221,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,The adoption of such a proposal would involve the use of expensive machinery for the sake of one man.,42
222,Mr CROUCH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I venture to say that we should look to that individual for a true expression of the opinions entertained by the white settlers. Probably he would also prove the best protector of the natives to be found in the community. I can recall three places in the British Empire where non-official members of the Legislature are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. I venture to say that in the Transvaal there is a larger proportion of black people to white residents than there is in New Guinea.,",42
223,Mr MCCAV,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,There are not 900 times as many.,43
224,Mr CROUCH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"At any rate in the Transvaal there is a majority of black people. The promise has been made that as soon as that country is settled, the white members of the community shall elect non-official members to the Legislative Council. Similarly, at Malta there are nine non-official members who are elected by the Italian population, as against the British residents. A little time ago, when a difficulty occurred there in regard to the language question, in order to demonstrate the opinion of a majority of the people, these nine non-official members resigned their positions, and were elected again and again. Similarly, at Singapore, even Chinese are elected as non-official, members of the local Council. In my judgment, there should be one man in the Legislative Council of New Guinea representative of the white dents, who should be able to express a non-official view. I shall support the amendment, but I should like it to be amended in the direction which I have indicated.",43
225,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," To my mind, the arguments advanced by the honourable and learned member for Corio cut in exactly the opposite direction to that which he intended. He speaks of the Italian residents of Malta electing non-official members to the Legislative Council there, in position to the British race. If there is virtue in his argument, it appears to me. that the natives of New Guinea should elect the non-official members to the Legislative Council to represent them. To give 500 white residents a representation of tliree members in the Legislative Council seems to me to be altogether out of proportion  seme representation.",43
226,Mr LONSDALE,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Surely it is the natives - who are entitled to representation. honourable member for Maranoa spoke of the manner in which the white races had treated the blacks. I quite agree with every word that he uttered in that direction, and consequently I hold that a greater measure of protection should be provided for the natives of New Guinea. We talk about maintaining a White Australia. Do honourable members desire to secure a"" White New Guinea by deporting the natives from that Territory? As the white population of British New Guinea is so numerically small, I am of opinion that it would be better to pass the Bill in its present form.",43
227,Mr TUDOR,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I think that the Prime Minister might very well agree to a compromise under which three representatives of the Legislative Council would be chosen by the residents of New Guinea. All that the honourable member for Kennedy desires is that the white residents shall be directly represented by some non-official members of that body. I admit that the clause would have to be amended further down, because I do not think that the honourable member for Kennedy desires that the non-official members should increase, as provided for in subclause 3, since, if they did, they would outvote the official members. If we provide for the representation^of the white population, we shall do, I think, all that is desired.",43
228,Mr HIGGINS,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Northern Melborune). - This subject was considered by the late resi- Government, who came fo the conclusion that to insist upon an election in this instance would be to carry principle to a pedantic extreme. I would ask my honourable friends to remember that the appointment of non-official members must be made by the Governor General, which virtually means by the Ministry responsible to this House, so that we can insist upon the adequate representation of the miners, and other white residents, and see that effect is given op- to the expression of the popular voice I any feel that we should not provide for elections without taking every precaution against fraud; but it would not be possible in this instance to provide all the machinery in the way of rolls, polling-booths, scrutineers, and returning officers, necessary for the proper conduct of an election. There is a good deal to be said in favour of the honourable member's proposal, because there is too great a tendency in Governments of this kind to consider only the wishes and The ideas of the Governor, and the clique surroundings him; but, having regard to the fact that the Ministry advising the Governor General will be responsible to this House, I do not .think we need go any further.",43
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I am in sympathy with the' honourable member's proposal; but I , too, see difficulties in the way of carrying it into effect. I think, however, that it would be better to do without non-official members than to create an anomaly. The Bill establishes a clear and definite relationship between the non-official members of'the Council and the white lation. It is clearly intended that they be regarded as representing the white popuCommission lation. Inasmuch, however, as it is imposaffairs sible to give the white residents an tunity to select their own representatives, is an undesirable anomaly to appoint as their representatives men in whose selection they have had no voice.",43
230,Mr WEBSTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I cannot see effect; how effect can be given to the amendment, though, of course, it is natural to desire, enacting a Constitution for a new country, to of the Bill. preserve the best features of our own system of government. Despite the difficulties with which a white population has to struggle in a tropical country like New Guinea, if gold were discovered there payable quantities, there would soon be large population settled in the Territory, and I think we should make some provision for that event. I do not agree honourable member for Parramatta that it come, the Commonwealth will would be well to abolish the non-official members of the Legislative Council. They are provided for as a safeguard for the intion terests of both the white and the native habitants. I should like, however, to see provision made for a definite number. will be able to hold the balance between official members, who may be bound up with too much red tape, or inclined to dominate tod much. I think that in view of a sible expansion of population, the Bill should operate for a limited period, say, years.",44

232,Mr WEBSTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Yes ; but it is diffithe cult to secure the amendment of a Constitution. tion. If , however, the measure had effect for a limited period only, its operation would come up for review at the that time, and it could then, if necessary, be amended without any trouble. The measure is a very crude one.",44
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,No .,44
234,Mr WEBSTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,I think that ir is. The right honourable gentleman thing of New Guinea.,44

236,Mr WEBSTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"We hope that the nastitution tives of New Guinea will be treated more humanely than the natives of some ot our Crown Colonies have been. But, although we are trying to provide every safeguard, we are legislating in the dark, as we have very little information about the Territory. popuI think it would have been money well shall spent if the Government had appointed a to inquire into the condition of there, before proposing any legisopporlation; but as they and their preit decessors regard the measure as one of urgency, I shall not oppose it. I should vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Kennedy if it could be carried into but as I think it cannot, I shall support the clause as it stands, hoping that a in time limit will be placed upon the operation",44
237,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I realise that New Guinea is in a very different position from Australia, or any other country wheie the majority of the population belongs to in our own race; but I think that the Prime a Minister might consider whether it is not possible to meet to some extent the veryproper anxiety of the honourable member with the for Kennedy. While for many years to be constrained to keep the government of the Territory'in its own hands, for the proteco f the native population, I do not see inwhy the white population should not have representation on the Council. It would be They very hard to debar them from expressing the their opinions on matters of concern to them-opinion s which would frequently be of value. I think, therefore, that the Goposvernment of the day might be allowed to prescribe the method of securing such reten presentation. We might be content with enacting that at least one member of the Council shall be non-official, and chosen by white residents, as prescribed by regula",44

239,Mr WATSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,The Commonwealth Government would be responsible; but the New Guinea Government would have to afford the detailed information on which the knows noregulations were based.,44
240,Mr WILKINSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I am into favour the clause as it stands, rethat the measure is a temporary expedient. The power which causes this Conto come into existence will be able at any time to alter it. The white population of British New Guinea is so small that I think that even their interests, as well as those of the natives, would be much safer in the hands of the Governor General-and Governor General, I presume, means "" the Governor General in Council""",44
241,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Hear , hear.",45
242,Mr WILKINSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Tha n they would be in the hands of a few nomadic settlers, who might go to British New Guinea as prospectors, intending to make it merely a temporary abode. We know that there is a precedent in the Empire for the course we propose to adopt. In India, for example, native races under the Crown are not allowed to exercise the franchise as British subjects in other parts of the Empire, where there is responsible government, are able to do. British New Guinea is as yet in its infancy. It is not a State of the Commonwealth, but simply a territory on whose development we are expending a considerable sum. At present the white men in the Territory may fitly be described as visitors rather than settlers. They have gone there to see if they can make a rise for themselves, and I am rather inclined to think that in their interests, as well as in the interests of the natives, it is well that we should allow the clause to remain as it stands. - Sir JOHN FORREST (Swan) - I think we shall act wisely in passing the clause as it stands. As a matter of fact, it provides for something slightly more liberal than the usual' Crown Colony form of government, inasmuch as there is to be a larger number of non-official nominee members of the Council than is usual. The interests of the natives will be quite as secure in the hands of a Council, consisting of members nominated by "" the Governor-Genera], and with the Commonwealth Parliament ready at any time to step into remedy any defects, as they would be if representatives of the few white inhabitants of the Territory were elected to it. Fiji is administered under the usual Crown Colony type of government, an.1 its Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official, and six non-official members. The Constitution with which we propose to endow British New Guinea is similar to that which all of the Australian States had at their foundation. When a colony is founded, it is granted, the Crown Colony form of government of the severe type in which all the members of the Legislative Council are nominated. As its population increases, however, nominee and elective members, in addition to the official members are returned to the Council, and finally it is granted what ds called responsible government, such as that under which we live. Considering that there are only about 250 British white subjects in New Guinea, I fail to understand why there should be any desire to introduce the elective system at this early stage in its career, and I do not think that it is necessary in the interest of the native population to do so. The Crown Colonies of the Em-, pire, such as Ceylon, Mauritius, the West Indies, Fiji, the Straits Settlements, and several others, are governed under a very similar system to that proposed in the Bill, and no one would say that in Crown Colonies the interests of the natives are not safeguarded. On the contrary, the complaint is often made that they are safeguarded to too great an extent, and that the white population do not receive theconsideration they deserve. I think that the proposal to introduce an elective system of representation into the Government of this Territory in the early stages of its career would be regarded as rather Quixotic. Local residents will be recommended to the Govern or-General for appointment to the Council. We may be sure that proper inquiries will be made before any appointment is made, and that the gentlemen nominated as members will be largelv interested in the development and progress of the Territory. I therefore see no reason for taking exception to the clause.",45
243,Mr BROWN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I shall support the amendment, which embodies a proposal that I voiced in the last Parliament. At that time, in view of the limited information at oiir disposal, it was considered that it would be unwise for us to concede this measure of self-government to the white settlers of the Territory ; but. upon inquiry I feel more .strongly than before that the proposition is a sound one. The white population of British New Guinea consists mostly of miners and traders who are really pioneers developing what no doubt will become an important part of the Commonwealth. These persons have been trained in the exercise of the powers of self-government in the States from which they come, and we need have no fear in granting theni a power which they have already enjoyed.' I believe that the interests of the Crownand of the natives are amply safeguarded by the Bill. There is to be a Legislative Council, consisting of six members, nominated, in the - first instance, by the Lientenant-Governor, .and approved by the Governor General. It is now proposed that there shall be three other members of the Council to represent the white population, which I understand consists of about 600 whites.",45
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"They are British subjects. . Mr BROWN - I admit that the white population is scattered, but in the mining centres a considerable number are to be found. The objection has been taken that it would be very difficult to secure such an expression of opinion on the part of the white settlers as would lead to their being fairly represented.",46
245,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,That is one of the smallest objections that have been mentioned.,46
246,Mr BROWN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I am glad to learn that the Government regard that objection as a trivial one, because in the last Parliament it was considered a very serious objection. I agree with the Prime Minister's view, because wherever there is a fair population it will be just as easy to take a poll, as it is in our back-block districts. - Mr WILSON - That is rather farfetched.",46
247,Mr BROWN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I do not know that it is. I have never visited New Guinea, but those who have assure methat no more difficulty would be experienced in taking a poll in the mining centres there than in the back blocks of Australia. those living in isolated districts, why should we not permit them to vote through the post, just as we allow settlers in, the remote parts of the Commonwealth to do?",46
248,Mr STORRER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,The system might abused.,46
249,Mr BROWN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I do. not think it would. It seems to me that.the white settlers would do their utmost, to secure the proper expression of their views at the ballot-box. Until the population of British New Guinea exceeds 2,000 it would be impossible under this proposal for them to exercise any greater voice in the management of the affairs of the Territory than they would, at the present time. It is provided that for every increase of 1,000 in the population after the limit of 2,000 has been passed one additional member shall be elected, until a total of twelve representatives shall have been returned. When that stage is reached the white population will probablv be large enough to warrant some alteration of the Constitution. view of the fact that there is no insurmountable difficulty in the way of securing a vote of the people, I think that they should be given some opportunity to select the men who are to specially represent them. injury would be done to the native population; on the contrary, it seems to me that their - interestswould be more likely to be not all safeguarded by a Council constituted as the honourable member for Kennedy proposes than they would be by a purely nominee Council.",46
250,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"As I have already said, the object which the honourable member for Kennedy has in view is a very good one, and I think it can be substantially obtained under the system provided in the Bill . H is object, in so far at it tends to independent representation in the Legislative Council, is a good one. I would point out, however, that the object of having non-official members is not that we may secure some echo of the official members. If that were the principle of the Bill it would be a mere waste of effort. The principle underlying this proposal is that these non-official members of the Legislative Council shall really be different from the official members in the sense that they will to a greater degree represent the non-official elements in the community. I am thoroughly with .the honourable member in regard to that, and I think I can meet his views in this way. First of all, the responsibility will rest upon the Government of As to the day to see that the non-official members are of the right sort. That will be one direct hold which the House will have upon any Government which may bring this Bill into operation, or exercise any powers under be this particular section. It will be the constant desire of the Government of the day here, and I think also of the Government in Papua, that .the non-official members shall, in the fullest and highest possible sense represent the best independent elements of the community. We have many methods of attaining that end. For instance, the Lieut - Governor cannot make an appointment under the Seal, of the Territory, except with the consent of the Governor General, who will, of course, act under the advice of his Ministers. Therefore, it will be the duty of the Government of the day to see that the three non-official members are of the class that the honourable member has in view, and that, I think, we all desire to see recognised in these appointments. Ah election In under the extreme conditions of the problem to which I have referred would by no means secure the object of the honourable member. The white residents in New Guinea do not form a settled community; No but comprise a number of nomads who have gone there for the purpose of making all they can out of. the blacks, and otherwise. That is the plain English of the matter. No man desires to go into such dangerous parts of the world, except for the purposes of personal gain. I am speaking of the average man, and not of those heroic spirits who have existed in every age. The main impulse is, in most cases, gain.",46
251,Mr CROUCH,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,That is the basis of all British settlement.,47
252,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"I suppose it is, and I am not underrating it, but I am pointing it out as a disqualification for a high-spirited Legislative Council dealing with the fate of half-a-million blacks. If this were a business concern some of these keen spirits might make the best kind of directors; but in view of the paternal Government we have in view, we must impose some check upon the kind of men who are returned. In a constituency of this kind, very limited, and with strong conditions of selfishness surrounding its enterprises, it would not be impossible for some person to be elected who would be the last man my honourable frieivl or any one else would desire to place in such a position. I submit that we have a far higher duty to the 500,000 blacks in Papua than to the 50O whites. The latter can look after themselves much better than the blacks can. If a white man has a grievance, he can induce honourable members to champion his cause, and to endeavour to have his wild charges published at the public expense. He has always at his command methods of ventilating his grievances.",47
253,Mr WEBSTER,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,Bu the is not assured of justice.,47
254,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"Perhaps not; but his position is far better than that of the blacks. The honourable member for Kennedy can take my assurance that the anxiety of the Government will be to appoint men who shall be just what we all desire them to be-independent , good men, who will faithfully reflect the opinions of the independent members of the community.",47
255,Mr BROWN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,How does the right honourable gentleman expect to secure that result?,47
256,Mr REID,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"That will be a matter for us to consider with a full sense of our responsibility. I do not propose to work out that problem on the spur of the moment. I can, however, assure the Committee that our best efforts will be devoted to working out some method, short of a cumbrous elective process, for securing the appointment of three thoroughly representative men.",47
257,Mr JOHNSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," I have a good deal of sympathy with the idea underlying the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy, but I can clearly see that under present conditions the difficulties of putting it' into operation are insurmountable. Of course honourable members must recollect that the conditions in Papua are 'very different from those which prevail here. I think there is some merit in the proposal that a limit should be fixed for the operation of the proposed system of government. At the expiration of a specified period the present arrangement might, if it were thought desirable, be continued for a further term, or it might be superseded by a better one"" - 'Some reference was made to the Constitution of Fiji, and the manner in which the Government there is conducted. I have no official information relating to .the matter, but a book recently published under the title of Sunshine and Surf, and written by Mr. Douglas Hall and Lord Albert Osborne, makes some reference to it. This book describes a cruise among the South Sea Islands, and the statements made by the authors can be regarded only as ex parte declarations of tourists. Still, the authors seemto be fairly well informed, and what they say with regard to the experience of Fiji is not particularly in favour of th"" form of Constitution which is now proposed for Papua. At page 225 they sayF i j i , as many know, is a Crown Colony of a most rigorous type. The whole Government is vested in the hands of the particular colonial official who happens to be appointed Governor. His council, who assist him in making the laws, is composed of the six heads of Government Departments, and six presumably leading white inhabitants appointed by the Governor, but only during "" good behaviour."" The present Governor decided that the six Government officials were bound to vote with the Governor pn any measure which he might bring forward, thus one can see at a glance that, as he ihas a casting vote, with his six satellites, he can carry any measure for taxation or for the spending of the revenue he chooses. The present Governor is a man with very strong ideas, which are not always successful, and it was commonly reported to us that if a deputation of merchants or others came to see him on any subject he scarcely received them with decent politeness. They quote a number of glaring cases of governmental tyranny under the Fijian system, and remark furtherAs a white merchant here said to me once, "" We are thousands of miles away from England. Even the Governor's salary is now paid by the Colony, and nothing of any sort about F i j i ever goes up before Parliament. We know nobody in authority in England, and nobody to take our part."" They are absolutely under the autocratic thumb of the Governor appointed by the Colonial Office, and the only way his acts can be criticised, I presume, would be when the Colonial Office estimates are brought forward; but, no doubt, any members wiho spoke or asked questions about F i j i would get as their sole reward a caricature of themselves in Punch, dressed as a half-naked Fijian, with a club in his hand, dancing a wardance. Of course, this has reference to the form of Government in a Crown Colony, which is far removed from the sphere of English parliamentary influence. Papua is very differently situated, because it is located within 100 miles of our coast, and its Government will be under the immediate supervision of the Commonwealth Parliament.",47
258,Mr BROWN,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,We know as much about F i j i as we do about Papua.,48
259,Mr JOHNSON,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH,"But the conditions of Papua and F i j i will be entirely different, because we shall have the whole of the Government under our immediate observation. At some future time it may be advisable to proceed upon the lines proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy; but, at present, I am sure that his scheme would be absolutely impracticable.",48
260,Mr MCDONA LD,COLOURED LABOUR ON ENGLISH," The Prime Minister has assured us that the appointments to the Legislative Council will lie made upon a principle very different from that followed in connection with appointments made up to the present time; but the whole administration of Papua has been so unsatisfactory ihat I think some radical change should be made. I have had scores of letters from miners, who state that the conditions there are very far from what could be desired. It is true that the miners who go to Papua resort there for the purposes of personal gain; but at the same time they are performing valuable development work, which is not likely to be undertaken by anv other class of settlers. But in doing that, they incur an enormous risk. It is that risk which makes it possible for others""to subsequently settle there, and to live in comparative comfort. Under the circumstances, I think that these men should receive better treatment than has NA been meted out to them. I can assure the Minister that the mining population of British New Guinea is very much dissatisfied with the manner in which the administration of the Territory has been conducted. One'of the principal things of which they complain is that a little band of residents who are located around Port Moresby practically controls the whole island. Whilst all sorts of concessions can be obtained by settlers in the vicinity of that port, the miners who desire that pathways should be cut to the different mining centres-and honourable members must recollect that the jungle of New Guinea is almost impenetrable-experienc e great difficulty in getting their requirements attended to. When it was proposed to take over .the administration of this Territory, I voiced the opinion that we were embarking upon a very dangerous course, inasmuch as we were undertaking the control of 500,000 blacks, some of whom are of a very warlike disposition. I quite agree with the Prime Minister, that the black residents of the Possession should be protected in every possible way, and I trust that the scandals which have occurred in connection with the treatment of Australian aborigines willnot be repeated there. The way in which our own natives have been treated constitutes one of the blackest pages in our history. In the northern portion of Queensland they have been shamefully treated.",48
261,Mr BROWN,IO Q,They are being badly .treated there at the present time.,48
262,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,"I will not say that. The Queensland Government has done a great deal to alleviate their sufferings. But whilst we should protect the natives of New Guinea, we should also encourage our white settlers to develop its resources. It has occurred to me that if we granted them direct representation in the Legislative Council, that ""body would necessarily gain a better knowledge of their requirements. Of course, I realise the difficulty that would be experienced in conducting an election in which only 500 voters were interested.",48
263,Mr REID,IO Q,"Of course, there would be nothing to prevent the white residents of the Territory from sending in a memorial in favour of the appointment of any particular individual to the Legislative Council. That would be an informal way in which they might express their opinion.",48
264,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,The suggestion of the Prime Minister would certainly be an improvement upon the proposal contained in this Bill. They might very easily send in a memorial expressing their desire that some particular individual should be appointed to represent them.,48
265,Mr REID,IO Q,"That would overcome the difficulty without any necessity for legal formalities. Mr MCDONALD.!-If Iwe appoint; a number of officials as members of the Legislative Council, I can foresee that they will be reluctant to take up a position which is hostile .to the Administrator.",49
266,Sir JOHN FORREST,IO Q,They will be dependent of him.,49
267,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,"If we appoint six or seven officials, they must, to a large extent, give effect to the wishes of the Ad ministrator. If they did not do so, a conflict would immediately arise, and the Administrator might see that some of them were removed.",49
268,Mr REID,IO Q,That would be a risky move upon his part.,49
269,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,But such things do take place.,49
270,Mr REID,IO Q,A member of the Legislative Council could not be removed without the aporoval of the Governor General in Council.',49
271,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,"At any rate, there is always an unconscious leaning on the part of officials towards the view which is entertained by their superior officers, and that leaning might induce them to give decisions which they would not give if they were independent of him. - Sir JOHN FORREST - This is not a new system.",49
272,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,"I am aware of that. Nevertheless, it is a system which has not worked well. Take the case of the Transvaal as an example. There, the Legislative Council system is regarded as most unsatisfactory by all those who are directly interested. But seeing that we cannot obtain a_ better system, I intend to withdraw my amendment. Before doing so, I would point out that the members of the Legislative Council of New Guinea will be elected for life.",49
273,Mr REID,IO Q,"No ; the non-official members are to be appointed for six years,- but upon the expiry of that term they may be reappointed. Mr (MCDONALD - When these persons, are about to Ibe appointed, I think that their names should be laid upon the table of the House, so as to allow us to obtain some expression of opinion from the white residents of British New Guinea as to whether their appointment would prove acceptable. When once they have been appointed they cannot be removed- ",49
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IO Q,The Government may remove them at any time.,49
275,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,Not unless some specific charge is proved against them. in- Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Every non-official member can be removed at any time.,49
276,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,"I think that my suggestion is a reasonable one, and that it would be a fair compromise under the circumstances.",49
277,Mr HUTCHISON,IO Q," I recognise that some difficulty would be experienced in giving effect to the proposal of the honourable member for Kennedy. At the same time. I think that the Prime Minister should see whether some system cannot jbe devised whereby the white population of the Territory will be directly represented. In the Transvaal the Legislative Council is appointed in the same manner that it is proposed to constitute it in New Guinea. I find from a dispatch by Sir Arthur Lawley, the Governor of the Transvaal, that the white population of that country are up in arms against the Legislative Council-so much so that he is afraid to use his majority in that Council to carry out the policy of the British Parliament. That fact evidences the necessity for having the white population in a Crown Colony directly represented. The proposal in the Bill practically amounts to this : If the Governor is dissatisfied with the action of any member of the Legislative Council, he may remove him at any time. Consequently, its members are merely his puppets. The official members of the Council well know that a word from the Governor will be sufficient to deprive them of their positions. In the Transvaal we know that it is proposed to apply a test in regard .'to immigrants, not only in the English but in the Indian ""language, because ""there is a very . , large Indian population settled there. In deed, in Petersburg there is not a single white storekeeper today. The Indians have acquired control of the entire trade there, ' and so'incensed have the'white population become as the result of having no direct voice in the matter that the local bodies have taken the law into their own hands - The CHAIRMAN - Does the honourable member intend to connect this with the clause ?",49
278,Mr HUTCHISON,IO Q,Certainly . I'was going to say that precisely the same thing would occur with regard to the white population in New Guinea.,50
279,Mr LONSDALE,IO Q,What about the black population? Is the honourable member going to prevent: them from becoming storekeepers ?,50
280,Mr HUTCHISON,IO Q,"They are living very happily now, and will not be improved by coming into contact with white people. If the honourable member knows anything about the history of Natal, he must be - aware that, not only have the coloured races there been contaminated, but the white race is deteriorating.",50
281,The CHAIRMAN,IO Q,The contamination of races has nothing to do with the question before the Chamber.,50
282,Mr HUTCHISON,IO Q,It has everything - to do with the subject under discussion.,50
283,The CHAIRMAN,IO Q,"I must be allowed to be the judge, temporarily, at any rate, and I fail to see any connection. I therefore ask the honourable member not to refer to that matter.",50
284,Mr HUTCHISON,IO Q,"I should not have done so had it not been for the interjection of the honourable member for New England. There is great danger of dissatisfaction arising among the white residents of New .Guinea, and, in fact, many complaints have already been made of the present Administration. If the white population were given at least one direct representative, a great deal would be done to prevent irritation, and to - secure the good government of the Territory. I am sorry that the honourable member for Kennedy is prepared to withdraw .the amendment. I urge the Prime Minister .'to make provision for the appointment of at least one member of the Council to directly represent the white population of 'the Territory. . I should be quite satisfied .with the appointment of a non-official member, on a memorial from the white population. Mn BROWN (Canobolas) - I do not [think that the honourable member for Kennedy has - secured any very great concession. I should be prepared to-allow the .clause to pass as-it stands, if the experience 10 Q 2 of the various British possessions where this system of Government has been tried had not shown that it has not been-an unqualified success. Although in the initial stages of colonization it has been thought necessary to adopt this form of government, it has not been regarded by those who have lived under it as very desirable. If it could be shown that a nominee Council would safeguard the interests of the blacks better than an elective or partially elective Council, my position would be different; but our experience in Australia has been that the blacks have suffered the greatest amount of injustice, not under representative government, but under a government similar to that which is proposed for New Guinea. An opportunity should be given to the white population of the Territory",50
285,Mr LONSDALE,IO Q,They number only 500 persons.,50
286,Mr BROWN,IO Q,"I suppose that they will increase, and multiply.",50
287,Mr REID,IO Q,Provisio n is made for that.,50
288,Mr BROWN,IO Q,"Provisio n is made for an . additional non-official member of the Council for every increase of 1,000 persons to the white population, until a maximum' of twelve non-official members has been reached, when, I presume, it is considered that other legislation will be needed to meet the altered conditions. We have no evidence to show that this system has in the past operated in the interests of either the black population or the white population engaged in the pioneering work of developing new countries.",50
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IO Q,Why should we develop New Guinea? Is there not room for development in Australia?,50
290,Mr BROWN,IO Q,Would the honourable member haul down the British flag?,50
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IO Q,No ; but I would leave New Guinea to the natives who are there.,50
292,Mr BROWN,IO Q,"I do riot think that that is the policy of the Power which'contrOls-rhe situation. If there were no white population in New Guinea'there would, of .course, be no elective member on the Council. I wish, however, to provide machinery which will enable the residential white population to express its voice in the Government of the Territory, if not By electing a representative,"" by nominating one for appointment. At . all events, I should like to have a vote of the Committee on the question, and for that reason I object to the withdrawal of the amendment - ' ' - ' Question-That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the clause-put .

293,Mr WEBSTER,IO Q," I m o v e That the word "" three,"" line 13, be left out, with a view to the insertion of the word "" six."" If any system of representation by election be desired, we should balance, as far as possible the representation of the respective interests in the Council. It has been stated that in one of the Crown Colonies there are six official and six non-official members of the Council.",51
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IO Q,"Where that is the case, there is no reference in the legislation dealing with-the subject to a white population.",51
295,Mr WEBSTER,IO Q,"That may be, but at the same time, I think this would be a reasonable provision to make. members of the Council are to be appointed by the Governor General in Council,' and there are to be three unofficial members. I take it that the latter would be more directly in touch with the aspirations and desires of the white population, and. would probably know more of the grievances under which the coloured population laboured than would the official members. If we provide for six,, 25 instead of three unofficial members, we shall 22 go as fa r as we can towards giving the settlers that encouragement which an elective system invariably afford's. The names 1 AYES. of the gentlemen to be appointed would be suggested to the Lieutenant-Governor, who in turn would submit then; to the Governor General, with a view to their nomination, and I hope that honourable memberswill recognise that although no great principle is at stake, there is good reason for accepting this amendment.",51
296,Mr REID,IO Q,"I do not desire to unduly inflate the importance of the question whether there should be three or six unofficial members; but I must again remind the Committee of the extraordinary state of NOES. affairs with reference to the white and black races in the Territory. There we find 600 whites living among half-a-million blacks. There is to be no provision for the representation of the Blacks, but six persons, who may be more closely identified with the interests of the whites than of the blacks are to be made membets of the Council. I do not say that these gentlemen will necessarily Tellers : be more closely identified with the interests of the whites. They may be philanthropists, who think more of the coloured races than PAIR. of the white population, but the probability is that that will not be the case.",51
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IO Q,"This clause, at all events, contemplates that they will consider the coloured races.",51
298,Mr REID,IO Q,"That is so. The principle of the amendment is that the six unofficial members should be representatives of 600 white settlers, as against the interests of half-a-million coloured persons. Tf that is democracy, it is a democracy of a new kind, with which I have no sympathy. I think that a start may fairly be made by appointing three non-official members. There will be ample room for expansion. The Bill enables the three to be gradually increased to twelve at the rate of one additional member for every 1,000 whites, and I appeal to the Committee, to say whether the provision und^r which, without anv change of the law, the number of noa-official members may Six official be increased to twelve as .against six, as the white population increases, is not a fair one. This provision for the gradual expansion of the non-official element should be sufficient, 1 think, to insure the full representation of any interests which the 600 whites may have. There is the further guarantee that Papua is not like the form of Crown Colony with which many of us are familiar. It has been suggested, for instance, that the ment? Lieutenant-Governor might immediately dismiss any official member of the Legislative Council who crossed his path. There is absolutely no foundation for such a suggestion. The Lieutenant-Governor will not be able to dismiss an officer unless the - Governor General-and that means the Governor General and his' Ministers-ap proves of his action.",51
299,Mr WEBSTER,IO Q,The Governor General will be able to disn.iss a man on the recommendation of the Lieutenant-Governor.,52
300,Mr REID,IO Q,"But the Governor General and the Lieutenant-Governor are two different persons. In this Territory, unlike the old type of Crown Colony, where the Governor was a sort of despot, who could do as he pleased, it will not be possible for the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint a single Officer without the approval of the Australian Ministry. Under the Bill there is not one official whom the Lieutenant-Governor will be able to remove. He will be able to suspend an officer, just as the head of a Department might do, but the case must ihen be submitted to the Governor General in Council, with cause shown for the action taken. The Governor General in Council will then decide whether the man is to be dismissed or not. I think that honourable members will see that we are keeping a fairly close grip, after all, on the working of this experiment, and in a way which is unknown in any Crown Colony with which I am familiar.",52
301,Mr MALONEY,IO Q," The statement made by the Prime Minister as to the position of the white and coloured races in Papua reminds one of the situation in India. India has a population of some 350,000,000 coloured British subjects, and I doubt if there are as many hundred thousand whites to be found there; but neither the white nor coloured races are allowed to exercise the franchise. We know, however, that in two small districts in the peninsula - Chandernagore , and Pondicherry-whic h belong to France, the people have the privilege of electing a member to the ChamBer of Deputies, and the Senate in Paris. I mentibn ithis only as. showing that one European nation, at all events, allows representatives to be elected in respect of a - small part of the peninsula of Hindustan, whilst 350,000,000 highly civilized human beings in the main part of the peninsula, are not pem.itted to exercise the franchise.",52
302,Mr REID,IO Q,Does that justify this amend,52
303,Mr MALONEY,IO Q,It shows that. the white settlers in Papua should have representation.,52
304,Mr REID,IO Q,But the amendment means something more than that; it says in effect that the whites shall exercise half the power of the Legislature-60 0 whites against half-a-million blacks.,52
305,Mr WEBSTER,IO Q,Not necessarily.,52
306,Mr REID,IO Q,In reality that will be the position.,52
307,Mr MALONEY,IO Q,"The white races will have: some measure of representation, but unless the number of members be increased from three to six, they will not be properly represented. Australian sentiment is that the white races should have proper representation, and I intend to vote for the amendment. Question-That the word proposed to be left out, stand part of the clause-put .

308,Mr CROUCH,IO Q," The Prime Minister has succeeded in resisting both the attempts which have been made to amend the clause, because he has given honourable membersan assurance that the Government will be responsible for any appointments that may be made. I would point out, however, that sub-clause 2 provides that the appointments shall be made by the Governor General, under the seal : of the Commonwealth, or by the Lieutenant-Governor in pursuance of instructions from the Governor General. If these instructions are of a general character, and are issued immediately the Bill is brought into operation, any subsequent Governments will be relieved of the responsibility .for the directions given by their predecessors. I should like the Prime Minister to consider the advisability of amending the clause by providing that special instructions shall be given in every case. 'In that event, the Government of the day will be directly responsible to Parliament for any action that may be taken. Clause agreed to.",53
309,Mr MAUGER,IO Q," I move That the following new clause be inserted 20A. No intoxicants or opium shall be allowed to be imported into or'manufactured or sold or otherwise disposed of in the Territory except for medicinal purposes to be disnensed on the order of a medical practitioner, or person duly authorized by the Lieutenant-Governor, and any ordinance passed before the commencement of this Act providing for such introduction or sale is hereby repealed. I have considerably altered the scope of the clause since it was last submitted to the House. When the Bill was before us last session, it was provided that no intoxicants should be sold except for medicinal purposes on the order of a medical practitioner, but honourable members will notice that I now propose .that liquors shall be dispensed by a medical practitioner ""or person duly authorized by the Lieutenant Governor.'"" I desire to direct attention to the objections raised by Sir Edmund Barton upon a' former occasion, and also to the information gleaned by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat from residents in Papua. Sir Edmund Barton, in opposing the clause which was previously agreed to, laid special emphasis on two points. In the first place, he stated that a considerable loss of revenue would result from the prohibition of the sale of liquor, and, in the second place, pointed out that the precautions taken to prevent the sale of liquor I to natives had proved thoroughly effective; and that no real danger was to be appre-J hended. He directed attention to the fact that the ordinary licensee was allowed to sell liquor only for consumption off the premises, or for consumption on the premises by bond fide residents in such premises, and that the conditions were such as to preclude the natives from obtainingliquor. He represented that the loss of revenue would amount to something like; £s> &3> and said, further, that there were 2 fourteen licensees to meet the requiremnts of 500 white people. The opinions expressed in the paper laid upon the table, which gives the answers to a series of question submitted to residents of the Territory by the honourable and learned n.ember for Ballarat, were offered in respect.to the clause as it was embodied in the former Bill, which precluded any one but a medical practitioner from dispensing spirits for medicinal purposes. The evidence of the missionaries was particularly based upon that restricted provision. I would direct the attention of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to the fact that some of the statements made are of the most remarkable character. :- In the first place, the Acting-Administrator admits that he does not know the number of licences issued.",53
310,Mr KELLY,IO Q,That is hardly a fair way of putting it.,53
311,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"I shall quote his own words. He saysI regret to say I am not yet in possession of the results of the Government Secretary's inquiries as to the number of licences in force. They are granted by the Resident Magistrate in each division, but no general record of them has been kept at head-quarters. Therefore the Administrator has so little control over the issue of these licences that he knows practically nothing about them.. The statement that there are only fourteen licences is proved to be wrong, because there are actually twenty. A further remark is made by the Acting-Administrator to the effect that if the proposed prohibitionbe carried out neither missionary nor miner on' the gold-fields will be able to procure a bottle of spirits to alleviate pressing sickne-.s except on a certificate from a medical officer, and he points out that there is only one medical officer at Port Moresby, and 1 another at some place far removed from the gold-fields. The clause' as it is now framed meets.the objection based upon the ground that spirits can be dispensed only by a medical practitioner. It will be competent for the Government to arrange for spirits to be dispensed by any person, subject to proper supervision. Sir Edmund Barton stated that no less a sum than £ 3 > i 3 ° 8s. 5d. was collected annually in the shape of liquor duties.",53
312,Mr WILKS,IO Q,The white residents must have a very big thirst.,54
313,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Yes . Sir Edmund Barton also stated that, no retail licences were issued, and that no intoxicating spirits were sold, except in bottles, for consumption off the premises. The Acting-Administrator states, however, thatYour Excellency will have observed that Section IV . of ""The Liquor Ordinance of 1S91"" does not authorize what is generally known as a "" bar trade,"" but such a trade seems to have been permitted, and the hotels at Port Moresby and Samarai and the stores in the more remote places sell liquor by the glass under the licence granted them. This shows conclusively that the conditions of the licences at present issued are being evaded, and that liquor is being sold parently without any restriction. Now me quote the opinions of some of the missionaries, to which great prominence is given in the papers laid before the House. The stainers ? Bishop of the Church of England Mission says The laws dealing with the sale of alcoholic liquor generally have been observed, so far as the authority and influence of the Government officers have extended, but there are stores the gold-fields, and at least one township at times no officer is present, and then excessive drinking has been resorted to. The present unrestricted sale of alcoholic liquors, bringing gains to the vendor, or to the licensed victualler, or storekeeper, whom he represents, needs diate attention. It has led to unchecked which have disgraced and lowered the white race in the eyes of the native, and while the 'state Samarai in this respect has greatly improved ing the last five years, in more remote places disgraceful scenes have occurred more recently. Another missionary says The morals and health of the white community and natives would probably, as a whole, be slightly improved, but members of the former would perhaps be driven to dishonest, acts to procure spirits. The fear is expressed by most of them that liquor will not be obtainable for medicinal purposes, and their objection is based upon that ground. They agree that the mora^ and the health, of the people will be greatlyimproved. Another missionary remarksThe laws of the Possession arrange for bottle licences, and forbid liquor to be drunk on the premises where it is sold. This prohibition is universally disregarded. Every place where liquor is sold by licence has a bar at which it is drunk. Sir Edmund Barton made a strong point of the fact that the native residents could not obtain drink except for consumption off the premises, and' stated that there were no licensed houses in the sense in which we understood the term in Australia. Another missionary testifies thatNatives have undoubtedly obtained drink. The sources at present are : the stores, private individuals (whites), hotels, and Kanakas. I don't think that natives get it from the stores with the knowledge of the storekeepers. Private individuals are not always careful to lock up their whisky bottles. Hotels have, it is supposed, supplied Kanakas, with or without permit, secretly. It will be impossible to safeguard the supply to natives unless Kanakas are placed absolutely on the same footing as the Papuan, and the sale of drink taken over by Government, and no licences issued to private individuals, t Although prohibition on the lines indicated in the clause as previously adopted is condemned, all the missionaries agree that if prohibition could be made effective it would apbe in the best interests not only of the let natives, but of the white residents.",54
314,Sir JOHN FORREST,IO Q,Are they all ab,54
315,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,I wish that they were.,54
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,IO Q,Why ?,54
317,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Because it would be on better for them and for the cause which where they desire to serve. Another remarkable objection which is urged by the missionaries large ' is that they cannot get wine for sacramental purposes. One would really think that the immetime had gone by when such an argument orgies, would be advanced. Why, there are thouof sands of churches all over Christendom in durwhich non-intoxicatingwine is used for sacramental purposes, and many others in which no wine is used whatever. I recognise too well the value of missionary work to say one word which would reflect upon missionary sacrifice. But I cannot refrain from' declaring that the whole of the evidence which is advanced by the missionaries in this Parliamentary paper is about upon a par with the statement to which I have referred. Then again, great prominence is given by the missionaries and the officials to the question of revenue. I should like to direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that this matter was recently discussed in the New Zealand Parliament, which found it necessary, in the King country and Cook Islands, to absolutely prohibit the use of intoxicating drinks except for medicinal purposes. Mr. Seddon, in addressing himself to this question, said I say that the clause at all events should have met with the general support of the members of the House. Then, coming to the question with respect to the Cook Islands, I tell you now that unless you pass this clause it will be a bad day's work that was done for the natives when those islands were taken over.",54
318,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IO Q,To what clause did he refer?,55
319,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,To a clause prohibiting the sale of liquor except for medicinal purposes.,55
320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IO Q,Will the honourable member be good enough to read the clause ?,55
321,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"I cannot put my hand upon it just now, but I can assure the Minister that its effect is absolutely prohibitive. Continuing, Mr Seddon is reported to have saidThere were, during the year 1901-2, 4,271bottles of spirits consumed at the Cook Islands amongst less than eighty whites, including Chines: and women and children. The women and children number thirty. This, added to 11 respectable quantity of wine and beer, is a bad record. Where you have a state of things like this, with schooners coming about with grog, and going in and out amongst them, you are faced with great difficulties. We stopped lhat to some extent by making only one port of entry, thus gaining control, and we provide that no liquor shall be introduced except as specified here.",55
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IO Q,But how is it specified ?,55
323,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,It is specified upon the lines that I have indicated.,55
324,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,IO Q,No .,55
325,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Then another member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Fowlds, speaking upon the same question, said I admit it is not possible for any one to go there with the eyes and ears open and not come away with the knowledge of the fact that a good deal of illicit trade in liquor is going on. At the same time, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the picture that is frequently drawn of the cbr.dition of things in the King countryand especially if we compare it with other similar places, where licences exist-is over-drawn. I go to other places where there are a number of natives, and where there is a licenced house, and almost any time. I go to these places I see more evidence of native drunkenness and demoralization round about the licenced houses than I have ever been able to see on any visit to the King country. It is true t'hat the police and the magistrate have done their duty as well as possible under the law they have to operate, but it has to be remembered we have never had applicable to the King country the same law that is applicable to districts where no licence has been carried in other parts of the colony.",55
326,Mr JOHNSON,IO Q,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting?,55
327,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Fro m the New Zealand Hansard. The same speaker proceededThe condition of things existing there will be very greatly improved by the adoption of the clauses in this Bill , or the provisions applicable in other districts, where no licence has been carried. It will thus be seen that provision is made for supplying liquor only for medicinal purposes. In urging that we should not grant responsible government to the white residents of New Guinea, the Prime Minister declaredthat their business interests might very possibly come into conflict with the interests of the native blacks. I quite agree with him, and I claim that it is apparent from this document, that the interests of the storekeepers of New Guinea are regarded as of infinitely more importance than are those of its black population. Mr Reid:-If the white residents could control New Guinea, the honourable member would not secure teetotalism there.",55
328,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Havin g very carefully examined this parliamentary paper, I say that the case for prohibition has been very much strengthened. It is patent thai the 1 licensing conditions are being evaded, and that liquor is being retailed to the natives. I contend that we ought to discharge our duty to these people. Like the honourable member for Parramatta, I do not think that it matters very much whether we develop New Guinea or not. It is of importance, however, that we should not carry our vices to the natives of that Territory, and ruin them in the same way that we have ruined the Australian aborigines. We should absolutely prohibit the sale of intoxicants in the Possession except for medicinal purposes.",55
329,Mr DEAKI N,IO Q," I think that the Committee will sympathize with the object of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in submitting this amendment. But while svmpathizing with him most cordially, I differ from him entirely as to the means by which he hopes to serve the cause of temperance. As the honourable member remarked, whilst presiding over the Department for External Affairs, it fell to my lot to institute some inquiries into this question. I did so with every desire to arrive at conclusions somewhat similar to his own. The results of that investigation are now in the hands of honourable members, and I am content to allow them to draw their Own conclusions from them. The overwhelming impression which that inquiry left upon my mind 7s in absolute conflict with the views of the honourable member. I think that he would have done well had he reminded the Committee of the area which is embraced by British Guinea. One would suppose, Jfrom the manner in which he dealt with the matter, that he was alluding to a suburban disthat trict, or a small country area like the King Country in New Zealand, which, relatively speaking,' is easily controlled by the thorities. But there is absolutely no parallel between the King Country and New Guinea, and very little parallel tween that Territory and the Cook Islands. Honourable members should recollect the largest of those islands is about twenty miles in circumference. They are situated to the north of New Zealand, in a tropical posal. climate, and contain a population of between 5,000 and 6,000. There is only one port at which vessels can call, quently it is comparatively easy to deal with them. The contrast between the phywhich sical conditions which obtain there and those which prevail in New Guinea is absolute. Prohibition is simply impossible. Papua, it should not be. forgotten, comprises area larger than the whole of Victoria. It is a country without roads, or tracks. Paths only have been cut through the jungle. There are beasts of burden there, and all the translect port is undertaken, by the natives themgin selves. There are handfuls of white miners scattered over great areas, in the valleys, leading to German from British New store, Guinea. The honourable member for Melber bourne Ports appears to be shocked by the number of licences issued in the Terribut tory, and by the fact that no complete record is available at short notice. If he will remember that at every camp there necessarily a store which is usually licensed, he will readily comprehend why, in a couna try as mountainous as Gippsland",55
330,Mr MCDONALD,IO Q,It is much more mountainous.,56
331,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"I admit that mountains of New Guinea are of greater magnitude than are those of If the honourable member for Melbourne Ports appreciated the difficulties of transit and the tardiness of communication, in race New Guinea, he would understand why the officers of Port Moresby cannot keep themselves informed of every, little licence granted in other portions of that Territory.",56
332,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,Thos e conditions should render illicit trading much more difficult.,56
333,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"I do not agree with the honourable member. The honourable member New for Kennedy a few moments ago drew a fair picture of the conditions of the white residents of New Guinea. He pointed out they are scattered, living at great distances from settlements, and earning a precarious livelihood in a climate of which authose who have not lived for a period in tropical countries, as I have done, both in the South' Seas and elsewhere, can have bevery little conception.",56
334,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,Governo r MCGregor takes that my side of the question.,56
335,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,I am sure he would not have supported the honourable member's pro,56
336,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,He has spoken very emphatically about the effect of drink upon both and consewhites and natives.,56
337,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"I have not said a word would imply that I think the drinking of alcohol more necessary in the tropics than elsewhere. I know that there is greater temptation to drink there, but believe an that it is even more injurious to do so than in temperate climates. Neither have railways, I said a word in defence of any proposition which would make it easier for the no natives to obtain alcohol. But if we recolthe circumstances of the country, we beto comprehend why there are so many licences, why, when one expires, another is gi anted, and why they are given now to one and now to two. The honourable memappeared to think that this implies defective control. The control is not defective, the best that can be obtained for the money that we spend. I am not going to dwell on the loss of £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year to the revenue, is though that is a very large sum in New Guinea, and honourable members will pull long face when they are asked to vote an extra £ 5 , 0 0 0 to make up that loss and the additional expenditure involved in the attempt to put the honourable member's proposal into force.",56
338,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Surely the honourable and the learned member would not seriously advance that argument, when the existence of a whole Gippsland. race is in question ?",56
339,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"No ; but it is preposterous to say that the existence of the is in question. All the testimony is to the effect that, with the exception of a few Papuans, who have been engaged in the pearling industry, the race has not acquired the taste for alcohol.",56
340,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,Every missionary says that they are acquiring it.,57
341,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"No . The Administrator, after having made inquiries, has assured us that he has not discovered a single authenticated case in which a native has been supplied with liquor without having been detected, and the white person responsible punished.",57
342,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,How does he know that ?,57
343,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"Because he is in touch with his omcers and with the White traders, whose interest it is to keep liquor from the natives, not only because the penalty for supplying them with it is very heavy, but because the continuance of their trade depends upon keeping drink from the natives. I have conversed with representatives of all the missions in New Guinea, and their testimony is that they know of no abuse and no use of alcohol by the natives. They were unable to give me more than isolated cases in which the natives consume alcohol, and in every case those natives were pear] divers, or had been engaged in occupations outside New Guinea. I am with the honourable member in the object which he desires to secure; but he does not realise the effect of his proposition even on the white population. The evils to which he has referred are neither numerous nor surprising, considering the circumstances in Papua. I regret to say that they occur too frequently in our own country, and any proposal he might make for curing them would have the sympathetic consideration of the Committee.",57
344,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,On e cannot play with fire without being burnt.,57
345,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"I wish to know why the honourable member, and those who are supporting him, voted to enfranchise the white population of New Guinea, and now will not permit them to have a voice in this matter ?",57
346,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"They would have a voice in the matter, if the honourable and learned member would enfranchise them.",57
347,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"If the honourable member proposed a system of local option for the whites of New Guinea, I would support it, allowing a majority of them to decide whether any, and if so how many, licences should be issued. I would go further, and support a proposal to allow a sweeping majoritv there to absolutelv prohibit the introduction of liquor. We are asked now to legislate for men who have no representation, here in regard to a matter upon which, so far as they have expressed their opinions,' they are all hostile fo this proposal.",57
348,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,W; e are not consulting them in regard to any other-matter.,57
349,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"No ; but it is inconsistent for those who votedto enfranchise, therri on matters of minor concern to despotically override their wishes.",57
350,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,The honourable and learned member was opposed to enfranchising them.,57
351,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"I think that it would be unprofitable to enfranchise them politically, at the present moment. The Bill under discussion is merely a tentative and temporary measure for continuing the existing form of Government. If the honourable member proposed to give local option to the white residents of New Guinea, or the right to prohibit the introduction of liquor into the Territory, I would vote with him. We should, however, hesitate to legislate for white men ab-' solutely against their will. Mr ' MAUGER - The expressions of opinion to which the honourable and learned member refers have been put forward by interested persons.",57
352,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"That is an incorrect statement, which I challenge the honourable, member to substantiate. Every missionary and public officer from New Guinea whom I have questioned has told me that the miners to a man are opposed: to the prohibition which the honourable member desires.",57
353,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,The missionaries are in favour of the amendment.,57
354,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,The testimony of the missionaries is equally emphatic against this plan.,57
355,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Why does not the honourable and learned member adopt ""their views in regard to a White Australia?",57
356,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"That is quite an irrelevant question. I am taking this side with great reluctance, because both missionaries and miners unanimously declare against the proposed prohibition. So keenly do I feel ^n this matter that, if it be necessary to give the miners political enfranchisement to secure their Control of the liquor trade, I would vote for it now. Enfranchisement must come, though I think that at the present time the number of whites in the Territory is not sufficient to justifv us in providing for it. I go the whole length of saying that the white population of New Guinea should have complete control of the liquor traffic there. I think that the of them would be in favour of restrictions which would prevent all the evils to which the honourable member has alluded.",57
357,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"The experience of"" the world is that the only prevention is prohibition.",58
358,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"We have not applied prohibition to our own people, and why, then, should we apply it to others who are not represented here, and who oppose it strongly ?",58
359,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Because this is a black man's country, of which we have taken charge.",58
360,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"It is very easy for us who live comfortably in this country to dictate to men who have no representation here, and whose wishes we disregard.",58
361,Mr LEE,IO Q,We shall have prohibition here in time.,58
362,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"Yes , but with the consent of the people to whom it applies.",58
363,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"We should have prohibition in New Guinea if we took the views of the majority of the population. It is a black man's, and not a white man's country.",58
364,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"The task of governing New Guinea, which is already difficult enough, will be rendered infinitely harder if the whole white population become opposed to us on this question, and are encouraged by our action, not to obey the law, but to surreptitiously undermine its administration. It goes much against my grain to argiie this side of the question. I wish that the facts were the other way.",58
365,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,There at present exists a greater inducement to smuggling than would exist if the traffic were prohibited.,58
366,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"I have put first the arguments which affect me least-the loss of revenue, ancl the difficulties of the whites. I agree that Papua is more a black man's than a white man's country, and that the black man is to be considered first and last. Fortunately, the natives are by nature tically models of sobriety, the exceptions being so rare that they are not worth menalong tioning. Our object is to protect against the liquor habit. At the present time the penalty for supplying liquor to natives is very high, it being possible to impose a fine up to £ 2 0 0 , with imprisonemployed ment up to six weeks. If the honourable member thinks that those penalties are effective, the Committee may support him . member. bulk in imposing more effective penalties, and better supervision if it be needed.",58
367,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,I hope that the Com-' mittee will prohibit the introduction of liquor into New Guinea.,58
368,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"If honourable members."" do so they must take the responsibility. No more serious blow could be delivered at the sobriety of the Papuans. The miners, no doubt, consume, for their numbers, a great deal of liquor, which is a misfortune ;but it is certain that so long as there are' miners in that country a large number of them will insist upon having alcohol. When they get gold, the first thing many buy will', be alcohol. The prohibition of gold mining would be more effective than the proposal of the honourable member. I would rather face that at once. How does he hope to prohibit the introduction of liquor into Papua ? He must, to make the prohibition effective, first guard the German and Dutch borders, because alcohol is imported into those possessions practically free of duty. Then he must watch a coastline of 3,600 miles, full of bays and estuaries.. Papua is a country larger than Victoria,, supervized by eight magistrates, who control immense trackless districts, and who in the discharge of their judicial duties are half their time away from the stations at, which, according to the honourable member's scheme, alcohol is to be kept. It must either be left under lock and key, and inaccessible when required for medical purposes, or the key would Have to be left with some black assistant. In a country with a coast-line of 3,600 miles, and having only eight magistrates,, who spend half their time in travelling, how are we to prevent smuggling, more especially when we remember the large supplies of cheap liquor that are available in the foreign settlements?",58
369,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,How do we prevent smuggling in Papua at the present time?,58
370,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"Because it is not to the interest of the traders at present to pracsmuggle. They deal with recognised firms at recognised ports, and carry their goods recognised tracks. At present it does them not pay them to smuggle.",58
371,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,Stil l these recognised routes might be used for an illicit trade.,58
372,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"But they would not be for .the illicit trade. The traders would not take the usual routes under the not prohibition proposed by the honourable They would take new paths from various inlets that pass through districts peopled by native tribes. The stricter our supervision, the higher would be the p-rice of the alcohol to the men who had the gold-dust to pay for it, and the more they would pay for smuggled drink. In these circumstances, what would be the result of amending the clause as proposed? It would not only lead to the natives being set an example; which they have not hitherto had, of white men defying the law, but would make it worth the natives' while to assist them to defy it.",58
373,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"The whites, even now, defy the law in this respect.",59
374,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,On l y in isolated cases.,59
375,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,It is said to be general.,59
376,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"On l y an individual here and there, who is not under control, defies the law at the present time. If we passed this amendment we should have practically the whole white community intriguing through the - natives for surreptitious supplies of smuggled alcohol, and should run a greater risk of demoralizing the natives of Papua by the liquor traffic than by any other means we could adopt. My opinion on the subject is worth nothing. I am merely repeating the evidence which has been expressed to me by magistrates, missionaries, and representative miners in Papua. They all tell the same story. They all admit that it would be absolutely impossible to prevent smuggling. We have not such a staff there, nor could we maintain such a staff as would be necessary to prevent the practice. The miners will have the liquor, and if we decide for prohibition, the only result will be to sacrifice revenue, and compel them to smuggle their supplies through the natives, instead of obtaining them, as at present, from the whites at Port Moresby. On behalf of the natives, and in their interests, I would emphasize the views that have been expressed by representative and independent men in Papua. I consulted no persons interested in the liquor traffic, but many others, including-total abstainers, and in every case the verdict was that .there was a much smaller risk to the natives now than would result from the encouraging of smugy-i'ig. It must be remembered that in Papua there is a penalty for supplying any person who is not a European with alcohol. Alcohol must not be supplied, either to .the natives of the country, or to any Kanaka, Malay, or other native who.may be brought there.",59
377,Mr LEE,IO Q,But they are supplied with liquor at the present time:,59
378,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,No . A penalty of £ 2 0 0 and six weeks' imprisonment may be imposed for supplying alcohol to persons other than Europeans.,59
379,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,The reports show that the Kanakas are continually being supplied with alcohol.,59
380,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"That statement refers not to Kanakas living on the island, but to those who fish off the coast and occasionally put in there. There are practically no Kanakas resident in the Territory. This is not a question of having to weigh reason against reason, or fact against fact. The whole weight of testimony secured by me is that it would be impossible to carry out this proposal. That is whyalthough I am. in sympathy with the object which the honourable member for Melboune Ports has in view, and would naturally wish to be on the same side with him- I find it my painful duty to oppose his proposition. Having gone into the question thoroughly, I feel it my duty to speak as decisively as I now do against the amendment, and' to wash my hands of all responsibility for what will be the consequences of carrying it.",59
381,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,What responsibility ?,59
382,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"The responsibility for the evil which will be done the natives by making them smugglers, and then victims of alcohol.",59
383,Mr WATSON,IO Q,No regulation against regulation.,59
384,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"That , argument might be urged against every law in the Decalogue.",59
385,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,"My honourable friend cannot point to any country which is more unfortunately .situated in this respect than is Papua. I assure the honourable member that unless every missionary, every miner, and every official whose testimony I Have heard, be wrong, no one will more regret the course he has taken with the best of intentions than he will. I can understand my honourable friend's devotion to his principle. With him it has been a life-long devotion, and in this State I have always been able to work side by side with him in giving effect to itBut I object to the despotic exercise of power to enforce a restriction which will not be obeyed, and which will be defeated by the white settlers at the expense of the native population, and at the cost of their moral ruin.",59
386,Mr WILKS,IO Q, The ho lorable and learned member for Ballarat has discussed what is really a temperance question with considerable warmth.,59
387,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,I should rather be speakplace ing on the other side if I could do so.,60
388,Mr WILKS,IO Q,"I should prefer to see the honourable and learned member voting for the amendment. His arguments against it are that he fears, first of all, that if the sale of alcohol in British New Guinea were prohibited, there would be a considerable loss of revenue- ",60
389,Mr DEAKIN,IO Q,That is the slightest objection of all.,60
390,Mr WILKS,IO Q,"Then the honourable and learned member says that if we do not allow alcohol to be sold there, smuggling will be sure to take place. Assuming that his argument be correct, the loss of revenue which this proposal would involve would amount to only £ 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. The honourable and learned member, however, has forgotten to put the other side of the question. He has quite overlooked the fact that as long as we continue to allow alcohol to be sold in the Territory, we shall be put to the expense of "" policing "" the islands, and maintaining gaols. We have heard a great deal to-night about the coloured races, and I think it is as well that we should pay some attention to the position of the white settlers in the Island. If the 600 white settlers consume the whole of the liquor which, according to the official returns, is annually introduced into the Territory, I can only say they are the thirstiest individuals of whom I have ever heard. We are told that the liquor is conveyed to the Territory in schooners, and I am inclined to think that the white settlers there must drink it in "" schooners."" In 1902-3, the 500 white residents of New Guinea consumed 1,600 gallons of whisky, 800 gallons of brandy, 140 gallons of gin, 600 gallons of rum, 300 gallons of bottled beer, 4,200 gallons of draught beer, 1,000 gallons of wine, 64 gallons of sparkling wine, and 290 gallons of other liquor. There is a fine liquor bill for 500 whites. If the people of Melbourne and suburbs had the same drinking capacity to the square inch as honourable members would have us believe the white residents in Papua possess, the shares in brewing companies would be of much greater value than they are at present.",60
391,Mr WATSON,IO Q,A number of non-resident traders obtain theirsupplies of liquor at Port Moresby and other ports in Papua.,60
392,Mr WILKS,IO Q,"When it suits the leader of the Opposition he describes Papua as a distant island which no one ever visits, but now he would have us believe that it is a of call for thousands of people who require to replenish their stores of liquor. He will next tell us that it is' in New Guinea that the Japanese procure their extra supplies. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that 100 traders called at New Guinea every year, and obtained supplies of liquor, that would bring up the number of white consumers to 600. Even though the average consumption were in that way reduced by one-sixth, I cannot conceive it to be possible for such a small number of persons to consume such a large quantity of liquor. iThe white population in Papua require a little protection at our hands. We should endeavour to break them off the excessive ""drunk"" in which they have apparently been indulging. I do not know whether their excessive drinking habits are due to the climate or to malaria, or whether they are accounted for by the fact that some of the more thirsty souls from Australia have gravitated there. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat said he did not like the idea of doing anything that would be calculated to encourage smuggling or ill i cit distillation. But the arguments used by the honourable member might, with equal force, apply to the circumstances of every State in the Commonwealth. "" I can assure the honourable and learned member'that he would be astonished if he knew of the large quantities of illicitly distilled spirits which pass down the throats of liquor consumers in the Commonwealth. This is not so much due to dishonesty on the part of hotel-keepers as to malpractice by brewers and wine and spirit merchants. I am not a professional teetotaler in the sense that I belong to any temperance society, but I have from conviction been a total abstainer for many years. Still, I have a very good idea of the drinking capacity of the average man, and I feel convinced that the small number of white residents in Papua could not consume the quantity of liquor imported into that country. The only conclusion at which I can arrive is that a large proportion finds its way into the possession of the natives. You, Mr Chairman, ardently supported the honourable member for Melbourne Ports when he made a proposal of this kind on a former occasion, and I heartily wish that you were in a position to assist us in fighting the opposition which is now being directed to the proposal before us. We all know that the population of many of the South Sea Islands has been - decimated owing to the fact that liquor has been sold to the natives, and we should be careful not to do anything that would bring about similar results in New Guinea, or increase the difficulty of dealing with the native problem in that Territory. If we permit the natives to obtain liquor, and their taste for it is cultivated, we shall have great trouble with them, and will probably have to incur very heavy expense in maintaining order among them. We have, at various times, heard a great deal with reference to temperance reform, and I believe that if we could make our people more temperate we should effect a great improvement in their condition. The leader of the Opposition, and those honourable members who support him, profess to be very anxious to elevate the masses, and they could adopt no surer means of bringing about that result than that of making them more temperate. We now have presented to us an opportunity of experimenting in Papua, and if we adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports we may be in a position, within a short time, to point to that Territory as a glorious' example of the benefits of prohibition. I have much pleasure in supporting the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and I trust that the Committee will repeat - the vote which it recorded upon this matter upon a previous occasion. The only reason which has been urged against the adoption of the proposal is that it will be difficult to give effect to it. But I would point out that the same trouble, is experienced upon the mainland today. Smuggling is rife upon our coastline. Some honourable member with a fair degree of mathematical skill has calculated the consumption of whisky, brandy, and gin per head per annum amongst the population of British New Guinea. I do not propose to quote -.these figures, but they prove' incontestably :that the bulk of the liquor which is consumed there is not consumed by the white population, but by the black. The present affords a splendid opportunity for carrying out an experiment in temperance reform, without any risk nf injury to more than a few people. , Mr Reid - I think that we may congratulate ourselves upon the brevity with which honourable members have addressed themselves, to this question. It is one-which has been before us for some years, and jpropose to imitate the excellent exampleupon-the which has. been set, by making only a very few remarks. I anv as thoroughly in sympathy with the good object of the' honourable member for Melbourne Ports as anybody can be ;- but I confess that the weight of the evidence which has been collected from all sources is so overwhelming that I cannot see any possible-justification for the amendment which has been submitted. It is urged that the proposal is made in the interests of the natives themselves. That would be a most serious matter to consider if it were necessary to do so. But the evidence which has been obtained from every conceivable authority in New Guinea- I do not propose to detain the Committee by making a number of quotations-show s that there is absolutely no abuse in the consumption of intoxicants by the natives of New Guinea, except on the part of a few ""pearl fishers. The great mass of the natives of the Territory indulge in no sort of traffic in spirits, and the laws which are in force in the Possession are absolutely effective. Testimony to that effect is borne by a cloud of witnesses, including missionaries and storekeepers. The District Committee of the London Missionary Society, at a special meeting, dated 16th March,"" unanimously passed a series of resolutions for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government having reference to the liquor laws. These refer to the subject of prohibition, with the general principle of which many of the missionaries agree. I shall quote the final sentence of those resolutions. It reads thusWe are resident in New Guinea solely for the well-being and good of the natives, and in their interests, and for their sakes, we wish to deprecate the passing of this lawThat is, the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports",60
393,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,No ; it was a different proposal then.,61
394,Mr REID,IO Q,"It was ""practically the same proposal, because it is intended to supetsede the local ordinance by an amendment in the direction of prohibition. The resolution saysWe are resident in New Guinea, solely for the well-being and good of the natives', and in their interests, and for their sakes, we wish to depre cate the passing of this law, which, we believe, would lead to the very evil we are all anxious to prevent. I put against fRe views of the honourable ] member for Melbourne' Ports, whose moI tives we all respect, but whose experience subject in this particular part of the world is limited, this recommendation of the missionaries in New Guinea. I say that this formal resolution, which was liquor? passed by the District Committee of - London Missionary Society, and which is signed by Mr W. G. Lawes, who has had thirty years' experience of missionary >in the Possession-especiall y when it is considered in conjunction with the testiare mony of other witnesses, which is set forth in this Parliamentary paper-show s the dreadful evils which the honourable ber anticipates do not exist; that the - law is sufficiently effective to prevent-them; pathy. and that the natives of New Guinea-lik e most other members of the aboriginal races --d o not seem to possess any taste for toxicants.",61
395,Mr WILKS,IO Q,They will soon acquire it.,62
396,Mr REID,IO Q,"It is a taste that can"" acquired very suddenly, even by white people. In support of the views which are entertained by the District Committee of the London Missionary Society, I shall quote only two witnesses. One .of these Mr Lawes, who is perluips one of the most eminent authorities in New Guinea, where he has been located as a missionary for thirty years. He says that the present is good, that no liquor is sold to natives under it, and that none Ts consumed by natives at the present time.",62
397,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Ye t in the same report such a desire. there is a list of fines imposed for breaches of the law. , Mr Reid - Of course, Mr Lawes does not pretend to be omniscient, but that the result of his thirty years experience. One of the Roman Catholic missionaries, who has been in New Guinea for ten declares that there is no such thing sale of liquor to the natives. He says The laws of the Possession dealing with sale of alcoholic liquors generally, have carefully observed; arid especially concerning 'the sale to the natives, I do not remember example of violations of the same prohibition, least in our district at Mekeo. That gentleman says that to his knowledge there is no sale of liquor to the natives, that the law in this respect has been actly observed. He goes on to sayI know not of a single case of a white giving alcoholic liquor to natives, except twice to a dying man. In this district the .do not consume any alcohol. - That sort of testirnony runs right through the evidence, and it supports the recomunder mendations of the Lieutenant-Governor his predecessor,'and-also those of the don Missionary Society's committee.",62
398,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,"Who . consumes all the the - Mr Reid - If there are white people about, especially in a country of this sort, that would account for the enormous conwork sumption of liquor. The honourable member does nol suppose that the missionaries making false statements in order to conceal a traffic which is destructive to the that bodies and souls of the New Guinea memnatives? That is a spirit of teetotal inliquor temperance with which I have no sym",62
399,Mr MAUGER,IO Q,The right honourable gen-' tleman would not follow the missionaries' inadvice in the matter of a White Australia?,62
400,Mr REID,IO Q,"This is a question of fact. The missionaries are asked if this poison is be destroying the New Guinea blacks, and the answer is that the natives do not drinkthat there is no sale of liquor to them. Surely the honourable member has some respect for the veracity of the men whose is names I have mentioned, although his own views may not be helped by the testimony. The plain English of the matter is that some of our friends desire to make an experiment law of despotism and tyranny over their white fellow-subjects of the King in New Guinea - to bring about a state of tilings which does not exist in any part of the British Empire today. I have no sympathy with",62
401,Mr LEE,IO Q,"What about Clutha, in New Zealand ?",62
402,Mr FOWLER,IO Q,"That is local option; give is the New Guinea people local option, and let them act for themselves.",62
403,Mr REID,IO Q,"I have never believed in the years, right of any number of people to deas the cide whether a man shall or shall not drink. We should not like to give any the people such a power over ourselves. Howbeen ever, the object in view is such a noble one any that we can have no impatience with temperat ance advocates. Every one must have the greatest admiration for the good results which have attended the patriotic labours of and the temperance bodies. No one feels more exkeenly that I do the great services those bodies have rendered to humanity. But man in dealing with this particular position, we once or must follow the lines of policy, so far as natives the whites of New Guinea are concerned, that we follow for ourselves. We must not interfere with personal libeity, except the proper exercise of political power. and What is suggested is a despotic exercise of Lonpower in regard to the private wants of individuals, and that is a power which no » democratic Parliament should exercise over white men, or over black men for that matter.",62
404,Mr STORRER,IO Q,What about the matter of the franchise which was mentioned just now ?,63
405,Mr REID,IO Q,"In the matter of the personal consumption of aliquid, the rights of men ought to be considered as well as the rights of Parliament. The proposal, in my opinion, interferes with the right of a man to his own liberty. I admit there are numbers who do not agree with me, and who think that the extent and the 1 importance of the good achieved warrants .an invasion of liberty. But my point is that we have taken no such step in regard to Australia, and we have no right to perform this heroic experiment on a few whites in New Guinea, simply because we happen to have the power. Why not go a little further, and create a dietary scale or a system of healthy clothing?",63
406,Mr CROUCH,IO Q,O r insist on vaccination ?,63
407,Mr REID,IO Q,"All sorts of laws of the kind might be taken in hand. able members know, members of the Government have previously voted on this question as private members, and, of course, they must be allowed on this. occasion to vote as they did when acting as individuals. I would not ask any colleague of mine, who had voted in accordance with his convictions as a private member, to so far sacrifice his principles as to now vote as I do. Each member of the Ministry will vote as he previously voted. We are giving to this dependencv legislative and administrative power, and I think we may safely leave this matter to the authorities there. Accor ling to the reports and evidence, the local management of the liquor traffic has worked for good. It appears that has been practically no abuse of the traffic in regard to the natives, and that is the main point. The fact that the administ r at is of the law has proved good in its effects is a strong practical reason for leaving this matter to the bodies we have consi ituted for dealing with the internal affairs of the dependencv.",63
408,Mr WATSON,IO Q," I do not desire to delay the Committee, because, in the first place, it seems to me that the arguments for the side on which I intend to vote have been put by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat in as clear and summary a manner as is possible. The honourable and learned member has had a longer experience in office than have most of us in the Chamber, and, therefore, has had an opportunity to make himself acquainted with the official facts to a greater extent than has the present Prime Minister or other honourable members. I think that the honourable and learned .member put the arguments against this proposition wellj and all I desire to do is to emphasize the vote I gave on the last occasion. I then entered somewhat lengthily into the subject, and expressed the opinion that apart altogether from the desirability or otherwise of enforcing prohibition-especially in a territory such as New Guint a, with a large black population - there is. the absolute certainty, if we are to judge by results of similar legislatioi elsewhere, that smuggling would be encouraged to such an extent that nothing effective in the way of prohibition could be accomplished. We all have the utmost anxiety that the natives shall riot be in any way deteriorated by the consumption of liquor. It is a duty we owe to the natives not to subject them to temptation, but, at the same time,, we have As honor- to recognise that in New Guinea we have a totally new or different"" set of circumstances, compared with those which exist upon the mainland of Australia. There we have a long coast-line to begin with. We have the proximity of the Dutch and German territories,' and we have islands within a very short distance. Take our own State of Queensland, where liquor is: obtainable in any quantity, and ""can be conveyed across to British New Guinea in a. few hours. Is it likely that, when men are anxious for liquor, and when there are opportunities of obtaining it, they will foregoits use? A premium will be put upon smuggling, and in a district like that, wherethere are very few whites, it is almost imthere possible to prevent it. In regard to any' proposal such as the prohibition of the sale of liquor, it is almost impossible, it seems to me, even in highly civilized communities, and with all the forces of the Government, and with the assistance of the' police, ancf everything of that kind, to enforce it satisfactorily, unless you have public opinionwith you. In New Guinea what public sentiment there is is distinctly against the proposal to enforce prohibition. The .whitepeople have declared against the idea. Leaving the officials out of the account, because they are bound by their oaths to administer their offices, the bulk of the white population will see no moral offence whatever in getting liquor if they can; and, naturally, they will get it under existing conditions. T 9 think a very grave error will be permitted if Parliament passes a law as proposed the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I can sympathize with the object he has in view, and, if anything can be done to safeselves guard the interests of the black population against intoxicating liquors, I shall be quite prepared to help to the fullest degree. But I see no hope of that being done effectively by the methods proposed. Indeed, I rather think they will have the opposite effect, that injury rather than good will result the present proposal.",63
409,Mr JOHNSON,IO Q," For once I in find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and I cerRev. tainly do not share the pessimistic views which have been expressed by the honourable members who have opposed this posal. In regard to the question of smuggling, upon which so much stress has been laid, I would point out that that is a risk which will have to be taken in any case. As a matter of fact, smuggling now goes on fishing boats. to a very large extent, and it will go on under any system. As to the Prime Minister's argument, based upon the report are which he read, I wish to point out that, so of far from those arguments appearing to me which to be against prohifjltion, they seem to be in favour of it, because they show that there will be a minimum amount of opposition the principle owing to the alleged absteman saysmiousness of the white population. What we need to dp is not to wait until these the evils arise, and then attack them, but prevent them from arising if we possibly can. The honourable and learned member of for Ballarat said that this is a black question. It certainly is. It is the native population that we require to protect in a special degree. The argument that they are age not addicted to the use of alcoholic stimuable lants at present, to my mind, ought not be used as it has been employed as a reason for putting temptation in their way. black races are naturally abstemious, almission though they acquire the drinking habit from the white population very readily. need to place as many obstacles as possible in the way of their securing drink. The best thing we can do is to prohibit the introduction of alcoholic stimulants to New Guinea. The same applies to the opium cessity traffic. This policy will afford us an opbut portunity to watch the practical results piohibition. The very fact that the climate of British New Guinea is tropical is an by excess. argument for prohibition, because every one knows that a tropical climate is disastrous 10 R to those who are in the habit of using by alcohol to any extent. Now that we have an opportunity to prohibit the use of alcohol in British New Guinea, we should avail ourof it. It is very desirable to make the experiment. When the white population increases, if that experiment is not successf u l , they will be able to make an effective demand for the repeal of the law. As against the reports which have been quoted and by the Prime Minister, other reports of a from totally different character might be mentioned. I do not intend to go into these extenso, but I will read an extract from one report, which is typical of many. The E. Pryce Jones, who has had five years' experience as a missionary, saysTlhe present law is too lax in the prosecution proof drunken Kanakas, and such like Evidently Kanakas are able to get intoxicants now.",64
410,Mr WILKINSON,IO Q,They come from the,64
411,Mr JOHNSON,IO Q," These men have native wives, and in every way identified with native life, and the danger the spread of drinking habits among the Papuans is here. Also the Kanaka etiquette, forbids the refusal to share with their fellows, is a cause of the others obtaining drink. to Then in regard to prohibition, this gentle The result of prohibition will be to decrease revenue, which, in view of the grave dangers to of drink, is of little consequence. I share that view. The loss of revenue is very little importance in the light of the man's evils against which we have to guard. For medical purposes prohibition does not touch alcohol. The use of alcoholic drink as a beverin hospitals depends on the principle, favoror otherwise, of the medical officer in charge. to The proposed amendment intends to go beyond the medical officer, and to allow other The properly appointed persons to grant perfor the use of alcohol. That would overcome the difficulty that has been menWe tioned about obtaining medical sanction in every case owing to there being only two medical practitioners in the Territory. Prohibition will create a sense of injustice in the minds of those who feel alcohol to be a neof their life, even as opium, eaters will , it will be an undoubted blessing to them notwithstanding. This does not refer to the miners of only, but to many others who are not so employed, who are evidently, destroying themselves Prohibition would place one more difficulty in the way of getting alcohol. The more difficulties are placed in the way of getting it the better it will be for the population, whether white or blackIn order to carry out such a law, it would be necessary to see that the Government officials who would have to administer the law were pathetic with its principles. Those officials, may themselves be habitual inebriates, could hardly be expected to be zealous in the adminisbeen tration of such a law. It would be necessary also, I think, to extend the law to Torres Straits and Northern Queensland. It would be necesan sary to increase the staff of sympathetic Government magistrates, and, having done this, ment alone would prove effectual or otherwise. There would be a slight lessening of revenue as a result of its adoption. The tendency would be to improve, posbe sibly the morals, really the health, of the excessive drinker. I have set forward the views of these misremarks sionaries in opposition to the opinions pressed by admittedly equally good authoripassed ties on the other side. The subject has exercised the minds of a very large body my constituents, and in supporting amendment I am endeavouring to give effect, not only to their opinion, but also to the pledges which T gave during my recent electoral campaign.",64
412,Mr REID,IO Q,"As we are to have an early sitting tomorrow, and a number of honourable members wish' to speak on this subject, I shall not ask the Committee to deal with the amendment to-night. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. COALING OF WARSHIPS - REPOR T OF THE rule NA DEFENCE PROPOSALS. Motion (by Mr Reid) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",65
413,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON," I wish be to direct the attention of the Prime Minmighttoadopt ister to a matter of some importance to a with the loading section of the people of Fremantle. Honourable members may have read a few days ago press reports of a disturbance which occurred at that port in connection with visit of the flagship of the Australian Squadron. It was only by the exercise great care by. the leaders of the Lumpers' Union there that a serious strike was averted. The facts are these: The of Euryalus, under Vice-Admiral Fanshaw, visited the port of Fremantle, and was take some 2,000 tons of coal from the laide Steam-ship Company's Winfield, which was brought there for the purpose. Eighty or a hundred of the lumpers of the port were engaged by the foreman company to transfer the coal from the Winfield to the Euryalus, and having that engagement they refused other work. On presenting themselves at the appointed time, however, they were surprised to learn that symthe Admiral had issued orders that his bluewho jackets were to do the work. If that has the practice at other Australian ports, it is not generally known. I do not say that the Admiral has not the right to issue such order, though there is a difference beexperitween an ordinary coaling in Sydney Harbor and a coaling at a port like Fremantle. If , however, there is any general rule, it should be made known, so that there may no repetition of the occurrence of which I complain. When interviewed by a press reporter, the Vice-Admiral made sarcastic about his own men looking on while exa few gentlemen smoked their pipes and the coal in deliberately. I do not think that he need have gone out of his of way to make reflections on the members of the the Fremantle Lumpers' Union. I am aware that the Squadron is not under our direct control; but, seeing that we pay a subsidy of ^200,000 a year towards its upkeep",65
414,Mr REID,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,And get value for the money.,65
415,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,"I do not dispute that. I wish, however, to avoid a repetition of what might lead to serious disturbances, and, therefore, I ask the Prime Minister to take steps to ascertain why this oider was given, and whether there is any in connection with the matter. If there is such a rule it should be made widely known. It might also be suggested to the Vice-Admiral that, as it has been the practice in Australian ports for shore labour to employed in the transfer of cargoes from ship wharf, and from ship to ship, he a similar practice in connection of vessels of war.",65
416,Sir JOHN FORREST,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON," I should like to ask the Minister of Dethe fence whether he is agreeable that the report of the General Officer Commanding of on the defence proposals of ,the Government should be printed ? It is very inconvenient that there should be only one copy the report for honourable members to refer to. I should like to have a copy for to my own use, that I might be able to read 1 Adeit carefully, and I know that some other honourable members desire it also. I have no wish to press the matter, but if there is no objection, I should be very much obliged 1 of that if the report could be printed.",65
417,Mr MCCAY,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON," I have not previously suggested that the report in question should be that printed, but knowing that the right honornot able member for Swan and other honourable members desire to be supplied with copies of it, I shall make such arrangements as influential may be necessary to provide copies of the report without incurring unnecessary pense.",66
418,Mr REID,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON," I really do not feel terms of sufficient intimacy with the miral in command of the Squadron, in my official or private capacity, to make all the suggestions to him which orable member for Fremantle has submitted. I do not claim the right to municate with the Admiral on any of the subjects mentioned. I would suggest that if any inconvenience is being caused to any body of our fellow-citizens while engaged in their honourable avocations, it might cur to themselves to 'ascertain what the practice in these matters is to be.",66
419,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,Surely it is the place of the Government to take action in matter ?,66
420,Mr REID,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,"It is entirely a business matter between business members of the community and the Admiral commanding the Squadron, and I cannot consent to become the intermediary between him and them. I do not propose to interfere in any matter in connection with which I have not some authority. There are a number of other persons who might - make the representations to which the honourable member has referred. These are not matters which concern the Federal Government in any sense. The question of the coal supply at any port, or the labour used in conveying coal from one port to another, is not one which concerns the Federal Government.",66
421,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,The Squadron is engaged by the Federal Government.,66
422,Mr REID,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,"It is avery great mistake to say that the Squadron is engaged by the Federal Government. My honourable friend should remember that the Federal Govern. ment does not secure control of His Majesty's Fleets by the payment of a subsidy of ,£200,000 a year.",66
423,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,3 am not saying that they do.,66
424,Mr REID,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,"Then why does the honourable member use the word "" control "" ?",66
425,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,"I said that we had no control over the Squadron. IO R 2 Mr Reid , - I am ready at all times to do anything in reason, but I really feel these are representations which I should be asked to make. The business authorities of the port could make them very much better. The Coal Lumpers' Union is a very business like body, having branches in ail the ports of Australia, and I exam sure that in connection with any matter concerning their own business the Admiral of commanding the Squadron would be very on ready to give them the fullest information, Adin order that they might not be exposed either any inconvenience in the future.",66
426,Mr CARPENTER,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,Is . not the matter one the honorof public importance?,66
427,Mr REID,GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING ON,"They would get nO better cominformation if I were to take it up. Their right to a courteous consideration of a matter affecting their own business interests will be fully recognised by the officer in command of the Squadron, and he will give them all octhe information they require. They have not asked me to represent them in any way, and the fact that the honourable member has asked me to interfere in the matter does such a not make it my business to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative House adjourned at 11.14 p.m.",66
