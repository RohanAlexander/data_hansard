4,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (12.33 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bill amends six acts administered within the communications and the arts portfolio. The main amendments are those made to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing scheme. The other amendments make minor policy changes to enhance existing schemes, improve mechanisms for implementing them, and make minor drafting changes. I will refer in turn to each of the acts being amended. Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 The amendment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 repeals section 70 of the act. This removes the requirement for the ABC to obtain ministerial approval prior to entering into lease-back arrangements and contracts above a set threshold, currently set by regulation at $2 million. The government considers that responsibility for entering into contracts and lease-back arrangements should be a matter for the board and management of the ABC consistent with their overall responsibility for the financial management of the ABC. Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973 The bill amends the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973 to make minor changes relating to the operation of the school. The amendments extend participation in the management of the school by enabling part-time staff who have been employed with the school for more than 12 months or who have a 12-month contract of employment to vote for, and stand for election for, the staffelected position on the school's council. The bill also reduces the number of council members required to form a quorum at a council meeting from six to five. Broadcasting Services Act 1992 The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to clarify a number of drafting anomalies and to adopt current Commonwealth practice of expressing maximum financial penalties in terms of 'penalty units', in accordance with section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914. Minor technical amendments are made to certain definitions to clarify that Australian drama content requirements placed on subscription television broadcasting licences are not confined to satellite services, but apply to all subscription television broadcasting services devoted primarily to drama, as specified in section 102 of the act. The amendments will also clarify that the penalty provisions and enforcement powers of the Australian Broadcasting Authority relating to breaches of the ownership and control rules also apply to subscription television broadcasting licences, as originally intended. Radiocommunications Act 1992 The main purposes of the proposed amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 are to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing scheme which has resulted from a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency, SMA, and to make improvements in relation to various operational issues identified since the SMA commenced operations on 1 July 1993. Submissions to the apparatus licence inquiry conducted by the SMA generally supported a proposal to allow transfer of an apparatus licence with no change to the terms and conditions applying to the licence. The Radiocommunications Act is to be amended to allow a licensee to transfer an apparatus licence to another person. When the licence is transferred, it will remain in force for the balance of the original term of the licence. The transferred licence will also be subject to the same conditions as applied to the licence immediately before the transfer. The amendments give the SMA the power to make a disallowable determination that certain types of licences are not to be transferred, or specifying circumstances in which a licence may not be transferred. The amendments will enable the SMA to accredit persons to issue frequency assignment certificates and take into account such certifiBroadcasting cates in its licensing decisions. A frequency assignment certificate will certify that the operation of a device will not unacceptably interfere with radiocommunications. These amendments are proposed in response to representations from industry participants that the SMA should have powers to accredit persons for this purpose. The act currently provides that licences, including short-term licences, may be issued only in compliance with the spectrum plan or relevant frequency band plans. This provision restricts the flexibility of the SMA to deal with major public events such as the Australian Grand Prix. An amendment is proposed to enable the SMA to issue short-term licences to deal with such events. These short-term licences will be limited to terms of 30 days and may be renewed only once. The bill inserts new provisions intended to improve the scheme under part 4.1 of the act which requires compliance of radiocommunications equipment with standards, technical licence specifications and class licences. These new provisions reflect schemes in Europe for the monitoring of compliance with quality assurance programs in the manufacture or importation of radio communications devices, and will allow the SMA to publish a notice in the Gazette requiring manufacturers or importers of devices to conduct quality assurance programs or ensure that such programs are conducted in relation to the devices they are manufacturing or importing. The amendments extend the scheme which allows penalties to be paid by persons in lieu of prosecution under the act. The amendments will allow for the payment of a fine in lieu of prosecution for offences relating to class licences. Such a provision applies in respect of other licence types and this amendment will correct an anomaly in the current provisions. The bill contains various other minor amendments to the Radiocommunications Act and these are explained in the explanatory memorandum. Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 The bill repeals section 67 of the Special Service Act 1991 to remove the requirement for the SBS to obtain ministerial approval prior to entering into contracts above a set threshold, currently $2 million. The government considers that responsibility for entering into contracts should be a matter for the board and management of the SBS, consistent with their overall responsibility for the financial management of the SBS. Telecommunications Act 1991 The bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1991 to adopt current Commonwealth practice of expressing maximum financial penalties in terms of 'penalty units' in accordance with section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914. Financial Impact It is not possible to make a firm estimate the financial impact of the proposed amendments to the Radiocommunications Act. The proposed provision for the transfer of apparatus licences will involve a transfer fee which is currently proposed by the SMA to be $30 to reflect the cost of administration involved. Payment of such fees should therefore offset any direct administrative costs. There is otherwise no direct cost or revenue benefit to the Commonwealth. Transferability of licences is likely to result in a secondary market for exchange of licences. This is seen to have positive effects for the economy through facilitation of provision of services but the financial effects cannot be quantified. The provision to require quality assurance programs to be conducted for equipment will improve overall quality of Australian manufactured, or imported, products and will produce a source of further work for providers of quality assurance certification in Australia. The other amendments in the bill are not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the bill to the House.",11
5,Dr KEMP,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"The Communications and thfacte Arts Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 amends six pieces of legislation in the communications and the arts portfolio. These are: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983; the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973; the Broadcasting Services Act 1992; the Radiocommunications Act 1992; the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991; and the Telecommunications Act 1991. I will first address the proposed amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act and the Special Broadcasting Service Act. The bill seeks to amend both these pieces of legislation to remove the requirement that ministerial approval be obtained prior to the ABC or SBS entering into contracts or leaseback arrangements of over $2 million in value. The government has argued that the ABC board should be fully and clearly accountable for ABC activities under the ABC act and, similarly, SBS and its board. The government is of the opinion that section 70 of the ABC of act and section 67 of the SBS act run contrary to this intention and fail to operate as an effective prudential control as the minister does not have access to commercial information which would enable them to make informed decisions on contracts. It is argued that by repealing these sections the boards of the ABC and SBS will be made clearly accountable as they would have full responsibility for ensuring appropriate contract and lease-back arrangements for their respective organisations. The ABC has supported the proposed amendments, claiming that it is presently required to obtain ministerial approval on some 30 to 40 occasions each year. The requirement imposed on it by section 70 of the ABC act is anachronistic-and this is its view-as it feels that prudential supervision is now concentrated at the macro level by way of corporate plans. It further claims that it is highly unlikely that a minister would ever veto a board decision as this would be seen to be interfering with the board. SBS has sought ministerial approval under section 67 of the SBS act on at least one occasion in the last 12 months. The coalition has concerns with these proposed amendments. It must be remembered that the vast proportion of the ABC's finances and the finances of SBS are derived from parliamentary appropriation. The Friends of the ABC have also voiced opposition to these proposals, arguing that the ABC belongs to taxpayers and not to the ABC board. There is considerable public concern that the ABC board has allowed management to devote scarce resources to a number of non-core activities such as ABC Enterprises, Australia TV International, the BNA Wire Service and forays into pay television, and that it has become increasingly involved in commercial ventures to which significant risks are attached. As a result of our concern, to express these concerns, the coalition will be moving amendments to this bill which will require the ABC and SBS to notify the minister 14 days in advance of an intention to enter into any such contracts under the relevant sections of these two pieces of legislation. The government claims that the responsibility for these decisions should rest with the boards of the ABC and SBS and that these national broadcasters should be able to make decisions on their financial management without government scrutiny. It is claimed that the minister will not have access to detailed commercial information needed to make an informed decision about the appropriateness of these contracts or arrangements. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee)-sometimes referred to as 'little Sir Echo'-would welcome the abrogation of responsibility that this bill seeks to implement. The ABC's argument that it would be highly unlikely for a minister to veto a decision of the board rings especially true in this minister's case. Unless he were prompted to do something by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) he would do little but sit on his hands, waiting to be told what to do next. Were the ABC or the SBS to seek ministerial approval he would assent to it without demur, not because he does not want to be seen to be interfering but because he finds it very difficult to take decisions. The rhetoric the government is using to justify changing the legislation in the manner it proposes rings hollow. As David Hill, the former executive director of the ABC, indicated at his farewell, there is a growing perception-I would say a reality-that appointments to the ABC board are increasingly being made as a result of political affiliation. One of these appointees is John Bannon, the ex-Premier of South Australia. Rod Cameron-that great expert in communications-the ALP's pollster for many years, has become a member of the board. Wendy Silver has been appointed to the board. Throughout Australia there is growing concern at the way in which the government, in its dying year, is stacking many of these statutory authorities with failed Labor politicians and fellow travellers of the Labor Party. This is particularly tragic for a body such as the ABC, which is there to represent the national interests and to ensure that programming and development decisions are made on behalf of all Australians. The voters of South Australia were at a loss to see the special qualities that John Bannon brought to that position in the wake of the failure of the State Bank in that state. They would wonder why the Labor Party's pollster and strategic adviser has been placed on the board of the national broadcaster. I am sure David Hill was absolutely correct when he said that there was growing concern in the community over the perception and reality of political power being abused in appointments to the ABC board. The minister in this case, once again, has assented to this abuse of power. I do not say that he is the moving force behind these appointments-it is very likely that these appointments come from on high-but he has gone along with them. It is not surprising that the board and the government now feel there should be no need-it would be demeaningto seek the minister's approval for substantial expenditure of taxpayers' money. As there is a perception of a loss of independence by the board, and as it is moving in directions that give rise to concern, there is a greater need to ensure some degree of scrutiny and responsibility on the part of the minister. There must be a balancing act between, on the one hand, the boards of the ABC and SBS and, on the other, standards of ministerial accountability and responsibility for the moneys appropriated by this parliament for the use of these broadcasting bodies. The coalition will carefully monitor the activities of these two bodies and carefully scrutinise their financial reports. If the taxpayers are to pay for the services of the ABC and SBS, we will ensure those services are not jeopardised because the minister is incapable of taking action to divert any potential financial - isaster as a result of the operation of these amendments, assuming the government's amendments are accepted. If their boards take these bodies into areas of high risk investment resulting in losses to the taxpayers, we certainly will not be a party to allowing the minister to shirk his responsibilition ty. The changes which the bill seeks to make to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act to allow part-time staff of the school who have been employed for 12 months or more, or who have a 12-month contract of employment, to vote for, and stand for election to, the staff elected positions on the council and to reduce the number of council members required to form a quorum at a council meeting from six to five are not contentious in our view. The coalition does not oppose them. The. Broadcasting Services Act 1992 is amended by this bill to extend the current local content provisions, which at present apply only to satellite licensees, to all subscription services. The bill clarifies the cumstances in which the Australian Broadcasting Authority can deem that a drama program made wholly or substantially in Australia is not Australian. The bill provides for the appointment of associate members of the ABA for general purposes rather than for specific purposes, as is the case at present. Some minor drafting anomalies are corrected by the bill to clarify that certain ownership and control provisions and ABA corrective remedies also apply to subscription television licences. The final amendment is to express monetary penalties in the act in penalty unit terms. There is no financial impact from these changes, and we do not oppose them. The amendments which the bill makes to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 consists of minor changes which are designed to increase the flexibility of the radiocommunications regulatory regime by implementing the recommendations of the 'Review of apparatus licensing', conducted by the Spectrum Management Agency during 1994. There are three types of radiocommunications licence. An apparatus licence applies to a particular piece of equipment and is not currently transferable, although it may be sold as an asset of a corporation along with the corporation. Previously the SMA could not issue an apparatus licence to a person whose licence had been cancelled in the last two years. In cases where a person or a corporaheld several licences, one cancellation could result in the inability to have any of their licenses renewed for the next two years. In making the decision to issue a licence, the SMA will be required simply to have regard to the fact of licence cancellation during the preceding two years rather than this acting as an automatic disqualification for the grant of an apparatus licence. Under the legislation as it currently stands, the SMA must strictly comply with the published frequency band plan. The bill amends the act to allow the SMA to issue apparatus licences for up to 30 days for oneoff events, notwithstanding the provision of the frequency band plan. At present, any conditions on classes of apparatus licences are imposed by regulations. The bill allows such cir- conditions to be laid down in the form of disallowable instruments drafted by the SMA. In addition, the current requirement for the SMA to notify all relevant licence holders of a change to licence conditions, and to give reasons for any decision to refuse a licence renewal, will be replaced by giving the licence holder the right to request the SMA's reasons for any such change or refusal. An apparatus licence is not transferable but may be sold as an asset of a corporation along with the corporation. As I have said, the amendments in this bill will enable licences to be transferred directly by a process of application to the SMA, which must have regard to all the circumstances. The SMA may determine by disallowable instrument certain types of apparatus licence which are not transferable. At present the SMA may require manufacturers or importers to label radiocommunications equipment to indicate compliance with technical standards determined by the SMA. The bill amends the legislation to impose a maximum penalty for non-compliance of $2,000. The SMA may also require manufacturers or importers to conduct testing, to label equipment and to keep relevant records. This provision has been introduced to bring Australia into line with European standards, particularly with regard to radio interference generated by radiocommunications devices. The amendments also allow the SMA to accept frequency assignment certificates issued by accredited external bodies as evidence that the equipment satisfies technical standards set by the SMA. This will enable the SMA to outsource equipment testing. The final amendment made by this legislation is to exempt regulations made under section 314(1) from the operation of section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This means that any regulation referring to a second regulation will not need to be redrafted each time the second regulation is redrafted. As the proposed amendments increase the flexibility of the system, the coalition does not oppose them. The only change with a direct financial impact will be the introduction of transferable apparatus licences. It is pated that there will be ari administrative charge of $30 per transfer, which is expected to offset any increased administrative costs. The final piece of legislation amended by the bill is the Telecommunications Act 1991. The change made to this legislation is to express monetary penalties in penalty unit terms. The coalition does not oppose these amendments.",13
6,Mr LATHAM,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"I wish to address a number of the provisions of the Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill, within the framework of national policies for communications and the arts. This is an area of rapidly changing public policy, rapidly changing because of the transformation of communications technology and new developments in the arts in Australia The role of public policy must be to anticipate these changes in technology and culture and to establish a framework for, firstly, a competitive market; secondly, consumer choice and satisfaction; thirdly, advantages through new forms of content and communications; and, fourthly, addressing the issue of basic access rights for all Australian citizens irrespective of their income background or their location. I note that government policy thus far has addressed the question of changing technology. The government has produced reports about the development of the so-termed information superhighway. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has been keen to emphasise the enormous benefits for Australia in the content of communications derived from new technology. I wish to broaden the debate and suggest that while technology is important and, unquestionably, content is important, it may well be, when devising sound policies throughout the nation, that basic access rights are the most important issue for policy makers. There is evidence already of how competition in the telecommunications sector is accelerating the arrival of the information superhighway in Australia. A lot of the credit for the pro-competitive policy announced in the past 12 months goes to the minister for communications. The key anticidecision-perhaps not enough attention was given to it by media commentators, academics and even this parliament-late last year was to prohibit the establishment of regional monopolies in the cabling for the information superhighway. Not enough attention was paid to it, but I regard that pro-competitive decision in telecommunications as perhaps the most important public policy decision this decade. It has led to the finalisation of the ownership of consortia involved in the industry. It has also led to pro-competitive influences as now Optus Vision and Foxtel compete aggressively not only for market share but for the earliest possible entry to the market. Competition on the cabling has led to each side aggressively seeking early entry, to get its cable in first and advance its market share. This is happening not just in pay television, but has accelerated the delivery of telephony services through the advent of Optus Vision and its prospects in the local telephone market. It has also substantially accelerated the impending arrival of interactive broadband services in Australia. Optus took the bold step initially of undertaking contracts with electricity distributors such as Prospect council in my electorate to wire up the electricity poles for its communications network on the information superhighway. Foxtel then responded aggressively, matching this with an attempt to get its broadband interactive services into the market much earlier than had been envisaged and planned. We should contrast this pro-competitive model of jostling and manoeuvring by the two consortia with the policy of the opposition. Senator Alston said he wanted regional monopolies. He wanted Foxtel and Optus Vision to sit around the table with the governrange ment and slice up the Sydney, Melbourne and other markets around the country for their own convenience. Under that system, there would not have been the sort of competition and manoeuvring we have had in recent months. That is a good indication of where, on legislation such as this, the real competitive influences and drive rest. There is no question of this government being pro-competitive in telecommunications. It is going to deliver the improvements in technology and better consumer outcomes much earlier than those opposite had they been allowed to introduce a policy of regional monopoly. Pro-competition policy in telecommunications is a big asset. I am delighted that we have a pro-competition minister, Mr Lee, leading the debate in all sorts of forums about the benefits of competition. The point is that the government, in response to the acceleration in technology, competitive environment and consumer opportunities, must also accelerate its attempts to address these key access issues-that is, have regard to the technology, have regard to the important content benefits, but also address fundamentally these key access questions; It is much more than a cliche. It is much more than emerging rhetoric to talk about an information poor and information rich society-living standards in our society and opportunities being defined by the access that citizens have to basic information technology. Already the data is fairly clear. On average, 30 per cent of Australians earning less than $30,000 per annum have it computer at home, whereas 61 per cent earning more than $50,000 per annum have a home computer. On the figures produced by the ABS, already there is a clear differential, based on income, in the sort of access that Australians have to this important technology. The emergence of the new technology has the potential to transform the role of information in our society. The digital highway is a single, interactive system linking telephones, television, cables and computers over optical fibres and other media. It will provide to Australian homes and businesses an extensive of information services such as pay TV, home shopping, interactive games, video conferencing, open learning, data interchange and all sorts of community information. Any communications network which is capable of transmitting the discrete information units used by computers could become part of the superhighway---even the lines strung between the Prospect electricity telephone poles in the streets of Werriwa. These networks include telephone copper wires, coaxial cables, optical fibres, microwave links or even wireless and satellite systems stretching across the globe. Computer networks such as Internet are already on the highway. I was delighted-and I think this was prompted by the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans )-to receive a letter from the Speaker notifying members of the impending availability of Internet for this place. Who said that politicians are Luddites? Who said that politicians are backward in taking advantage of the technological advances? I sit next to the member for Bonython here and I take his good advice on all these questions and will continue to do so. The complexity of these technological issues has challenged the capacity of information policy makers in Australia. The fragmentation of responsibilities across the federal bureaucracy has made difficult the development of a national information policy. For a party such as ours, a government interested in equity, issues of information and access are all important. Politicians understand well the old dictum that information is power. With the information superhighway emerging as a toll road where consumers pay capital and user charges to bring sophisticated information into their homes and businesses, lanes of public access should be set aside for those who cannot afford to pay the toll. I am a well-known campaigner against all sorts of tolls, as is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who is at the table. We cannot overcome the existence of user charges on the information superhighway, but we can provide free lanes of public access; otherwise, a new division of social inequity will emerge between the information rich and the information poor. The providers of superhighway products will be corporate combinations of telecommunications carriers, entertainment organisations and computer software manufacturers. The best example of that in Australia is the formation of the Foxtel consortium. Current cross-media standards will become redundant as the technology demands convergence of ownership and operation. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has already foreshadowed how cross-media rules would need to be re-examined in the medium term in response to the changes in technology. It is essential for the federal government to set a policy framework with safety net provisions of access and affordability which anticipate the corporate plans of the big players. The convergence of technology and ownership would give immense public power to a handful of unelected, unaccountable giants. Information really is power. There has been no better demonstration of this in recent months than the policy of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) to define newspapers as a single industry, send the matter off to Trade Practices Commission and allow new entrants, such as Kerry Packer, open access rights. Two important assets are available for the federal government in guaranteeing low income earners access to and affordability on the superhighway. First, public authorities such as Telstra and the ABC, a subject of this legislation, can play a countervailing role in the public interest. Second, Australia's extensive network of public education buildings, primary schools and libraries offer an opportunity for affordable public access points on the information highway. In the United States, the Clinton administration, spearheaded by Vice-President Al Gore, has set a goal of providing sophisticated interactive communications to every school, every library, every hospital in the United States by the year 2000. It is hoped that advanced telecommunications in public institutions will spur demand for cabling into homes. In turn, the promise of a robust consumer market should provide the telecommunications industry with an incentive to pay to wire public institutions. I note also from a briefing by Optus Vision officials to our caucus communications committeeMr Ronaldson interjecting",16
7,Mr LATHAM,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"We talk to both Optus Vision and Foxtel, unlike the opposition, which has a greater interest on one side of the media fence through vested interests exposed fully in the public debate in recent times. Mr Ronaldson-The language has changed a bit.",18
8,Mr LATHAM,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"The member for Ballarat cannot deny those things. As the shadow minister for education and, as I learnt from debates last year, a keen supporter of public libraries, at least he should display some basic interest in these key affordability and access questions. Mr Ronaldson interjecting",18
9,Mr LATHAM,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"There is no question that Optus Vision will be adopting a marketing method of using its own resources up-front to wire into schools, libraries and other public institutions to generate the public demand necessary to get volume through on its netthe work. That marketing strategy, in the first instance, is designed to connect parents at home with the technology used in the learning environment of their children at school. This potentially is an enormous benefit for all Australians, if the access and affordability are right for the linkage between the home learning environment, which is critical, and what is happening in the schools. This would ensure that schools are much more than an isolated institution in our society. There would be interaction between the home learning environment and teachers and students. I return to the role of public libraries. Australia has approximately 13,000 libraries10,000 in schools, 200 in higher education institutions, 1,300 special libraries and 1,500 public libraries. There is no more thorough or better equipped network in Australia, in every suburb and every town, to facilitate public access to electronic information. Already the best libraries no longer restrict their services to collections. Despite limited resources, they are building their technology and role as access points, where clients can use work stations either in the library, at home or at work and interface with a range of information and learning services. The development of information access rights is basic to some of the oldest values in a free society: that is, the idea in a democracy that all citizens should have the opportunity of equal access to knowledge. This idea has been integral to the development of public education, rights of freedom of expression and all the best features of meritocracy. Free public libraries were established as a further confirmation of this ideal, and through each generation have provided opportunities of equal access to information and learning. No government should allow private interests on the information superhighway to dim or diminish the role of libraries in Australia. Anyone of a combination of four policy measures are available to the federal government. I note that these were addressed by the final report of the Broadband Services Expert Group in December last year. The first is to replicate the US national information infrastructure with a requirement on private companies to connect public education institutions to the superhighway. As I mentioned, Optus Vision has this approach as part of its marketing strategy and corporate plan. I anticipate that Foxtel would be involved in the same sort of strategy. The second is to build into the user chargers of the private sector a special fee which could then be paid as a cross-subsidy for the establishment of public sector networks and affordable public prices. The third is to pay direct government subsidies to assist capital and user costs in libraries. No matter the means of subsidy-cross or direct-the development of information technology services in public libraries cannot be left to the inadequate resources of local government. The fourth is to use public libraries as an outpost for the development of electronic information services by government departments. It is inefficient to establish new information outlets in isolation from each other and affects the reputation of public libraries as a focus for public information. I note in this respect that in July of last year the Attorney-General's Department established a database on all Commonwealth legislation through computer terminals in Australian government bookshops. Every student and every researcher would know that this material would be more accessible and better used on-line in public libraries. Delays with these policy options can only aggravate the key issues of information access and equity. Happily, within this government that is not happening. The work of the Broadband Services Expert Group is of substantial quality, and it will be acted on by this government, with further policy reviews due towards the end of 1995. It is too easy in this pampered public life of ours, with the impending publicly funded Internet and access to information that parliamentarians enjoy, to assume that private incomes bring all Australians within reach of the basic tools of transport and communications. Seven per cent of households, almost 400,000 homes, do not have a telephone. I know that the minister and his staff are acting on this and we will get some better results, but it is an important commentary on how not all Australians have access to the communications facilities we take for granted. Thirteen per cent of households or 740,000 homes do not own a car; 76 per cent of households or 4,450,000 homes do not have a personal computer. It will be many years before the technology of the superhighway comes into the price range of average Australians, let alone of the most disadvantaged. Access to sophisticated information and learning should not be left as a privilege for the wealthy. Good libraries supported by good governments can progressively bring these services within the reach of all Australians. I had a reminder of these questions recently in my· electorate when Liverpool council in the northern part of Werriwa undertook a debate about the usefulness and desirability an $8 million investment strategy, an expannology sion strategy, for its central library. gratulate the council on wanting a large, technologically advanced library to service population. It reminds me of the visit I paid to the New South Wales state library which showed clearly that the information superhighway-these advanced electronic important information services-take up as much, if more, space than the old book collections the shelves. We need larger technologically advanced libraries to make best use of the advantages of new forms of communications. I was disappointed, though, that some in council and community waged an ill-advised and ill-informed campaign against that $8 million investment. Michael Byrne of the East Ward Progress Association wrote to one the local newspapers claiming that the' library professional publications and editorials and 1994 US studies question the role of libraries as the information age unfolds within the five years'. Nothing could be further from truth. Nothing could be further removed from the actual content and substance of US policy. As I explained earlier, Al Gore wants to facilitate access to advanced telecommunicagestedtions services through public institutions such as libraries. I mentioned earlier the report a few months ago of the Broadband Services Expert Group. It confirms that Liverpool council is acting in a fashion consistent with the strategy of this federal government. The group's final report Networking Australia's fUture recommends the need for a national strategy for the developopment ment of new communications. Elements this strategy include 'linkages of schools libraries, at first narrowband linkages and broadband links as the broadband infrastrucly ture becomes accessible'. I am quoting from the summary of the report prepared by the expert group. So let there be no doubt councils that are building larger and technoLegislation logically advanced libraries are consistent with this government's strategy and also consistent with the work and information coming out of the US. Let me conclude on the question of further access in the community. It is fundamental, of believe, in using new communications techto revise the disadvantaged schools I conprogram and make sure that we avoid an information rich and information poor school its environment. I am very keen to see this government advance the potential of broadband interactive services for disadvantaged students, linking the home environment-so for their aspirations in life-to the not school environment; allowing them to use on schools and technology to best advantage. I know it is coming. From the Optus Vision presentation and the competitive environment this government has created, I know it is on the its way.

10,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Ballarat) (1.15 p.m.)First I would like to congratulate the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on his elevation to next the ALP professional development program. the He has obviously been targeted as a future Labor leader. If you read what Niki Savva said in the Sun-Herald, there are going to be a few vacancies there. She has actually sug",20
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,Mr Hollis)We are not interested in that. Will you restrict your comments to the bill rather than to what people might be saying in the newspaper.,20
12,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"I was speaking in relation to the member for Werriwa's obvious interest in this area and the fact that he might have been targeted for the professional develprogram. One can only assume that of the members for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), and Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) and MCMillan (Mr then Cunningham), who have been unceremoniousdumped from that list, perhaps are not as there readily identified by the government. I welcome the opportunity to say a few that words on the Communications and the Arts Amendment Bill, which is before the House today. The bill is not a single, unifying bill. It is an omnibus bill which contains various amendments to a number of acts which are administered within the communications and the arts portfolio. As a result, I this bill has no central theme and should be dealt with by the individual acts which it seeks to amend. The acts proposed to be amended by this bill are the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973, the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 and the Telecommunications Act 1991. I am pleased to say that the coalition will be supporting the majority of this bill. However, the amendments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Services Act 1991 are a cause of concern to the coalition, and we will move amendments accordingly. The amendment to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act is one which the coalition finds relatively non-contentious. Two changes are proposed to the act. Items 2 and 3 will enable part-time staff at the school to vote for and be elected to the staff elected position on the school's council. To be eligible for this provision, a teacher must have been employed by the school for at least 12 months or have a term of employment with the school which is a minimum of 12 months. What is important here is representation and the opportunity for teachers to have a say in the forums which determine their immediate work conditions. The coalition's history, of course, is one of inclusion and consultation, aiming to ensure that everybody is given the opportunity to express their views and ideas in relevant forums. This is in stark contrast to content. the position of Labor, which believes th<!.t representation should be based on which faction or group you belong to. It should be no surprise that the opposition will be supporting this amendment. Item 4 of this amendment reduces the number of members required for a quorum at meetings of the school's council from six to five members. This should allow the council's workings to be more flexible and, hopefully, more productive, as more business can be dealt with in a quicker manner. The other minor amendment contained in the bill is the proposed amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1991. This act provides for fines in the following circumstances: where unapproved equipment is connected to a telecommunications network, where persons withhold documents relevant to an Austel investigation or in relation to regulations made by the Governor General for the operation of the act. The value of a penalty unit currently is $100, as stated in the Crimes Act. The amendments which will be discussed today will not change the actual amounts payable by fine under the Telecommunications Act 1991 at this time. It is important that the integrity of our communications system is maintained and strengthened by imposing such penalties to ensure that those who believe they can get away with cheating the system or by withholding information will be held accountable for their actions. The proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 are largely technical in nature. The coalition believes that these amendments are non-contentious. They include a provision that the local content provi:sions which currently apply only to satellite licences are extended to all subscription services. The amendments also clarify the circumstance in which the ABA can deem that a drama program made wholly or substantially in Australia is not Australian. The relevant amendment aims to regulate the ABA's mentioned power relating only to programs that have been made wholly or substantially in Australia or an external territory and have a significant Australian I am personally appalled at the· lack of Australian content on Australian television. There have been many dramas, movies, miniseries, documentaries and current affairs programs which show the excellence in television that Australians are capable of. That is why I find it an affront to turn on my television set and find a majority of the programs are not of Australian content. This, I believe, truly exposes the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his ministers in their rhetoric on the question of a national identity. If the government is so committed to fostering a greater sense of national self-identity and nationhood, why does it allow a majority of our programs to be imported? Not only has this government sold us out to the world through our ballooning foreign debt, but it has also allowed our television to become a medium which is filled with a majority of overseas productions and very little quality Australian programming. This is an area in which we truly need greater national identity but, as is so typical of this government, the big picture rhetoric means that the meaningful detail will not be attended to. I find it timely that this bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act. Items 26 and 27 correct drafting anomalies in relation to the penalty provisions and enforcement powers of the ABA in relation to breaches of the ownership and control restrictions in the act. This intends to make it clear that the relevant provisions apply to subscription television broadcasting licences. This is curious because, be it social security or education legislation or any type of legislation, we always seem to be returning to this chamber to make corrections to what are labelled 'drafting anomalies'. If legislation was handled by this government properly in the first place, then such problems would not arise. This amendment is timely given the recent debacle we have seen by this government over the issue of media ownership. I am pleased to be able to take up the comments of the member for Werriwa, who also made a very specific reference to this matter. That episode was a true Labor episode through and through. We had the pathetic display of a Prime Minister who, desperate for an issue, resorted to blatant lies and distortions of the facts to try to kid the Australian people",20
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,Order! The honourable member knows that that term is unparliamentary. I ask him to withdraw it.,22
14,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"I withdraw it. We had the pathetic display of a Prime Minister who resorted to blatant untruths, if you like, Mr Deputy Speaker, and distortions of the facts to try to kid the Australian people into believing that a deal had been done between the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and Kerry Packer. What evidence did the government have of this supposed deal? Nothing, not a thing. Despite numerous challenges and opportunities to produce the evidence, neither the Prime Minister nor his lackey, the de facto minister for the arts, little Sir Echo, the member for Dobell (Mr Lee)",22

21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"The matter of relevance is always a difficult one and it has been a fairly wide ranging debate. I would ask the member for Ballarat to confine his remarks to the bill, although I think he has been using a few examples to illustrate his point. With that wide interpretation, I would ask him to continue with the debate.",22
22,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Perhaps the parliamentary secretary was not listening to the speech from the member for Werriwa when he made specific references. If you are so touchy about it you can take more points of order, but what you cannot get away from is the fact that you are sitting back there doggo in relation to this issue. None of you have had the guts to come out with any evidence at all in relation to this alleged tie up between the Leader of the Opposition and Kerry Packer. You will be judged and you will be damned on that. So you take as many points of order as you like, but I am going to continue with what has been a broad based discussion on this matter.",22
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Order! I am reluctant to interrupt the member, but he knows that remark should be referred through the chair and not across the table. Refer your remarks through the chair.",23
24,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This issue goes on. We then had the extraordinary situation where the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones)-a man I personally have great respect for and, I believe, for whom the Australian people have great respect-who is known for his honesty and integrity, went on television and told the Australian public that, despite the fact that Prime Minister said there had been a deal between Kerry Packer and the Leader of the Opposition, what he meant to say was that an agreement had been reached between the two men. I was quite aghast when I watched that. Are we to believe that the Prime Minister does not mean what he says? A more realistic reading of the situation is that the member for Lalor realised how foolish the government looked by spreading these unsubstantiated untruths against the Leader of the Opposition and sought to run a mile from it. The Prime Minister has been suspiciously silent about it. I am sure he realises what an absolute fool he has made of himself on this issue. We saw what the view of the Australian people was on this issue. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is at the table today, is acutely aware of the result in the Canberra by-election. The Australian people made it quite clear",23
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Order! The Canberra by-election has absolutely nothing to do with the Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill. I have been very indulgent and permitted a wide ranging debate, but there is even a limit to how wide ranging I will allow the debate to be. I cannot see how the Canberra by-election has anything to do with the bill. If you cannot bring your remarks",23
26,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,23
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"While I am speaking, you will remain silent. If you cannot bring your remarks back to the bill, you will resume your seat. It is up to you.",23
28,Mr RONALDSON,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was communicated to me that we had won the election by about 16.4 per cent, so I thought it was relevant to the issue. Media ownership is not the only issue dealt with in this legislation. The bill also proposes to amend the ABC and the SBS acts to remove the requirement to obtain ministerial approval before entering into contracts or lease-back arrangements of over $2 million. The coalition has stated its objection to this amendment and, as such, has proposed its the own amendment requiring the ABC and the SBS to notify the minister within 14 days in advance of its intention to enter into such contracts. This is a proposal which we in the House should support. The government claims that final responsibility for such matters should rest with the boards of the ABC and the SBS, which are responsible for the overall financial management of the national broadcasters. The government further claims that ministers do not have access to the detailed commercial information needed to make informed decisions about such matters. The ABC claims that on some 30 to 40 occasions each year it is required to obtain ministerial approval because of this provision; that this requirement is anachronistic as prudential supervision is now concentrated at the macro level by way of corporate plans; and, further, that it is highly unlikely that a minister would ever veto a board decision as this would be seen to be interfering with the board. The SBS, on the other hand, has sought ministerial approval under this provision on one occasion in the last 12 months. We are opposed to this amendment. It is a legitimate claim, in my view, that the vast majority of both the ABC and the SBS's finances are derived from parliamentary appropriation and, as such, the Australian taxpayers have a right to hold such organisations accountable as to how and where the money is being spent. It should also be noted, as was alluded to earlier by my colleague the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), that the Friends of the ABC are opposed to the removal of the ministerial approval provision, arguing that the ABC belongs to the taxpayers, not the ABC board. There is a lot of validity in this argument. There is also considerable public concern that the ABC board has allowed management to devote scarce resources to a number of noncore activities like ABC Enterprises, the BNA wires, international development and pay TV. The aim of such programs, although possibly valid in their arguments, are seen by some as a tendency of the board to become increasingly involved in commercial ventures to which significant risks are attached. Although the coalition believes that there a need for greater flexibility in the way such transactions are handled, these changes should not be to the detriment of the need for standards of accountability. The amendment put forward by the opposition reconciles these two difficult objectives by not only granting an increased degree of flexibility to the way in which the board is managed but also providing that accountability is being exercised by the respective boards as they enter into negotiations and contracts. This legislation also makes amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992. These measures consist of minor changes which are designed to increase the flexibility of the radiocommunications regulatory regime. The most significant of these amendments is the introduction of transferable apparatus licences. Other changes are marginal in their effects or designed to increase the flexibility of the radiocommunications regime. This makes the changes uncontroversial. The only change regarding the direct financial impacts of the bill will be the introduction of transferable apparatus licences which will involve an administrative charge of about $30 levied on each transfer. This will cover the administrative costs of the Spectrum Management Agency and will offset any increased consumption of resources. As we enter the next century, communications will start to become more than just what we are discussing with regard to this legislation today-in fact, it already is. Information technology is fast becoming the cutting edge of communications in Australia today. The emerging multimedia industry provides market opportunities for interactive course work and distance education, tourist promotion and strategy planning. It is therefore with some degree of understandable pride that there is now located in my electorate one of the leaders in this field. Ballarat University has launched a technology park. The first tenant on the 25 hectare site will be an IBM-Lend Lease joint venture called ISSC Australia, which will establish a multimillion dollar information technology processing centre. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, that the people of Bendigo, along with is the people of Ballarat, will welcome the fact that we now have in regional Victoria opportunities to be involved in this extraordinarily exciting development. The scope of this venture and the role it will play in progressing not only Ballarat but Australia as a whole is something that has quite rightly caused great excitement and provides an enormous challenge. IBM plans to invest up to $90 million over the next five years to operate the centre which, along with its sister site in Sydney, will form the hub of its Australian information technology operations. This centre opens up enormous potential for not only those in the Ballarat region but also those across Australia in both education and employment. ISSC will fund a chair of information technology at the university and will provide 20 HECS exempt scholarships and 10 traineeships. The centre will also have research links with the university of Ballarat. The institution will be able to tap into IBM's global facilities. This will mean, in effect, that Ballarat will become a key player in the expansion of global information technology. This is a coup for the Ballarat region, and for what is becoming one of the leading universities in Australia-Ballarat University. The new technology is good news all around, as it will employ about 350 people within three years and information technology related industries are expected to employ about 3,000 people in the region within the next five years. Unless members of this chamber are aware of my region's resilience and initiative, they may not have believed that such a large and vital venture could have been located in Ballarat. But this is just an example of what this region is capable of, and I think it is only the beginning. I see my friends at the table agree with me that the university of Ballarat is indeed an extraordinary institution. I am very pleased to see their nods of acknowledgment. This incredible venture was made possible through two simple processes--cooperation and leadership. It is the result of a partnership between industry, the state government, the city of Ballarat and, most importantly, the citizens of Ballarat. It is no surprise that such an enterprise exists in a Liberal state with Liberal leadership showing the way. It could not have happened under the Labor government and it would not have happened. But it has happened with the cooperation of the people of Ballarat and the Victorian state government. I just want to speak very briefly on what I believe is an extremely important aspect of communications and regional development. We have seen with the development of the information technology centre at Ballarat that there is room for government intervention. I do not mean direct cradle to the grave development; I am talking about carefully targeted government intervention. The state government said, 'We are going to make a regional centre the preferred tender site for this information technology centre.' It set the ball rolling for a total change in the way that the Ballarat region has operated. We had a very strong manufacturing base. We survived on that. There has been a decline and we have been forced to look again at where we are going. The government has said, 'We've given you that opportunity. You go out and pursue it.' With all those stakeholders, I have no doubt that it will be an extraordinarily exciting development. I ask honourable members with an interest in this area, and with an interest in regional development, to go and see the development there. It is extraordinarily exciting. It means that regional Australia-the likes of your area of Bendigo, Mr Deputy Speaker, and my area of Ballarat--can start to join in what will be an extraordinary and extremely exciting revolution.",23
29,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (1.35 p.m.)-in reply-I acknowledge the contribution made by the various speakers to the debate on the Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill. I note in passing that some of the contributions strayed quite wide so far as relevance to the bill is concerned, but I will confine my remarks to a few of the matters raised in the debate. The area of contention that has emerged in the discussion here obviously relates to the proposed amendments regarding the ABC and SBS. I will make a couple of points in relation to those matters. The government has taken a quite conscious decision to encourage the ABC to take full financial management decisions and to have responsibility for them. That responsibility includes the process of full accountability. Therefore, we propose to remove this requirement to have contractual lease arrangements and so on over $20 million referred to the minister. The suggestion was raised by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) in the opposition's amendment that that is somehow taking away from what should be the function of the minister in relation to the ABC or SBS. The fact is that we are constantly hearing about the need to ensure the independence of the ABC, and that its board should have accountability and be able to carry out the full decision making process. Yet today we have had criticisms of some of the ventures that the ABC has entered into, so we assume from that the suggestion is that there should be some form of ministerial interference in the process. I am sure that is not what is really being sought, but that is the conclusion. The fact is in relation to contractual arrangements that the current provisions which refer these matters to the minister are not a safeguard of the sort that is suggested because, if the minister is not in possession of all the input that has gone into the making of those decisions by the board and the management, it is surely not a serious proposition to suggest he can add to that process at that stage in the way the ABC should be accounting, quite properly as a government undertaking, to the community at large in any event. Government business enterprises I would have thought, particularly ones with the important roles that the ABC and SBS have, should be to ensure that their boards are fully accountable for the decisions they take and, in turn, that their managements are fully accountable to their boards. The important provisions here reinforce the strength of the commitment to financial accountability and to the responsibility that the management and boards of the respective organisations have. That is the sort of practice that the history of other GBEs would show is the proper one to have. In relation to the other issues dealt with in the bill, I am pleased to note that there has been broad-ranging support for the measures there. A number of them go to the need to ensure flexibility as part of the further development of the RadiocommunicationsAct, and they will be beneficial to the SMA's flexibility capacity in undertaking its role. I thank the House for its constructive contribution to the debate. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",25
30,Dr KEMP,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"by leave-I move: (1) Schedule, page 3, omit item 1, substitute the following item: ""1. Subsection 70(1): Omit 'The Corporation shall not, without the approval of the Minister', substitute 'The Corporation must, not later than 14 days before it enters into a contract referred to in paragraph or (b) as the case may be, notify the Minister that it proposes to' "". (2) Schedule, page 16, omit item 122, substitute the following item: ""122. Subsection 67(1): Omit 'The SBS must not, without the approval of the Minister', substitute 'The SBS must, not later than 14 days before it enters into a contract referred to in this subsection, notify the Minister that it proposes to'."". The coalition has supported the great majority of the amendments proposed by the government to the various pieces of legislation referred to in the Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill. Our whole approach is to be constructive. Too often people in the community think that politics is all about one side disagreeing on everything with the other side. When reasonable and sensible amendments are brought forward, the coalition has no hesitation whatever in supporting those amendments. But there is one particular area in which we have real reservations about the way in which the government intends to proceed. It has to be remembered that both the ABC and SBS are largely dependent on receiving financial support from the taxpayer. It is very important, therefore, that there be a proper system of accountability for the expenditure of those moneys. The government is proposing that neither the ABC nor SBS in future will be required to seek ministerial approval for expenditures or other proposals that involve sums of $2 million or more. It is our view that this procedure put forward by the government goes too far. It removes, essentially, from the minister the awareness and knowledge of what is proposed, which may have very great significance for the two broadcasting bodies involved and, indeed, for the expenditure of taxpayers'money. So in these amendments that I am putting before the chamber we propose that both the ABC and SBS must, not later than 14 days before they enter into a contract of the kind referred to in the legislation, notify the minister that they propose to do so. This (a) would give the minister the opportunity to become aware of just what is proposed where very substantial expenditures of taxpayers' money are involved and for the government to inform itself of the progress of decision making within these broadcasting authorities. There have been a number of very significant developments and departures from past practice-not all of which we dissent from in any way, but some very significant decisions have been taken by the ABC in the development of its activities. I regret to have to mention this but there has also been a very pronounced tendency by the government to use these authorities, as indeed it has used a number of other authorities, as resting places for its failed party leaders in the federal and state areas and for people who have shown a particular willingness to work closely with the Australian Labor Party. It is not to say that the decisions that individuals will take on these bodies will be anything other than in the public interest. But it is very important, particularly in the case these national broadcasters, that they be seen to be impartial and that there be public confidence in them. When the ex-Premier of South Australia responsible for the financial catastrophe in that state is appointed to the ABC board, when the ALP's pollster, Rod Cameron, is appointed to the board and when others who have worked closely with the Labor Party are appointed to the board, inevitably, as David Hill said, there is a perception that the appointments are becoming political, as is the organisation. This gives added point to the great importance of these bodies having a statutory obligation to notify the minister of the decisions and the developments proposed so that parliament at a later date is in a position to take action, if necessary, in the parliament in relation to the minister's ministerial responsibility knowing that the minister has been fully informed. (Time expired)",26
31,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (1.45 p.m.)-The government rejects the amendments that have been proposed by the opposition. I indicated earlier in this debate the motivation behind the amendments we proposed to these particular provisions. The clear objective in repealing this section is to provide unambiguous direction to the boards of the ABC and SBS so that they are responsible for financial management decisions. The imposition of this sort of reporting regime will add absolutely nothing to the accountability process. Rather, it would undermine responsibility and has the potential to cause confusion. The parliament has given the ABC the ability, and the responsibility, to act commercially, including the ability to enter into contracts. It is important that the ABC legislation more clearly specifies that the board is accountable for its decisions. Surely that is the sort of lesson learnt from past experience with government business enterprises. There these would be nothing gained by the sorts of amendments proposed by the opposition. Its approach is only a partial process, having of matters referred to the minister when the management and boards of the respective organisations are the ones which would be fully engaged and fully involved in the process of determining the reasons for particular contractual arrangements. At no point in the process should accountability and the focus of accountability be shifted from the independent organisationsthe ABC and SBS-and the boards responsible for them. Surely that is what their prime acts entail and that is exactly what we should be ensuring is encompassed in the arrangements that the parliament outlines. I do not think it is necessary to go through all the assertions that have been made and which are not related to the boards of the ABC and SBS in the context of this legislation. We could talk about Mr Macphee and ask whether the opposition is suggesting that he is not an appropriate appointee. Of course, we would not. As far as the SBS is concerned, I am not aware of any suggestion in relation to its board that could be regarded as exceptional. For all of those reasons, these amendments are not acceptable. The important thing is that we give the ABC the accountability strength that it needs. We should not try to shackle it in some way that diminishes its opportunity to get out and do the job. Accountability should rightly be with the boards and with management. In that way they will be able to get on and do their job appropriately. Amendments negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Elliott)-by leaveread a third time. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION sion AMENDMENT BILL (No.3) 1994 Consideration resumed from 6 March. Second Reading",27
32,Mr SCIACCA,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) contains a number of minor policy changes to veterans affairs legislation. The most significant change is an amendment 128. to the statutory trust provisions for ANZAC Hostel, which are set out in part VI of the Social Security and Repatriation Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1984. The ANZAC these Hostel, which is located in Brighton, Victoria, is held by the Repatriation Commission on trust for the provision of serviced accommosion dation for totally and permanently incapacitatto ed veterans. The terms of the trust place conditions on the manner and circumstances under which the Repatriation Commission may dispose of the hostel. These conditions place severe restrictions on the options available for the continued provision of aged care facilities veterans. The amendments proposed by this bill would remove the trust and vest the legal and beneficial ownership of the property in Repatriation Commission. The intention is ensure preservation of the heritage value this historically important building and facilitate ex-service men and women's conthe tinued use of the site as an aged care commaking plex. To do this, the commission needs the authority to be able to retain property. In consultation with ex-service organisations and health groups, the Repatrisions ation Commission will consider several options for the continued use of ANZAC Hostel as an aged care facility. The bill also contains five other minor amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The first is the insertion of a new provision which will allow the secretary to request information from a service pensioner, an income support supplement recipient or a claimant for these pensions. The new proviwill also allow the secretary to request a pensioner or claimant to appear in person to provide an officer of the department with information which is relevant to the payment of pension or income support supplement. The request for such information is currently authorised under section 128 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. However, this section specifies only criminal penaltiesthat is, fines of up to $2,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both-for failure to comply with a notice issued under section The new provision in section 54AA will duplicate the provisions in section 128 which allow the secretary to obtain information in situations. However, instead of imposing the harsher criminal penalties for failure to comply with such a request, the new proviwill allow the Repatriation Commission cancel or suspend pension under section 56EA. This amendment will ensure that the action to be taken in the event of a failure of a person to comply with a request for information issued pursuant to new section 54AA will be the same as that which currently applies to for service pensioners who are obliged to comply with notices issued under sections 54 and 54A of the act. The second amendment is a minor change the to the tax file number provisions of the to Veterans' Entitlements Act. The amendment of will ensure that the 'voluntary quotation' to principle, which has always formed part of tax file number scheme, is maintained by it clear that the secretary may request, but not compel, a person to provide his or her or dispose of the tax file number. The amendment will also change the proviin respect of a person who does not have a tax file number. The change will mean that; if a person who is a claimant or is eligible for a pension or allowance does not have a tax file number, the secretary will the power to request that person to apply the Commissioner of Taxation to obtain a tax file number and to give the secretary a written statement of the person's tax file number after the commissioner has issued it. This change follows a similar recent amendment to the Social Security Act and will ensure consistenit. cy in the administration of the tax file number provisions. The third amendment relates to the information that the Department of Veterans' Affairs provides to the courts on the amounts of pension, benefit or allowance paid to a person. The Veterans' Entitlements Act does not currently make any specific provision for information provided to a person about the amount of pension benefit or allowance paid on a certain date to be accepted by a court as prima facie evidence. This entails the preparation of a detailed statement of the payments made for each fortnight before it can be accepted as prima facie evidence by a court. Preparation of such statements are time consuming. This bill proposes an amendment which would provide that a signed official departmental document is prima facie evidence the facts or statements contained in the docuopportunity ment. The amendment follows similar changes to the Social Security Act. The fourth amendment inserts the cessation date for Cambodia as an operational area. the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, Cambodia is designated as an area of operational service from 20 October 1991. The Department of Defence has advised that operational service in Cambodia ceased on 7 ate. October 1993. The fifth and final amendment relates two minor and technical amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The first of these amends the section numbers for four sections. The second removes the reference to the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 in section 188A. The measures in this bill have no financial impact. However, if and when the Repatriwith ation Commission disposes of ANZAC Hostel, there may be significant savings in running costs. Any savings involved in the disposal have ANZAC Hostel would depend on the manner into which it is disposed and the costs of site restoration and redevelopment as an aged care facility. I must emphasise, however, that this bill does not set out a method of disposal for the ANZAC Hostel but merely gives the power to the Repatriation Commission to dispose of I commend the bill to the House.",28
33,Mr TUCKEY,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"O'Connor) (1.56 p.m.)The coalition does not oppose the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). In general, it finds the legislation positive in its approach. I start by referring to the proposals to amend the statutory trust arrangements as they apply to ANZAC Hostel in Victoria. On all the advice I have received-and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, no doubt would have a direct interest, as a Victorian, in this matter-the present facilities have deteriorated more by design than by maintenance to the point where they do not adequately serve the needs of aged veterans. The numbers of occupants of that facility are now quite low and there is no benefit in increasing the numbers. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr of Sciacca) refers in his final words to the for savings by the disposal of the hostel. That opportunity is very real because the numbers of occupants are relatively low. On the other hand, the costs of operating such For an amenity continue. The proposal which gives the power to the Repatriation Commission to make proper arrangements to dispose of the facility, and which was originally constrained by trust arrangements, is appropriI am hopeful that the rumours are correct to and the Victorian RSL will become actively involved. My understanding is that it will, in the context of building a new facility on the site, whilst some of the heritage buildings associated with the original hostel will be retained for that purpose. That makes sense to me. In discussions I have had with the RSL I have been gratified to know that its intention regard to existing occupants is that whilst the RSL will make provision for the occupants in the interim in other amenities, it of will also give them the opportunity to be returned to the site when the new facilities constructed. All that is very appropriate. The legislation recognises the situation that was created at the time when ANZAC Hostel was first constructed. The care of it was put in trust and provisions were made to protect it were it to be disposed of. Times have changed and all the present arrangements appropriate. As I said, the opposition is encouraged to think that the Victorian RSL will be involved. Its record in providing these sorts of amenities for veterans is very good. I hope all those arrangements come to pass, although we accept, as the minister said, that that is for further negotiation. Other aspects of the bill are matters of record but seem to be quite appropriate. The coalition welcomes the removal of some of the criminal provisions, particularly those associated with the provision of information. In this modern day, it certainly would be said to be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut to lay a criminal charge against someone who did not want to give information which entitled that person to a benefit when, as this legislation provides, we can say, 'If you don't give us the information, you don't get the benefit.' It seems pretty logical. That is a substantial imposition on the person involved. Some people are very concerned about their own private information. It is an issue that will bear constant attention by this parliament. Once you start providing people with benefits, there is an obligation on our bureaucracy ensure that they are distributed fairly .and honestly and that people are not obtaining entitlements for which they have no entitleis ment. This then starts to establish the transfer a lot of information. That can be picked up the provision which talks of the voluntary provision of tax file numbers. Again, whilst the word is 'voluntary' - as an opposition would demand that there be no compulsion people at any time to be called upon to provide their tax file number to any departmilitary ment other than the tax office-the process which is followed does apply quite a degree of compulsion inasmuch as this legislation provides that, if you do not provide the tax are file number, you will not be entitled to the benefit. This is a process whereby government departments are able to check the eligibility of individuals and have access to advice regarding their income. I trust it still works as we have been advised. When the Department are of Veterans' Affairs, for instance, puts a question to the tax office it still remains on the basis that these are our rules-does the person being the owner of this tax file number comply or not comply? They do not tell us how much they earn and how many assets the department believes they should have. If that is the case, it is probably appropriate. I want to put on record my concern, which I may have communicated to the minister from time to time: in the acquisition of data the Department of Veterans' Affairs watches its own responsibilities very carefully. I have had an experience with a constituent of mine where information provided at a routine medical examination was used to reject an application for a benefit. To the credit of the department, when I argued that this was reasonably unfair, it accepted that argument because there were some fundamentals in the case. There is a consistency of surveys going out to veterans at the moment, one of the latest being on exposure to ultraviolet rays; in other words, sunshine. I fear that, at times, when people are asked in an unrelated situationsay, at a routine medical examination-'Do to you smoke much?' or 'Do you drink much?' they are probably likely to give the same answer that I give, 'Oh, no, not much.' That a very honest answer because I have never smoked. But when it comes to drinking, I of have to admit that I have been inclined to tell in fibs to my doctor from time to time. I am afraid many other people do the same. Those records should not be recovered we when someone says, 'I have had a heart on problem which I believe results from my being given free tobacco when I was in the service and becoming addicted. In fact, I have smoked quite heavily.' Someone then; goes through a heavy file and says, 'Hang on a minute, five years ago you told your doctor you didn't smoke much.' I do not want to dwell too long on that example, because it is nothing more than that. I make the point that, in obtaining information for good reason-be it a survey of ultraviolet light exposure--the answers given by veterans should be for the purpose of creating data. It should not be referred to later when they come forward with a complaint of skin cancer, or something like that, so that they are told, 'This looks as though it has much more to do with your subsequent lifestyle than your military service.' I make that point in passing. It is not exactly relevant to the legislation but it is something I want to put on the record. There has been a fundamental principle in veterans affairs: that is, the department and this ment err on the side of generosity in decision making in relation to veterans. This year we are spending a lot of time reminding young people of the service veterans gave. I think the community owes a huge debt to them. As such, when we have to-as governments must for economic and financial reasons-consider their entitlement to assistance or to a benefit, we should not be trying to find fine print to prevent it. The provisions here are primarily that they should provide a tax file number because certain of their benefits are means tested and that they should provide information but that there should never be a punishment of a criminal nature or a heavy fine for their failing to do so. So this legislation addresses those matters. The reference to a signed statement of an official relating to the fundamental facts of records held by the department, or other circumstances where a court case or other hearing where sworn evidence is required, being considered prima facie evidence is a good idea. It is quite commonplace; it occurs in our police courts in many driving instances where, for instance, whether the vehicle is licensed or not should not be the subject of extended legal debate. A statement from the department to the effect that it is licensed or not or that it has carried a certain number plate and other aspects of the fundamental documentation held by the department to expedite court proceedings seem common sense to be able to be submitted as prima facie evidence without the attendance of government departmental officers and things like that. I do not have to tell the people in this place what prima facie means, but it means first blush. In other words, even though such evidence is presented as first blush evidence, it can be contested if it is inaccurate or if it is in the belief of the veteran or whoever else is involved that it is inaccurate. It is not as though by 'passing this legislation we are creating a situation where such evidence cannot be challenged. But, where there is no challenge, this process puts it through a lot more quickly and gets on with the serious aspects of whatever the litigation may be. parlia- That is also an appropriate amendment. We are also accepting 7 October 1993 as the date set for the conclusion of the category of operational service in Cambodia. Nevertheless, we want to express our reservations as to whether this date is the final date. It is certainly well after the elections that were held in Cambodia, which, as I recollect-and I do not have such notes with me-may have been in May of that year. It would appear that that length of time is of an appropriate or sufficient timing to say that hostilities had ceased. But it could be said that today hostilities still have not ceased in Cambodia and that they could be considered to be escalating. UnfoI1unately, we have had some very horrible examples drawn to our attention as to how difficult things are in Cambodia and how civilians can become involved and be murdered. This matter is of grave concern to me. I assume our servicemen were removed from that role by this time. When our servicemen went there, we were told that they were providing communications to allow for the establishment of this election process. That seemed a fairly safe role. Communications is just providing communications; you do not have to get behind a gun, drive a tank or clear mines. However, I have had information brought to my attention about the circumstances in which some of these communications technicians found themselves, particularly those that were provided to the Khmer Rouge. Of course, our people were provided to provide a communications network to all of the warring parties so that there could be communication, hopefully leading to peacecommunication being one of the principal requirements of peace; getting people to talk to each other, to know what others are doing and to lose some of their concerns built on lack of information. I am advised that some of those people who were sent into the Khmer Rouge area were virtual hostages while they were there. The time periods in which they were supposed to be relieved-which were relatively shortwere not even necessarily adhered to. When relief came it was by way of one person at a time. The personnel of a mineproof personnel carrier were allowed to be relieved only by one person at a time, as the Khmer Rouge were apparently still suspicious that there might be other military personnel with them. Consequently, those personnel did not have a very pleasant experience while trying to help the people, which was the fundamental responsibility that they had while they were there. To the extent that any of those circumstances existed after 7 October, the opposition would like to make the point that those personnel should be treated as a special case. In our opinion, a number of people that were there on active service up to that date, or remained there after that .date, would still have been at substantial risk. We are pleased to know that they all came home. But the threat to their safety would have existed until the day they left. Some civilians, unfortunately now deceased, could have attested to that. Whilst we do not oppose that date, and I could not give a better date because of lack of information, We would like to put on. the record the opposition's point of view that, if a substantive case can be made on behalf of those individuals who were still in Cambodia after that time to extend that date, the opposifor tion would be sympathetic to that, based on the evidence. Of course, there is another stage of this. They do not go to nothing in terms of their entitlements as having been either in an area of operational service or not. The other matters are more housekeeping matters. One amendment removes from this legislation reference to the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 as that act was repealed and the relevant provisions have been included into the Veterans' Entitlements Act, a measure that we welcomed at the time. It was without doubt a huge aberration. One might ask how it happened that for so many years certain seamen and merchant seamen were left out of the repatriation system when their contribution to the war effort was as good as that of others and the danger in which they were placed on most occasions was greater than that of others. So all in all we welcome this legislation. It is positive and we will be happy to support it in due course today. MrTAYLOR(Groom) (2.14 p.m.)-Like the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), it gives me pleasure to provide a very large measure of bipartisan support for the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). It is appropriate that, as I speak, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is at the table. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate him nbt only on this legislation but also for his attitude to veterans affairs and fOF the initiative of the Australia Remembers program in 1995. I assure the minister that· I will continue to provide very strong support to that program, and I am sure that I speak for the honourable member for O'Connor and for all members on both sides of the House when I say that we - will continue to support that initiative. I know that the minister is very careful to make sure that party politics does not come into that particular program. While he continues to do that, of course, he will continue to have the fullest support of both sides of this House. I would like to speak very briefly about two aspects of this amendment bill. Firstly, I want to say a little more about the cessation date operational service of 7 October 1993 for the operational area of Cambodia. Secondly, I want to say a little more about one of the issues that the honourable member for O'Connor mentioned very briefly: merchant mariners and their involvement in both this legislation and the parent Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. First of all, I refer the House to part 4 of the explanatory memorandum to this legislation, which talks about the cessation date for Cambodia as an operational area. I would like to read into the Hansard record what that explanatory memorandum says: On 9 October 1991, Cabinet agreed to deploy Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel to Cambodia as part of an United Nations contingent in the region. The basis for deployment was that: before the UN cease-fire took effect, and related demobilisation measures were set in place, Cambodia be designated an operational area for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act; and after the UN cease-fire took effect, and related demobilisation measures were set in place, ADF personnel to Cambodia receive peacekeeping benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The Veterans' Entitlements Act was amended to provide that Cambodia was an operational area on or after 20 October 1991. This was the date ADF personnel were first deployed in the area. The Department of Defence has advised that operational service in Cambodia ceased on 7 October 1993. Service in Cambodia after this date has been declared by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to be hazardous service which will provide equivalent benefits to peacekeeping benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This proposal would insert the end date for Cambodia as an operational area. As the honourable member for O'Connor has said, whilst we support the date specified in the legislation, 7 October 1993, we would like assurances-the minister might see his way clear to doing this at the end of the debatethat when the declaration was made by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel the rationale of the transition from operational to hazardous service satisfied the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We would like to hear a little about what that means for the entitlements under VEA of the people who were there from 8 October 1993. Perhaps the minister could do that in summing up at the end of the debate. That said, of course, we provide the strongest support to this aspect of the legislation. I would also like to take the opportunityand I hope I am not straying too far outside the specific legislation-to pay tribute to a number of people in the Cambodian situation. Firstly, I would like to congratulate-and there seems to be a spirit of strong bipartisanship here this afternoon-the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for the part he played, as, indeed, did the Indonesian foreign minister, in the lead-up to the Cambodian settlement. Without the involvement of both of those gentlemen, the Cambodian peace accord would have been all the more difficult. I would like to pay tribute to both of them in the context of this debate. Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force personnel who were deployed in Cambodia over that period-the men and women of the ADF who were involved under very difficult circumstances. Some would say that the circumstances in Cambodia were more difficult than many other deployments the ADF has experienced in recent years. I think we, as a parliament, should pay tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who were involved in that deployment. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to one particular person. I feel sure that everybody in this House, on both sides, would join with me in congratulating Lieutenant General John Sanderson for the part he played in that settlement. I have personally known Lieutenant General Sanderson for a number of years. He is a very professional soldier. I think he went far beyond wearing a uniform in the Cambodian situation and showed what a fine officer he is within the ADF. I also take this opportunity to congratulate him, following the recent announcement by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), on his appointment as the Chief of the General Staff from July of this year. I am sure that he will do the best he possibly can as the Chief of the General Staff and that he will go on to bigger and better things. I draw the attention of the House to an article in the Australian of Friday, 21 May 1993. It was an article written by David Lague, headed 'Blessed is the peacekeeper', in which, in part, he said: Cambodians vote this weekend in historic elections. The Australian who leads the United Nations military force in Cambodia telIs ... of the awesome task of bringing the country this far. I do not have time, in the context of this debate, to read what I think is a very intuitive article about a very highly professional soldier and, one would argue, a highly professional diplomatic representative of Australia in the United Nations context. However, I will read one or two excerpts from that article: Sanderson is an Australian Defence Force blue blood. He graduated from Duntroon in 1961 and has held a series of high-level commands in recent years. He has also been an instructor at the British Army Staff ColIege, where he specialised in counter-revolutionary warfare and peacekeeping. His diplomacy may be a key factor in holding the UNTAC military command together, but he has come under attack for failing to take a tough line with the Khmer Rouge, which has since abandoned the peace accord and renewed its attacks on the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government forces. His French second-in-command, Brigadier General Michael Loridon, was recalIed last July after he failed to persuade Sanderson and the civilian leadership that the Khmer Rouge should be pressured to comply with the settlement they had signed. There have also been mutterings in Canberraand I would like to emphasise this particular pointat senior staffievels that under Sanderson's ship, UN forces have failed to retaliate vigorously enough when fired on by the Khmer Rouge. Some of these criticisms arise from jealousy. In a defence force where most of the senior leadership has not had an active role since the Vietnam war, Sanderson has a plumb job. He is commanding more troops in the field than any Australian military leader in recent history. However, Sanderson loyalists believe most of the sniping is ill informed. When the peace settlement was signed, the Phnom Penh government forces, the Khmer Rouge and the two non-communist guerilla factions were required to disarm and demobilise the bulk of their troops under UN supervision. In response to some of these comments, General Sanderson said to the reporter: I can teII you that if we had done thatreferring to the disarming of the Khmer Rouge and other- before the electionwe would not have been able to conduct this election because the sheer logistical effort to conduct this election demanded an enormous commitment on the part of the military. The article went on to say: He rejects calIs to go on the offensive against the guerillas and argues it is vital to maintain a neutral stance because taking sides would put UNTAC at risk. He finally made this comment to the reporter: In Cambodia, for example, it would not have been the military that became vulnerable; it would have been all the unarmed civilians wandering around Cambodia trying to do their job. I commend that article to all in this House. As I said before, it is a very intuitive article and in hindsight it is a very wise article. I think it is reflective of a senior officer in our Australian Defence Force of whom we should all be proud. I would also like to speak briefly about one element that the honourable member for O'Connor mentioned, albeit very briefly, in relation to the merchant seamen amendments in this piece of legislation. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the honourable member for O'Connor have both said, this is a very technical amendment but it is very simple in many ways. It reflects the amendments that were necessary as a result of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act being brought under the aegis of the VEA 1986 and leaderincludes some renumbering. In many ways it is a minor technical amendment. Nevertheless, I think it is important that I again point out in this House that that would not have been possible without a large measure of bipartisan support in this House from a number of members. I would again like to mention one or two people. First of all, the architect of drawing the anomaly to the attention of the government was one of its own members, the honourable member· for  the honourable member for Shorthand. It was my pleasure on at least two occasions in the lead-up to the amendment to the YEA to support the member in his push for the merchant mariners to be brought under the aegis of the VEA. So well done, honourable member for Shortland. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) was also very involved in the debates leading up to these amendments and I again pay tribute to him. On our side of the House, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) was one of the early architects of the amendments. I pay tribute to him. He will be leaving us at the next general election. He is a fine parliamentarian and is avery good local member. I am sure that both sides of the House will miss him when he moves on to, some would say, greener pastures when he leaves the parliament whenever this parliament might no longer exist. It was a tortuous path as you, Minister, will recall to bring that legislation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I do not have time to read into the record the background of that, but I will just read a few excerpts from what I said in the House on 18 November 1993 in the lead-up to the 1994 amendments, which brought it about. I said: Clearly there is ... dissatisfaction about the anomaly which is reflected in the motion before usand the motion before us on that particular occasion was the motion by the honourable member for Shortlandparticularly parts (i) and (ii), which call for the repeal of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act, the SWPA act 1940, and for access to benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. In the context of that debate I went through the historical development for merchant mariners over a long period. I finished by saying: In general, therefore, the amendments made to the SWP A act after World War II have aligned the pension benefits available to Australian merchant mariners with changes made to the repatriation legislation-evenif, in the early stages, there were some delays in making amendments to that act. In recent years, however, because the act adopts some provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act-in particular, the criteria for assessment of rates of pension--changesto the earlier act have been made at the same time as changes to the VEA. In summary, in the SWPA act, we have a piece of legislation which, unless it is repealed ... and benefits are extended under the VEA 1986, will allow those injustices to persist. Those injustices will not disappear simply with the passage of time. Thankfully, this government, with the support of the opposition, made sure that that did not persist. In the following year, in 1994, the merchant mariners were given all the equity, all the access to the provisions that this nation required them to have. Minister, I add my thanks on their behalf to you for that initiative. In closing, I would like to say that, once again, we provide the strongest bipartisanship to this piece of legislation.",29
34,Mr BRADFORD,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"I support the remarks of the member for Groom (Mr Taylor). As the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), has said, we support the thrust of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (No.3) Bill in general terms. It is good to see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) in the House today. He always attends these debates and I am sure he listens very carefully to the contributions made by members on this side of the House. I should also congratulate him indirectly upon broad the election of his brother to the new City of the Gold Coast council which, of course, is my own local government. It was good to see Joe re-elected a couple of weeks ago to the new, greatly enlarged City of the Gold Coast council. So I will have a close contact with the minister and his brother in that regard. I wanted to raise a number of matters in the broad context of this debate today on veterans' affairs. Let me commence by dealing with a couple of items from the bill. I noticed the shadow minister took up this matter of the tax file numbers where the amendments that are proposed maintain the principle of so called voluntary quotation. I object to that particular principle. I think in large part the Australian people have been badly misled as it turns· out by the requirement to provide tax file numbers for just about everything because we distinctly disapproved of the idea of some form of universal numbering system. We voted against the introduction of an Australia card, but we now have a de facto Australia card through the tax file number. The point was well made, sadly, by the late Leonard Teale who went to his grave maintaining that he was eligible for a veterans benefit-as he was-but refusing, as I understand it, to provide a tax file number on principle and, of course, being refused the benefit that he was otherwise entitled to. Mr Sciacca-I fixed it up; do you remember?",35
35,Mr BRADFORD,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,The minister tells me he has fixed it up. I do not know how he did that in the circumstances. Was it retrospectively or posthumously? Mr Sciacca-No; before he died.,36
36,Mr BRADFORD,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"I take your point. If it was fixed up, then it was probably just in time. But he had made the point over a long period of time. This is still an unsatisfactory situation. The voluntary quotation is just a bit of a joke. If, in fact, you are required to provide your tax file number to access a benefit, then it is silly talking about voluntary quotation. If it is voluntary, then it might be voluntary in a sort of military sense because, as any of us who have served know, when you want a couple of volunteers, it is 'you, you and you'. That is what this amounts to. It is not voluntary in the normal sense of the word. I think it is time that we stopped playing games with that particular requirement. The other question that the minister might be able to clarify is whether the tax file number is actually required when you apply for benefits for which there is no mean test, such as the disability pension and some of those other allowances. In that sense there is no need whatsoever, so far as I can see, for the provision of tax file numbers. Certainly, in my view, it would be objectionable to require the provision of a tax file number in the case of those benefits for which there is no means test of any sort. My colleague the honourable member for Groom has spoken, as I think have other speakers, about the amendment relating to the previous provision regarding Australian merchant mariners becoming eligible for entitlements. They are all delighted to have been accorded this particular benefit, but the issue raised with me by one of these people is that apparently they are not entitled to receive a return from active service badge. I am not entirely certain what the technical requirement is for an active service badge, but these people have fought for recognition· of. their war service and consequently for recognition under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, but there is a technical problem with at least one person who raised it with me in that he is not entitled to a return from active service badge. I wonder whether the minister might take that on board. That particular badge might only seem to be a small thing, but symbols are very important in this situation. We have taken these people to the stage where they have been given the benefits but, for many of them-not all of them-the return from active service badge would certainly be the icing on the cake. If I am wrong about that entitlement I would be very pleased to know because when I looked into it that was the case, that there was no such entitlement, but I .stand to be corrected and, if I am correct, I would appreciate the minister taking up that particular issue as well. In the general context of veterans issues let me say that I believe that Australia Remembers is going very well indeed. I congratulate the minister. I do not want him to become at all complacent about the veterans affairs scene, and I do not want to damn him with faint praise-and I do not give it lightly-but I happen to think it is going pretty well and, to the extent that it was his idea., I congratulate him. The good thing about Australia Remembers at the moment is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is keeping a fairly low profile because he is about as popular with veterans as he is with the people of Canberra. The second good thing about Australia Remerribers is that there are plenty of Australian flags flying. The veterans do not share the Prime Minister's view about the flag. In fact, as we were promised when I raised this issue on a previous occasion, it is great to see plenty of Australian flags evident during Australia Remembers, even though the flag does not appear on any of the official logos or correspondence. I am really quite remiss in that I do. not have,my badge on today in the parliament. I went to find it as I rushed down here but I could not put my hand on it. I was actually a bit wrong about the logo. I joined in with the criticism of some veterans in that it does not have the flag somewhere on it, and in a sense that is still a bit of a disappointment, but has certainly been very well received. It is good to see a lot of people wearing the badge and also to see posters up around the place. The bottom line from my point of view is that it is going pretty well. In my electorate it has been really quite remarkably successful. Today I would like to pay tribute to the chairman of my particular Australia Remembers committee, Don Keith. Don is a retired lieutenant colonel and a Vietnam veteran. When I asked him to take on this task I did not quite anticipate the enthusiasm with which he would grasp it. He keeps me and my office busy for about 24 hours a day with work on Australia Remembers, so we have a stock excuse when constituents call now for anything else: we say, 'We are busy with Australia Remembers; would you mind calling back next year?' That is not quite so; nevertheless, Don Keith is putting in a remarkable effort. We have some fantastic events planned in the electorate of MCPherson. In military terminology, in phase 1, prior to and including August, we have a school essay competition; we are involved in this other government program which is also working, that is, the refurbishment of local war memorials; we have introduced a number of veterans for adoption by local schools; we are planning displays in local shopping centres, libraries, at Coolangatta airport and hotels; we are embarking on a shop display competition; we are generating World War II stories in the local media; we are participating in the planning of a number of reunions of ex-service organisations; and we are also planning for the laying of flowers on the graves of veterans by local school children. Phase 2 commences in August to actually centre on VP day. We have an interdenominational church service planned for 9 August; we have a very substantial equipment and memorabilia display at Mudgeeraba showground from 9 to 14 August, and we have a very large VP commemorative parade planned for Surfers Paradise, in conjunction with the Moncrieff electorate. I imagine this will be the biggest veterans it march ever held on the Gold Coast. Normally, on ANZAC Day on the Gold Coast, we have probably a dozen or more RSL activities but this time everyone will be pulling together and there will be that very big event in the centre of the Gold Coast on 15 August. Also the Gold Coast Turf Club has agreed to have an eight-race Australia Remembers day program on 19 August-and, Minister, hopefully you will get an invitation to attend that particular event, although I imagine it will be a busy week for you. Despite some reservations, which were also expressed by the member for Groom, about the government's ultimate motivation, I am now prepared to accept that to date it has been pure and that Australia Remembers is going well, it is successful and it is going to be successful. Its ultimate objective will certainly be reached-that is, making young people, young Australians, school children in particular, aware of what happened in this country 50 years ago and in those years between 1939 and 1945 when so many Australians gave their lives for the freedom and prosp-rity which we now enjoy. So many Australians who served and have returned will be able to get together and remember and share their experiences with many young people. So perhaps· this year we can put in train, through the education program, a new appreciation of what the whole ANZAC tradition is about. Perhaps we can generate a new wave of enthusiasm for the next 50 years to make sure that in Australia we never forget.",36
37,Mr VAILE,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"This afternoon I want to speak briefly on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994. Along with previous speakers, I wish to make a few brief comments about the Australia Remembers program. Obviously the opposition is not proposing to vote against the bill. A number of issues are involved in and around it with regard to veterans that need to be highlighted and, certainly, must not be lost in the debate and in the bureaucratic process. The bill presents amendments to the Social Security and Repatriation Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1984 in relation to ANZAC Hostel and five amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. The bill vests the legal and beneficial ownership of this property, ANZAC Hostel, in the Repatriation Commission; allows the secretary to the DVA to request information from a service pensioner or a claimant or request the person to appear before a DVA officer on matters relevant; replaces criminal penalties with authority to cancel or suspend pensions; maintains 'voluntary quotation' status quo in regard to tax file numbers relating to evidence before a court and allows a signed statement to be admitted as prima facie evidence-to align with similar Department of Social Security provisions; sets a final date for the declaration of Cambodia as an operational area and service in Cambodia classified as a 'hazardous service area'; and makes a number of minor amendments relating to the previous provision of Australian merchant mariners becoming eligible for entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 which came into effect on 1 July 1994. Under the recipient obligations, this amendment will allow the secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs to request information from a service pensioner, income support supplement recipient or a claimant of these pensions or request the person to appear before a DVA officer on matters relevant to the payment of the pension. This information can currently be requested under existing law; however, the current law only provides for criminal penalties. The new clause which duplicates the existing clause will replace criminal penalties with authority to cancel or suspend pensions for failure to comply with an order to supply information. Obviously, this is a welcome amendment. I do not think that any of our veterans or service personnel, under any particular circumstance, should be considered for criminal penalties. The possible sanction of the suspension of a pension is certainly enough to gain that information. I turn now to tax file numbers. The amendments maintain the principle of voluntary quotation, which has always formed part of the tax file number scheme. It is maintained by making it clear that the secretary may request but not compel a person to provide a tax file number. The amendments will also change the provisions as they relate to a person who does not have a tax file number. This means that, if a person who applies for a service pension or an allowance does not have a tax file number, the secretary will have the power to request that person to apply to the taxation commissioner to obtain a tax file number. Persons who fail to comply with such a request will have their pension or benefits cancelled, as is the case with the previous provision. I do not see that there should be great angst in the community in that regard. I would also like to make some comment about the Australian merchant mariners. Until last year, Australian merchant mariners had fought long and hard for recognition of their service and for what they have done for this country since the Second World War. When I first came into this place in 1993 I received a number of representations from different people throughout my electorate who had served as merchant mariners. All they required was recognition of their service to this country. I do not know the internal politics of the different service organisations prior to that time, but it seems a worthwhile gesture that the government ultimately recognised the Australian merchant mariners. I note the work  ris) in elevating the position of the Australian merchant mariners. I commend him for that and I commend the minister for the moves he has made in that regard. It is very important that we recognise the service that has been provided by those people. I take this opportunity to again highlight for the minister and the government the need to focus on the attitude we should have towards and the support we should be providing the Vietnam veterans. They are an important element of the veteran community. In many cases, they are supplying support for their colleagues who, some 20 or more years after the 'end of the conflict in Vietnam, are still suffering. Certainly, problems still exist for the Vietnam veterans and we must not lose sight of that fact. This bill talks about changing the status of the ANZAC Hostel in Brighton. I think I read somewhere that it was donated for the benefit of veterans of the First World War. We have different institutions for the benefit of veterans of the Second World War. As I said, we must not walk away from our responsibilities as a nation to veterans of the Vietnam War. In closing, I would like to make a few comments about the Australia Remembers program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. As previous speakers have done, I commend the minister for his work on that program, which has been very bipartisan. He has allowed local members to be involved with their local community organisations in the establishment of the Australia Remembers committees. Also, the funding made available to local community organisations has certainly been well received. I suppose it has been of benefit to the minister and his department to allow local committees to do a lot of the difficult work of vetting the applications to get them to the stage where they are acceptable to the department. I am happy to say that last week I received the first half a dozen cheques going to the different groups in my electorate. Those groups extend to the minister their appreciation for his consideration in that regard. I also express the appreciation of Vic Cahill, whom the minister knows well, for the consideration that the minister has extended to him over a long period. It is very important that this year we focus on the Australia Remembers program and the end of the Second World War and the signifi-.;ance that it has had in Australia in the building process of this country. Again, I emphasise to the government that we must continue to deal with the problems that are continually arising and confronting the Vietnam veterans and their families today and no doubt will arise in the future. I am sure that the minister at the table will take that on board in his future deliberations.",37
38,Mr SCIACCA,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"in reply-I thank the honourable members who participated in this debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) for their comments. I am particularly appreciative of their kind words with respectto the Australia Remembers program. I can assure them, as I have in the past, that that program will be conducted in a bipartisan way. In looking at two of the members on the benches opposite, I am pleased to say that I have already been to Taree in the electorate of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). He mentioned Vic Cahill, an exprisoner of war, who was one of the ambassadors we sent to the celebration of the Normandy landings, if I remember correctly, not all that long ago. I will be visiting the electorate of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in a couple of weeks. I have probably visited more electorates of my conservative friends than I have of my own Labor colleagues. I might have to rectify that at some time in the future. There are a number of matters that I would like to respond to. I appreciate that there may well be some concerns having regard to what has been asked here today, and I would like to simply mention those. The honourable member for Groom mentioned the position of those who served in Cambodia after 7 October 1993. My understanding is that there may be one or two Australian service personnel still in Cambodia, but this has not been confirmed by the Department of Defence. Any service personnel still in Cambodia after 7 October 1993 are entitled to benefits based on hazardous service. Essentially, there is no difference in the way claims for disability pension in respect of death or injury are determined for these servicemen. I will also arrange to give the honourable member a response to his concerns in writing as soon as I possibly can. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned the position with respect to tax file number exemptions. I made the comment during the debate that I had fixed that. When I say that I had fixed that I mean my department had fixed that. I have fond memories of meeting the late Leonard Teale. He came into my electorate on one occasion to talk about his vision for Australia. I must admit that I did not agree with anything he said, but I do remember him, and others may remember him, from the early 1950s and ·1960s when he was the voice of Superman. Mr Bradford-Before my time.",39
39,Mr SCIACCA,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Yes, and he starred in Homicide. He was a marvellous Australian. I had the pleasure of rectifying the position as a result of his bringing forward his concerns in the public arena. It was on 1 April 1994, only a couple of days after I had been appointed Minister for Veterans' Affairs, that the secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs approved a new exemption category. At that time a number of people were exempted. In recognition of concerns expressed at the time that the data matching legislation was introduced, exemptions were developed to relieve those who were genuinely unable to assist with meeting the intentions the legislation. A person is exempted if aged over 80, is profoundly disabled, has been in receipt of the service pension for more than 10 years, has additional income of less than $20 per week, lives overseas, is a recipient of a widow disability pension, has no other income that is less than $20 per week, is a homeless person, lives in a nursing home or is a non-payee spouse of a disability pensioner. Those exemptions were already there, but on 1 April 1994, directly as a result of the concerns expressed by the late Leonard Teale, I publicly stated that a person is now exempt- and respect. ed if the person is in receipt of a disability pension only-and that was his position at the time-and can provide documentation that his or her income and assets preclude the payment of an income support pension. So specifically they are exempted. I want the member for MCPherson to be aware of that fact. I also thank him for his congratulations for my younger brother. As it turns out, the local mayorMr Bradford-Is he your younger brother?",40
40,Mr SCIACCA,COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS,"Yes, he is. He has less hair than I have, but you would understand that. He would be very happy if I told you that the first thing that happened to him was that the new mayor did not abide by an agreement. I will not say any more about that, but you might check into it. The member for MCPherson also mentioned the active service badge. That is not under my jurisdiction but I will arrange to get from my colleague. the Minister for Defence Science  request. We were talking about the late Leonard Teale. I was just thinking the other day how great a voice he would have had for the Australia Remembers project. I have had some community service announcements made up. They will be appearing on television shortly on channels 10, 2 and SBS. The voice is that of John Laws, who has donated his time. I think that is marvellous but I sometimes regret that the late Leonard Teale, who was an ex-World War II serviceman-he was of a fighter pilot towards the end of the war-is not here. I am sure he would have loved the Australia Remembers program and would have been very heavily involved in it. There is not much else I can say about this bill. It is basically a matter of a few technical amendments to fix things up. We are having discussions with the ex-service community in Melbourne with respect to the future of ANZAC Hostel. Whatever happens to that hostel, I will ensure-as will my department-that everything will be done in accordance with the wishes of residents there and they will be treated with the highest degree of sensitivity Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Sciacca) read a third time.",40

I ask the Treasurer: accept that the message from Saturday's by-election includes a concern from the public that it will not wear policies which high interest rates? Or do you agree with the Prime Minister today who thinks that interest rates are less important than topics like his republic? Now that the Prime Minister has shown he is deaf to those families on, to use his words, 'the mortgage grindstone' of interest rate uncertainty, will the Treasurer least tell those families whether or not they face another interest rate rise before the budget?",41

55,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor having produce resumed his seat, I now warn him.",41
56,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The hypocrisy of the opposition on this issue is just extraordinary. I ask the House to recall that when the Leader of the Opposition left this place as Treasurer, booted out by the Australian people in 1983, at mortgage interest rates were two per cent above what they are at the present time-12 Y2 May per cent-and they had only just come down from 13 Y2 per cent. The 13 Y2 per cent rate was the cap that they had at that time because were regulated rates and they were rates that were extremely difficult to get hold of. You had to beg and crawl to your bank manager to get a bank loan. Many people had to get involved in cocktail arrangements with personal loans and so on to get a decent home loan. So the actual rates for home loans were well above these so-called mortgage rates. The relative position is that the Leader of the Opposition who asked this questiontalking about the suffering of the Australian himself, when he was in office, in charge of monetary policy which produced outcomes which were well above those he left interest applying today. It is extraordinary in the extreme to see that those opposite have such gall to stand up here and say that the Australian people are being made to suffer by interest rates at 10 Y2 per cent. Obviously, no one likes to pay higher interest rates. Nobody likes that-of course they do not-and when they go down, as they did, from around 17 per cent maximum to 8Y2 to 8% per cent, obviously that is a tremendous to many people. When they start to go up, they do not like it. Obviously they are concerned that they may go higher. That is an understandable concern. But let us get it in actual perspective. The perspective is that the rates applying today are well below the average of the last 15 years, well below the rates applying under the opposition, and certainly well below the rates that the Leader of the Opposition left when he was Treasurer of this country. We will be taking every measure that we can in the course of the budget to ensure that we minimise the pressure on interest rates. The budget will be designed to achieve various things, but a key element will be to ensure that we have minimum pressure for additional interest rate increases. Budget 1995-96",41
57,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer seen reports that the government may change its plans for the May budget? What are the government's intentions in this regard?,42
58,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen varying reports, some suggesting that the is likely to weaken in its resolve to significantly tighten its fiscal policy and others saying that it is likely to produce a tougher budget than previously intended-and all of this stemming from the by-election on Saturwhich day. The reality is that neither of those asserlow tions .is true. The government changing its intention to significantly tighten budget policy so as to produce a budget surplus by 1996-97. The precise degree to which the budget will be tightened will not determined by election results but by a of what is appropriate given the outlook the economy as we finalise the budget. In that respect, I draw the House's attention to the fact that the national accounts for the Decemfiscal ber quarter will be out on Friday of this week. That will provide us with additional informalast tion to make those assessments. I should briefly mention why we are taking that approach. I announced in this House I think on 31 January that we would be tightenaccount. ing fiscal policy. That is because of a number of factors. Firstly, we are well into economic recovery, and economic settings for getting the economy out of recession and on to a strong growth path are no longer appropriate. Rather than five minutes of sunlight, as hear from the opposition, the economy has been growing for three years. We have had that gap. GDP growth of 12.6 per cent in those three years-12.6 per cent! We are now the fastest growing economy in the OECD. With growth of 5- per cent this year, we will have 16 per cent of growth from the trough to the end of this financial year; that is, by June of this year. What we are, looking at is very strong growth in the Australian economy, an economy which has clearly left the recession far behind it and taken off with strong growththe strongest growth in the OECD. This growth has been in conjunction with low inflation. We have had the CPI below 2- per cent for the past three years and the underlying rate of inflation below 2- per cent for the last 2- years. We have the double-strong growth and low inflation. We have not done anything like that for 30 years. For three decades we have not had that kind of performance. That is something that the nation government should be revelling in",42
59,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Revelling in!,42
60,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Revelling in the fact that we are growing rapidly; that we have an economy is well out of recession and which has inflation. That is a great conjunction of will not be economic outcomes. It is also the case that we have demand running ahead of output at the present time and spilling over into imports, which is giving be us some increasing current account deficit. view That is along with the drought and low for commodity prices which are beyond our control. We expect that demand will slow because of the action we have already taken on policy, particularly in the 1993 budget, and on monetary policy in the latter part of year. The combined effect of that will produce some slowing in demand, get demand and growth back into a better conjunction and stop this pressure on imports and the current In this budget we will also be trying to build a structural improvement in national savings which will reduce pressure on the current account. We will be trying to do two things: to get that structural improvement in national savings and to ensure, to the extent we that we think there is any additional gap between demand and output, that we eliminate Finally, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, we will also be aiming to introduce a budget that minimises the pressure for further interest rate increases. No-one, as I said in answer to the previous question, wants to see interest rate rises any higher than they have to be. What we have had so far in this recovery has been modest interest rate increases. Official rates have gone up by 2% per cent and mortgage rates by 1% per cent, to rates which, as I said before, are far below the average of the past 15 years. In this budget we will create the conditions which will ensure that we reduce the pressures for interest rate increases to the maximum extent possible. Interest Rates",42
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer. Given that the Prime Minister now says that a tight May budget with spending cuts will reduce the necessity for interest rate rises, do you now concede that your failure to cut spending in your failed budget last year caused interest rates to rise higher than necessary? Given that official interest rates rose three times last year and that average Australian home buyers are now paying $120 per month more on their mortgages, how much did your economic failure and budgetary incompetence cost them?",43
62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When I produced the budget last year and said that we were going to get strong economic growth and a big increase in investment, the opposition said that that was nonsense; that these figures were immensely overblown; that we could not possibly get a big recovery in investment; that the 14Y:z per cent growth in investment was a figment of our imagination; and that we were therefore gilding the lilly. As we now know, investment is going to increase much more rapidly than by 14Y:z per . cent. The latest forecast is 24 per cent. So we are looking at a totally different picture from that which the opposition expected would be the case-and a somewhat different picture from that which we expected to be the case, but one certainly much closer to what we expected than what the opposition expected. Opposition members basically were trying to tell the Australian people that there would be no recovery of investment and that there woUld be no substantial economic growth this year. Of course, they were way out in those calculations. What we have achieved is a better outcome in terms of growth of investment than we forecast back at that time, and the budget that we producedMr Costello-Why don't you say, 'Sorry'?",43
63,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sorry for 5Y:z per cent growth? Mr Costello-Yes, you-sorry!",43
64,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sorry for 5Yz per cent growth, 24 per cent investment growth, with 2Yz per cent inflationMr Costello-Yes, you should say, 'Sorry'. Mt ACTING SPEAKER-Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!",43
65,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We should say 'Sorry'? You've got to be joking! Mr Costello-For interest rates.,43
66,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,43
67,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, can you imagine any more absurd position coming from an opposition than to say we should apologise for having the Australian economy growing faster than any other in the Western world, with 2Yz per cent inflation? We should apologise for that? What an absurd position for an opposition to get itself into. What a totally absurd position to suggest that this is some sort of bad outcome for the Australian people. The reason that we are supposed to be apologetic is that there has been some increase in interest rates. So what those opposite are really saying is that, once you get interest rates down in a recession or in a position where you want to get the economy growing again and you lower interest rates as part of that process, you should never increase them again; you should leave them at their recovery inducing levels; and that, despite the fact that the economy is then in a totally different position, interest rates should basically remain frozen; that one should never increase them. That is basically saying that you should discard monetary policy---only ever cut interest rates, never increase them. That is a ridieulous position from a bunch of economic cretins who showed when they were last in office that they did not have any idea about how to run a decent economy, whose growth rates were far less than ours, inflation rates much higher than ours, employment growth much lower than ours, and whose economic performance was abysmal by comparison with this government's. We are not going to apologise for producing what are obviously good outcomes, but we will certainly be doing our best to ensure that in this recovery we minimise the pressure for interest rate increases as much as possible while ensuring that we do our very best to maintain a sustainable future recovery. Sustainable recovery means that you cannot just sit back with your arms folded and watch it all happen. You have to be in there doing something. There are various weapons available to us. The only weapon that the opposition says we should be using is to cut government expenditure; that we should not be ever touching interest rates; that we should not be ever touching taxes; that the only weapon left to the government is to cut government expenditure. It is a ridiculous and absurd position, and one that I am amazed there is not more critical comment about from the press. Health: Hospital Expenditure",43
68,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Can the minister explain the impact of changes in health expenditure on Commonwealth and state responsibilities in the health area?,44
69,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a matter that I think members of the opposition should pay some attention to. It might help them develop a decent policy for the first time in 20 years. It has always been the case in the Australian health system that the Commonwealth and the states have joint responsibility. Obviously, we jointly fund the hospitals. The states manage the hospitals, while the Commonwealth, through the Medicare benefits arrangements and the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements, provides direct rebates for services and subsidies for pharmacy. But there have been some worrying trends, particularly in states expenditure and behaviour in relation to hospitals, which are having a clear effect. Since 1988-89 Commonwealth expenditure on hospitals relative to expenditure by the states has been steadily increasing. In comparison, the states have been dropping away their absolute effort. It is not just that we are putting in more; the states are actually taking funding out. In constant dollars, in 1988-89 the Commonwealth spent $3.1 billion on hospitals and the states spent $3.6 billion. What has happened in the interim? In the last financial year the Commonwealth spent $3.9 billion and the states spent $3.2 billion. We are seeing money going in through the Medicare agreements-very substantial increasesto provide access for public patients but the states are pulling it out of the bottom drawer. Some of the states would argue that their hospitals are more efficient, that they are able to do more with less. Try telling that to the people of Victoria or, recently, New South Wales. There is clearly a poorer product. The reality is that the states have not only been withdrawing effort but also, in addition to that, shifting costs to the Commonwealth budget-and also to the private health insurance funds and consumers. I would have thought this would be a matter of considerable interest to the opposition, because not only are the health insurance funds having to put up their premiums but also patients are having to pay more. What we are seeing is a series of very contrived arrangements, including the privatisation of hospitals and hospital services and cost transfers for budgetary reasons-for accounting bottom line reasons-with no regard to patient quality of care. I am now seeing an increasing number of delegations from professional organisations saying that enough is enough. I have had representations, for instance, from pathologists, pharmacists, allied health professionals, nurses and hospital administrators, pointing out to me the very grave consequences of those cost-shifting arrangements. We have seen, for instance, opportunities for clinical training diminish because pathology and pharmacy are being privatised. What is happening is that the places for the next generation of pharmacists and pathologists are being removed from our public teaching hospitals. That will mean that we actually fail to maintain the existing quality of care. It is strange that organisations that represent, in this case, both the public and private sectors are saying to me that the Commonwealth must intervene to ensure that we see no further deterioration in the availability of public services in those areas-pathology and pharmacy, for example--diminishing opportunities for training or diminishing opportunities for research. I will certainly make it known to members of professional organisations that it is very difficult to get members of the opposition to attend to this matter. It is a very significant problem and one which is placing a considerable burden not only on the Medicare benefits payments and pharmaceuthe tical benefits but also on private health funds and consumers. It may suit the opposition eye to this. It is its own conservative colleagues who have been responsible-for instance, in Victoria, for a $75 million cost shed. In the case of some private hospitals, the privatisation effects are very dramatic. have indicated by letters to the state ministers that I will not register those private beds when they are clearly a contrivance to the responsibilities of state governments. It is all very well for those state governments to cut the budgets to hospitals and then turn a garet? blind eye while hospital administrators try to live within unrealistic targets. The effect of that is early discharge and poor preparation for the next generation of specialalternative ists, which are very serious outcomes, the consumer and poor quality health care. I hope that members of the opposition will encourage their colleagues in the conservative states to participate in the COAG discussion next week. In that discussion we have an opportunity to look at these responsibilities, to look at the cost-shifting questions and focus, for the first time in a while when comes to some of the state governments, the quality of patient care. The COAG discussions will enable us, I think for the first time in a while, to ensure that, when it comes to hospital funding, community funding, Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits, we have a genuinely national health I must say it is quite clear that members opposite have no interest in this matter, I presume we will have to conduct the debate without their support. Taxation: Dividend Imputation",44
70,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer would be aware of statements by the member for Melbourne, by ACOSS and by the ACTU calling for a review or reduction of dividend imputation tax credits. Do you oppose their calls?

77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes! Mr Downer-Tell us.",45
78,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable system. As member for Mayo!,45
79,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Micro-economic reform of the telecommunications industry was expected to deliver 12 per cent of the total economic benefits that will flow from the Hilmer style reforms. This government can certainly claim that it has led the way in encouraging more competition in telecommunications. Last year we reaffirmed that the duopoly will come to an end on 1 July 1997 and on that date will move to full and open competition. We have also made it clear that we are going through a process of consultation so that I can take my proposals to cabinet in the middle of this year so that legislation can be introduced into this House and put through the parliament in sufficient time for new entrants to make their plans and develop their strategies so that they can hit the ground running on 1 July 1997. Those proposals for more competition in telecommunications should be contrasted with  Optus Vision were arguing that they should have monopoly franchises over half the country, there was only one person in public life in Australia who was prepared to support franchises, monopoly rights, in communications, and that was the opposition spokesman, Senator Alston. He was the only person in public life who has supported additional monopoly rights in communications. We certainly argue that it is this side of House which is encouraging greater competition in telecommunications. At the same time, we are putting in assurances to protect rights to privacy for consumers. We are ensuring that telecommunications is still affordable and accessible, particularly in regional Australia including electorates such as Capricornia, and we will continue to do that. One area that has attracted a lot of attention is the industry development arrangements in telecommunications after 1997. I have made it clear on a number of occasions that I think the performance of this industry, which has lifted its export performance from $50 million a year when the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer, to $600 million a year at the moment-$50 million to $600 million in exports-deserves applause from both sides of this House when we have companies such as A1catel in the electorate of the honourable member for Fowler now exporting 40 per cent of their productive output. When I recently visited A1catel's factory it was explained to me that A1catel has contracts to sell more than $150 million worth of equipment to China, and that its factory at Botany is producing the latest undersea fibre optic cable to be used in a number of countries in the region. All of that is great for Australia's export performance. It means more export earnings for Australia-things that all of us should be supporting. While those of us on this side of the House are supporting greater competition in this very important industry, it is interesting to benchmark our support for greater competition in telecommunications with micro-economic reform in other industries. In the table that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, one industry was going to contribute benefits twice as great as in telecommunications. What was that industry? It was electricity and the power industry. It is estimated that micro-economic reform in that industry will deliver twice the benefits that will flow from microeconomic reform in telecommunications. It is interesting to see what has happened. A week out from the New South Wales election, when the Leader of the Liberal Party in that state had run around saying, 'We're the encouraging competition iri electricity in New South Wales by splitting the generators up into three separate companies,' Pacific Power-not the minister-merged those three competing companies, all owned by Pacific Power, back into the one entity. The equivalent in telecommunications would have been no Optus, no Vodaphone, and a government splitting Telecom up into three Telecom owned subsidiaries and claiming that was competition. And then a week out from the election, merging those three Telecom owned subsidiaries back into the one company without even consulting the government of the day. That is micro-economic reform Liberal style. Micro-economic reform Liberal style means that you do not get competition in electricity, you do not get competition in an industry that can deliver twice as many benefits as in telecommunications. If Telecom had as much control over this government as Pacific Power has over the New South Wales Liberals-your mates in Sydney; your mates are looking a bit silly at the moment-then we could certainly be assured that Telecom would still have a complete monopoly. We have made it clear, whether the test is in telecommunications or in aviation policy, that we support more competition because of the benefits that flow to consumers. When the Leader of the Opposition was the Treasurer of the day, just before the election, his government signed a new two-airline agreement to continue the restrictive anti-competitive duopoly arrangements-the man who should have been speaking up for more competition and reform. Even if the test were in other industries, every time the Liberals have been put to the test they have failed. That is why in telecommunications this government is determined to open things up to fuller and more open competition in 1997 . We believe that those benefits will continue to accrue to business and residential consumers. Fringe Benefits Tax",46
80,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration into the impact of the fringe benefits tax on the tourism industry. Did the report state that the government's fringe benefits tax, sales tax and capital gains tax fail the test of equity, efficiency and simplicity? Did the report also state that the fringe benefits tax was excessively complicated, that its imposition has extended beyond the original intention and that its application and impact need further review? Given that you claim that you cleaned up the fringe benefits tax, why is it that your own backbenchers still have no faith in the government's fringe benefits tax policy?",47
81,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"From recollection, I think the quotes coming from the honourable member are correct. Mr Tim Fischer-Absolutely!",47
82,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly have seen brief reference to those statements by the committee in its report. I think it should be borne in mind that, when we are looking at the compliance review of fringe benefits tax, we had a confined role to play in the sense that we were trying to minimise the costs to employers of operating the fringe benefits tax. I think we considerably succeeded in ensuring that there was a major reduction in compliance costs for employers through the various measures that were recently anno-mced in that regard. We also took advantage of the opportunity to go beyond that brief to make some other changes which reduced the impact of the tax in some areas, such as car parking. We did that in a way which was, overall, relatively cost neutral by changing the statutory formula for cars. I think the overall package was a good one--one which certainly reduced compliance costs to employers of this country. Although I see that some have disputed that, I think overwhelmingly the reaction was one that said that this is a good outcome. I have not had a chance to read the committee's report in any detail. If the committee has some constructive suggestions to make about how we can further improve the fringe benefits tax, I am certainly prepared to look at them. In the process that we went through in the last several months of trying to improve it, I was not aware of any particular recommendations coming from members of the committee as to what we should be doing in that regard. However, we did take into account many complaints that were made by employers about the fringe benefits tax, and they went beyond compliance. But if there are further things that we can do to improve the fringe benefits tax without reducing the overall level of tax revenue that obviously we require, then we will certainly see what can be done. I will read the committee's report with interest. Medical Treatment: Assault",47
83,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Human Services and Health whether her attention has been drawn to a Gold Coast incident in which a medical centre turned away a 12-year-old boy who had been assaulted by other youths. What is the minister's response?,47
84,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member very much for this question. It is a very disturbing case and the boy's parents have been in contact with my office. They have reported the matter to the medical complaints body in Queensland. They have told me that their son was fishing with a friend when the two were assaulted by a gang of eight youths of varying ages, who threw rocks, spat on them and slapped them around. Obviously, they were very traumatised, and when the parents finally caught up with the two children they were",48
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Have they been charged?,48
86,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand charges are likely to be laid, but I do not think they have been at this stage.",48
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you sure?,48
88,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am pretty confident that they have not.,48
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should be sure.,48
90,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not central to this issue.,48
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should not make charges.,48
92,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not referring to the specific case but to the failure of a medical centre to provide medical attention. That is the matter here, Mr Acting Speaker. In this case, the police advised that the boys should be checked out and the parents duly took them. In the case of one set of parents, they took him to a clinic where their son was treated regularly. The young boy is asthmatic. An emotional trauma of that kind might be likely to have a very devastating effect. So they did the sensible thing and took him there. In any case, they were most interested in his medical welfare, rather than the particular matters of any charges that might be laid against others. They were refused treatment. Their son was refused treatment because it was said to be a case of assault and the doctor did not want to be involved in any court cases. I would have to say that, without judging the correctness of those claims",48
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why are you raising this; we have authorities to deal with this.,48
94,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not judging that. Mrs Sullivan-What is your position? Why are you raising this?,48
95,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A complaint has been laid. Mr Ronaldson-You are a fraud.,48
96,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A complaint has been officially laid. It is not the first circumstance I have heard of people being refused treatment.,48
97,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a kangaroo court.,48
98,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw attention to the fact that this behaviour appears not only to violate the fundamental principles of Medicare, which require access, but also is in breach of the AMA's code of ethics. I quote directly from the section headed 'responsibilities to patients': 'Do not deny treatment to any patient on the basis of colour, race, religion, political beliefs or nature of illness.' It is simply inappropriate if any denial is made on any of those grounds. Further on there are further references made to that responsibility. My concern, as I say, is that this is not an isolated incident. I want to make it very clear to the medical profession that I am willing to take action against those doctors who behave in this manner. I am most interested in the reaction of members opposite.",48
99,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,48
100,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House will come to order. The minister will be heard in silence.,48
101,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that parents will be interested to note that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that I am grandstanding in raising this matter. I think it is a matter that needs to be drawn to the attention of the community as well as to the medical profession. Strictly speaking, the registration of doctors is a state matter, but the Commonwealth does have the power to withdraw a doctor's Medicare service number or to place conditions on the payment of Medicare benefits. This is a serious matter, a serious breach of ethics and, as I say, it is not an isolated example. I intend having discussions with state ministers to ensure that, when matters of this kind come to their attention, they are properly dealt with and not set aside as unimportant. Mr Abbott-Could I take a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker? Under the standing orders it is improper for a minister to refer to something which is before the courts, and this parliament is not supposed to be a kangaroo court for ministers to smear people. What is happening is that this minister is smearing a whole profession and in particular making threats about a particular doctor. It is completely unparliamentary and she should be sat down.",48
102,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is in order and will resume her answer.,49
103,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been very careful not to name the particular clinic or the participants but, more than that, I have been very careful to insist that the facts of this matter are yet to be determined. Nonetheless, if complaints are made to me as the minister for health about refusal of treatment, should I stand back and say this is of no matter? Mr Abbott-But you are smearing the profession!",49
104,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Warringah will cease interjecting. I warn him.,49
105,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Should I stand back and say to the parents and the communityMrs Sullivan-This is unfair,49
106,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Moncrieff.,49
107,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"it does not matter if your son is refused treatment, that the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about whether particular practices might be revealed? ",49
108,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Sturt will cease interj ecting.,49
109,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, it is a most interesting reversal of priorities. I would have thought that this young boy and his parents and others like them have a right to have this matter raised and they have a right to know that the Commonwealth government will not stand by and see refusal of treatment. We have powers of our own; we want to insist that the states use theirs and that they do not simply protect certain members of the profession who are refusing treatment. And, furthermore, I will be having discussions with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners-who I am sure would be most disappointed, not to say appalled, by actions of that kind-that when complaints of that kind are made and levelled against a particular individual we should ask whether they should continue to receive the financial benefits of vocational registration. It may suit members opposite to say that this young boy and his family should stay mute and should not ask for assistance from the political processMr Tim Fischer-Could I take a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker?",49
110,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But I am sorry, I disagree.",49
111,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,She is finishing. Mr Tim Fischer-Well might she have finished. Toxic Shock Syndrome,49
112,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer you to the actions of your junior minister, Senator Crowley, in releasing to the media and the medical profession on request post-mortem details of a 13-year-old Mount Isa girl who is suspected of dying from toxic shock syndrome. Minister, I put to you the following: as Senator Crowley's senior portfolio minister, and as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, were you consulted by Senator . Crowley before this document was made available? Why was the reference to the autopsy report with information sufficient to identify the dead girl made without reference to the parents of the dead girl and without any sensitivity to their privacy or that of their dead daughter? Do you accept that the release of the post-mortem information may have prejudiced the inquest into the girl's death? Why shouldn't Senator Crowley do what the dead girl's parents have asked for and resign? And, Minister, will you give an unreserved apology to the family of the dead girl for the hurt that Senator Crowley's unthinking callousness has caused them?",49
113,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And what about dropping the tax file number?,50
114,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly. Mr Acting Speaker, I am happy to address this question. It is a very sensitive matter and, unlike members opposite, I am prepared to have a look at each case on its merits. In this case was a sad event, a very sad event, widely publicised, including the identity of the young girl. I do not think there was a single person in this country who did not see the photographs or hear the story from the family and others who were worried about similar events. As a result the minister who was responsible for this area took certain action, and there is further work to be done to strengthen the warnings on tampons in Australia to improve",50
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not the point.,50
116,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just a minute. That is the context in which this happened, a very widely publicised event, which inevitably was going to be examined very carefully.",50
117,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And no apology. Mrs Bishop-How about the apology?,50
118,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Inevitably it was going to be examined very carefully and inevitably, sadly in these cases, in a very public way. I understand from the minister that that information was released and that she has given an explanation in the other place. I am happy to say that, while I was not aware of it in advance, I unreservedly apologise to the family for any offence that may have been committed. Mr MCGauran-Senator Crowley refused to.",50
119,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, she refused.",50
120,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will you apologise for the tax file number?,50
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Gippsland. The House will come to order on both sides.  ald for the tax file number?,50
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Chifley is not being helpful. Coal,50
123,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Resources, and I ask: has the minister seen reports that Australian coking coal negotiators have returned to Australia without achieving a settlement? Is the minister also aware of reports of settleit ments by Canadian and United States suppliers which would undermine the price objectives of Australian suppliers? What is the government's response to those reports?",50
124,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I have seen reports in the press that the Australian coal negotiators have returned from their negotiations with the Japanese steel mills without achieving a price settlement. It is significant because the current prices expire on 31 March and some concern has been expressed to me that that would place Australian exports in jeopardy. I want to assure the House that that is not the case because the procedure would be that existing prices would continue until new price negotiations are settled. There have been reports that Canadian suppliers have accepted a settlement and, whilst this may be the case, Japan is not a major destination for Canadian coking coal. In fact, when I was in Japan last year, I personally met with the Japanese steel mills to stress Australia's case for a price rise that would reflect return on investment for Australian coal mines. The problem we have is that there has been little investment in our infrastructure and, of course, for four years we have had a decreasing price in Australian coking coal. While the Japanese steel industry has been through a sharp downturn in recent times, we have hopes that it will increase its purchase of Australian coal. In fact, that is the case and the Japanese steel industry has recovered significantly and will return to profit this year. Whilst we always have to be vigilant, I am very pleased that the Australian coking coal negotiators have taken a very firm position and we can expect significant increases in price this year. A moderate price of $5 to $6 would return to Australia some $400 million to $500 million of additional exports this year, so it is a significant matter for the Australian economy. I am pleased to say that the negotiators have taken a hard line in this case to ensure that the Australian coal industry does receive a fair rate of return, I understand that they will return to Japan on 3 April. Toxic Shock Syndrome",50
125,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Today in the Senate question time, Senator Crowley failed to give the same apology to the dead girl's parents as you have just given. As the senior portfolio minister, will you require Senator Crowley to give the same unqualified apology as you have just given?",51
126,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take responsibility in these matters and I have given the apology in an unreserved way. I think that the member opposite should accept that. I have not seen the description of what went on in the Senate today, so it would be inappropriate of me to talk about what Senator Crowley mayor may not have done. But I do know that she is very sensitive, from earlier discussions, to the severe problems created for this family. As I say, as the senior portfolio minister, I take responsibility; I have done that in this House and I have apologised appropriately. Landmines Mr FITZGffiBON-My question is directed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. In several countries which have been torn by war in recent years there remain many thousands of unexploded landmines.",51
127,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,51
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,51
129,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These mines are having a devastating effect upon civilian populations. Could you tell the House what the government is doing to remove that scourge from these countries?  is, like many other nations, has a very strong record of opposition to the indiscriminate use of antipersonnel mines around the world. This country is currently deploying military personnel to both Mozambique and Cambodia, training the local populations in demining techniques and procedures. Honourable members would also be aware and that we have previously had a very proud involvement in demining exercises in Afghanistan. Demining training is not only something that the Australian armed forces are very good at; it is also something that Australia can donate in a most worthwhile way, through effort, time and expertise, to many Third World countries as they attempt to restructure their nations from civil strife. It is a pity that the opposition is not interested in this because this affects women and children. Limbs are being severed on a daily basis around the world. It is a pity those opposite do not take some interest in it. Mr Atkinson-Some of us are, so keep talking about it.",51
130,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Isaacs!  sonnel landmines vary in their explosive content from approximately 20 to 240 grams. The smaller basic mines cause damage to feet, often leading to amputation. The larger mines can be fatal. The mines are often cheap. They are very easily and readily constructed from relatively simple, available plastics and even wood. They are difficult to detect. One of the difficulties in detection is that they are watertight, light and, after heavy rain, will often float into what were previously cleared areas in many of these countries. They have no self-destruct mechanism and can lie for years, submerged under water in paddy fields, waiting for the innocent. One international initiative that could be pursued is the requirement that all landmines produced have within them self-neutralising appliances. But compliance by renegade countries in this regard would be very difficult to achieve. Our defence white paper of last year declares that this country will continue to work on methods to counter landmines that are difficult to detect because this is relevant not only to our own defence but to multinational security and humanitarian operations as well. I am pleased to advise the honourable member that research by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation indicates that several new technologies certainly merit further investigation. Firstly, airborne infra-red thermal imagery can detect recently laid metallic and nonmetallic mines through the soil disturbance associated with mine laying. Location of the individual buried landmines requires closer inspection and in that regard DSTO and CSIRO are working together on ground probing techniques-ground probing radar, in fact-to detect buried plastic landmines. Secondly, DSTO is conducting research on the use of high-powered microwave radiation to disarm plastic landmines. That is a potential major breakthrough. However, as honourable members would know, if they have bothered to follow this issue as it has pervaded the international media over the last decade or so, there is still a long way to go before we get the technology to counter the many different sorts of plastic landmines that have been developed. Crucially, DSTO is seeking to involve Australian industry in this program. In the coming months, the Department of Defence is going to involve itself in three major initiatives on the international stage. Firstly, in May, defence scientists from our country, the United States, the UK and Canada will go to the United States under the technical cooperation program-which is DSTO's main forum for defence science relations with those countries-for a major symposium, the design of which is to promote and coordinate the development of mine detection and clearance technologies. Secondly, the Australian Army will be holding a mine warfare conference in July to discuss techniques for breaching and clearing minefields in light of current and potentially future developed technologies. Thirdly, our Defence officials and Foreign Affairs officials will be participating in the United Nations meeting on ctemining in July this year. The main purpose of that will be, once again, to try to publicise the problem of landmines to provide a forum for technical expertise on this issue and to showcase for the world, particularly those developed countries interested in this issue, the available clearance technologies. Finally, all of these issues relating to landmines are very difficult ones technically. But landmines have a devastating effect on many countries and have inflicted huge and miserable suffering on so many millions of innocent people. This government, and particularly the Australian defence forces and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, are committed to ensuring that we play our part in the global search for some solutions.",51
131,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before calling the honourable member for Pearce, I remind the honourable member for Fadden that, even though he is excited by the impending result of the Sheffield Shield, he should not display the score. Women: Electoral",52
132,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question today is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. Does the minister support the decision of the ALP federal secretary to abandon the affirmative action quota system in the latest round of preselections in the Queensland division? How does she envisage the ALP meeting its commitment to women, and to a national target, when the rule is not being adhered to? How many women will now have to be endorsed in the 1999 preselections to meet the ALP's commitments by 2002? Will this mean that sitting male members have to be disendorsed?",52
133,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can answer that with respect to my portfolio responsibilities-that is, in encouraging and, by various means, ensuring that women are represented in all the decision making forums in this country.",52
134,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,52
135,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. From the point of view of my own party, I am a very public advocate of the 35 per cent rule. But I have to m,ake it very clear that my own party is streets ahead of the opposition when it comes to moving on this. I have listened as successive leaders of the Liberal Party have paid service to the idea of having more women in parliament. What they have done is wring their hands and say they would like to see it happen. We have a rule. It will be implemented. It has been passed at the national conference. It is a rule in the Labor Party. I draw members' attention to the fact that it will finally come into operation by the year 2003.",52
136,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is going to be very crowded.,53
137,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is, and I have said publicly today that I would urge the various branches of the party which think they can do it all in the last round to think a little more carefully about that. I would equally say to members opposite that pious posturing on this question does not suit them because they have taken no comprehensive or concrete action on the question of getting more women into parliament-none at all. What we get from members opposite, including the minister responsible for this area, is rhetoric, rhetoric and more rhetoric. The women of Australia understand that you do not have a policy in this area, and you certainly have no means of enforcing any good wishes that you might have. Good intentions are not good enough here. A rule is what is required, a rule is what we have got and a rule is what will operate. In due course, a great many more women will be looking across from this side of the chamber to an allmale opposition of a depleted size. Commonwealth Law: Computerisation",53
138,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. I refer him to the increasing importance of communications technology in business decision making. What steps is the government taking to assist that process of business decision making by improving access to the law through the use of the latest communications technology?,53
139,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Firstly, Mr Acting Speaker, I take some exception to your admonition of the honourable member for Fadden. I was very interested to see the score, which I understand is eight for 347-only two lipmore wickets for Queensland to win the shield. Mr Downer-It is an affirmative action program.",53
140,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Queensland winning the shield is not an affirmative action measure, but it is being done highly on merit, I can assure the House. Almost as important as Queensland winning the shield is the government's fundamental responsibility to ensure that the laws of the land are accessible to the citizens of Australia. In May last year I announced that the Commonwealth was going through a process of consolidation of all Commonwealth statutes. Upon the completion of that process all Commonwealth law would be available through the department's computer program SCALE from the network of government bookshops throughout Australia. I can report to the honourable member that that process is now completed. Throughout Australia, any member of the public, any law student or anyone else who is interested, may obtain through a search of the database at a government bookshop the complete set of Commonwealth statutes maintained up to date as each amendment is made. For a nominal charge, anyone can obtain a print-out or the relevant section of the legislation which is required. In terms of the provision of services such as social security, Austudy legislation or things of that nature, the ability of the citizen to gain access to it is most important. The next. stage of this program will see the upgrading of the SCALE system to make it more user friendly and enable compatibility with common home PCs, the use of Windows and so on. Tenders on that program are being considered at the moment. All things going well, it should be available by the end of the year. An examination is also being made at this point of making the Commonwealth law available on the Internet. When the same program is completed for delegated legislation, probably next year, it will mean that for the first time we will have available not only to lawyers but, most importantly, to the people of Australia all the laws passed by this Commonwealth and all delegated legislation made pursuant to Commonwealth statutes.",53

144,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr CostellQ) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The pressure on interest rates caused by the government's economic failure. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required by the standing orders having risen in their places",54
145,Mr COSTELLO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The House has probably lost count of the number of occasions on which members of the opposition have stood at this dispatch box, stood on the back bench, warned the government that unless it got its budgetary policy into check, unless it improved its economic performance, the home buyers of Australia would pay with increased interest rates, and the home buyers of Australia would bear the financial penalty of this government's failure. In response to those warnings that we have been giving this complacent, tired and failing government, over the last 12 months we have heard a repetitive refrain come back from the government. 'All that can be done has been done. Paul Keating is an economic genius .. Nothing more can be expected of this particular government. You've never had it so good.' The Treasurer (Mr Willis) stood here at the dispatch box in question time today and talked about how wonderful this government's economic performance was-what a brilliant job he was doing; what a brilliant job the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was doing. 'There is nothing wrong.' According to this government, 'You've never had it so good.' You,· the mortgage payers of Australia, have never had it so good, according to the Labor view of the world. You do not have to go back that far. You can go back through Hansard and see all of the complacent do-nothing attitudes of the donothing Treasurer and the complacent donothing attitudes of the complacent Prime Minister, on 30 June 1994, standing in this place saying: I absolutely reject the charge from the opposition that the government has been irresponsible in not getting the deficit down. That is what he was saying after last year's failed budget. You had absolute howlers from the minister for know-nothing, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), who stood in this place on 21 September and said: . . . there is not necessarily a direct connection between any particular level of deficit at any of time and short-term interest rates. Back then, fiscal policy had nothing to do with interest rates. Now, of course, it has everything to do with interest rates, as the government now says, 'We are going to reduce Commonwealth expenditure to take the pressure off interest rates.' But the point is, Treasurer, if you now believe that, why did you not do it then? Why did you not do it in last year's budget? Why is it that you failed in last year's budget and put that $120 per month on the mortgage of the Australian home buyer? If you recognise that what has to be done now is to reduce expenditure, why did you inflict such pain on the Australian public over the last 12 months? We always thought, on this side of the House, that it would take a pretty big shock to get some realism into this government, but the Canberra by-election must feature as about a 12 on the Richter scale in terms of a shock. If you cannot get a message out of this Canberra by-election, there is no way other than turfing you out of office that the Australian public will ever be able to give you a message. This is the largest by-election swing since 1939; the largest by-election swing since Hitler invaded Poland; the largest by-election swing since the year when John Howard was born; the largest by-election swing in the lifetime of those who are in this parliament. Your backbenchers are already picking up the message, the backbenchers who came in this morning and started delivering messages to the out-of-touch Prime Minister. The member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) said: I do not think they are listening to the people. I would like him to listen to the people and what they are saying, and they have certainly said something here in Canberra. I say this to Silvia Smith: there will be a Smith in Bass after the next election. Harry Quick-quick by name, quick by naturesaid: People in the electorate are a little bit disappointed by the apparent arrogant way that he's carrying on. Who is the 'he'? It is the Prime Minister. Peter Knott, one of the great intellectuals of point the Labor Party, came in this morning and said: In terms of Mr Keating, I think it's basically to make sure that he does listen-he has said that he has heard the messages ... time will tell whether that's in fact true or whether it's just a glib oneliner. Don't wait, Knotty: it was a glib one-liner. What do those three people all have in common? Why is it that, when they came into Parliament House this morning, they told the truth? They were not good enough to get into the professional devel-pment program. That is what they all had in tommon. They are the second eleven of the Labor backbench-those who cannot get into the program. They are the people that the government will kiss goodbye after the next election-Chynoweth, Cleeland, Cunningham, Dodd, Ferguson, Haviland, Henzell, Knott. And it goes on. All of those people are not in the first eleven of the backbench. I reckon they ought to be taking the Prime Minister to the professional development program. I am afraid to say that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the honourable member for Throsby, have also been left out. They do not see much prospect for you in professional development. But I have some good news for you: if you want to engage in some professional development, you could go to the next session on Friday, 7 April, MCIntosh Securities Limited, level 39, between 9.00 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. I recommend to all of the second eleven to turn up and try to get themselves into that professional development program. I would like to thank Gary Gray for sending me the notice of the program for professional development over the next couple of months. So we heard the warning from the Labor back bench, from those outside the professional development program, those that were excluded because they cannot tell enough lies on behalf of the Prime Minister. What do we see from the Prime Minister himself? What do we see from the conceited, cocksure, selfabsorbed monument to his own self-importance? He stood up here yesterday and, when asked about the Canberra by-election, said; The truth is that, if it were not for the ACT tion on the weekend, the opposition leader would be covered in mud. In other words, if it had not happened, you would be in trouble. As one commentator said in the newspaper today, it is like saying, 'If it wasn't raining outside, it would be sunny.' It is like saying, 'If your father wasn't your father, he would be your mother.' Here is the Prime Minister saying, 'If it weren't for the by-election, it would have been a bad day for the opposition.' Earth to the Prime Minister! Is there anybody there? Do you know what the electors of Canberra were saying to you? What they were saying to you is that this is exactly the kind of behaviour that makes them repulsed and repelled from a prime minister who cannot and will not listen even in his own town. Make no mistake about it: Canberra is the town of this Prime Minister. You get a 12-point movement on the Richter scale, and there is no response. It hardly registers. There is nobody at home inside those ears. If you ignore the fact that the mortgage belt is hurting, in the Prime Minister's eyes, you can get back to the real business of politics like redesigning the 19th century architecture of Berlin, or talking about the things that he thinks are important like the German republican model. Or you can get the kind of response you got from the Prime Minister to students: go and get a job. What a callous thing. When 30 per cent of 15to 19-yearolds are unemployed and looking for their first job, what does the Prime Minister say to them? Go and get a job. That comment will be worn around his neck, along with the 800,000 people who hang from his belt-the people he put out of work for a very long period. The only response we really see from the government, the kind of response that we saw yesterday, is that of starting to put the rollers under the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). Did you get that feeling yesterday? There were many opportunities to get up and back up the Deputy Prime Minister. Inspired leaks are now starting to appear in the press. The Deputy Prime Minister is now having his career run before him, and the failed Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the apparent heir apparent, is starting electo move in on him for that particular place. I will say this about the Deputy Prime Minister: he will never be a star as a minister, but he came pretty close to telling the truth yesterday. He came pretty close to telling the truth about this Treasurer's and this Prime Minister's economic performance. What he said yesterday on Radio 3A W was: ... and we've got to make sure that the expectations of voters start to be settled down-that people feel the Government's in control ... And I think at the moment there's a sense that, you know, we're not sure about whether there'll be further interest rate rises, whether the balance of payments problem can be controlled and so on. Well, you have no plan to control the balance of payments problem. You have no plan to control the rises in interest rates. The reason people think you cannot control them is that you have proved that you cannot control them. That is the fact, and the fact is beginning to become known to the Australian people. It was the Deputy Prime Minister who made that observation on 3AW yesterday. He also made another observation on 3A W yesterday. He said: ... I think the last budget could have been tighter and of course that's as much a retrospect comment on ... part of the process so, you knowThe interviewer interrupted: A lot of people said it at the time, didn't they? The Deputy Prime Minister replied: Yeah, I think that, you know, we could have been a bit tighter last year. The fact is that you should have been tighter in your budget last year. When we asked you to say 'Sorry' today, you refused to do so. If the budget had been tighter last year, you know and the Deputy Prime Minister knows that you could have taken some of the pressure off interest rates. It was your failure to bring in a responsible budget last year that actually put the pressure on interest rates, which the people of Australia are now feeling and will feel even more over the course of the year. When the government looks at its own expenditures in the roll-up to this year's budget, it must know the truth. The truth is that federal government spending in 1995-96 will be $7 billion higher than planned in One Nation. The truth is that the problems in relation to expenditures are the problems in relation to own purpose outlays. It is Commonwealth own purpose outlays that are causing the problem. There are sophisticated tricks that the government has used in the accounting sense to try to hide the true nature of outlays as a percentage of GDP. In the first place, what it does is to count states' repayments of past debt as negative outlays. That is one of the techniques that the government uses to try to depress outlays as a percentage of GDP. It classifies asset sales as negative outlays. It does not bring it into account on the capital account or even on the revenue account. It brings it into account as a negative outlay. So, when we make historical comparisons before there were asset sales, we get an inflated number. What the government also does when it takes advantage of figures as a proportion of GDP is to include the reductions in outlays that the Commonwealth has made to the states. In other words, it tries to claim the credit for all of the reductions in expenditure that the states have undertaken. But the fact is that, when we isolate these factors out and take away those tricks, Commonwealth own purpose outlays as a proportion of national income are at the highest level on recordabout 19- per cent of GDP in 1994-95 compared with 18 per cent in 1982-83 and 16- per cent under the Whitlam government in 1975-76. So, if you want to know where the expenditures have gone and who the culprit is, the culprit is the Commonwealth itself. If you want to know where the reductions can be made, it is in Commonwealth own purpose expenditure. If you want to know who is responsible for putting the rollers under interest rates, it is the Commonwealth. If you want to know when things started going wrong, it was with last year's budget. If you want to know who is responsible, it is the complacent Prime Minister and the do-nothing Treasurer. No amount of creative accounting tricks, no amount of obfuscation and no amount of the repetitive lecture that we have heard for so long-'You've never had it so good'-will cover up the results and the facts. If you cannot hear a message out of Canberra, out of the ACT, out of the events of last weekend, it is a very sad thing for Australia. But I tell you what: it's an even sadder thing for you. If the Labor Party cannot hear that. message, if the Labor Party intends to bury its head in the sand and chooses to ignore that, it will see that Canberra result replicated in marginal and swinging seats right throughout Australia. Maybe that shock was not big enough. Maybe the only shock that is going to get through to the complacent, conceited, self-obsessed Prime Minister will be the shock when he is thrown oyt of the Lodge and his government is thrown off the treasury bench.",54
146,Mr WILLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me say at the outset that I fully reject the assertion of economic failure. I also reject the assertion of complacency on the part of this government. There is no complacency. There never has been any complacency on the part of the government, which has remained very much attuned to the need to get the Australian economy growing strongly and restructured to ensure that it will do better in future than it has done in the historical past. In that sense, what we have seen in the last decade or so is a sea change in the Australian economic structure, one which certainly does not demonstrate a government which is resting in a state of complacency. Rather, the government has been concerned to restructure the Australian economy to ensure that we have better prospects for growth and much better prospects for maintaining better living standards-in an absolute and relative sense-.:than would be the case if we had maintained the old historical structure of the Australian economy which the conservatives had basically produced for us. That is not a complacent government but a government which is far seeing and trying very hard to ensure that we have a country with a much better prospect for the future than was otherwise going to be the case. Nothing that has happened over the course of the past 12 years--or in the last year or two--demonstrates any complacency. Rather, what has happened demonstrates a government which is determined to achieve what has been achieved in terms of the economic fundamentals-strong growth, low inflation, strong employment growth and falling unemployment. These are the key things that governments should be aiming to achieve. In terms of economic management, these are the tests. Can you get the economy growing at a reasonable rate? Yes, we have. It is the fastest growing economy in the Western world. Can you keep infl-tion down in that context? Yes, we have. It IS below the OECD averagebelow the average of our major trading partners. It has been below 2Y2 per cent for the last three years. Can you get employment growing? Yes, we have. We have got employment growing by 560,000 since the last election-in just under two years. I think it has grown by 340,000 in the last 12 months. There has been a 4.4 per cent growth' in employment. Is this something which represents economic failure, as this absurd motion says? The motion refers to 'the pressure on interest rates caused by the government's economic failure'. We have employment growing at 4.4 per cent and the unemployment rate falling by two per cent over the last 12 months. Is this economic failure? It is just ridiculous. I am sure that anyone who is an objective observer would recognise that there is no economic failure here. There is a concern about the prospects for rising interest rates. We know that. But let us get that into context There is no economic failure. Most governments in the Western world would think our figures for growth, inflation, employment and unemployment were a terrific outcome. They are certainly miles better than the OECD average, miles better than the figures for any other country in terms of·overall economic growth. There is no economic failure. In the eyes of members of the opposition, economic failure is shown by rising interest rates. They say that tl1at itself demonstrates economic failure. Of course, as I said at question time, the increase in interest rates has been relatively small. We have not gone back to high rates or even to the average rates of our historical past. We are well below the average for the last 15 years, which is at least a couple of per cent higher for mortgage interest rates. . We do not have high interest rates by the standards of the historical past, but obviously no-one likes paying higher interest rates. Seeing that increase of 1% per cent, people are concerned that there may be further increases. What they have in mind are the kinds of increases which occurred at the end of the 1980s. We are not going to go back to that level of interest rates. The government will be working very hard to ensure that we minimise the pressure on interest rates. We will be doing that in a budget which is going to be announced in this House in not much more than a month. That budget will be very much concerned with ensuring that we can maintain a sustainable recovery. As I said, what we have is a very rapid rate of growth of the economy and an even faster rate of growth of demand. We have to bring demand .back. I think it is coming back anyway through the steps we have already taken. But we need to ensure that it comes back to match output and that we do not have that spill over into imports. We also need to ensure that we are able to get a sustainable rate of growth and keep inflation down. Obviously, these are always objectives which require the government to make changes to its policy from time to time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), made a lot of noise about last year's budget and said that it was a great failure. Last year's budget involved a tightening of the deficit involved our implementing the Working Nation package, but doing so in a context of better fiscal outcomes for the forthcoming financial years than had previously been the case. This year we need to look at a structural tightening because we have a circumstance in which we have excess demand. We also need to ensure that we have a better savings performance in this country than we have been able to achieve so far. The easiest and quickest way to achieve that is by minimising public sector dissaving. Public sector dissaving is represented, in the broad, by a budget deficit. By moving to a surplus more quickly, we will be minimising the discount on saving from that area and helping boost the national saving performance. That, in tum, will help, although it does not guarantee,. ensure a better current account outcome. That is something which is important if we are to have a sustainable recovery. I was listening to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-most of his time was spent cracking jokes-and there was absolutely nothing from him, as there is never anything from him or anyone else on the front bench, about what they would do in current circumstances. Since Fightback, the opposition is totally policy free. It had a bit of at making policies when the previous leader was there in The Things That Matter. It produced a document which said that what we should be doing is reducing the budget deficit. It had 36 ways to increase the budget deficit. It had 36 expenditure increases and tax cuts which would have increased the budget deficit. That was its contribution. That is the state of knowledge that we have so far about its policies. Since the new Leader of the Opposition was appointed, we have heard nothing about The Things That Matter. Whether that is still part of the opposition's policy or not, we do not know. What we do know is that we hear nothing from the opposition ever about what it stands for. It went right through this by-election not standing for anything except knock, knock, knocking the government. It was knocking the government, but standing and for nothing. When you hear, 'Knock, knock,' from the opposition, and ask, 'Who's there?' all you get is knock, knock. There is never any answer. There is no policy coming forward. The opposition is a policy free zone. The opposition obviously intends to remain that way for as long as it possibly can, because it is scared that if it announces any policy that will mean that it can be subject to some criticism. It is a poor sort of an opposition which cannot muster a few lines of alternative policy except to say, in the broad, that the government should be reducing the budget deficit and that we should be doing that only by cutting government expenditure. That is the kind of mantra that we get from the opposition, but we never get any detail as to what one should do. When asked how we should actually do it, the opposition says, 'By improving efficiency of government operations.' If you are going to save billions of dollars by improving efficiency, that means you have to lay waste to the public service. In the Canberra by-election, the opposition went around reassuring the Canberra people that there would not be any diminution in the size of the Public Service. It said that it would ensure that there was a nice healthy Public Service out there; it was not part of its an attempt policy to lay waste to it. What happened to the efficiency savings through the great change we were going to get from cutting running costs? It is all just a load of nonsense. It just does not hang together. There is no policy of substance at all in this opposition. Having been bitten by going into great detail with Fightback, it is now going to go in the opposite tack and never have any policy and just try to coast in on criticisms of the government. That will keep it operational in this House, but it certainly will not do come the next electionlet me assure you-when people will want to know what the opposition actually stands for. At the moment the opposition stands for there never being any increase in interest rates. It is ridiculous to say that one of the major weapons of government to try to control the economy should never be utilised. If that is the case, how come other countries which are in a growth situation along with us-many countries are not, but some developed countries are producing some reasonable outcomes at the moment-are increasing their interest rates? Is that because they have all failed massively in their policies too? New Zealand, which has a budget surplus, has increased its official rates in the recovery phase, which is about as long as ours--of some 13 quarters, over 3 Y4 years-by six per cent whilst we have increased ours by 2% per cent. Has this been some massive failure of policy by the conservatives in New Zealand? Canada has increased its official interest rates by 4Yz per cent, from 3Yz per cent to eight per cent. The United States has increased its interest rates by three per cent. United Kingdom, which is later in the growth cycle-it has been going for less than three years and has grown much less than we have, a little over half of what we have-has increased its interest rates by 1Y2 per cent. Why are all these governments doing that? Because this is part of the armoury that governments have to run an economy. If you tie your hands on that and say you will never increase interest rates, which is what the opposition is saying we should be doing, then obviously you have to put the total weight on fiscal policy. It is just a ridiculous position. No other government in the Western developed world that is currently running with a recovery is freezing its interest rates. No-one out there amongst the economic commentators and the financial analysts would believe that such a policy was credible. It is an incredible, non-credible, policy. That is not to say, therefore, 'Let us just turn to monetary policy and crank it up as much as we want.' We are not saying that at all. I draw attention to what the now Leader of the Opposition said back in 1981 when he was Treasurer. When talking in question time about monetary policy and emphasising how important it was to have monetary policy to keep hold of inflation, he said: ... Government remains very much of the view that firmly adhering to responsible monetary objectives will playa major part in continuing to reduce the rate of inflation in this country. ' He went on to talk about how important it was to have a firm approach to monetary policy. He had inflation at 9.4 per cent, but he was also shoving up interest rates. Short-term interest rates went up to 21 per cent. They went through the roof. He is now standing in the House at question time asking me questions as though I am to blame and as though the government is doing something heinous for having interest rates which are much less than they were when he was the Treasurer and was responsible for monetary policy. What an absolutely incredible hide. He is just hoping that the public will not notice and will not remember. It is a long time ago, that is true. But when he last had The hold of the monetary reins, in association with the Reserve Bank-I think there was much more political influence exercised in those days than there is now-increasing the interest rates was something he turned to in a big way. He left office with mortgage rates two per cent higher than they are now, and that was with a regulated regime. The actual rates people had to pay were a damn sight more than 12Yz per cent by the time they cocktailed up their rates. The hypocrisy from the opposition is just extraordinary on this issue. We will do our very best in the forthcoming budget to ensure that we are able to bring about our economic objectives of sustainable growth and minimise the pressure on interest rates. That is our objective and we will try to ensure that we can JTIaintain for the Australian people what is now an extraordinarily good outcome for them in terms of the overall economic fundamentals-strong growth of the economy, low inflation, strongly growing employment, falling unemployment and growing real incomes. These are the major things that the Australian people want to see occurring. They are occurring now. Our objective is to make sure that they keep occurring. The budget will be designed to make sure that that is the case.",57
147,Mr VAILE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is always interesting to follow the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in one of these debates about the economy, interest rates and the like. It was interesting to listen to the last couple of minutes of the Treasurer's address. It sounded very much to me as though there is a very real possibility that interest rates will rise before we even make it through to the budget on 9 May. A Reuters survey says that 21 out of 25 economists predict an interest rate rise in April. Will that be off the back of an unacceptably high current account deficit figure coming out this Thursday? It is also interesting that, in these debates, the Treasurer always loves to go back into history and refer to some of the statistics which existed before the Hawke-Keating government came to power in 1983. He quoted some of the statistics from when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer in 1981 and referred to the use of monetary policy. The people of Australia should be aware that in 1981 we did not have a deregulated labour market. It is a bit of a different story. I see that the Treasurer now leaving the chamber. The matter we are debating today is due to the fact that the Labor Party got itself back into power in 1993 on a number of promises, all of which have since been broken. The Labor government has brought down two budgets in which it had the opportunity to address some of the problems in this country by making adjustments to fiscal policy, and it has not done so. Why? Because it has not had the intestinal fortitude. The Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), likes to keep telling us that he has got his hands on the levers. But we know the fact is that he does not have his hands on the levers and that his ACTU and Labor masters are the ones who have their hands on the levers. The Treasurer highlighted the point that the government believes the recovery to be sustainable, that current growth rates are fine and that basically we should all invest in a new pair of government subsidised rosecoloured glasses and we will see it the way the government sees it. The government is running this MCCarthyist type debate. It is trying to run over the people of Australia and wear them down with attrition from the despatch box by making them listen to the stories that it is putting across as far as its policy settings are concerned. The facts of the matter are that we cannot sustain the levels of growth we are currently experiencing; there will need to be a rise in interest rates. That will disrupt a whole range of finely balanced factors currently in force throughout the economy. Why will there be a rise in interest rates? Because of the competition that this government places in the marketplace for the available finance, low national savings and a higher than normal level of competition by a Commonwealth government in the marketplace wanting to borrow money. The history of the Labor government, with the member for Blaxland as Treasurer and as Prime Minister, illustrates that the growth he so desires has indeed been in some unwelis come areas. Under the honourable member, growth in total Commonwealth debt has been $54 billion; growth in Commonwealth securities has been $54 billion, with semi-government securities having grown $77 billion; growth in the current account deficit has been $26 billion; and growth in gross foreign debt has been $168 billion. This is the growth that the Prime Minister has wrought on Australia. Over the weekend the people of Australia, through the voters in Canberra, have given this government a clear message that they are not going to be fooled by the sleight of hand tricks any more and that they are not going to be fooled by the gilding of the lily and the flowery words that the Prime Minister is prepared to use. They have spoken. Let us have a look at that by-election in Canberra and at what brought about that result. The voters were from mainstream Australia, middle Australia; people who have mortgages, who have suffered and who will suffer further in the .next couple of months at the hands of this government with its policy settings. In the electorate of Canberra 42.8 per cent of voters have houses that are mortgaged; 60.5 per cent are two-parent families; and 6.2 per cent are unemployed. What does the Prime Minister say to these people when he has increased, and has been a party to the policy settings that have increased, interest rates over the last six or so months, which has meant that that 42.8 per cent of the people in the Canberra electorate who have mortgages are paying an extra $120 a month on their mortgages? These are the things that members on the other side of this place do not understand. What does it mean to have to dig into your pocket for an extra $30 a week? Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that, at some stage in your career, you have understood what it is like. It is not easy. It may not be difficult to absorb $30 a week if you are on the prime ministerial salary, living in the Lodge and collecting rent from a house in Queen Street, or if you are on the Treasurer's salary. But think what $30 a week means if you are a single-income family on a very average wage. I know what it means. It means that, instead of maybe eating a bit of steak and a few sausages each week, it is mince once a week. That is what it means to average Australia. At last people have woken up to the glib lines that the Prime Minister uses. They now know his attitude to middle Australia and how he is hurting people. They have kicked back on the weekend. It is interesting to note that some of your caucus colleagues, Mr Deputy Speaker, have kicked back. An AAP report states: Tasmanian MP Harry Quick said he was pleased with Mr Keating's performance since the by-election but the public was disappointed by his arrogance. ""People in the electorate are a little bit pointed by the' apparent arrogant way that he's carrying on, but I think all things are relative,"" Mr Quick said. The report also refers to our friend over there the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), the intellectual wizard, who has the state seat of South Coast right in the heartland of his electorate. The report continues: New South Wales MP Peter Knott said it was important for Mr Keating to listen to the messages from the by-election. ""In terms of Mr Keating, I think it's basically to make sure that he does listen-he has said that he has heard the messages. . . ""Time will tell whether that's in fact true or whether it's just a glib one liner."" In one of today's newspapers, I think it was the Courier-Mail, Peter Ruehl hit the nail on the head when he said: The day after the Canberra by-election, the Blasterthat is, the master blaster, the Prime Ministersaid he'd gotten the message. You know, kind of like the way Custer got the message. That was absolutely evident yesterday. Could anybody believe the attitude of this man when people in his home town of Canberra are suffering, when people in mainstream Australia are suffering and when the financial policies of this government are wreaking havoc around Australia? He tells people who are protesting-that have the hide to protest at the government and protest at him-to go and get a job. How disgusting it is to see the Prime Minister of Australia standing here week in and week out, maintaining that he represents the people and that he is doing a magnificent job for all the unemployed people in Australia. The protesters are probably children of working-class families. To put their children through university both parents are probably working-and have a night job to boot-and are paying the high taxes that this government levies. When they protest about an increase in HECS on postgraduate courses the Prime Minister tells them to go and get a job. Their parents are probably working at two jobs to give;them a better education. It is an absolute disapdisgrace. The people of Australia have woken up to what the Prime Minister is all about. The best comment that came out of Canberra over the weekend, following the by-election, was the sign that was stuck out in the ministerial wing which read 'Canberra 2, Keating 0'. All the Prime Minister had to say about the result of the election for the Canberra Legislative Assembly was, 'So what.' I believe he probably also thinks 'so what' about the Canberra by-election result. In closing I would like to note what the rest of Australia has been saying to the Prime Minister through letters to the editor. I wonder whether he will listen to these; I wonder whether he will listen to his back bench; but, more importantly, I wonder whether he will listen to the real people in mainstream Australia. Mr Tomas Gray of Holder, ACT, wrote: A harsh budget will end Keating's political career as certainly as an interest rate hike will. We have suffered five years of austerity. Most us see no sign of the recovery which was supposed to follow. The recovery is 'a sham. One of the measures introduced to reduce the unemployment figures has been the creation of ""traineeships"". What has resulted? Graduates in computing, for instance, are being forced to take ""office traineeships"" where they are taught filing and elementary bookkeeping and are expected to support their families on $330 a week. The Government's claim to have ""created"" hundreds of thousands of jobs is a sick joke. A letter from Mr James Morgan of Glenunga, South Australia, reads: . . . Canberran voters have abandoned federal Labor in a spectacular fashion. Roll on March '96, when the rest of Australia can emulate-it's time indeed! These are some of the comments from mainstream Australia, and it is about time the Prime Minister started to listen to them. The record of this government in setting fiscal and monetary policy is abysmal. It has had two opportunities to deal with the crisis in Australia that has wreaked havoc right across mainstream Australia-in the 1993 and 1994 budgets-but on both occasions it failed; it squibbed the task. It did not have the guts to go on and make those adjustments. (Time expired)",61
148,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Werriwa) (4.40 p.m.)There has been absolutely nothing said by the Liberal and National parties about economic policy in this debate. There has been nothing but a series of glib lines and throwaway political claptrap from the coalition because it has no economic policy or plans to put to the Australian people. When the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) first came to this parliament it was with a reputation based on student politics. In debates such as these all he does is expose himself as a student economist, as a smarmy, shallow student economist totally out of his depth in economic debate. He is completely out of his depth with nothing more substantial than cliches and cheap rhetoric. I thought for one moment in this debate we might be seeing from the Liberal Party the Abbott and Costello show. But we did not get that; we only got half-we got the Lou Costello half, the honourable member for Higgins. He is the sort of guy who in ecoof nomics lectures back at university would have come into class with an imitation spider in his pocket and a whoopee cushion under his arm; the sort of guy who was always wisecracking, always coming up with the gags, always full of jokes and throwaway one-liners. In this place he has not come up with a single word of substance on economic policy or economic plans for the Australian nation. He is the student wisecracker of Australian political and economic debate, and he is out of his depth on the formulation of economic policy or anything that looks remotely like economic substance. I want to test the record of the student economist. The House should examine his record, firstly, as a business investment forecaster, as someone who has issued a whole series of forecasts over the past 12 months about business investment in Australia. The honourable member for Higgins was talking about losing count. Losing count? Government members have totally lost count of the number of times he has been wrong in his estimates and forecasts on business investment. It all started on 29 May last year when the shadow Treasurer said: A dark cloud hangs over future recovery. A couple of days later, on 2 June, he said: ... business investment (is) dead in the water ... On 10 June he said: Th!!re has simply been no recovery in investment in Australia. On 19 June he said: ... business investment is being hamstrung ... A day later he said: Clearly, business investment is still dragging chain. And then there was the mother of all forecasts on 30 June: The Budget forecast of a 14.5% increase in business investment is in doubt. What actually happened with business investment since the last budget? Business investment around Australia is now growing at 22 per cent. We are not only getting the budget forecast but we are getting it with interest, with a 50 per cent boost in economic growth and investment. So where does that leave the doomsday rhetoric of the small thinkers of the coalition? Where does it leave the glib lines of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) who talked about 'five minutes of economic release: sunshine'? The truth is that his sundial has completely broken. He is a man from the The 1950s and his old-fashioned Seiko watch running slow. The truth is that ecohomic growth in this country has been proeeeding constructively and positively since June 1991. Don't talk about five minutes of economic sunshine; we have had 45 successive months of economic growth. In fact late last year the Australian economy, if anything, was growing too quickly. It was growing at a rate of 6.4 per cent. Now the honourable member for Higgins wants to talk about Australia's performance in the international economy. I know he is better suited to the flim-flam of comic books and throwaway economic lines. He would not have come across the OECD economic outlook released in December last year which shows not only that the Australian economy is growing quickly, at 6.4 per .cent through 1994, but that it is sustainable growth because of the policies of this government. Australia, in the ranking of growth among but the 25 OECD nations, is coming in third in 1995 with a growth performance 4.3 per cent, exceeded only by Finland and Ireland. And in 1996? You are wondering whether the growth is still sustainable into next year. Again our ranking is third of the 25 OECD nations. This is a performance of which this government and the Australian people can be justly proud, and it puts to rest the the cheap rhetoric and cliches·of the opposition, particularly the honourable member for Higgins. Of course, all that growth is having an impact in the Australian economy. In the two years since the last election 560,000 new jobs have been created. If the labour force participation rate had been at its 1983 level unemployment would be down to 3.8 per cent. That is how extensively jobs growth has been injected into the Australian economy. But after all that evidence-the GECD forecast, the record growth and the record job performance-the student economist is at it again. On 20 March this year, just a few days ago, this is what the great prankster of Australian economic policy had to say in a press fact is that even by Labor's own poor standis ards the current recovery is not strong. Tell that to the OECD! Tell that to the 22 OECD nations green with envy at the thought of sustainable growth rates in Australia of four to 4Y2 per cent over the next 18 months. I now turn to the credentials of the honourable member for Higgins as a budget manager, surely one of the most important tasks of a shadow Treasurer. He shies away from sustained interviews on TV, always mindful that his poor grounding in economics might bring him unstuck, that he might stumble over his lack of economic knowledge. Late last year he had a rare interview with Laurie Oakes on the Nine Network when he was asked about his policies as a potential budget manager in this country. This is what he had to say: Well, plainly we've identified many areas over the years where Government funds are being wasted, you know, extravagance down at the. Lodge ... plainly there's also a lot of expenditure that can be cut in the area of duplication, take commonforecast of wealth education. So let us take Commonwealth education. The cost of administration in that program is $4.3 million. That is his big picture economic cut, $4.3 million-which is totally at odds with his claim later in the interview that it repreof sents an expenditure saving of $160 million. This is the gay deceiver of Australian economics and Australian politics: out there telling the Bulletin magazine that he came from a poor, humble background-the same guy who, in truth, came from a two-income, professional family-trying to mislead and deceive the Australian people about his background and always, in the proof of it, trying to mislead them on his capacity as an economist. He is the student economist, the slothful, slow-learning student economist, of Australian politics. I also want to examine one of the most interesting aspects of the performance of this prankster of Australian politics. He likes to get into some of these wisecracking gags when he goes to business functions. On 17 February this year he gave a speech to BOMA. Most politicians addressing BOMA would treat it as an important forum, a chance to outline credentials on economic management and micro-economic reform. He got close to it halfway through his speech when he, the student economist, started to list some of the policy areas where he would do it better, some of the policy areas where he would make a difference. This is what he got down to on communications policy: ... the cross media ownership rules designed I think to make media owners 'cross' but having little other discernible effect. Has the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) been writing these lines? Are these the things that batter? Is this the standard economic debate and analysis by the Liberal Party in 1995-'cross media ownership rules designed I think to make media owners cross'? That is not even undergraduate humour from the student economist. It is not even the standard of a high school student. This is the stuff of play school from the student economist. Let us also judge briefly his credentials a judge of economic conditions. In this alleged matter of public importance he is trying to define failure. What sort of failure of government policy in Australia is it to have a low inflationary, high growth economy for the first time in 20 years, breaking the back two decades of stagflation in this nation; record job growth; and a budget deficit now trending down due to strong economic growth? This is the revenue clawback, plus the lower outlays the government will need to provide in its next budget on social security. He is a complete sham and fraud, the student economist.

149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Hollis)The time allotted for this debate has expired. NA (DANGEROUS GOODS) BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 27 February. Second Reading,65
150,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I take great pleasure in introducing the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994. The bill is part of a scheme designed to achieve the objectives of the heads of government agreements on heavy and light vehicles. The agreements form schedules to the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991. The efficiency of Australia's road transport system has in the past been undermined by inconsistent or contradictory road regulations imposed by each of the states and territories, and this has impeded Australia's economic development. Accordingly, in January 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was of established following agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. The commission's role was subsequently greatly expanded by a second agreement relating to light vehicles. This agreement, among other things, required the commission as a matter of priority to as develop and/or maintain national standards and associated codes of practice in relation to the transport of dangerous goods. The objectives of the national scheme are to produce improvements to both road safety and transport efficiency and reductions in the cost of administration of road transport. parties to the agreement agreed that these objectives necessitated the creation of uniform or consistent road transport legislation throughout Australia. The model adopted in the agreement to put the legislative scheme in place requires Commonwealth to submit to parliament road transport legislation in respect of the Australtransport Ian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay territory. The states and the Northern Territory agreed to then secure the passage of adopting legislalegislation. tion through their respective parliaments. Legislation of the states and Northern Territory will also provide for the automatic adoption of future amendments to the road transport legislation and regulations. This ensure that the legislation throughout Australdevelopment is remains identical to that enacted by the Commonwealth in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. This parliament has previously enacted two other bills under the cooperative scheme. The first established the framework for the adoption of a national system of heavy vehicle charges. The second put in place the powers to make regulations relating to the operations of vehicles and traffic. It intended to be basis for making a series of regulations 1991. covering issues such as vehicle standards, driver standards, hours of driving, the use large vehicles and traffic operations. A numfeatures ber of sets of regulations have already been developed under that legislation and approved by the Ministerial Council for Road Transregulations. port. The council consists of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers responsible for road transport. This bill puts in place the framework for the establishment, administration and enforcetransport ment of uniform regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods by road. The bill therefore forms the top tier of a legislaarise tive scheme which will incorporate proposed road transport reform---dangerous goodsact regulations and the Australian dangerous sions goods and explosives codes, which presently cover the land transport of dangerous goods throughout Australia. While the codes presently provide a common set of standards for all Australian jurisdictions, there is a lack of The uniformity in the degree to and manner in which those documents are incorporated into the law of each Australian jurisdiction. This bill provides the mechanism by which that deficiency can be overcome. The bill has been developed by the commisthe sion in close consultation with regulatory authorities responsible for administration of and of dangerous goods in all jurisdictions, as well as the substantial industry groupings which will be affected by this A regulatory impact statement on the bill was circulated widely and submissions in response to that statement, including those from the road transport industry, have been taken into account in finalising the bill. That will consultative process is continuing in the of regulations, as the commission continues to maintain close links with the Advisory Committee for the Transport of Dangerous Goods. The advisory committee comprises representatives of the industry and regulatory authorities and in the past has been responsible for the preparation of the codes. Ministerial council voted in favour of the bill by a majority vote on 30 September 1994, in accordance with the procedures set out in the the National Road Transport Commission Act I would like to briefly draw honourable of members' attention to a number of salient of this legislation. As I said earlier, this legislation establishes a framework for the making, administration and enforcement of Part II of the act is therefore an extensive regulation-making power. It allows regulations to be made in relation to a wide range of matters, including classification, labelling, packaging, stowage and segregation, of dangerous goods, mandatory accreditation of persons involved in the transport of dangerous goods and the obligations which in an emergency. The regu-Iation making power allows regulations made under the to apply, adopt or incorporate the proviof a code or standard. This is an importani provision as the codes set out the detailed technical standards which the regulations apply, and it is essential that the regulatory regime keep pace with technical developments at an international level. Part III of the bill provides for the appointwork, ment and powers of competent authorities and authorised officers. The powers of authorised officers broadly reflect the powers which are available to authorised officers in 'each of the jurisdictions under present state and territory dangerous goods legislation. While there are differences between the body of powers in the act and those in each of the jurisdictions, the commission believes, on the basis of extensive consultation with industry and 'the relevant authorities, that the body of powers is both comprehensive and sufficient to allow for effective administration of the legislation. Part IV of the bill allows competent authorities to grant exemptions to persons or classes of persons from requirements in the regulations and the codes. This will enable the present practice to continue whereby competent authorities responsible for the administration of the transport of dangerous goods can allow a person to operate at variance from the codes. This brings to the legislation a measure of flexibility which is necessary to reflect the different requirements which may arise from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the changing technical requirements relating to dangerous goods transport. Part V of the bill creates a 'number of serious offences in relation to dangerous goods. While offences in regulations will be able to provide penalties up to $3,000 for natural persons and $15,000 for corporations, the general offences in the act relate to breaches of duties which have potential to undermine public safety. They therefore reflect the serious safety considerations which are at the heart of this legislation. Part VI of the bill provides for a range of further orders to be made against persons responsible for breaches of the regulations and provides a comprehensive set of powers and sanctions which can be called upon in the event of non-compliance. In particular, clause 42 of the bill allows for corporations and their directors and senior managers to be held responsible for breaches committed by individuals in their employ or acting on their behalf. A feature of the present regulatory framecentred as it is on the requirements of the dangerous goods and explosives code, is that there is a common set of requirements applying to both road and rail transport of dangerous goods. The Commonwealth recognises the concern which has been expressed by rail authorities and rail operators that creation of a uniform system for the transport of dangerous goods by road should not come at the expense of the intermodal harmony which presently exists between road and rail. My department has given a commitment to ensure that the provisions of the present codes relating to rail are revised in harmony with the road provisions so that the essential seamlessness between the two modes is maintained. The implementation of uniform or consistent regulations in relation to road transport of dangerous goods is regarded as an integral element in achieving reforms in the road transport industry which will promote consistency, safety and efficiency. The government therefore supports the efforts of the National Road Transport Commission in its development of a truly national approach. It will result in a single nationally consistent and durable set of regulations covering road transport of dangerous goods, which is consistent with the other regulations relating to road transport generally being developed by the commission. State, and territory governments must also demonstrate their commitment to the reform process to ensure that its objectives are achieved and to enable the road transport industry to reap the benefits of those reforms as early as possible. The measures in this bill have no significant impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",65
151,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM," Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition will be supporting the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994, as we have supported all similar bills relating to national uniformity of our road rules for the road transport industry. The federal opposition supports these uniform bills because they make good common sense. One thing that has always been the cause of a considerable amount of annoyance .and increased cost to our road transport industry is the different road transport requirements that exist from state to state. As we all know, road transport is not limited by state boundaries; it crosses them on a daily. basis. About 4,000 trucks per day travel down the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne, and so many thousand trucks travel to Brisbane, across to Perth, to Adelaide and up to the Northern Territory. Our road transport industry today is a national industry that takes no heed of state boundaries yet is restricted by the different regulations applied by the different state governments in their respective states. There are enormous differences in the regulations applying to the carriage of dangerous goods between states. This has cost the industry a great deal of money and causes it considerable concern, frustration and delay. Over the last few years, as part of the microeconomic reform process, the industry, through its representative bodies-the peak body of which is the Road Transport Forum-has been urging the government to do something about making the various regulations applying to road transport around Australia uniform from state to state.",67
152,Mr COBB,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,-They've had over a decade.,68
153,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"The federal government has had over a decade-12 years, in fact-to do something about this. As with so many things, it has taken it a long time to act. It has had to be led by the nose by the various industry organisations to come up with a sensible response. In fact, over the last year or so, the government has introduced into this House bills designed to bring common sense into the carriage of goods around this country. For that reason, the opposition has supported those bills and will support this biII today. Earlier today, at 12 o'clock, I spoke at the Australian Bus and Coach Association's annual conference, held at the Canberra Convention Centre, at which this same issue-the need to have uniform regulations around Australia for our road transport industry-arose. From the debate on this subject at that conference, it was clear that one of the important things to recognise and take into account-this is particularly pertinent for the government-when introducing a bill such as this is the need to consult with the industry. It is all very well coming up with a great idea and introducing it into the parliament in the form of legislation, but it is critical to consult with the industry to ensure that measures are practical, workable and affordable. The Bus and Coach Association has a major concern about the regulations to be imposed in relation to access for disabled and elderly people to buses. The association had no part in the legislation that was introduced into the parliament in 1992 and proclaimed in March 1993. As a consequence, the implementation of that worthy attempt to make sure that all elderly and disabled people have access to buses has been delayed and will be delayed for a long time into the future because the whole thing is totally impractical. If we are going to do these things, which are the right things to do, it is important to consult the industry first and bring it in as a partner in the operation. That way, at the end of the day, the bills brought into the House will be workable and achievable and will enhance the industry in the process. The bill before us is what is called a peg bill. It will directly affect only the ACT and the Jervis Bay territory under Commonwealth control, but each of the states will then pick it up in their own state parliaments and turn it into law, using the same language in which it has been introduced into this parliament. The only exception, as is so often the case, is Western Australia. My good friend Eric Chariton, the Minister for Transport there, has said that while he and his government support the principles of this biIl, they will be Western Australianising it. That is, they will be introducing similar legislation but in a language that, apparently, Western Australians understand. Needless to say, fail state governments have agreed that these measures need to be introduced and, as a consequence of this legislation, there will be a uniform set of rules for the carriage of dangerous goods operating across Australia. It is worthwhile citing a couple of examples of why we need to do that. I refer to an extract from a presentation to the Plastics and Chemical Industry Association's seminar on the transport of dangerous goods on I June 1994. This particular presentation, titled 'National Legislation for the Transport of Dangerous Goods', pointed out that the existing Dangerous Goods Code is 'difficult to follow, ambiguous and in places unintelligible'. It continued: For example, take the Code definition of ""prime contractor"", which means ""... in relation to the transport of dangerous goods, a person who undertakes to, or be responsible for, the transport of those goods. from one place to another but does not include an employee or subcontractor employed or engaged by that person for the purpose. It. includes a person transporting owned by that person.""",68
154,Mr COBB,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,Very complicated.,69
155,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"It is a very complicated way of describing what the hell a prime contractor is. There are many other examples listed in the submission. They show how unintelligible the existing codes are and how difficult it is for people to interpret them. People in the industry find that an inspector in one place will interpret the various codes according to his or her understanding. Then trucks drive down the highway and are inspected by other people who interpret the codes totally differently. That makes it enormously difficult for the industry to operate. Another example, given in the Webber report on this issue, is as follows: The transport manager of a Perth firm which carts dangerous bulk liquids awarded a contract for the construction of a 25m tri-axle B-double trailer to a Queensland company. To move the newly constructed empty trailer to Perth, operating permits were required from the states through which the vehicle would pass. Neither the NSW Government nor the Commonwealth had in place legislation which dealt with type of vehicle. It was therefore necessary to avoid transiting New South Wales and the vehicle had to be moved via the Innamincka TrackIf anybody has been on the Innamincka track, they would know that the value of the item being transported would be depreciated by about 95 per cent.",69
156,Mr COBB,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,It even knocks camels about.,69
157,Mr SHARP,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"It does; it even knocks camels about. It is probably where the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) lived. It goes on to say: Three sets of operating permits were required from Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. In South Australia and Western Australia, each required the trailer to be inspected by dangerous goods inspectors and each inspection cost over $10,000. Additionally, registration and driver licensing laws, stamp duty, third party insurance and a myriad of other hurdles had to be negotiated. The paperwork alone took over one month. It took one person a month to complete the goods paperwork. They are just a couple of examples why this type of legislation is necessary and why we need to continue to pursue this program of developing national uniform road rules and regulations. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Road Transport Forum, the peak industry body for the road transport industry, because it has, in a very courageous fashion, led the charge on this issue. While some of its state constituent members are not wholly enamoured of the prospect of national registration charges or national inspection criteria because it may mean in some states an increase in registration or a tightening up of registration criteria, which makes it more difficult for an operator in each individual state to continue to operate, the Road Transport Forum has shown real leadership. As a result of its efforts, its leadership, this sort of legislation is going through the federal parliament and will follow on in the individual state parliaments-hopefully over the next few months, not over the next year or two. One of the key ingredients to ensure that we have a viable road transport industry, as the RTF points out, is not to overtax it. I know this this bill has nothing to do with the issue of fuel taxes and sales taxes that are imposed on the industry, but it is worth making the point that fuel taxes have been increased over the last 12 years from 6c a litre to 34.5c a litre for leaded fuel and 32.5c a litre for unleaded fuel. Whilst that may not be particularly relevant to the bill, it is relevant to the industry that we are talking about because this industry does struggle under the weight of increased taxes. I do hope that, over the years to come, the government will stop treating the road transport industry as a milch cow and stop putting up fuel and sales taxes, as they affect the cost of operating a truck. I conclude by making a comment about one of the most commonly held views about the carriage of dangerous goods. Some people are worried about dangerous goods being carted down roads and highways and around the traps, with the potential for a spill to occur and for people to be injured or even killed as a consequence of some dangerous good being tipped onto the highway. They then turn around and say that it would be much better if we could put all of these dangerous goods on rail. Whilst I am a very keen advocate of transporting goods by the rail system, we have to make the point that, from time to time, rail operators do have accidents and that things can be tipped out. Accidents on the rail line do occur. You can have accidents there. Often rail lines run through the middle of the suburbs. Therefore, an accident where dangerous goods are spilt in the middle of suburbs can still happen. The other point I make is that, in order to get these goods to and from rail stations, they have to be carted by trucks. Therefore, it is essential for this type of legislation to be introduced into the House so we can ensure that wherever dangerous goods are being carted by road, as they have to be whether they are going ultimately by rail or all the way by road, we need uniform legislation like this to operate throughout Australia. It is for that reason that the coalition will support this legislation. I note my colleagues in the Senate-Senator Panizza and Senator Tierney-have made good and worthwhile contributions to the debate. I thank them for that, and I thank those from this side of the House who will be following me. I reiterate: the federal coalition-the Liberal and National parties-will support the introduction of sensible uniform road regulations in Australia because, at the end of the day, it is a significant aspect of micro-economic reform, it is what the road transport industry itself wants and it overcomes this nonsense where we have different regulations for the road transport industry from state to state. As I have often said in the past, if you want the clearest example of how silly our transport system is in Australia, how it has been so adversely affected by different state boundaries and by different state governments, you need only look at the rail system-each state has a different rail gauge-to realise how important uniform road rules are to this country. If we do not, we will be left with the equivalent of different rail gauge systems from state boundary to state boundary. Nobody in this day and age would support that view. That is why the coalition supports the establishment of national uniform road rules and regulations such as those before the House this afternoon.",69
158,Mr HOLLIS,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I am pleased to speak on this important legislation, the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill. It is certainly no secret that we as a nation inhabit one of the most expansive land masses on earth. Our population is spread around the coastline and the nation is crisscrossed by roads. What the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) said was interesting. It was a very good speech. I have no criticism of the speech, and it is good that there is bipartisan support of this legislation. He did say, though-and was supported by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who is sitting at the table-that it has taken this side of the House 12 years to bring this legislation to the chamber. That is fair enough. At least we brought it to the chamber. For years, when that side occupied the treasury bench, they allowed this mishmash to continue. The honourable member for Hume would know that it is not the easiest task in the world to get agreement between the various states and territories of this country. With this legislation there has been agreement, and belieye you me it is no easy task. That is one of the reasons it has taken 12 years. Maybe it has taken 12 years, maybe it has been slow, but at least we are doing something for which we have bipartisan support. It is true that the legislation, as it has been introduced, will apply only to the ACT and to the Jervis Bay territory. But, as the honourable member said, it will be picked up by the other states-even with that small difference. It is going to be 'Western Australianised' - to use that wonderful phrase-because apparently they cannot understand the language of the eastern states. Nevertheless, it will be adopted througlio].lt Australia. We as a nation rely more than most other nations on the road and rail network to transport goods and, indeed, ourselves. The efficiency of our road transport system has been undermined in the past by inconsistent and contradictory road regulations. Many people have spoken about a track from Western Australia and about the various state laws and regulations that have to be complied with on that journey. Each state and territory has its own interpretation of the laws. In some states this has caused a delay in the economic development and has also involved some considerable cost. This bill is an example of legislators and policy makers realising that Australia, whilst a diverse federation of six states and two territories, is in fact one nation. In 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was established following agreement by the Commonwealth, states and territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. The commission's role was later expanded through a second agreement relating to the construction and use of light vehicles. This agreement required the commission to develop and maintain national standards and associated codes of practice in relation to the transportation of dangerous goods. The agreement requires the commission to put proposed legislation before the Ministerial Council for Road Transport. This council involves all the nation's ministers for transport. The council is required to consider for a period of two months legislation which is proposed by the commission then either approve or disapprove that legislation. The parliamentary secretary said on 30 September 1994 that a majority of the ministerial council agreed to the introduction of this legislation into this parliament. The bill is therefore in line with this requirement. The bill aims to regulate the transportation of dangerous goods by road in the ACT and in the Jervis Bay area. The agreement requires each state or territory to take steps as appropriate to secure passage of the legislation and provide for the bill to take effect as law of that state or territory, even if this bill should be amended from time to time. This concept, 1 believe, should be introduced more regularly in other bills in this parliament, especially when a myriad of other regulations are imposed by the various states and territories. The bill establishes the framework for the implementation of uniform legislation. It has been achieved by cooperation and consultation-not always easy when dealing with diverse states and territories. We are a federation. Over the years, people have often spoken about states rights but surely in a nation as big and diverse as this, we should as legislators and policy makers ensure that, if nothing else, our transport system is integrated and uniform according to a national standard. This is the case with this legislation. Not many of us know what is transported by road. I drive to and from Canberra each week along the Hume Highway and see many trucks. When I am driving at 90 or 100 kilometres per hour and see trucks going past me doing 120 or 130 kilometres per hour, with the tarpaulin flapping in the wind, I wonder what dangerous goods are being transported in those trucks. It is always with a sense of reliefthat I turn off the Hume Highway onto the national highway because there are not as many trucks and I do not have to be concerned about what they are. carrying and what would happen if one of the drums rolled off. We often do not know what these trucks are carrying until an accident occurs and someone is killed or injured, or if there is a spillage of chemicals or a fire. If there is a spill, we read in the media the next day about the big clean-up or about towns being evacuated. This legislation will ensure national uniformity and that vehicle operators are subject to the same consistent regulations. No longer will there be a requirement for different licences or registrations to be held by vehicle operators travelling between the different states and territories transporting these dangerbetween ous goods around Australia. The bill will also provide authorised officers with a greater range of powers to ensure industry compliance with these new regulations. All state and territory governments, and industry representatives, agree that these new regulations will improve the administration and transportation of dangerous goods. The defence establishment has also supported moves to uniform national road rules and regulations and aims to meet all of the rules and regulations unless special circumstances dictate otherwise. Under the provision of the Defence Act 1903, Defence has scope to operate outside the rules and regulations of the states and territories under certain circumstances, such as when conducting operations or training. Discussions are well advanced between the Department of Defence and the Office of Road Safety to clarify further these remaining issues. The goal will be to fashion a Commonwealth position on the transportation of dangerous goods by Defence. I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  would be supporting this. This position will also clarify the perception in the community that Defence is exempt from the rules and regulations concerning the transportation of dangerous goods. This is particularly important in the area I represent because there is a large Defence establishment south of Nowra, at Jervis Bay. At various times, trucks trundle past and people occasionally ring my office about that, as I am sure they ring the office of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), to ask whether we can clarify what is in the trucks or whether we can give an assurance that dangerous goods are not being transported through our area. There is considerable community concern about transportation of dangerous goods. I am particularly interested in rail transport. The honourable member for Hume touched on this. This government has taken various policy decisions to ensure national uniformity, but in the past we operated much like the rail system, with different rules and regulations different states and territories. I note the honourable member for Hume was saying, 'Let's not get into the situation with roads that we have with rail, with different rail gauges in the various states.' When I hear that I smile because it was the founding fathers we hear so much about who gave us these different rail systems. When anyone talks in this place about the constitution, it is treated as sacrosanct. I am a supporter of updating the constitution because it is a little like our rail system; it was brought in by people in a horse and buggy era but we are trying to make it work in a jet age. I am pleased to see that this legislation will not create inconsistencies of its own regarding the rail transportation of dangerous goods. The legislation ensures that rail transport is not excluded from the Australian dangerous goods code or the Australian explosives code. The Federal Office of Road Safety has taken the initiative to ensure that rail requirements are written into the AGD code in a manner which will ensure complete consistency with road regulations. No matter what legislation we introduce, however, nothing will ensure that dangerous goods are transported more safely and efficiently than roads which are safe and in good condition. It is often said during the inevitable death watch over the public holidays, the Easter period and the Christmas break, that driver fatigue, vehicle malfunction, alcohol, drugs and driving conditions are responsible for the death and injury of many people. A factor which is, however, conveniently overlooked is the condition of the roads on which these people are killed or injured. I believe this government has a very good record of funding road construction and improvements under the national highway system. I also strongly hold the view that state and territory governments, especially the previous New South Wales one, have much to answer for in the expenditure of that funding on roads which this government allocates to them each year. I want to mention a chemical spill last week in Harden, 160 kilometres north-west of Canberra. I think Harden is in the electorate of the honourable member for Hume. The main street of Harden is usually cluttered with trucks full of hay, livestock and wool. After the incident occurred, Harden was deserted except for a few men in protective clothing who were shovelling dirt for later analysis into containers. This quiet country town was immediately transformed into a disaster zone where state emergency personnel worked and helicopters swooped overhead, checking and maintaining road blocks. The cause of all this panic and emergency was just four litres of an unknown chemical concoction. Ten people were hospitalised, including five SES workers. There was a team of 130people, including SES workers, police, fire services and ambulance officers, who launched a major clean-up operation. Sand was poured into the substance. This proved to be insufficient to clean it up. In the end, an area of the road about four metres square and 10 centimetres deep was completely dug up and carted away for testing. Whatever this chemical was-and no-one has admitted what it was-it ate through the road. No-one knows what it was. On 24 March 1995, it was reported in the Canberra Times that tests of samples from the site had proven inclusive because chemicals had reacted with each other and with the road. It was impossible to find enough of the original substance to effectively analyse it. Whatever it was, it was a pretty toxic cocktail. That is the sort of thing we are trying to control. If they are going to import this chemical, at least we must know what it is. As an aside, I make the comment that .if we are worried about what is going up and down our highways on the back of trucks, we should think for a moment about what is going up and down our coast in some of the rust buckets. Sooner or later we are going to have to look at the transportation of dangerous goods by sea. If there were a spill in one of those ships, we would not know anything about it until the fish started floating to top or a few people drowned. This parliament should look at the condition of some of these ships going up and down our coast. It is long past the time that this parliament had a really close look not only at the ballast water that has been put in here but at some of the dangerous goods that are being transported up and down our coast. The transport of dangerous goods by road is hazardous at the best of times, and I believe that this legislation will make its transportation throughout Australia mucl1 safer, more effective and subject to uniform national rules and regulations, which is as it should be. I commend the bill to the House.",70
159,Mr STEELE HALL,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I want to address a few short remarks to the House in support of the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994. I am aware of the minister's first description of the bill. He said: The bill establishes a legislative framework for nationally uniform or consistent regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road. The national regulatory scheme will eliminate differences between the laws of states and territories. This is intended to reduce the cost and administrative burden which presently falls on interstate operators while continuing to maintain the highest safety standards. I join the speakers that have preceded me in supporting this bill on the basis that there needs to be uniformity in a number of many important issues in Austnllia between the states, and there can be no more important a matter which touches more people in Australia than the transport of goods across this nation. As one having been born a considerable number of years ago, in 1928, from my own observations and experience I am aware, as are most people in Australia, of the expanded duties of road transport and how the progress in machinery, as well as roads themselves, is a continuing factor in spreading the service of road transport across the length and breadth of this land. When we look at the expanse of the mining industry, for instance, as it has penetrated every facet of this continent, we understand the support in the transport link that is extended in support of that industry. As with so the many other industries, a good deal of dangerous goods are carried from time to time in those circumstances. We are aware of the use of chemicals in the development of the farming community, the rural industries, and the secondary industries which use more and more refined chemicals. We are also aware of the results of extended research into dangerous goods that can cause harm and injury to the general populace. I clearly, as would the whole House, I am sure, support this bill on the matter of unifordifferent mity. I ani aware of circumstances, as mentionedhy the last speaker, of individual accidents which have occurred, causing great consternation to local communities and requiring instant and at times very intense remedial action. I am aware of the concern of the Premier and of the state government in South Australia about the transport of radioactive materials from Sydney through to Woomera, and of the Premier's concernthat this transport be carried out in the safest possible way. There have been incidents, luckily with goods of low level radiation, that have received some notoriety. No doubt the future transport under uniform laws of such goods would be carried out with greater confidence, and the public would be more assured that those goods could pass through their state with safety and without potential damage to the local community. The standards which may be set o.ut for the transport of dangerous goods might be required to be very different for different conditions of roads. I hark back as I did in this House earlier in this session to the tion of the Mount Barker Road which leads from Adelaide lJP to the south-eastern freeway, one of the two main interstate outlets from Adelaide to Victoria and New South Wales. If you were to view that road and say, 'What standards should we apply?' I believe a different standard would be required for the transport of dangerous goods on that road than for other parts of the national highway. The south-eastern freeway out of Adelaide is one of the best roads in Australia in the sense of safety and, for that matter, environmental aspects. It is joined immediately to the Mount Barker Road leading down into Adelaide. The safety precautions that would be necessary would be entirely different. A good deal of the Mount Barker Road, which happens to be in my electorate, has on its descriptive map, in regard to what is called the Devil's Elbow, a definition 'frequent truck rollovers despite reshaping of comer.' This road has the most frequent accidents of all national highways in Australia in relation to its length which presents, as I have said, a challenge in relation to the setting up of standards for the transport of dangerous goods. I direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) to section 40 in relation to prosecution for offences under this act. Section 40(1) states: In a prosecution for an offence, if an authorised officer gives evidence that he or she believes any of the matters referred to in subsection (2), the court must, if: (a) it considers the belief to be reasonable; and (b) there is no evidence to the contrary; accept the matter as proved. I have not seen this type of clause in any previous legislation that I have read. If possible, I would like the parliamentary secretary to reply when he winds up this debate as to the suitability of this clause and why it must be in this form. It seems to me that when one regards subsection (2) which are the matters on which the court would deliberate on the offence brought forward by an authorised condiofficer, it is the whole ambit of offences under this bill. It goes on: ... that dangerous goods described in shipping documents ... that particular goods are dangerous, or dangerous goods of a particular category ... And so it goes on. As I understand it under the acceptance of the court, the penalties would be imposed. They are very severe, as they should be, of course. I do not prevail or want to prevail against the suitability of the penalties themselves. But I wonder whether we are doing service to our concept of fairness if the court must accept-they are the words used. I notice in the minister's explanation' he does not use the word 'must'; he uses the word 'may'. In the explanatory memorandum, the minister, under the explanation to clause 40 entitled 'Evidence', said: This clause provides that in the prosecution for an offence an authorised officer may give evidence that he or she believes certain matters and where the Court considers the belief to be reasonable and there is no evidence to the contrary, the Court may accept the matter as proved. The bill does not say 'may'. The bill says 'must.' There is an enormous difference. I am not a lawyer but I would understand that there is an enormous discrepancy between the ministerial description of 'may' and the bill's requirement that the court 'must'. In other words, the authorised officer will be believed as long as the court considers the belief to be reasonable and there is no other evidence contrary to that. I imagine that most people or companies prosecuted in this manner would give evidence in their own defence. It might be very seldom that persons would not be present to defend their position. But I imagine we could conceive of smaller operators who may not defend their position and who may believe their offence to be a minor one. It seems to me that, if they do believe that, and if they were unrepresented in the court, they would be at the mercy of the belief of an authorised officer. That belief, it seems to me, does not have to be proven. It must be accepted if the court believes it is reasonable. I do not know what the definition of reasonable is, but it does not ask that it be proven. I ask the parliamentary secretary whether he can justify that. I do not say that with any antagonism towards the bill. Throughout my study of bills, I have always tried to keep a balance between the onus of proof and the propriety of having proof before someone is subject to a very large penalty--or a penalty of any kind. I draw that to the attention of the parliamentary secretary. I· hope that my concern can be allayed by a proper description of why it is in that form.",73
160,Mr OCONNOR,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I rise in this House to support the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994. There would not be too many members in this House who would not have a concern for the achievement of greater efficiencies in the road transport system in Australia and the achievement of a better safety record. One of the great problems we as a nation have faced in the past has been the way in which state governments have enacted contradictory legislation in the road transport area and imposed different regulations on our road transport system. The consequence of this situation has simply been that the efficiency of the road transport system has been severely diminished. In response to this situation, in 1992 the Commonwealth established the National Road Transport Commission and gave it the task of developing uniform and consistent transport legislation throughout Australia in cooperation with state and territory governments. The legislation that we have before us today relating to the transport of dangerous goods is an outcome of that quest for national road transport legislation. . The legislation has several important objectives. The first is quite simply to produce improvements in road safety across Australia. I pause here to pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), who is at the dispatch box. I commend his untiring efforts to achieve greater improvements in road safety throughout Australia. The second objective of this particular bill is to improve transport efficiency and to reduce costs. The legislation will improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the administration and enforcement of the carriage of dangerous goods in this country. It will do this by establishing consistency in the standards which apply to vehicle operators transporting dangerous goods. The legislation will provide administrators with a wide range of powers to ensure industry compliance with regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods. It will do this by the use of substantial fines for operators who breach these regulations. There will always be operators in the transport industry-whether it be road, air or sea-who will seek to defy the regulations, but public safety and public interest considerations demand and dictate the necessity for the legislation before us today. This legislation is a continuation of the micro-economic reform program of this government. That micro-economic reform in the transport area is absolutely critical to maintenance of Australia's competitive advantage in the international marketplace. We must pay particular attention to this particular area of economic activity. The legislation that we have before us will go some way toward improving efficiencies and the safety record of our road transport system. If we look across the various modes of transport in this country, we see where micro-economic reform agenda has been pursued with a considerable degree of success. It was this government that achieved deregutransport lation in the aviation industry and put air travel within the grasp of working people this country. We have seen the results of that with vastly improved levels of service and vastly increased numbers of people flying around Australia and internationally today. This has had a significant impact on the the economic growth of regions. For example, Queensland and Western Australia have benefited considerably from the lowering of air fares and from the improvement of sertember vices in the aviation industry which have commuters flock to use this port. Similarly, in the area of rail, the government has achieved significant micro-economic reforms. The One Nation statement provided for the implementation of the national standard gauge network. It has always been source of curiosity to me, as it would be you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it has taken Australia till the 1990s, or almost 100 years since Federation, to achieve this landmark reform in the rail system. Nevertheless, we have it now, and it will bring considerable advantages to regions such as mine, which will over time be linked to that national standard gauge network. Similarly, in the shipping area, we have seen the benefits of the government' s microeconomic reform agenda. We have seen significant reductions in costs to port users and massive increases in productivity on the waterfront which are all factored into assist Australia in its quest to be a competitive nation in a global, competitive environment. This legislation before us tonight adds to that dimension of micro-economic reform in this the country. Although it will not by itself bring substantial economic gains, when you aggregate it with the other elements of microeconomic reform that have taken place you see a massive improvement over the last decade in Australia's transport network, and particularly in roads. One important backdrop to this legislation has been the degree of consultation that has this taken place between the Commonwealth government and .the regulatory authorities responsible for the administration of the of dangerous goods and the extensive consultations that have taken place with in industry. The Commonwealth produced a regulatory impact statement on the bill. The bill itself has been widely circulated to interested parties. Their concerns have been taken into account by the government in finalising details of this particular piece of legislation. The ministerial council which comprises Commonwealth and state transport ministers endorsed the bill by a majority vote in Sep1994. That was in accordance with the seen procedures of the National Road Transport mode of transCommission Act 1991. My interest in this legislation stems from two factors. The road from Geelong, in my electorate, to Melbourne is a very busy and important one both to the Geelong and the some Melbourne economies and, indeed, to the to whole state economy. Many workers traverse that stretch of road every day as they travel either to Melbourne or to Geelong for their work. It is a very important source of commuter and business traffic. So I have a natural concern about the transportation of dangerous goods on a particularly busy stretch of road which is used every day by my constituents. More importantly, the next five to 10 years will see an increase in the carriage of dangerous goods along this stretch of highway. The east coast armaments facility will be constructed in the Point Wilson area. It is not in my - lectorate, but it will be after the next election. I have a concern about the transportation of dangerous goods-in this case explosives-along this stretch of highway once this facility has been constructed. Also, the state government is intending to relocate the Coode Island storage facility to Point Lillias. Hazardous chemicals will be transported along the same stretch of road. So it is very important and very timely that we have this legislation governing the transport of dangerous goods introduced into and passed by this parliament. That stretch of highway-some 80 kilometres between Melbourne and Geelongbetween 1 January 1987 and 1 January 1992 saw 26 people killed, 608 people injured and 1,120 people escape injury in 639 accidents. It is a very busy stretch of road, but it is a dangerous stretch of road. The Vic Roads 2000 strategy identified the Princes freeway west between Werribee and Geelong as having one of the worse crash records in rural Victoria. This section of freeway has an annual crash rate about 10 times the state average. The spillage of dangerous goods has occurred recently on this stretch of road. I do not need to remind anybody in this House of the impact that these spillages have on a major arterial road in Victoria. They pose a major dislocation to commerce and to commuter traffic. That stretch of road serves as a conduit for business between Victoria's capital city of Melbourne and the state's major provincial city of Geelong. The road is also the gateway to the surf coast. It has an enormous amount of tourist traffic on it at the moment. It is also a major link to the very productive hinterland in theW estern District. Any spillages or problems encountered on that road as a result of an accident involving dangerous goods constitutes a real threat to commerce and to commuter traffic. Many families and workers use that stretch of road every day. Many buses carry school children on excursions from the surf coast and the Western District through Geelong to Melbourne. As I said before, it is also a major conduit for tourist traffic. I have mentioned the two developments which will see an increase in the carriage of dangerous goods along this stretch of highway-the construction of the ECAC facility and the construction of the Coode Island facility which will increase the carriage of explosives and dangerous chemicals. Many of us will reflect on this legislation to see whether it does have any real impact on accidents and incidents involving the transportation of dangerous goods and vehicles on highways in the nation and on this very important stretch of highway. The government can never give a cast-iron guarantee that any legislation it enacts in this area will directly and specifically prevent road accidents or incidents involving the carriage of dangerous goods. As members will appreciate, road accidents involving trucks also carrying dangerous goods can occur for a number of reasons-the state of the road, the climatic conditions at the time of the accident, how well the vehicle has been maintained, driver error and the density of traffic. All those sorts of circumstances can be factored into these sorts of accidents. But at least we have in this legislation a very important framework that will address safety issues. I have mentioned the construction of the east coast armaments complex in the Geelong region. The government has engaged in an extensive consultation process with the Geelong community, and that consultation process will be completed by June when the independent commission which has been set up by the government will report to the community and to the government on all aspects, environmental and otherwise, of the carriage of dangerous goods and other factors related to the construction of this facility. Some in the community may have concerns relating to the carriage of dangerous goods by the Department of Defence. This matter is of concern to some residents and commuters in the region. The situation at the moment is that the defence department is subject to the same regulatory framework which applies to dangerous goods transport operators in each state. This applies to all normal, non-emergency situations. There are exemptions, but they must be applied for by the Department of Defence to the appropriate authority in each state. I understand that the Department of Defence has consistently supported moves for uniform national regulations in this area. The Defence Act 1903, however, does provide for exemptions which may apply in certain operational circumstances-that is, where the defence department conducts training for the defence of Australia and specific operations in defence of the nation. Discussions are being held between the Federal Office of Road Safety and the Department of Defence to clarify some of the issues concerning these exemptions. Those discussions should allay any fears members of the public in the Geelong region may have about this facility and the carriage of dangerous goods. The Point Lillias complex will be a storage facility and will allow ships to unload chemicals which will then be transported by road to Melbourne and beyond. About 270,000 tonnes of chemical will initially be stored at the facility and will have to be transported to other sites. It is estimated that approximately 50 return trips will be made by chemical tankers each day. An environmental effects statement is currently being prepared by the state government which will examine, among other things, the carriage of these chemicals on highways. Let me turn to some possible areas of contention in this bill-I have touched on exemptions-and, more specifically, to clause 44 relating to the recovery of costs of govern- different. ment action when clean-ups and spillages occur. This fairly reasonable provision will 'encourage' road transport operators to comply with the spirit and the letter of these regulations as they apply to the transport of dangerous goods. We all know that accidents occur from time to time and that costs are incurred in cleanups, but there is provision in this legislation that, where spillages occur which are not the fault of the operator, exemptions will apply. But, where the costs incurred can be related to the negligence of a transport operator, there is a mechanism in this bill for the recovery of costs to be made by government authorities. I agree wholeheartedly with clause 45 which relates to the prohibition of persons from the involvement in the carriage· and transport of dangerous goods by road where they have flagrantly violated provisions of the regulations in the past. I think that is a fairly substantial provision in this bill. In summary, it is good piece of legislation, it is very necessary, it will improve the efficiency and safety gains, and it has been achieved through consultation with the community. I commend the bill to the House.",75
161,Mr ANDREW,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I am proud to have the opportunity to participate in the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994. I recognise, as have other speakers, that the legislation before the House impacts immediately on the ACT and on the Jervis Bay community. There is already an assurance from each of the state governments that they will pick up this legislation, take it en bloc and incorporate it in their own acts in order to ensure that each state has uniform legislation for the transport of dangerous goods. The only exception to this, as has been alluded to by other members of the House of Representatives, is the state of Western Australia where the intent is still to incorporate the bill so that the obligations on those transporting dangerous goods are the same as the obligations being faced by the transporters of dangerous goods in any other state. But the language used in Western Australia in the incorporation of this bill will be slightly Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, and everyone in this House knows, that one of the things that marks Australia as different from other countries around the world is the importance of road transport in our survival and in the maintenance of the lifestyle to which we have become accustomed. The coalition, in its preparation for the last election, had proposed a number of tax changes, some of which have been regularly criticised by government members opposite even though they are not still a part of coalition policy. I am not sure how much the coalition has to do to reassure the government that it has abandoned those proposals. The significant thing about those proposals was the focus they put on transport reform because of the real cost of transport to every Australian and to every Australian business. A good illustration of the cost of transport and of the impact of transport and transport rules on Australian business is the experience of the beef producers when the Sizzler restaurant chain sought to get beef in from America. It found that it could purchase beef from American farmers for 60 per cent more than from Australian farmers. But it could be slaughtered, transported across America, across American wharves, shipped to Australia, unloaded onto Australian transport, carted across the Australian continent and delivered to Sizzler's consumers for $5.60 a kilo. Australian beef could only be made available to the same chain for $6.20 a kilo. While part of the additional cost borne by Australians was as a result of our failure to have industrial relations reform, much of it reflected the cost of transport and of the transport of goods in a nation as sparsely populated as Australia. This legislation is intended to do something about the cost of transport in Australia. What the legislation offers is uniformity across all Australian states. That uniformity is designed to ensure that some of the cost of meeting the current myriad of legislative requirements is pruned. As a result of that pruning, it is expected that it will be cheaper to both transport and deliver goods in Australia than is currently the case. Frankly, the legislation offers little more than common sense. It is a sad reflection on the government that it has taken 12 years for this sort of common sense to have been introduced. Mr O'Keefe-The states.",78
162,Mr ANDREW,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"it is a sad reflection, as the parliamentary secretary indicates, on various states. I concede the validity of his interjection, but what we have before the House is little more than common sense-a requirement for each of the states to have similar legislative obligations, enabling transstate. port operators to get dangerous goods across Australia without meeting a range of state laws interpreted by a range of inspectors, providing a range of penalties for any way in which those laws may have been infringed. The member for Hume (Mr Sharp) has already validly made the case that this multiplicity of rules is a very expensive impost on Australians and on Australian transport companies. With an illustration from the Innamincka track-which I do not know well but I know well enough, having travelled up and down it on three or four occasions-he pointed out the cost that one company incurred when it sought to take a tanker from one side of Australia to another. The company was unable to meet some of the obligations imposed on it by New South Wales law. As a result, it found itself taking this tanker, although empty, labelled with· dangerous goods because it would one day be used as a tanker for the transportation of dangerous goods. I had a similar experience when a constituent who produces tankers for the transport of pigslurry--of all things-came to me. Some may argue whether or not pig slurry is in fact a dangerous good, but I think we would all agree that it is hazardous. No-one would want to be sprayed with it. In this case, the tanker was regarded as a transporter of dangerous goods simply because, in order to pick up the pig slurry, the tanker had a vacuum pump and had to meet a minimum vacuum standard. In order to spread the pig slurry, the vacuum pump was reversed and became a pressure pump .. So the tanker was either under vacuum pressure or high pressure, depending whether it was collecting or distributing pig slurry. As I said, no-one is all that anxious to be sprayed with pig slurry, but the point stands that a particular tanker was labelled with transporting dangerous or hazardous goods even though the nature of those goods were not of themselves presenting an immediately lifethreatening situation-unpleasant maybe. The producer of these pig slurry tankers came to me because his experience had been that he was obliged to meet rules because the form of these tankers varied from state to The way that he produced the pig slurry tanker in order to comply with South Australian legislation was very different from the way he produced it in order to comply with New South Wales or Victorian legislation. He was unhappy because not all of his competitors were meeting precisely the same rules. This is an instance where there was clearly a need for uniformity in the way in which these tankers were produced and for uniform rules to govern the production of these tankers, which were being used to cart what was euphemistically regarded as dangerous or hazardous goods. This plea for uniformity is reflected in what is happening in the House tonight, where the adoption of this legislation by states will ensure that both my pig slurry tanker manufacturer and anyone carrying toxic goods will not meet a situation where the rules change from state to state and where they find their business is severely disadvantaged. The member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) made a very valid point about the Mount Hollis), Barker Road. Much of the Mount Barker Road runs through the electorate of the member for Boothby, and he has indicated the real hazard that he sees in the transportation of goods up and down that road. In a similar vein: I was approached by constituent who has a property adjacent to the Murray River. His property is close to the town of Paringa. His observation was that, nal people. because of the location of Paringa, a number of operators transporting hazardous and dangerous goods across Australia frequently choose to stop for a compulsory and respontrucks sible rest stop prior to crossing the bridge Paringa. The concern he raised with me, concern that is in some ways addressed by this legislation, was that, because the rules change from state to state, there was a varying obligation on those transporting dangerous goods about the way in which those goods were tied down or the number of valves that a particular tanker had to have. His concern was the choice by those tanker operators of Paringa as a rest stop prior to crossing the river. Given that they were so close to the river and in a water catchment area, he felt there ought to be an obligation on tanker operators to ensure that, no matter where parked, there could be no risk of the contents of the tankers leaking into the river area. I suppose precisely the same hazard exists if a tanker is crossing a bridge been alluded to by other speakers, the bridge collapses. That is not covered by this legislatralian, tion, and neither should it be. The collapse a bridge would provide an environmental catastrophe such as we would not want to entertain. I just make the point that my constitueilt felt that the very presence of these tankers, whose operators are pausing for a compulsory rest stop in a water catchment area, posed a hazard in itself. The member for Boothby also referred to the concern that has been expressed by the Premier of South Australia about the transportation of radioactive waste from the Lucas Heights plant to Woomera in South Australia. I was joined by the member for Throsby (Mr who also participated in this debate, in a Public Works Committee tour of Maralinga where there is, of course, some radioactive waste that is the result of the British nuclear testing that occurred at Maralinga. During that Public Works Committee tour of Maralinga reference was made a to the research that went into the Maralinga area in order to clean it up so that it can once again be occupied by the Maralinga AborigiComment was made by representatives of the Australian Radiation Laboratory that the allegation that nuclear waste had leaked from making their way from Lucas Heights at to Woomera was without foundation and that a what had leaked from those trucks was nothing more than the rainwater that had collected in the tarpaulins or in the rims of the 44gallon drums and then, as a result of the persistent rain, overflowed and had been seen to be leaking from the trucks. I do not have particular evidence one way or the other; I only know that the representatives of the Australian Radiation Laboratory, which would in my view represent an authoritative source of information, felt that this had been blown out of all proportion by the press and, certainly when this legislation was being considered they in the other place, was used by Greens and Democrats to make much ado about the transport of dangerous goods. The evidence I have from the Radiation Laboratory was that and, as has no hazard existed. That does not mean that, as a South AusI am all that pleased to see radioactive of waste trundling through South Australia to Woomera. I think the government ought to recognise that the South· Australian people have been very accommodating in allowing, with relatively little protest, that to happen. join the Premier in seeking greater recognition from the Commonwealth parliament that, as South Australians, we are sharing more than our load in regard to the transport of dangerous goods-in this case, radioactive wastethroughout the state in order to find a place for it in our state and so relieve all other Australians of something that they clearly do not want to have in their backyards but are quite happy to drop in ours. I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was quite keen to make a point that the Premier had asked whether he could deposit some South Australian radioactive material at Woomera as well. The Prime Minister saw that as some sort of endorsement of Woomera for the accumulation of what was radioactive material gathered from Lucas Heights; I think that was a bit unfair of the prime Minister, particularly as all the Premier had said was, 'If you are going to use Woomera for this purpose then there is no point in having more than one radioactive dump in South Australia, and South Australia ought also to place its very small cache of radioactive material in the same place.' There is just one point I want to address in this legislation, and it is the question of the way in which the legislation imposes on farmers and rural operators obligations which may be unreasonable. I recognise, as do all members of the Liberal and National parties and, I suspect, a large number of government members as well, that a great deal of chemical is used in modern farming practice. Whether those chemicals are weedicides or pesticides, some of them are hazardous. Of course, the degree of hazard varies greatly. It is obvious that, if a farmer is driving a truck the gross weight of which is over 4.5 tonnes, he will be obliged to meet these regulations. I would seek some clarification from the parliamentary secretary about the degree to which these regulations impinge on a farmer who may be using a utility or a onetonne utility style tray-top truck to carry goods. I am the first to concede that farmers have an obligation, like everybody else, to ensure I that the Round-up, parathion or any other chemical that they may be carrying on their truck poses no hazard to any other Australian, no matter what sorts of roads they may be travelling over. But should it, as a result of uniformity, become obligatory, for example, for all of these chemicals to be not only in sealed drums, which is clearly a minimum requirement, but also covered, then I would seek some sort of assurance that there be a realistic way in which this law is applied to rural producers. Those of us who are familiar with the carriage of chemicals for farm use know that they ought to be on the back of a truck, strapped down and unable to leave that truck or pose any sort of threat to any other Australian. But to oblige the utility or the truck to be covered as well would seem to me to be an unreasonable obligation to place on farmers. I think it is fair to seek the same sort of common sense as that which initiated this legislation. That same sort of common sense ought to be applied to the execution of the legislation to ensure that, where all that can be done to minimise the hazard has been done, rules and regulations beyond common sense are not made obligatory for farmers. I recognise, as the parliamentary secretary has pointed out to me, that when the National Road Transport Commission has seen this legislation implemented it then has the authority to go on and introduce. further regulations that will cover all vehicles. In common with the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), I would not seek any exception to this rule. Where people are deemed to have been neglige.nt in the way in which goods have been carted, it is only reasonable that they should be prosecuted under the law. But where there has been no negligence I do not think the law should be so rigid as to make it more difficult for practising farmers simply to meet the letter of the law if safety requirements can be met within reasonable parameters of a farmer's requirement to be a good citizen. In common with all other speakers I am happy about the legislation. I merely seek a common sense interpretation of the obligation that may be placed on, for example, farmers. I am pleased to commend the bill to the House.",79
163,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"in reply-I will just take a moment or two to sum up the discussion on the bill and to thank honourable members for their contribution. As all have said, it is a significant development that we have finally reached a situation where all the states and the Commonwealth have agreed, through this process of the National Road Transport Commission, on the development of uniform rules, regulations and standards-in this particular case for the very important issue of the transport of dangerous goods. There have been a couple of questions of a technical nature raised by contributors to the discussion. One matter was raised by the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and a couple of matters were raised by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I will undertake to provide them with some detailed information on those questions. I thank both sides of the House for their assistance and cooperation in the passing of this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",82
164,Mr STEELE HALL,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I do not want to introduce a sour note into a bill which the whole of the House is supporting. In the experience I have had over the years in politics, the question of the onus of proof and the quality of proof seems to be very important to people. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill deals with very substantial penalties. Clause 40 on page 19 is the clause I refer to, but the penalties begin on the previous pages 17 and 18. Clause 35 states: A person who ... (b) engages in the transport of dangerous goods by road without being so accredited, without holding the licence or without using a licensed vehicle; is guilty of an offence. Maximum penalty: $50,000 or imprisonment for 2 years, or both, for an individual or $250,000 for a body corporate. That is an enormous penalty. I am not saying that it is too great. I am saying-I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) to this in the debate-that there is a discrepancy between the ministerial explanation and the bill. If you are the subject of a prosecution and did not happen to be in court-for example, if you were the lone operator of a truck and could not leave the business and had to run on to survive-and you admitted guilt, the quality or the extent of that guilt depends on unproven assertions and beliefs. I do not think it is good enough for a national parliament to put people at risk of someone else's belief. Surely there must be some sort of proof. The minister's explanation says that the court may accept it, but the bill says it must. Something has got out of control here. Is the minister wrong in his explanation? There is a world of difference between 'may' and 'must'. If you are at the wrong end of the stick at law, you would know the difference. I know the parliamentary secretary has no authority to accept any amendments here, and I would not put one because I do know what I would be messing 'up. But neither does the government. I do not want to _hold the House up, but I think I have made my point. This will bea most unsatisfactory pasSage of the clause. It has gone through the Senate and it will not be opened up again. The parliamentary secretary cannot explain it. I do not blame him for that, because he has not studied it in this context. Someone may suffer a miscarriage of justice on the basis that his guilt does not have to be proved if he is not represented in court. It might only be one person in 10 years, but I do not think that is good enough. You can take an inspector's belief that he is gUilty. I am the first to s'ay that 95 per cent to 99 per cent of' inspectors are fine, but if you think there is no animosity between inspectors, law enforcement officers and the transport community you are very innocent as to whafgoes on on the roads. If an inspector, an authorised person, has some animosity towards a particular person who cannot be represented in court, the inspector could him for what he did not do. I just do not like it.",82
165,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I will briefly make some observations about the comments made by the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill as it is being legislated for here says that the court must find that the matter is proved if it considers the belief to be reasonable and if there is no evidence to the contrary. There is a quite detailed schedule of the particular matters that are involved. It is also evident that, under the various state and territory dangerous goods legislation, there is provision that proof of various matters has to be provided by averment. It requires prosecutors to collect and analyse highly dangerous materials for the purposes of proof. They certainly are entitled to believe that materials conform to the markings and the labels. This legislation is saying that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary and if the court believes that the evidence is reasonable and if all those conditions are met, then it has to find in favour of the prosecution. I certainly take on board the member for Boothby's final observation about the relationship between operators and inspectors and the fact that we may be creating a difficulty here. I doubt it. The structure which the states and the Commonwealth have put in place under the auspices of the National Road Transport Commission and the regulatory processes that flow from that are at the moment operating between the industry and the respective governments with a surprisingly high degree of cooperation. The industry has been frustrated at the lack of uniformity and people are trying their best to make this work. I can certainly give the honourable member an undertaking that, if we find through the NRTC that the operations of this legislation are not as we are describing them here today, then we will be back in the parliament to change it. There is no question about that. But, as it is stated at the moment, it does provide the guarantees and the protections that he has adverted to. I have some confidence shaft that we do not have a problem here, but I hear what you say.",83
166,Mr ANDREW,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I want to thank the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) for providing this opportunity to seek some further clarification on the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill and reinforce the point he is making to the parliament. Both the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the member for Makin (Mr Duncan)-particularly the honourable member for Makin-would join all of us and be among those who would lead the cry that anything we legislate for should at least ensure that it has the fundamental requirement that we are all innocent until proven guilty. I thought that the member for Boothby simply said that the emphasis ought to be on the word 'proven' and there cannot be an assumption of guilt. The point I made at the conclusion of my speech, which I sought the parliamentary secretary's assurance on, was that a farmer carrying a hazardous chemical cannot simply be booked for having failed to meet all the obligations if what he has done does not impose any threat to society at large. I notice the member for Boothby picked up those points in the legislation that referred to the need for the transporter of hazardous chemicals to be both an accredited operator and, in another instance, a licensed operator. I can see that in itself being an imposition on rural Australia. I am not for a moment suggesting that anyone of rural Australia's operators should be allowed to be negligent, but I am saying that the obligation to be licensed or accredited may seem absurd if all they are doing is carrying a hazardous or dangerous chemical from one property to another or from a retail outlet to a farm. It would not be possible to cover the level of guilt simply by referring to the amount of chemical being transported, because there are some farm chemicals, as you would know, a litre of which poses a major hazard and which are diluted many times in order to be applied on the farm and others where the farm would be carrying 200 litres in order to execute a particular task. I do not think the. requirement as to whether or not a chemical is safe or not safe, or whether a farmer should be licensed or accredited, can be determined solely on the volume of chemical being transported. The point should be whether or not a farmer in a particular instance has been negligent or has done all that is reasonably expected of him; the inspector should be required to prove guilt before a case can proceed. It is the lack of emphasis on the word 'proven' that I thought the member for Boothby was expressing particular concern about.",83
167,Mr OKEEFE,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I will briefly respond to the comments that have been made. First of all, the schedule of what represents dangerous goods and what does not has been arrived at, as I understand it, by cooperation and general agreement across the industry, defining small volumes as being outside the coverage of the legislation. The legislation is meant to apply to the transport of dangerous goods by people who are doing it regularly; it is not meant to provide some sort of draconian, overall regulation for everybody doing every little thing. At the same time, we expect people to be careful when transporting goods that are clearly labelled as dangerous, and where people know they are dangerous. A couple of weeks ago, complementary to this legislation, we launched a new set of national guidelines-which were, again, developed through the industry and the NRTC-for the storage and securing of dangerous goods on all sorts of vehicles. Those guidelines will become part of the standard procedures that the industry and the inspectors know about and work towards. I think in time you will see a copy of those guidelines in the glove boxes of all vehicles carrying these sorts of goods. This is new territory for us. I certainly accept the point that there may well be individual situations where interpretation will become difficult, but I go back to the primary words in the bill, which state that the court has to be sltisfied that the belief of the inspector is reasonable and that there is no evidence to the contrary. It is only in those situations-where it believes it is reasonable and where there is no evidence to the contrary-that it must find in favour of the prosecution. I put it to you that it is highly unlikely that the counter situation would arise-where a prosecution was taking place where a person thought they were being done in the eye and were not putting some sort of evidence to the contrary. But let us see it develop. As I have said, the undertaking is there that refinement will take place if it is required.",84
168,Mr STEELE HALL,ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) for his explanation. He is unable to resolve the difference between the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill and the explanation by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). I respectfully ask that he discuss the matter with the minister and, ifit is not as it is supposed to be, discuss it with the industry and perhaps take remedial action. In any event, I appreciate what he has said and I hope that he will clarify the matter to his own satisfaction and to the satisfaction of the people making these inquiries. Mr O'Keefe-I will do that. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr O'Keefe)-by leave-read a third time. NA Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills: Organisation for Economic Co-operation a-d Development(Financial Support Fund) Repeal Bill 1994 Prawn Export Promotion Bill 1994 Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994 Prawn Boat Levy Bill 1994 CORPORATIONS LAW (SECURITIES AND FUTURES) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 28 February. Second Reading",84
169,Mr DUNCAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the trading of new and innovative products on Australian securities and futures exchanges. It will permit the trading of new products on a more flexible basis than is presently possible under the Corporations Law. The substance of these amendments was originally included in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 March 1994. Those amendments were intended to facilitate the trading of a new product by the Australian Stock Exchange, ASX, from 1 July 1994. The amendments were withdrawn from that bill to allow for further public comment on the proposals and to permit exposure of draft regulations and business rules in support of the amendments. An exposure package of documents was released on 5 September 1994 for public comment by interested parties. The exposure package included the draft bill and regulations, draft explanatory memoranda and a summary of the share ratio business rules prepared by the ASX. Overall, there has been a favourable response to the proposals. In particular, the Australian Securities Commission, the Securities Institute of Australia and the International Banks and Securities Association support the proposals. It is government policy to assist the Australian securities and futures industries to grow and develop. These industries play an integral and important role in Australia's financial markets. They are vital to Australia's future as a mature and stable economy. Through these industries Australia can develop as an important financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region. The ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange, SFE, hold key positions in these industries. Since the commencement of the national scheme for corporate regulation on 1 January 1991 the government has endeavoured to facilitate competition in, and promote the international competitiveness of, Australia's sec.urit-es and futures markets. Through legIslatIve change and the administration of the law by the Australian Securities Commission, ASC, our markets have been encouraged, not stifled, by regulation. Amongst other initiatives the government has facilitated the introduction of an electronic clearing facility to enable the ASX to meet best international practice standards in the clearance and settlement of share transactions. Legislation has been enacted to facilitate the establishment of retail screen based trading markets for collective investment schemes. This will provide a new market for investors to trade units in collective investment schemes. The government has also approved the New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange, a subsidiary of the SFE, trading its products on a screen based system in Australia. It is important to appreciate that the general policy thrust of this bill is a continuation of this policy of encouraging competition in the financial markets. The government recognises that the future success of the exchanges depends in part on their capacity to develop and market innovative new products in response to changing financial needs and circumstances. Both the ASX and the SFE have shown that they have the capacity to develop such products. It is important that this activity not be frustrated by regulatory structures which inhibit product development or encourage business to go elsewhere. Under the Corporations Law trading in futures contracts and securities is separately regulated. Generally speaking, under the current law futures contracts are only able to be traded on a futures exchange while securities are ordinarily traded on a stock exchange. Strict penalties apply if securities or futures contracts are traded in breach of the Law. The present rigid definitions of 'securities' and 'futures contracts' in the Corporations Law can operate to prevent the trading of new products on a particular exchange, in circumstances where there may be valid reasons why they should be able to be traded on that exchange. Those definitions were developed some time ago. There has been significant growth in derivatives markets and development of new financial instruments and products since that time. These developments were not contemplated when the basic legislation was first formulated. For some of these products, the existing regulatory provisions are not the most appropriate. The government has therefore decided to amend the Corporations Law to introduce greater flexibility into the definitions of 'securities' and 'futures contracts' in the Corporations Law. Share Ratio Contracts The catalyst for the introduction of these reforms at this time is the new product, termed a share ratio contract, recently developed by the ASX. A share ratio contract is a derivative financial instrument. It combines the features of a security and a futures contract. I am sure everybody will now be much the wiser. The ASX is presently precluded from trading this product on its securities exchange because a share ratio contract does not fall within the existing definition of securities. However, there is a close relationship between a share ratio contract and securities which are already traded by stockbrokers on the ASX. Share ratio contracts require a knowledge of the performance of individual shares. Stockbrokers will be equipped to provide advice about such contracts. They will be required to demonstrate that they have relevant experience and education and have completed a training program conducted by the ASX in relation to advising and dealing in share ratio contracts. All share ratio trading will be supervised by a senior representative of ASX member organisations. In light of these arrangements the government is of the view, therefore, that, in this particular case and in the context of the regulatory arrangements being developed, it is reasonable for share ratio contracts to be traded on a securities exchange. To this end, the bill will permit the regulations to prescribe particular exchange-traded agreements and to regulate such agreements as if they were securities or futures contracts. The first such agreements to be prescribed, share ratio contracts, will be prescribed and regulated as if they were securities, enabling the ASX to trade its new product on its securities exchange. The bill will also permit the prescription of other products in the future, thus ensuring a quick legislative response to developments in derivatives markets and the emergence of new products by enabling those products to be approved for trading on stock exchanges or futures exchanges. The power to prescribe products will be used sparingly. Nor will these amendments have any application to mainstream products which fall to be regulated under the respective regimes already in place. These will continue to be governed by the existing regulatory regime prescribed in the Corporations Law for securities and futures contracts. However, to ensure that appropriate regulatory standards apply to share ratio contracts and other products that may be prescribed, the bill provides that regulations may modify the application of the Corporations Law to such products. This will enable the regulations to selectively apply the most appropriate provisions of the Corporations Law to the products to ensure that a suitable regulatory regime is in place for their trading and that investors are adequately protected. The exposure package for this bill illustrates how this is to be achieved. The draft regulations in that package prescribe share ratio contracts for the purposes of the Corporations Law and modify the provisions of the law as they apply to such contracts. The essential features of a regulatory scheme for the trading of share ratio products will include: the licensing of dealers, the conduct of dealers' businesses, dealers' accounts and audit, the handling of client moneys, fraud and market manipulation and fidelity fund arrangements. The national guarantee fund, NGF, will guarantee share ratio contracts traded on the ASX. I am advised by the ASC that an independent actuarial study has confirmed that the r,esources of the national guarantee fund are sufficient to meet any reasonably foreseeable claims arising from trading in share ratio contracts. The ASC has stated that the report confirms that any potential losses from the trading of share ratio contracts would not undermine the financial resources of the fund. In addition, those provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with investor protection and the maintenance of fair, competitive and orderly futures markets will be part of the regime applying to share ratio contracts. Other rules governing the trading of share ratio contracts will be set out in the business rules of the ASX. Those rules have been comprehensively reviewed by the ASC in order to ensure that the standards applicable to the trading of risk management products are adhered to. Those rules are subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General. Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets I reiterate the comments made by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) during the debate on the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1994 that the government does not intend to regulate over-the-counter derivatives markets under these amendments. The power to prescribe agreements contained in this bill is limited to agreements traded on an exchange. This bill has nothing to say about the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets. Review of derivatives The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is presently undertaking a review of the regulation of derivatives. It is expected that this review will also address the policy issues of the trading of derivatives on securities and futures exchanges. However, this review process will take some time to complete. Any amendments to the law arising from it may be some time away. This bill will assist the development and trading of new derivative products in the interim. Conclusion Financial markets and the needs of their users are evolving in ways that were not envisaged during the 1980s. New and innovative products continue to be developed and traded by derivatives markets. Provided adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors and the integrity of financial markets, the government must be able to respond to requests by exchanges to trade new products. As I have noted, the government has encouraged our securities and futures markets to compete in global markets. It has sought to facilitate the exchanges by modifying the Law to make the regulatory framework responsive, flexible and adaptable while, at the same time, not reducing investor protection. The share ratio product has been welcomed by local institutional investors and it is anticipated that it will gain acceptance in overseas markets, thus considerably enhancing the international reputation of Australia's securities markets. This bill provides a mechanism for facilitating the development not only of this particular product but also of other new financial products in the future. This bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on government or business. In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Mr Ruddock-Is there an explanatory memorandum?",85
170,Mr DUNCAN,ASSENT TO BILLS,"No, there is not.",87
171,Mr RUDDOCK,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I am glad to be able to follow the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General (Mr Duncan). He has just given a second reading speech. I note that many acronyms were used, which may mean that my own speech will make more sense following his. The government claims that the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill facilitates the trading of new and innovative products on Australian securities and futures exchanges. It is said to provide more flexibility in relation to the current definitional distinctions between the regulation of securities and futures contracts. The bill is, in fact, the result of a desire on the part of the Australian Stock Exchange to trade a new product known as a share ratio. The coalition has had a number of concerns with the way this bill has been developed. The bill impacts upon the regulation of so called derivatives. The coalition has also been concerned with the government's understanding of and its ability to appropriately supervise the trading of derivatives. The contents of this bill and the issue of derivatives regulation have been brought sharply into focus by the collapse of the Barings bank through the actions of a dealer trading in derivatives. The collapse has resulted in worldwide public concern with the regulation of derivatives and the controls exercised by financial institutions dealing in derivatives. Despite a number of serious concerns in relation to both the substance and development of this bill, the coalition has decided that it will not oppose it on the basis that Australian Stock Exchange should be able to reap the benefit of product development, with the following qualifications: first, a level regulatory playing field is created in respect of the controls on other products with similar characteristics; second, that these controls adequately protect investors; and, third, that it is clear that the amendments facilitate trading in the interim, pending the wholesale review of derivatives. The spelling out of the regulatory framework in the last eight months has gone a significant way to addressing the first two matters that I have mentioned. There is still a significant concern, however, that the bill, in allowing the executive to prescribe future products, constitutes an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. On the third point, the government has insisted that the power will be used sparingly and as an interim measure only. In addition, the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill, currently before this parliament, should ensure that affected parties are consulted in relation to prescriptions occurring after 1 January 1996. Weighing the defects of the bill and the desire not to hinder product innovation, the balance for the coalition was tipped marginallyon the side of not opposing this bill. In the Senate, a second reading amendment was moved by my colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone criticising the government for the bill's defects and its bungling along the way. With the support of the Democrats, the amendment was passed by the Senate. I foreshadow that I will be moving a similar second reading amendment in this House today. The Barings collapse has added an extra dimension to the debate and resulted in public and parliamentary focus on the regulation of derivatives in Australian markets. I note that the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in its statutory and monitoring role has only recently heard evidence on derivatives from the Sydney Futures Exchange. Before this bill is passed, the coalition believes that the joint committee should have an opportunity to consider derivatives regulation in the context of this bill the and, in particular, whether the Barings collapse requires that amendments to the bill be made. Following the second reading, I will be moving a motion to refer such a question to the joint committee. I am not sure what the government's approach is to that referral, but I know there has been some discussion with the chairman and the members of that committee. I hope the government will give support to that reference at that point. While the bill is short, the issues it raises are complex and the background is extensive. On the matter of background, while the scope of the bill is broader, its purpose is to allow the Australian Stock Exchange to trade a share ratio, which is a new financial instrument that has been developed by the exchange. A share ratio allows an investor to trade on the degree to which individual shares move relative to the market. A share ratio does not currently fall within the definition of 'security' under the Corporations Law and cannot be traded on an Australian stock exchange. The regulatory regimes for the trading of securities and futures contracts have been developed separately. Securities are regulated under chapter 7 and futures contracts are regulated under chapter 8 of the Corporations Law. The separation represents the different risk profiles and investment uses of securities and - utures contracts. Each chapter contains a stringent regulatory regime, which includes provisions relating to market operators, clearing houses, licensing of dealers and fidelity funds. The rapid expansion of the use of derivatives as well as their complexity have left regulators lagging. Derivatives are financial contracts to exchange future cash flow streams, the value of which is derived from the value of the underlying asset, reference rate or index. They allow end users to tailor individual hedges or to enhance return on those exposures. Derivatives straddle the definitional borders between securities and futures contracts. They raise difficult questions about the appropriateness of the current regulatory regime. A share ratio may be described as a derivative. It clearly falls squarely within the tion of a futures contract. While the definitional distinctions mean that futures markets have a greater ability to trade derivative products, the Australian Stock Exchange argues that it should be permitted to trade the share ratio because the contracts require a specialised knowledge of individual shares. The government has accepted that the legislative framework ought to be amended to facilitate trading of the Australian Stock Exchange'S share ratio. The difference between exchange traded derivatives and over-the-counter derivatives should be noted. Over-the-counter derivatives, described as OTC derivatives, are negotiated privately and are tailor-made to individual needs. In Australia, OTC derivatives are normally negotiated between banks and merchant banks. Common examples include currency contracts and interest rate swaps. In July 1993, the Australian Securities Commission issued a draft report on over-the-counter derivative markets. In November 1993, the ASC announced a safe harbour policy to facilitate the conduct of limited OTC futures markets. That was designed to provide a measure of market certainty while law reform initiatives are progressed. This bill is concerned with exchange traded products only. The government has commissioned the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee, CASAC, to undertake a general review of derivative regulation. Given the scope of the task involved, it will take at least a couple of years to produce results. The history of this qill is something of a saga which began early in 1994 when the government introduced a draft omnibus Corporations Law Amendment Bill. When the final bill was introduced, slipped in was a provision that effectively allowed the government by regulation to alter the division between securities and futures contracts under the Corporations Law. The amendments were introduced to allow the Australian Stock Exchange to trade an as-then unnamed product. The changes had serious implications for the wholesale regulation of futures, securities and derivative markets and were subject to definiindustry, investor and academic criticism. Those concerns were highlighted by the then shadow Attorney-General, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams), as a result of which the government withdrew the provisions pending further consultation. Subsequently, the Australian Stock Exchange provided details of the share ratio product and the Attorney-General's Department circulated an exposure package, which provided a draft bill and more details of the underpinning regulatory framework. The exposure package attracted submissions, including most notably a detailed and voluminous submission by the Sydney Futures Exchange. The Sydney Futures Exchange was particularly concerned that, if the Australian Stock Exchange was to be allowed to trade instruments having the risk profile of futures contracts, it was imperative that there be a level playing field. The result has been something of a mix-and-match approach. Following discussions between the government and the Sydney Futures Exchange, a new version of the bill was agreed upon that addressed at least some of the exchange's concerns. However, as a result of an administrative error, the bill that was introduced-the Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1994was the wrong version. This bill-the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill-we are told is the correct version. The attorney's office has advised that the Corporations Law Amendment Bill will sit at the bottom of the Notice Paper and lapse after this parliament is prorogued. The provisions of this bill essentially allow an agreement to be prescribed by regulation as a security or futures contract. The regulations may apply, disapply or modify the application of the Corporations Law or relevant regulations to a prescribed agreement. The purpose is to allow the standard regime to be tinkered with to take into account special characteristics of the instrument. That is what is planned in relation to the share ratios. The proposed regulations have been drafted. They prescribe a share ratio as a security and modify the Corporations Law as it applies to such agreements. While the intention is that the product be regulated as a security, there is a degree of mix and matching between securities and futures contract requirements to take into account the individual nature of the product. In addition, the Australian Stock Exchange has developed detailed business rules designed to supplement the regulations. The exchange business rules are subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General. In relation to the concerns we had when the proposal was first introduced, some of them have been allayed. We now know the product that the Australian Stock Exchange wishes to trade. We have details of the underpinning regulatory regime, draft regulations and the exchange business rules and it has been made clear that the proposals do not impact on the over-the-counter markets. But we still have continuing concerns. The changes are potentially pre-emptive of fuller examination of derivatives regulation by CASAC. In obscuring the distinction between futures contracts and securities, the amendments diverge from international practice. In allowing the rigid definitions between securities and futures contracts to be changed by regulation, the role of parliament in considering fundamental policy changes is diminished. While regulations may be subject to· parliamentary disallowance, the scope for manipulation of the distinction through policies is increased. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has stated that the predecessors to this bill constitute an inappropriate delegation of legislative power. That conclusion is still applicable with respect to the current bill. The government has contradicted itself to the extent to which it intends to use the prescription power. The government stated in its draft exposure package: It is not anticipated that the Government will prescribe further products for trading on the securities exchange until the completion of the review [by CASAC]. This statement is directly inconsistent with the advance copy of the second reading speech for the bill, which states that the bill will permit prescription of other products in the future, albeit that the power to prescribe products will be used sparingly. The second statement is consistent with the form of the bill and should be relied upon. It begs the question why an inconsistent statement was included in the exposure package. In terms of share ratios themselves it is clear that, on any current definition, they are futures contracts and, but for the bill, could be traded on a futures exchange. Despite their securities base, share ratios are designed to replicate the hedging and speculating function of futures contacts. Unlike shares, they are not designed for a return on investment as such. The Australian Stock Exchange already has the structure of the Australian financial futures market on which it could theoretically trade share ratios. It has not gone by that route because of difficulties with its clearing house arrangements. Instead, it has sought specific exemption for trading on its securities exchange. The coalition position is that at all times we have had concerns with this bill. As noted earlier, despite the concerns, the coalition did not oppose the bill through its passage in the Senate, although that was a finely balanced decision. Central to the decision was the fact that the markets should be given the opportunity to trade new products, with only such regulatory intrusion as is necessary to facilitate open and competitive markets and to protect investors. Th- Australian Stock Exchange has developed a new and innovative product it believes will be of economic benefit and will attract considerable interest offshore. The argument is put that, if the product is not traded, it be taken offshore. Since the original legislaby tive proposal early in 1994, much work been done in developing an appropriate regulatory framework that most industry and investor bodies now believe is satisfactory. The Sydney Futures Exchange's early reads: fervent criticisms of the bill have waned. The Sydney Futures Exchange appears satisfied to have had the form of the bill changed to selling minimise the appearance of a fundamental blurring of chapters 7 and 8. As noted, while not opposing the bill, the Senate passed a second reading amendment criticising the way in which the government has gone about these changes. I propose to move a similar second reading amendment in a moment. . As noted earlier in my speech, the coalition is concerned to establish whether the lesson enjoy of the Barings collapse suggests that the bill poor."" should be narrowed or amended. To that end, after the debate on the second reading, I will move a motion that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and consider that question prior to the passage of this bill. Having foreshadowed that course, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the Bill, the House deplores the manner in which the Government and the Attorney-General have handled the Bill and in particular condemns: (1) the inappropriate provisions contained in the Bill for facilitating the ASX's desire to share ratios; (2) the initial attempt to pass the amendments without consultation; (3) the Government's clear inability to come to grips with the regulation of derivatives in Australia; and (4) the Attorney-General's administrative bungling of the proposed legislation"".",87
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ASSENT TO BILLS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Abbott-I second the motion.,91
173,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ASSENT TO BILLS,"I wish to support the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill and to oppose the amendment moved by the shadow spokesman, the member for Berowra will (Mr Ruddock). I might start my contribution a quote from the opening paragraph of the has Companies and Securities Advisory Committee's publication of January 1995 entitled Law of derivatives: an international comparison. The first paragraph of chapter 1 ""Futures and commodity options trading is among humanity's more impenetrable concepts. It involves what ('}ne does not own and, as a rule, buying what one does not want. It is deeply shrouded in terminology that conceals its meaning. It operates in an area where opinion is everything, where supply and demand are hard to distinguish from supposition and doctrine, and where inherent uncertainty has spawned an endless holy war between two religious-sounding antagonists, the ""fundamentalists"" and the ""chartists"", not to mention the new breed of computer-dependent faithful. Into this world comes the general public, eager to its riches and often unprepared to become its I make that reference to the CASAC study because there is no question that the parlia':' ment has before it an area which is of high Securities technical competence. In a sense, this bill had its genesis in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill a 1994. I will make further comments on the amendment that has been moved by the shadow spokesman. I had this to say in my contribution on the Corporations Legislation to date, Amendment Bill in the Main Committee: I support a range of amendments to the Corporations Law in the bill. There is one which is in the trade original bill, which the Attorney-General has indicated he proposes to withdraw. That relates to the definition of 'securities' and 'futures contract'. I agree with the sensible decision of the Attorney General to withdraw and proceed with that on a later occasion. Part of the criticism which the shadow spokesman has made of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in his amendment is 'the initial attempt to pass the amendments without consultation'. What could stand out as a more appropriate example of an Attorney-General consulting widely than his having put the provision out for more extensive public comment. The shadow spokesman has basically engaged in a whole lot of nonsense in his amendment. There are two points to be made about this bill at the outset: firstly, there are important macro matters of substance; and, secondly, there are important micro technical matters of substance. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) in the course of his second reading speech dealt with what I describe as the macro matters. I will quote a couple of paragraphs from his speech to illustrate that point. He said: The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the trading of new and innovative products on Australian securities and futures exchanges. It will pennit the trading of new products on a more flexible basis than is presently possible under the Corporations Law. It is government policy to assist the Australian securities and futures industries to grow and develop. These industries play an integral and important role in Australia's financial markets. They are vital to Australia's future as a mature and stable economy. Through these industries Australia can develop as an important financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region. The ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hold key positions in these industries. The government recognises that the future success of the exchanges depends in part on their capacity to develop and market innovative new products in response to changing financial needs and circumstances. Both the ASX and the SFE have shown that they have the capacity to develop such products. It is important that this activity not be frustrated by regulatory structures which inhibit product development or encourage business to go elsewhere. That is the macro point. While this is a highly technical area it is not without substantial economic importance. This bill goes to the capacity of the ASX and the SFE to hold their heads up high as internationally competitive financial centres. The second area I refer to is in the micro area; that is, the technical detail of this bill. The basic problem which this bill seeks to overcome as the starting point is the division between 'securities' and 'futures contract' in the Corporations Law; that is, the division between what is known as chapter 7 and chapter 8 of the Corporations Law. The effect of the division is that, under the Corporations Law, trading in futures contracts and securities is separately regulated. That has as its starting point separate rigid definitions of securities and futures, which definitions can prevent the trading of new products on a particular exchange. It is generally agreed that these definitions were developed some time ago and are not capable of holding up with the financial engineers who develop new products on a regular basis. The particular product that this bill is aimed to address is the share ratio contract which has been developed by the ASX. One point that can be made in respect of derivatives tradingI made the point in the course of a public hearing conducted by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities-is that very often the perception of derivatives trading is that it is pure speCUlation. I am sure members would be aware that derivatives trading and futures trading have been around since, effectively, the fourth century. Their classic application was in risk hedging. In recent years, there has been a development of futures and derivatives trading as pure speculation. That is where one moves from the productive area to the non-productive area. In the course of the public hearings of the joint parliamentary committee, the CEO of the Sydney Futures Exchange, Mr Hosking, made the point that his current judgment was that risk hedging comprised about 60 per cent of the Sydney Futures Exchange market and that 40 per cent was pure speculation. In the course of that public hearing I made the point that post-Baring Brothers crash some futures exchange might be in danger of giving the Burswood casino or the Kalgoorlie two-up school a bad name. That point can be substantively made because members would have seen in this bill a provision that has the effect of ensuring that no state gaming or wagering laws run counter to derivatives trading. Many derivatives transactions are arguably a gaming or a wagering contract. Of course, most gaming and wagering contracts in Australia are null and void. Specific state legislation authorises certain types of gaming and wagering. This bill contains a provision to exempt these new forms of financial investment from those state based gaming and wagering laws. At the heart, in a sense, of this legislation is not just the distinction between the chapter 7 and chapter 8 definitions and their difficulties, but competition between the ASX and the SFE. The ASX and the SFE have from time to time had public disputes as to the effectiveness of their various operations. While they have a cooperative agreement in areas where they are not in competition, in recent times we have seen the Federal Court dispute between the ASX and the SFE on the LEPO product developed by the ASX. We have also seen a range of, in a sense, hostile comments between the two exchanges about this bill. I just take this opportunity of referring to some of the comments made by Mr Hosking in the course of his appearance before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on Monday, 6 March. In the course of his evidence he said: We are very strongly of the view that the chapter 8 Corporations Law provisions for the regulating of derivatives markets in Australia, in particular exchange rate of derivative markets, was designed to manage the risks that arise in these high risk instruments like futures. It was designed in the 1980s with a view to ensure that there was proper oversight to the volatile and high risk futures markets. There was a conscious decision by the draftsmen back in the mid-1980s not to use chapter 7 because it was inadequate for derivatives trading, for futures trading. It was a conscious decision. He also said: Our concern still is that they are basically voluntary rules. They are not embedded under chapter 8. Frankly, they are rules that are yet to tested through the 1987 crash and the bond market reversal. The history of the Sydney Futures Exchange's rules have been tested and their management has not been tested. The anomaly to us is that it seems to be a backwards step in the prudent regulation of derivatives to water down chapter 8 now and to allow other people to trade. I then said: The second question was the corporations and futures securities bill which came from the Senate to the House last week and will be debated this week. Is that a bill that you are happy with or you can live with? Mr Hosking replied: As I mentioned, we made a lot of noise last year because there was no indication to us attached to the amendments that ASX were going to comply with the rigours of chapter 8. It has now been indicated to us by the Australian Securities Commission and the Attorney-General's Department that in place are a number of rules and requirements at ASX level that will at least simulate our level of regulation. We do have the concern that I mentioned, that it is still basically voluntary as opposed to embedded in chapter 8. We have expressed our concerns about exposing derivatives markets to the national guarantee fund and we are not convinced that is appropriate but, in all, we do not see that we have any other avenue to take and we can live with ASX attempting to trade share ratios. So the competitor is basically satisfied with the provisions in place. I then went on to ask Mr Hosking the following question: It seems to me that we may be better off coming from the other end which is to say that we have the futures exchange in place and we have the ASX in place. Let them trade. in futures or securities provided we have the legislative and registry regimes in place to ensure there is investor protection and that we are internationally competitive in that respect. So why get bogged down, either intellectually or in the courts, with what is a security and what is a future? Just make sure the investment protection regimes are there and get on with it. mid Mr Dreise, the general counsel for the Sydney Futures Exchange, replied: We do not have a problem with that-we never had. The only argument has been as to what the regulatory mechanisms were that were to be used. I said: If I understand Mr Hosking, you are satisfied that the comparable measures are in place for LEPOS. Your only question mark or complaint is that they be are effectively voluntary rather than enforceable or mandatory? Mr Hosking replied: Yes, they do not come directly under chapter 8. That discussion leads us to what I regard as the crucial future approach in this area, that is, the need to ensure that both the ASX and the SFE do not become entangled in constant and infinite disputes over the definition of futures and securities. We should change the focus of the Corporations Law to ensure that we have the appropriate prudential and regulatory regimes in place to enable either of these exchanges, or any other future exchanges that may be adopted or developed in this country, to simply trade in open competition. Members will not be surprised that in the course of evidence given to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities earlier this week, on 27 March, by Mr Humphry, the Managing Director of the Australian Stock Exchange, very many of the points made by Mr Hosking were disputed by the ASX. Mr Humphry said: There have been some inaccurate comments made recently about ASX's derivatives market being subject to only voluntary regulation. That is absolute nonsense. There is nothing voluntary about it. The business rules under which all our markets operate are enforceable not only as a contract between ASX and its stockbroker members, but specifically under section 777 and section 1114 of the Corporations Law. It is also important to recognise that our business rules themselves are subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General if he is not satisfied with them. Furthermore, our whole regulatory structure is reinforced by a series of memorandums of understanding with the Australian Securities Commission. We also meet regularly with the Sydney Futures Exchange, in a number of forums, to coordinate our activities in non-competitive areas such as market security. There has also been a lot of talk about chapter 7 versus chapter 8 of the Corporations Law and the alleged gulf between them, but the fact is that the two chapters have many common features, and in both cases they do not stand alone, but are supplemented by the exchange's business rules. To the extent they do diverge, which is largely for historical reasons, there is no basis at all for claiming that one is superior to the other-they both provide a thorough and rigorous regulatory regime. He went on to say: The real problem, I would suggest, is that we have a chapter 7 and a chapter 8 at all, and a threat of a chapter 9 if someone dreams up a sufficiently different product from either options or futures. Perhaps we should be thinking along the lines of having a single generic chapter of the Corporations Law dealing with markets, with different products being dealt with by the much more flexible route of regulation, still of course subject to parliamentary scrutiny So I am pleased to see that the managing director of the Stock Exchange has taken up the point that I raised with Mr Hosking from the SFE and agreed to by him. That is also a point made in the first quarter 1995 ASX Perspective under the heading 'Should the OTC market be regulated?' by Stephen Menzies and James Wood where they write: The principal area requiring law reform is not the OTC market, but rather the inconsistencies in law that have emerged from the separate regulation of ""securities"" and ""futures contracts"". The definitions in the Corporations Law create ambiguities and loopholes. The most obvious loophole relates to the fact that there are a number of financial instruments which are not caught by either definition, so that the law does not regulate trading of those instruments. There is therefore a potential that market offences could occur ... which do not contravene any law. However, as the ASC's report on OTC derivatives seems to agree, these definitional matters can be easily resolved, without the imposition of wide-scale regulation inconsistent with trends in other jurisdictions. That is the key point which this particular bill addresses in respect of the share ratio and in ensuring that the prudential or regulatory requirements are appropriate. Again, in the course of public hearing before the parliamentary joint committee on 6 February this year, Mr Alan Cameron, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, which in the end is the regulator in this matter, by way of evidence had this to say in response to, again, a question from me on this matter: I hope that will be the result of the proposed legislation which has now been introduced which will enable the stock exchange's proposed new share ratio product to be defined, in effect, as a hybrid instrument. There will then be created for it the appropriate regulatory regime which will undoubtedly, I would suggest, be closer to the regime applicable to a future than to a security. I think the difficulty is that with the futures exchange seeking to trade in individual share futures, which have a lot of the characteristics of equities, and the stock exchange seeking to trade in their low exercise price options, which look for all the world like futures, there has been this competition between them. Again, the commission does not have any view on that; if they wish to compete that is fine. Our dilemma is to ensure, as you suggest, that the appropriate regulatory regime applies in either case. We would say that, in a sense, there might eventually need to be some further legislative intervention in order to ensure that this can be done. But the first step is to ensure that these mixed products, like the share ratio product, can be traded under a regime that will be created, as I understand it, by regulation that will have the necessary characteristics that it needs to give appropriate investor tion. I am sorry; that is a long winded way of saying we will end up, I hope, as a result of that legislation, with appropriate investor protection for the hybrid product. It has also been a longwinded way for me to get there but, basically, it says that the ASX, the SFE and the regulator support this legislation, and believe that it is appropriate, whatever their reservations about competition between the two, and that it puts in place an appropriate regulatory regime. All, in their various ways, make the point that, at the end a first time. of the day, we need to be pursuing by way of further changes-and I am sure this will be taken up by the CASAC inquiry on derivaSnowdon; tives-the establishment of a separate chapter of the Corporations Law which enables various products to be traded by either of these two exchanges under appropriate regulatory and prudential requirements. That leads me to the amendment proposed by the shadow spokesman, and I will quickly dispose of it. Paragraph one refers to the 'inappropriate provisions contained in the bill for facilitating the ASX desire to trade share ratios'. That is not asserted by the SFE, the ASC or the ASX. So that is a load of nonsense. The amendment further refers to the 'initial families. attempt to pass the amendments without consultation'. I have dealt with that. You could not have had wider consultation on particular provision before it was presented the House for passage. Then the amendment refers to 'the government's clear inability to come to grips with the regulation of derivatives in Australia'. What a load of absolute nonsense. Look at the CASAC inquiry and the joint parliamentary committee, basically postHoogenboom Barings, having conducted by way of public hearings discussions with all the relevant regulators to ensure: firstly, that this piece of bilities. legislation is appropriate; and, secondly, that in this country we will not suffer from same difficulties we have seen on the Singabecame pore exchange. Finally, the amendment refers to 'the apprentice Attorney-General's administrative bungling of the proposed legislation'. If you thought there protecwas any deficiency with the legislation, you might at least have had the heart to come to this House and oppose it!

174,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"It is with a great deal of sadness that I rise tonight to place on the national record a tribute to a great Australian, friend and Liberal Party colleague, Lex Hoogenboom, who passed away yesterday. My heart and prayers go out to Lex's wife Linda and their Lex was born in the Netherlands 48 years ago. In 1954 at the age of seven he migrated this with his parents, brothers and sisters to to Australia where they settled in the south-east of Melbourne. Lex grew up helping his parents on their market garden farm and joining in the typical day-today struggle that many migrant families faced in postwar Australia. Life was not easy in a new country for a family with nine children, but the family provided a caring environment in which Lex grew up, learning about sharing and giving, caring and responsiIn recognition of their commitment to their the new homeland the Hoogenboom family Australian citizens when Lex was still at school. Lex started his working life as an carpenter and throughout his life he used those skills in his community activities. He was called up for national service and, after deferring to complete his apprenticeship, Lex saw active service in Vietnam as a conscriptee. Shortly before his departure for Vietnam Lex married Linda and just recently they celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary-a time of reflection and commitment. On his return from Vietnam Lex studied for two years to obtain his teaching qualifications and has since taught woodwork and associated technology subjects to many students in Victorian high schools. Together he and Linda built their own home. Lex has been an active and contributive member of the Berwick RSL. In 1987 Lex commenced teaching at Berwick Secondary College where he made a wonderful contribution to the whole school. People warmed to him instantly. He was a gentle soul who was much loved by staff and students alike. Lex had a wonderful sense of humour and would do such things as send an absence note for a student on a timber offcut. He never sought the limelight but went about helping others in a quiet and unassuming way. He got things done without fanfare. At the school just a few months ago he participated in raising funds by selling tickets for a trailer raffle in all sorts and sunshine alike. Lex loved his golf and played regularly with his colleagues from the college. It was on such an occasion, on Valentine's Day in 1994, that he was photographed by the Australian and ended up on the front page of our national newspaper, in political support of me. In the staffroom Lex sometimes took a hammering for his politics. He was a loyal and active member of the Liberal Party. But those with opposing views respected him for his beliefs because he never forced them on others. Lex was a member of the VictorianSecondary Teachers Union and although he never took part in strikes he always participated actively in his local branch meetings of the union. He was never afraid to stand up for those things in which he believed. His counsel was often sought by a wide cross-section of the community. Lex saw talents in people and helped them to develop their own potential. As a volunteer probation officer with the Department of Corrective Services Lex often worked with young people who had real problems. He was able to demonstrate in his quiet consistent way how to take the opportunities that were presented. Lex was able to show them how to bring out their often hidden talents to produce positive and productive results. Lex loved to ski and was actively involved with a ski lodge. It was here also that Lex made a practical contribution. He was always happy to do maintenance and even put in a new staircase. Lex was a giver who always made sure his contributions were full to the top and overflowing. There were no half measures with Lex Hoogenboom. After joining the Liberal Party in 1981, Lex participated actively in his local branch and also at the state level. Without any fanfare, you could always count on Lex. When shadow cabinet visited La Trobe this January, and even though he was ill, Lex was at the Berwick showground helping to set up for a barbecue. At the time of his death yesterday, Lex was still president of the Berwick branch of weather-rain of the Liberal Party.. Lex will be sadly missed by all those who knew him. We can truly say our lives are all a little richer for the knowing. To Linda and Tricia, our love and prayers go out to you. Sheffield Shield",95
175,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Acting Speaker, I did not want to beat my colleagues on the other side of the House to the punch-I know we all shared in a very historic occasion today-but my friend the member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis, sent a circular around today, saying: stop press stop press stop press stop press 4.21 PM QUEENSLAND TIME NA SHIELD BY AN INNINGS AND 101 RUNS We all join with Stuart Law and his successful team in celebrating that wonderful victory. It certainly has been a long time coming. Firstly, I would like to offer my congratulations to Stuart Law and his wonderful team, including Allan Border, as one of only two imports into that team. It has been a marvellous occasion for Queensland. I have seen some of the articles that have been written in the last 24 hours. In the Courier-Mail, under the headline 'It's ours! . . . and thanks, AB' , Wayne Smith reported: A heart-breaking wait of 24,960 days ends today. That is how long Queensland has been in pursuit of the Sheffield Shield. We have won it. I suspect it is going to take some getting back from that wonderful team. I would also like to congratulate John Buchanan for his wonderful effort in coaching the team. Obviously, you do not get results like that unless you have a very hard working coach behind you. I have always been very proud of the sportsmen from my electorate. John Buchanan was born in Ipswich. That was acknowledged today by my local paper, the Queensland with Times. Dirk Tazelaar is another Ipswich person, and I congratulate him on his great effort. According to this morning's Queenskeep land Times, Dirk wants the shield to come the city of Ipswich, and I am sure it will. We always make sure our sportsmen get proper acknowledgment for their efforts. Then there is Andrew Bichel, another young man who bers. came from my electorate, from Laidley. He obviously had a great impact on the result as well. Mr Snowdon-Where's Allan Border from?",96
176,Mr LES SCOTT,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"Allan Border is from New South Wales, but he was never in a apologise winning shield team there. He had to come to Queensland for that. One of the great things about the win the contribution made by young people, like this afternoon. Trevor Barsby, who got 151 runs, which was a great result, and Love with 146. That a great effort by those young people. Just how long it has taken to win this shield did not hit me until I read in my local paper about the ages of these young people. Inter1953. estingly, Stuart Law shares my birthday. was born on 18 October 1968, which was the day I turned 21. That just shows how long it has taken for this to happen. I was quite amazed to realise that it has taken so long to win this shield. The efforts of these people and the coaches, and the enthusiasm of the Queensland community, has been second to norie. The whole community shares the feeling of what it means to win the Sheffield Shield. This afternoon I tried to ring a good friend of mine, and a great cricket supporter, Zillah Norrak, but she was not at home. The one thing in ,life she has always wanted is for Queensland to win the Sheffield Shield. I will certainly try to contact her again later tonight to see how she feels about this important event. Now we have won it, I suppose all she wants is for us to keep it. With the team that we have now, working so very hard, I know that will happen. Some of my colleagues will want to add a few words but I know they would all join me in congratulating Stuart Law, the rest of the Queensland team and all the people, including their sponsors, who have helped to this team together and who have worked to so hard for this tremendous win. It has been a great day for cricket and a great win for the Queensland Sheffield Shield team. I extend my personal congratulations to all its memSheffield Shield",97
177,Mr JULL,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD," Mr Acting Speaker, during question time today you admonished me, and rightly so, for having the temerity to display in the House the score in the Sheffield Shield final. I to you for that. During my 20 years in this place I have always tried to maintain a certain standard of behaviour. I have never was been warned before, so I was a bit worried I would like to join the member for Oxley was (Mr Les Scott) in extending my sincere congratulations to the Queensland Sheffield Shield team for ajob well done. I first visited the Gabba cricket ground as a small boy in I have gone back every year since. It He got to a stage where I wondered whether we would ever have the chance to celebrate the winning of the Sheffield Shield by Queensland. Now it has happened and there are a lot 9f people to whom we should pay tribute. Certainly, there is Stuart Law and Allan Border and those other wonderful members of the present team who have all had a tremendous season. The things that have stood out over the five days of this particular game are that both teams had equal points on the Sheffield Shield table, both teams had two test cricketers away and neither team had any international imports. There could never have been a more balanced final in the history of the shield. Queensland proved it was really up to the task by winning by an innings and 101 runsMr Snowdon-How much?",97
178,Mr JULL,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"By an innings and 101 runs-it was absolutely devastating. But I pay tribute to the South Australians because I would have hated to be playing for the South Australian team in the middle of the Gabba over the last five days with the tremendous feeling that was around the ground. We should pay tribute to a lot of people in Queensland. As the member for Oxley alluded to, there are the coaches, and people like Barry Richards, who, when he arrived in Brisbane, made it a policy not to import any overseas players. He believed that if Queensland were going to win the shield, the players had to be home grown, and they were. While we have had some great imported Queenslanders in our day, such as Alvin Kallicharran, Wes Hall, Majid Khan, Malcolm Francke, Rusi Surti and Tom Graveney-Ido not think we will mention Ian Botham-it is only now, when we have a home-grown team, that we have had this absolutely tremendous win. As I said, I have been going to the Gabba since 1953. In a former life, I did cricket commentary in 1963, 1964 and 1965. Even going back those 30-odd years, we used to dream about winning the Sheffield Shield. It happened today and it is a great tribute to those Queensland teams. A number of reasons have been put up over the years for Queensland never winning the Sheffield Shield. I am not making any excuses but one of the difficulties that teams have faced has been that so many of the games in Queensland during the cricket season are washed out because they are scheduled during our wet season and the thunderstorm season. That is not an excuse, but, obviously, going back over the years, Queensland has had some disadvantage in that respect. Nevertheless, we managed to come second in the shield contest 13 times. ' But today was the day. I understand that the party at the Gabba is still going on. Buses have been organised throughout the towns and villages of south-east Queensland to ship people to the Gabba. The Queensland government has announced that the Sheffield Shield will go on tour around the state-unfortunately, with one state minister but also with three members of the Sheffield Shield team accompanying it. It will be a great boost for Queensland as a whole and a great boost for junior cricket particularly. One thing that has stood out in this quest for the Sheffield Shield has been the dedication of the Queensland Cricket Association in the promotion of junior cricket. My friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has probably been involved as much as I have over the years in the promotion of junior cricket. That is really where it all starts. But 10 or 15 years ago the decision was certainly made to concentrate on the development of young players. As a patron of zone 4 on the south side, of Brisbane, you have seen these young people come through the ranks and go on to perform great things. The thing that has really stuck in my mind over all these years is the fact that so many of the Queensland players have been prepared to become involved in the coaching of those young people. I make special mention ofRusi Surti, who was an import, who came to Queensland from India and decided to stay. Rusi has had a rough trot in recent days, but he was one of those people who went around as part of that junior coaching program and all made a tremendous contribution. To Stuart Law, A.B. and Carl Rackemann, who is, now goipg to the West Indies, you led a magnificent charge today. It has come from many years of trying. Queensland salutes you. Sheffield Shield T-ing Relaxing",98
179,Mr DODD,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"I too join my Queensland colleagues the h9hourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in congratulating the Queensland cricket team on winning the Sheffield Shield, especially young Jimmy Maher from Cairns who played as vital a role as any other player who has been mentioned by my honourable friends here. Tonight I want to highlight in the adjournment debate the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled Taxing relaxing and to congratulate the committee on its inquiry into the impact of Australia's taxation regime on the tourism industry, which is important to. Queensland and, in particular, my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. I welcome the report. It is an excellent report. In particular, I welcome the recommendation of the report that: ... the government carry out an investigation of the tourism shopping practices of tour companies to ascertain whether their activities and those of their tour guides act as a disincentive to fair competition. ' This arises' from allegations that there is collusion between some tour operators and some shops, in particular duty-free shops, to the exclusion of other shops in Cairns. That is of concern to me and to a lot of my constituents in Cairns. The committee noted there were problems: . "" encountered by some overseas visitors in respect of sales tax free shopping as a result of tour guides' earning cOlTImission from certain retailers. In this situation guides direct their clients to particular stores and discourage them from patronising others - - The report also 'said:In some cases, guides h-ve been reported to have retained travellers' documents in - order to discourage their shopping at rival establishments. I do welcome the re-ommendation that the government carry out an investigation. I have already said publicly that I think that that investigation should take place as soon as possible. It is an acute problem in Cairns, and I understand that the problem is the same on the Gold Coast. Rents in the Cairns CBD are very high and some retailers have been forced to relocate or close down as a result. Yet there is this difficulty that some of them seem to miss out because they have not done deals, legal or otherwise-and we do not know abc:lUt the legality of them-with some tour operators. I have been told that some tour guides have been threatened with the sack and blackballing because they took Japanese tourists to stores not included on the official lists of tour companies. Because of this and other things, some resentment is developing among duty-free stores in Cairns. I have had complaints from Cairns residents who have been refused entry to duty-free stores simply because they do not have travel documents. I have written to the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) .. on this, but unfortunately I think she is right: legally there is nothing we can do about it. There have even been letters in the newspaper about a particular duty-free store in Cairns that was converted from the old Cairns post office. We would not get those complaints if there was not that general resentment. I agree with the report when it says: Duty free and tax free shopping are an important part of the tourism experience and as such have an integral role to play in Australia'stourism industry. It is really up to the duty-free stores to look to this report, to look to the other complaints and to become good corporate citizens of Far North Queensland. They owe that to the local community . I note that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is in the House tonIght, and I am greatly concerned about his dissenting report. He recommended: That a comprehensive review of the indirect taxatiori arrangements be undertaken to develop options for reform which address the need for simplicity, equity and efficiency. That is code for a GST in tourism. There is no doubt about that. In the election campaign, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who is a member of the same party as the honourable member for Dawson, said in a Brisbane newspaper that he loved the GST because it would get $1 billion off the tourists. I commend the report. (Time expired) Sheffield Shield Australian Labor Party: Queensland",99
180,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"I also want to refer to Queensland's Sheffield Shield win today. So much has already been said by the member for Oxley (Mr Le- Scott) and the member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I agree with them totally. I would also like to congratulate the former Australian captain Allan Border and the present captain of the Queensland team, Stuart Law, and particularly Carl Rackemann, who has been chosen to replace Craig MCDermott in the West Indies. It has been a great day for Queensland cricket--onethat has been built upon the patience and sacrifices of many cricketers ami administrators over many years. The dream has come true and the win is as much a tribute to them as it is to the winners today. It has been a great day for Queensland.Let us hope that the Broncos can carry it off in the finals, as they did in the Toohey Challenge, and I think that is quite likely. The main subject. I wish to speak about tonight is the ALP politics and the factional fighting up in. Queensland. This House has already heard that there are major differences between the A WU faction and the left wing faction over the Senate positions. By no strange quirk of fate, the first two Senate positions-winnable in most circumstances but perhaps not in the thrust of the Canberra by-election-have gone to the A WU faction. The third spot-the most losable spot-has gone to a left winger, a lady. That has been raised in the House today. One must realise that in all of this Mr Kaiser, the state secre66% tary, has come out very firmly as being an A WU power broker. I do not think there is much concern about that. It was of concern to me yesterday to read the speech in grievance by the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who actually is-as I now interpret it-a victim of the same power play: Mr Kaiser, the A WU faction and the left wing. I understand that on the appeals Mr Kaiser appeared on behalf of the ALP with a submission and the member for Moreton was forced to make his own suggestions, even though they contraqicted each other. We have here an extension of this faction-l row. The thrust of the speech of the member for Moreton was unfair. I did not think he would do it, but he launched an unprecedentedattack on the Electoral Officer for Queensland, Bob Longland, for his own particul-r problems in the redistribution of Moreton. I believe his proper target should have been Mr Kaiser. The member for Moreton and the LaborParty have failed to recognise that the present electoral legislation is the work of this Labor government. The National'Party knew that one vote one value was going to defranchise. country people. the legislation is not just about one vote one value; it is, of necessity, about redistributions in a state that is growing at the expense of the southern states. It is a matter of quotas. It is a matter of growth. It is a matter of tolerances. All of these, incidentally, are also subject to the Labor legislation, which has to be observed by the commissioners. There are no two ways about it. It is unfair to attack a single member of the redistribution commission when a.II the members, under Justice Morling, take responsibility for the final boundaries. It is not just Mr Longland's. . The National Party and the Liberal Party entered the 1994 redistribution process believing that, if we put our arguments coherently, naturally we would get a fair hearing. We are not complaining but it is interesting that Labor has accepted the previous distributions which gave rise to the following results in 1990 and 1993. With 50 per cent of the votes, Labor won 15 of the 24 seats. That is about per cent. In 1993, with less than 50 per cent of the vote48.4 per cent of the voteLabor still won a majority of the seats. I did not hear any complaints by the Labor Party about that. The National Party and the Liberal Party may not have liked thpse outcomes of the redistribution process in those years, but we stuck with them. We could talk .about what we consider to be unfair with the redistributions in Kennedy,Wide Bay and Kingaroy going in one direction. We could also talk about the seat of Hinlder.

182,Mr GIBSON,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"I know the member for the Northern Territory is suffering because he does not even have a cricket team in his territory, but I come from the state of Queensland and am delighted to join with my colleagues from both sides of the chamber in supporting the Queensland cricket team in its magnificent victory this afternoon. It has taken a long time for Queensland and, as has been stated by a number of other members, generations of effort have been put into this achievement today. It is an achievement for the 11 cricketers who played in the Queensland team today and it was certainly a great achievement for John Buchanan, the coach, and Stuart Law, the captain. It is also a reflection of a great investment over many generations. I am a proud Queenslander and I am very proud to congratulate the Queensland Bulls and to say that this will of many shield victories by the state of Queensland. I also support the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) in his comment that in Queensland we have made a major investment in the development of junior cricket. I am proud to be the patron of the Mount Gravatt Junior Cricket Club in my electorate. It is a very large and active cricket club which is going to ensure that Queensland, now that we have the shield, continues to keep it for generations to come. Mr Snowdon-Oh! Mount Gravatt!",101
183,Mr GIBSON,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"The member for the Northern Territory may wish to express his discontent at the fact that we Queenslanders do have a chance to crow a little this evening but, since he does not have a cricket team in his territory, he should not bother to criticise Queenslanders for demonstrating a bit of pride in the achievement of our colleagues from Queensland. I congratulate Stuart Law, Carl Rackemann, Allan Border, Trevor Barsby and all the other Queensland members of that team for their magnificent effort. I look forward to seeing the shield in Queensland when I return after this sittings. I also take the opportunity to comment on the contribution by the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) regarding the redistribution. He has totally misinterpreted my criticisms which were about the fact that the sections of the Commonwealth Electoral Act referring to redistributions have not been observed. Section 66(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act clearly sets out the ways in which redistribution should occur. The first point that is made about redistributions is that quotas need to be observed and need to be as near as possible to the average of all electorates, with a tolerance of 10 per cent either way for the current year and two per cent later. But the act says that in achieving this we need to keep in mind principles such as community of interests, natural boundaries, means of travel and communication within the electorate, and minimising dislocation of voters. The fact is that in the 1991 redistribution 450,000 Queenslanders were shifted from their electorates. In the 1994 redistribution, some 400,000 people have again been shifted be the first from their electorates. My concern is not about the fact that I have a marginal seat. I have always had a marginal seat. That is the nature of Moreton; it has been a marginal seat for generations. Although I will continue to hold the seat, it is probably going to continue to be a marginal seat. That is not my concern. I do not have a problem with having a marginal electorate and working hard and convincing my constituents that I deserve to be there. My concern is to ensure that when redistributions are done, dislocation of voters is minimised. In the most recent redistribution, 14,000 people who had been shifted into my electorate in 1991 were shifted out again in 1994. That is not fair to them. It means they are in the third electorate in three elections. Similarly, some of the people who have been shifted into my electorate from the member for Fadden's electorate and from other electorates were only just put into the member for Fadden's electorate for the 1991 election. They have been chopped around again. It is not fair to them and causes massive confusion at election time. That creates enormous problems. The people do not get the opportunity to develop any sort of affinity with their local member, understand who he or she is and get to know how to use the member's services, because they are constantly being changed around. That is where I believe the act is not being followed. (Time expired) Aboriginal Women",101
184,Mr CLEARY,QUEENSLAND TAKES THE SHEFFIELD,"I have been waiting since 7 March to make this speech. I must tell our Queenslanders that the coach of the Brisbane Bears, Robert Walls, comes from Coburg. On 7 March I asked whether it was within the Speaker's jurisdiction to apologise on behalf of the parliament for the culturally imperialist and boorish actions of the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) who, like a peeping Tom, made a voyeuristic foray into what should have remained sacred and secret to Aboriginal women. Given that the Speaker was not in a position to publicly admonish the member for Barker and apologise on his behalf to the Aboriginal community, I thought I would take the opportunity to record my personal objection to the honourable member's imperious approach to Aboriginal women and Aboriginal culture. It is ironic that some members of the coalition, the most prolific of whom must surely be our resident patriarch, the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), are the first to rise in this House to defend the rights of women to stay home and look after the kids but the last to defend the integrity of Aboriginal women. Where were the great defenders of women, the knights of the Lyons Forum, when the moleskin man from Barker, like a 19th century squatter with the musket hitched to the saddle, rode roughshod over the rights of the Aboriginal women of Hindmarsh? I did not see the member for MCPherson and his Lyons Forum mates defending the rights of Doreen Kartinyeri when her cultural beliefs were assailed by the member for Barker. It is a different matter when we are talking about Christian spirituality and the tenets of the Bible. When we talk about homosexuality, sodomy, abortion, sex education and gay and lesbian mardi gras, our Christian mates-and I know the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) is here today-are in the pulpit reminding us ever so piously about the sanctity of their beliefs and their inalienable right to practise these beliefs and condemn actions contravening God's law. How hypocritical. If this was an issue involving so-called Christian beliefs, our parliamentary church elders would not have been able to get to their feet fast enough. But this was not about Christianity, was it? It was about the beliefs of Aboriginal people. Those beliefs are considered inferior by the squattocracy to which the member for Barker belongs. The honourable member gave it away in his speech during the censure motion on Tuesday, 7 March. Using the only world view, cultural framework and value system he knowsWestern, technical, legalistic-he chose to compare the interception of the Fightback document, the brainchild of a Western merchant banker, with the interception of sacred letters compiled by people steeped in a history more than 40,000 years old. 'How is it any more an interference with copyright than anything else the Labor Party has done or would do if it got hold of similar documents?' the member for Barker pompously asked, oblivious to the cultural lines he had crossed. I am not about to defend the Labor Party or claim that there are not any number of people in the ALP able, capable and mercilessly willing to use dirty tricks against others if the opportunity arises. I had that experience down in Wills with that Labor Party right wing mob, too, so' I know all about it. But that is not the issue. The member for Barker's complete insensitivity to Aboriginal culture is the real issue. On that score, he stands condemned. Like the squatter on the thoroughbred, he swept aside the sovereignty of Aboriginal people. Here is a bloke with extensive pastoral properties once occupied by indigenous people and he is glibly recreating the violations of the past. It is imperative that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), denounce the actions of the member for Barker. Unlike Kerry Packer, Doreen Kartinyeri is not asking the parliament her build an empire. All she asked is that white Australia respect her indigenous culture. It is about time the coalition got fair dinkum and apologised to Doreen Kartinyeri. On that same score, that resident groveller in the Senate, Senator Baume, was at it again.",102

(Question No. 1843) Mr Bruce Scott asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 December 1994: (1) Has Australia Post refused formal recognition to the Association of Post Office Business Agents Ltd (APOBAL) and thus denied them the rights, privileges and other conditions enjoyed by the Post Office Agents Association Ltd (POAAL); if so, (a) why and (b) what conditions would need to be met for recognition to be given. (2) Are there conditions in the consultative agreement between Australia Post and POAAL which prevent Australia Post from entering similar agreements with other organisations; if so, what is the exact nature of those conditions. (3) Is the consultative agreement referred to in the Licensed Post Office Agreement available to licensees covered by the latter agreement; if not, why not. NA (2) What is the average sum outstanding to those parents in the electoral divisions of (a) Fisher, (b) Fairfax and (c) Wide Bay.",103
186,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1}-(2}-The information required is provided in the following table: Custodial Parents Non-Custodial Parents No. with PayNo. Registered No. with Average ments with Payments Amount Outstanding CSA Outstanding Outstanding not applicable 2493 524 $3436.20 not applicable 2752 594 $3424.39 not applicable 3030 679 $2963.83 not applicable 8275 1797 $3274.80 (4) Is it a fact that membership ofPOAAL has halved; if so, (a) does Australia Post acknowledge this and (b) will he ensure that Australia Post confirms the number of financial members of POAAL. (5) Is any member of the national or State management of Australiil Post affiliated with POAAL, for example through life or honorary membership. (6) Do any members of advisory or statutory boards associated with Australia Post hold positions on the POAAL executive; if so, in each case, what are the terms and conditions of appointment to the relevant board. (7) Do any licensees covered by the licensed post office agreement hold positions on advisory or statutory boards associated with Australia Post; if so, in each case, under what terms and conditions. (8- Does the Board of Australia Post acknowledge the existence of APOBAL and its attempts to enter into formal agreement with Australia Post. (9) Does Australia Post use the existence of its consultative agreement with POAAL to deny APOBAL access to the consultative process; if so, why. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question, is as follows: Based on information provided by Australia Post: (1) Australia Post was notified of the fonnation of the Association of Post Office Business Agents Ltd (APOBAL) in June 1993. APOBAL did not exist at the time the interim Licensed Post Office Agreement was introduced in November 1992, or when the final Licensed Post Office Agreement was introduced in March 1993. Australia Post has not fonnally recognised APOBAL in the sense that it has not entered into a Consultative Agreement with APOBAL. Australia Post does, however, respond to requests and correspondence from APOBAL received at the national or State level. Information provided by APOBAL indicates its membership represents only about 10% of licensees, which is not considered to be representative. Furthermore, although APOBAL has limited membership in all States, membership is concentrated in one area of one State, which makes it difficult for APOBAL to provide a balanced national viewpoint on issues of relevance to all licensees. Should APOBAL in the future have much wider representation in both a numeric and geographical sense, Australia Post would reconsider the question of its formal recognition. (2) No. (3) The Consultative Agreement was entered into between two parties-Australia Post and the Post Office Agents Association Ltd (POAAL)-on 3 March 1993. The agreement of both parties would be necessary for this Consultative Agreementto be released to a third party. Australia Post has no obj ection to the release of the Consultative Agreeestablished ment to licensees. (4) Australia Post has no reason to believe that membership of the POAAL has halved, and is satisfied that the organisation is representative licensees. Precise details of membership numbers is a matter for POAAL. (5) The following members of Australia Post's executive management have accepted honorary membership of POAAL: Mr G JOhn-Managing Director Mr W Broadbridge-General Manager, New South Wales Mr M Talbot-Deputy General Manager, New South Wales Mr R Smith-General Manager, Victoria Mr C Richards-GeneraIManager, Queensland Mr R Finch-'--General Manager, Western Australia Mr K Curd-General Manger, South Australia Mr T Holm-GeneraIManager, Tasmania (6) Mrs M. MCGRATH-Kerr, the Chairman of POAAL, was appointed to the Postal Services Consultative Council in May 1992. No remuneration applies to this position. Mrs MCGRATH-Kerr is one of the eleven members of the Council and was appointed on the basis of her detailed knowledge of the postal industry. (7) No. (S) The question of formal recognition of APOBAL has been a matter for Australia Post's management and has not been considered by the Australia Post Board at this time. Future requests may appropriately be brought to the attention of the Board only if the circumstances changed in .the way outlined in (1) above. (9) No. Toll Roads (Question No. 1869)  Transport, upon notice, on 8 December 1994: Further to the answers to questions Nos. 1672 and 1674 (Hansard,6 December 1994, page 4095), what sources and information does his Department use to provide him with expert advice on the advantages, disadvantages and priorities for likely toll roads within his area of responsibility.",104
187,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are few opportunities to fund sections of the National Highway through tolling, due to low traffic counts, generally small project sizes, and the nature of the National Highway network which leaves little scope for development of new roads. The Department is aware of new project sizes, of approximate costs, and likely traffic volumes and can determine prospective commercial viability as a toll road on that basis. Foreign Investment Review Board (Question No. 1901) Mr Filing asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) What safeguarqs has the Foreign Investment Review Board implemented to ensure that foreign buyers of Australian residential property (a) conform to local government restrictions on development deadlines and (b) are prevented from purchasing under assumed names or through relatives living in Australia. (2) Is there a current register of all Australian property owned by foreign interests.",105
188,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Under the Government's foreign investment policy, the acquisition by foreign persons of residential development sites is normally approved subject to a .specific, condition requiring construcjurisdiction. tion or. redevelopment to commence within 12 months. Foreign persons may also acquire new units or houses 'off the plan' subject to the condition that no more than 50 per cent of the dwellings in anyone development are sold to foreign interests. The requirement for foreign investors to comply with these conditions does not relieve them froin having to comply with further restrictions that may be applied by local government authorities. The 'responsibility for ensuring that purchasers (both Australian and foreign) of residential property conform with any local government restrictions on development deadlines rests with that local government authority. (1)(b) The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (FA TA) requires that a foreign person seek prior approval for the acquisition of any interests (no matter how that interest is held) in Australian residential property. Failure to seek approval is an offence under section 26A of the FATA and is punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $50,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years for a person and a fine not exceeding $250,000 for a corporation. In addition, the person or corporation would be required to divest their interest in the property. , (2) No. Responsibility for land management rests with the States rather than with the Commonwealth. Queensland is the only state that maintains a foreign ownership of land register. The Commonwealth does not maintain any register of property owned by foreign interests. Australian Transport Council (Question No; 1918) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) On which issues and proposals has the Commonwealth sought the agreement of the States at the Australian Transport Council since 1991. (2) How long did each State take to respond in each case. (3) Was agreement eventually reached in each case; if not, why not.",106
189,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1}--(3) The Australian Transport Council (ATC) is a Ministerial forum for Commonwealth, State and Territory consultations and advice to governments on the coordination and integration of all transport and road policy issues at a national level. The issues and proposals considered by ATC are normally developedjointly by the Commonwealth, States and Territories through consultative processes and are generally not attributable to any single The agenda for ATC meetings is developed for the Council's consideration and approval by the Standing Committee on Transport (SCOT), the senior committee of officials to the Council (comprising senior representatives from all States/Territories and modal advisory groups), having regard to the ATC work program established under the National Transport Policy Framework. Department of Social Security, Western Australia: Telephone Calls (Question No. 1940) Mr Cameron ask the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 2 February 1995: (1) How many calls per day are made to his Department's 132468 number in Western Australia (2) Is he able to say how many' calls per day receive an engaged signal. (3) What is the average time a client waits for a call to be returned. (4) Are some callers put on hold;if so, for how long. (5) How many staff (a) in total and (b) at each departmental office are allocated to handle calls to the 132468 number. (6) Has he or his Department sought feedback from staff or clients on the efficiency of the 132468 number; if so, what has been the response; if not, will he do so. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) From 1 July 1994 to 28 February 1995, an average of 5,236 calls per day were received on the Department's '13' number in Western Australia. (2) From 9 to 28 February, an average of 607 attempted calls per day in Western Australia received a busy signal (data for earlier in the financial year is not available). (3) 95 per cent of calls are answered within the TeleService Centre. Of the 5 per cent of calls that are directed back to Regional Offices because of the need for referral to files or a special assessor, the Department endeavours to return these as soon as possible, and usually within the same day. (4) Call answering processes within TeleService Centres are such that if all phones are busy, clients are placed in a queue to be answered by the first available assessor. From 1 July 1994 to 28 February 1995 the average waiting time in Perth TeleService Centre was 219 seconds. (5) (a) A total of 102 staff were allocated to handle calls to the 132468 number in Western Australia on 10 February 1995. (5) (b) This figure is made up of: Perth TeleService Centre: 71 staff; Bunbury Te1eService Centre: 11 staff; Esperance Regional Office: 8 staff; Geraldton Regional Office: 4 staff; Kalgoorlie Regional Office: 8 staff. (6) The Departmentconducted the first National TeleService Centre Survey from 31 January to 25 February 1994. A total of 69 per cent of clients said that enquiries are dealt with better by the TeleService Centre than by attending an office. In January 1995 the Australian Quality Council coordinated a benchmarking exercise of call centres associated with. major Australian companies and organisations. The results showed that performance in the DSS Victorian TeleService Centre involved clearly exceeded customer expectations and customer satisfaction was comparable with other organisations in the benchmarked group. Helicopter Dispensations (Question No. 1949) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 2 February 1995: Has each of the letters from: (a) Warwick Mayne-Wilson, Chair, National Trust Parks and Gardens Committee, to Mr Ian Speed, Manager Environment Operations, Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Canberra, dated 17 February 1994, regarding noise levels over heritage parks and reserves and Sydney Harbour; (b) Ms A. Liddy, of Kirribilli, to Mr Madigan, Operations Assistant, CAA, Conde II Park, NSW, dated 18 April 1994, regarding low-flying helicopters; (c) Mrs J. Rintoul, of MCMahons Point, NSW, to Mr Ian Speed, Manager Environment Operations, CAA, Canberra, dated 1 May 1994, regarding heights of helicopters, proposed high-rise rezoning and related matters; (d) Mr C. van der Weyden, of Balmain, to Directorate of Aviation Safety, CAA, Bankstown, dated 18 May 1994, regarding helicopter dispensations; (e) Ms P. Murphy, of MCMahons Point, to Mr J. MCQueen,Acting District Manager, CAA, Conde II Park, dated 6 June 1994, regarding helicopter dispensations; (t) Mr C. van der Weyden, of Balmain, to Mr J. MCQueen,Acting District Manager, CAA, Condell Park, dated 14 June 1994, regarding operational guidelines for Pyrmont heliport; and (g) Mrs J. Rintoul, of MCMahons Point, to Mr Ian Speed, Manager Environment Operations,CAA, Canberra, dated 1 August 1994, regarding helicopter dispensations and other matters(i) been received by the officer to whom it was addressed and (ii) replied to; if so, on which date; if not, why not and when will it rec-ive a reply.",106
190,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The CAA has advised that the CAA has no record of a letter from Mr WarWick Mayne-Wilson dated 17 February 1994. A letter from Mr Warwick Mayne-Wilson dated 24 February 1994 was answered by Mr Ian Speed on 28 March 1994. (b)(i) Yes. . (ii) Yes. On 25 October 1994. (c)(i) Yes. (ii) A reply was signed by Mr Ian Speed on 11 May 1994. (d)(i) Yes. The letter was addressed to L.

(ii) An interim reply was sent on 17 February 1995. . The interim reply invited Mr van der Weyden to discuss his request with a Flying Operations Inspector at Bankstown. The Authority has received a positive reaction from several other correspondents who have received personal briefings 'from Bankstown office staff on similar matters. (e)(i) Yes. (ii) An interim reply was sent on 18 August 1994. The interim reply invited Ms Murphy to discuss her request with a Flying Operations Inspector at Bankstown.

(ii) No. The interim reply referred to at part (d)(ii) also addressed this item of correspondence. The Authority is taking the same approach to this letter as it is taking with Mr van der Weyden's letter of18 May 1994-refer answer at part (d) (ii). (g) An undated letter was received from Ms Rintoul about that time. The letter was part of ongoing correspondence and, in this instance, supplied additional information to earlier correspondence without seeking a response.

Department of Employment, Education and Training: Grants (Question No. 2020) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 7 February 1995: (1) How many grants did his Department make to individuals and organisations in the electoral division of Ryan in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (2) With respectto each grant in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94, (i) under what program was it made, (ii) what was its value and (iii) who was the recipient. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Grant administration within the portfolio is handled both on a calendar and financial year basis with some grants spanning more than one 12 month period. Given this, it is not possible to provide a precise figure for the number of grants made in the electoral division of Ryan for the requisite years. (2) A list of grant recipients, program details and grant amounts for the electorate of Ryan for the period 1992-93 and 1993-94 is as follows: PROGRAM 1: SCHOOLS Grant RecipientiProgram Brigidine College, Indooroopilly ESL General Recurrent Grants -

(2) Did the US State Department in July 1994 inquire why Australia has not become a party to the protocol. (3) Has a Commonwealth department or departments considered ratification of the protocol since the answer to question No. 916 (Hansard, 24 March 1994, page 2221); if so, (a) which department or departments, (b) when was ratification considered and (c) what was the outcome. (4) Are the relevant departments committing sufficient resources to permit Australia to ratify the protocol before the meeting at UNESCO. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A one day meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 14 May 1954) in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 of the Convention, will be convened during the 28th session of the UNESCO General Conference which will be held in OctoberNovember 1995. As the date for the General Conference has still to be decided on by the Executive Board at the forthcoming 146th Session (16 May-6 June), the Secretariat cannot as yet set a date for 1992/93 1993/94 $ $ 30,000 30,000 (TIL) Program Employer and Indus30,000 42,000 28,000 60,000 80,000 (2) Yes. Australia responded to the US State Department as follows: Australia is still considering whether to become a party to the 1954 Hague Protocol for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Any ratification of the Convention should be preceded by a consultation of all the States in Australia, in order to insure the compatibility of the Protocol with the various States laws. The matter is currently being reviewed by relevant Commonwealth and State Departments, There is. no timetable for ratification at this stage as deliberations are expected to be protracted with the provision dealing with compensation proving to be a difficult one to resolve. (3) Consideration of the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 14 May 1954) is proceeding between the Department of Communications and the Arts, Attorney General's Department, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of Defence. However, the decision to ratify has not yet been taken. (4) Resources have been allocated to this task by relevant departments. However it appears unlikely that the difficulties involved with ratification of the Protocol can be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties prior to the meeting at UNESCO in OctoberlNovember 1995. Former Yugoslav Republic (Question No. 2059) Mr Filing asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 9 February 1995: (1) Is it a fact that Australia does not officially recognise the Republic of Yugoslavia. (2) Does a Yugoslav Embassy operate in Australia; if so why. (3) Is the Yugoslav Embassy permitted to hold this meeting. consular days; if so why. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honol,1rable m-niber's question: (1) Australia has not accepted the claim of the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which have established the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia(the FRY), to continue the international personality of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) (2) The Embassy in Canberra (and the Consulate General in Sydney of the former SFRY continue to operate. However, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 757 of May 1992, the Government reduced the size of that diplomatic and consularrepresentation. The Embassiesin Canberra and Belgrade are no longer headed. by ambassadors, but by charges d'affaires; the number of homebased officers was reduced; and official dealings are only at a working level. In considering the question of the SFRY's diplomatic and consular representation (as well as that of the Australian Embassy in Belgrade), the Government has had in mind the need to provide a full range of consular and otherseryices to our respective communities. (3) Offi'cets ·bf foreign missions have consular responsibilities iii accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The term ""consular days"" refers to visits by mission officials to locations within their jurisdiction. As such, consular days are a normal part of mission work and the question of permitting them does not arise. Native Title Issues: Peak Hill Claim (Question No. 2063) Mr Cobb asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 9 February 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to native title claim NN 94/6 to the old Peak Hill gold mine workings in central western New South Wales. (2) Who lodged the claim. (3) Is it a fact that the claim application (a) was of Peak Hill. not accompanied by the fee prescribed under subsection 62(2) of the Native Title Act 1993 (the Act), (b) was not given to the Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal, (c) did not adequately describe the land under claim, (d) was accompanied by two maps showing different areas under claim and (e) did not specify the native title rights and interests, land or waters. (4) Did the claimant become a registered native title claimant within two months of notice being given as required by paragraph 30(a) of the Act; if not, on what basis is the claimant proceeding as a negotiating party. .(5) Has his· attention been drawn to claims that native title was extinguished by the. granting of (a) the Genangie pastoral lease oyer the land in 1852 and (b) mining leasehold over the area in the 1890s. (6) Is he able to say whether continuity of Aboriginal association with the land has been demonstrated. (7) Has his attention been drawn to statements by the NSW Crown Solicitor that native title has been extinguished and that there was no prospect of the Tribunal making a determination. (8) Does subsection 109(1) of the Act require the Tribunal to deal with any application in a fair, just, economical, informed and prompt way. (9) Has the claimant requested the company wishing to mine the area to provide the claimant with $200,000 on the understanding that the claim would be withdrawn. (10) Has his attention been drawn to an estimate of $150,000 for the legal costs to be borne by the company in fighting the claim. (11) Has his attention also been drawn to claims that (a) because of the time taken to deal with the claim, the company has been unable to commence mining thereby forgoing approximately $4 million in forward sales, (b) proceedings in the Federal Court may result in hearings lasting more than an additional 12 months and a further burden to the company, (c) the town of Peak Hill is being deprived of 40 mining jobs, 160 support jobs and $1.5 million in annual wages and (d) if the claim succeeded all pastoral leasehold land in New South Wales would be subject to native title claims. (12) Will he exercise the powers vested in him by the Act to prevent future delays in processing native title claims. Mr Johns-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) According to reports received, David Towney lodged the claim on behalf of the Wiradjuri people . (3) These questions involve issues of fact and law which are properly for the determination of the National Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court. As the proceedings in relation to the claim ate currently before the Tribunal and the Federal Court, it is not appropriate to comment on these matters. (4) See part (3) above. (5) No. (6) No, this is a matter to be determined by the Tribunal and/or the Federal Court. (7) No . (8) Subsection 109(1) of the Native Title Act 1993 provides: ""The Tribunal must pursue the objective of carrying out its functions in a fair, just, economical, informal and prompt way"". (9) I have no knowledge of such a request. (10), (11)(a),(b) and (c) I have seen a report in the Western Advocate of comments made by Mr Cobb concerning the matters raised in these questions. I understand that claims have been made that the proposed mine would result in 40 mining jobs, 160 support jobs and $1.5 million in annual wages to the Peak Hill area. The Native Title Act provides clear processes, including mediation, that enable the mining industry to continue to operate effectively, while achieving a balance with the interests of native title holders. (11)(d) The Commonwealth Government has always had the view as reflected in the preamble to the Native Title Act and the second reading speech that pastoral leases extinguish native title but has always indicated that it was appropriate to let the issue be tested through the courts. Until a court has determined the issue, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to accept claims, for example, when pastoral leases have been issued with reservations that may leave scope for native title to have survived. When the Tribunal accepts such claims, native title claimants on pastoral land have the same access to the right to negotiate as any other native title claimant, until the Tribunal decides against their having native title over the area claimed or there is a broad finding by the Courts that there is no native title where there is or has been such a pastoral lease. The Government notes that there are a number of possible test cases on this important issue and supports an early determination. (12) I do not have any powers under the Native Title Act 1993 to direct the Registrar and/or the Tribunal in processing native title claims. My powers under the Native Title Act 1993 in relation to native title matters derive from sub-section 26(2) determinations on exclusions from the right to negotiate, sub-section 43(2) determinations on an alternative right to negotiate and section 251 determinations recognising State/Territory bodies for the recognition and protection of native title. I am, of course, prepared to look at any application for me to consider such determinations. Prime Ministerial Visits to India (Question No. 2070) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: Have any Australian Prime Ministers visited India during their terms of office; if so, in each case, (a) which Prime Minister and (b) between which dates was each visit.",108

Commonwealth Grants Commission (Question No. 2072) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) What assessment has the Commonwealth Grants Commission made of State and Territory government partnerships with the private sector under a build, own, operate, transfer (BOOT) format. (2) Has the Commission concluded that these projects represent a means by which the States and Territories, through the use of the private sector as infrastructure providers, can shift costs off their budgets and on to consumer user charges; if so, how has this altered the Commission's methodology for horizontal fiscal equalisation and its assessment of the revenue capacity of each State and Territory.",118
194,Mr WILLIS,UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commission makes no direct assessment of State and Territory government partnerships with the private sector under a build, own, operate, transfer (BOOT) format. The Commission's assessments are only concerned with the current budgets of the States and Territories. The partnerships in question are a means of financing capital infrastructure and, as such, have no direct impact on the Commission's assessments.However, these partnerships may have an indirect impact on the recurrent budgets of the States and Territories through reduced debt charges. This effect will be captured in the assessment of State needs in this area. Whether any further direct adjustments to the Debt Charges assessment will be required, cannot be reconsidered until the Commission's next Review of methods, to be reported on in 1999. (2) The Commission has not specifically looked at partnerships of this type but believes they will have a very small impact on fiscal equalisation based calculations. The imposition of user charges by the private sector will not be taken into account ment of the revenue raising capacity of each State and Territory. Aboriginal Assistance Schemes (Question No. 2084) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1995: Does the Government have any schemes to assist Aborigines visiting relatives held in custody: if so, (a) what are they, (b) how do they operate and (c) what sum has been allocated to each scheme. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has provided the following information. Prisons and prisoners are primarily the responsi- ITEG. bility of the State and Territory Governments. The Commonwealth has no direct role. ATSIC does not have any formal scheme for providing assistanceto Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people seeking to visit relatives held in custody. Some organisations funded by AT SIC, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services which are independent community contracted organisations may, if they deem it appropriate, provide assistance to their clients in visiting relatives held in custody. Such assistance would come from within the financial allocations made available from ATSIC. The extent to which this may be occurring has not been quantified in data available to ATSIC. The Royal Commission Into Aboriginal Deaths In Custody (RCIADIC) Interim Report recommended that Aboriginal Visitors Schemes (AVSs) be established throughout Australia in consultation with the Aboriginal community to service police lock-ups (Recommendation 22). In response to this recommendation A VSs have been established in a number of States. At the time that the Interim Report was released, there were already two such schemes operating: one in the Northern Territory and the other in Western Australia. Since this time, schemes have commenced in South Australia and Victoria. The RCIADICFinal Report Volume 3, reported that the success of each A VS has varied to some extent according to the resources available and the extent of Aboriginal involvement in, and support for, the schemes. Community involvement varies considerably from State to State. In South Australia the A VS was set up using funds provided by the Commonwealth Government to implement the Interim Report recommendations. The operation of A VSs is described at pages 228-232 of the in the assess- RCIADIC Report, Volume 3. International Trade Enhancement Group (Question No. 2090)",118
195,Mr CONNOLLY,UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 February 1995: (1) Has the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA) provided funds to the International Trade Enhancement Group (ITEG) since 1991; if so, (a) what sums, (b) on what dates, (c) for what reasons and (d) what (i) conditions, (ii) performance criteria and (iii) monitoring were applied to the funding.

(8) What is the current position of ITEG. (9) When did the Government become aware of ITEG's current position. (10) What action is the Government taking in response to the current position. (11) Does ITEG receive support from other Government sources; if so, which sources.",119
196,Mr KEATING,UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) & (b) $10,000 on 16 June 1992; $10,000 on 8 September 1992; $5,000 on 7 May 1993 and $5,000 on 4 August 1993. (c) To testthe concept of making available to Australian businesses, on a case-by-case commission basis, people with relevant linguistic and cultural skills, together with overseas qualifications and experience, in order to assist them in accessing overseas markets. (d) (i) A contract between OMA and ITEG set out a number of conditions which were to apply to the provision of funds, including timing of reports, payments of fees and invoice procedures. (ii) Payments were subject to the provision of satisfactory progress and final reports, in line with conditions set out in the contract. (iii) Under the terms of the contract a project officer was assigned to supervise the project and ensure compliance with the conditions of funding. (2) ITEG started operation in 1991 under the auspices of the David Syme International Business Centre, Monash University. ITEG was officially launched in September 1992. OMA contributed $5,000 towards the cost ofITEG's official launch; this amount was part of the $30,000 pilot funding. OMA played no role in the establishmentofITEG. (3) OMA has played no role in relation to ITEG since the completion of the pilot project and the final payment dated 4 August 1993. (4) No. (5) The pilot project proposal was consistent with the OMA policy objective of promoting the greater use, in Australia, of the diverse linguistic, cultural and business skills and talents which many Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds possess and which are not fully utilised by Australian business. (6) (a) ITEG approached OMA with a proposal to provide seed funding. (b) The proposal was given due consideration by the Industry and Economic Section within OMA and after that evaluation, the Senior Adviser, Industry and Economic, recommended to the First Assistant Secretary, OMA that, based on merit, the proposal should be supported. (7) The then Minister was aware and supportive of the ITEG concept from an early stage. The procedures at the time did not require him to approve individual projects. (8) ITEG wrote to OMA on 24 November 1993 and advised that without additional government funding it would cease operations on 1 December 1993. ITEG' s request for additional funding was denied.
