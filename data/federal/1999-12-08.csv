Relevant criminal had an organised element to it. That is the basis upon which the authority of section 55A of the act which provide: (1) It is hereby declared to be the intention of of a State that: (a) confers a power or function, or imposes Court, being a power, function or duty (b) vests jurisdiction in the Federal Court in Court by this Act; is not prevented or limited by reason And it goes on: (2) It is also declared to be the intention of the regulations, the Authority and the Judges of the Federal and duties conferred or imposed on it or them by conferred or imposed on it or them by a law of a State. The framework was set up so that, if a power states could enact complementary legislation, was a caution in that process because it reserved to pass regulations to cut that back.

But the minister's office was told of that advice In due course, I am told, the minister's office Queensland Solicitor's opinion was unlikely law, but then further and more senior advice was strongly arguable that such a case could a dilemma of how to address this because, parliament and its committees and every minister basis that states were entitled to confer similar Commonwealth had seen fit to confer.
