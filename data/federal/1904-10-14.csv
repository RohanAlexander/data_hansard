1,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown," I wish to make a personal explanation. In today's Argus the leader of the Opposition is reported to have said last nightMr Willis, in his speech, said that the Labour Party was-so well organized that there should be no dissolution at the present time. He was aware that the feeling of the country was against the Ministry, and therefore did not desire a dissolution. I have consulted Hansard, which, as honourable members know, is a verbatim report, and I find that the words which I used were theseHonorable members opposite nave derived some satisfaction from a reckless statement of the honourable member for Wilmot, that were a dissolution to take place at the present time, the polls would be swept by the Labour Party. The honourable member might be able to let'himself down softly in that way, but he could not deceive me, nor could he deceive Mr Tom Mann, who has said that honourable members opposite would go further than they now profess to be prepared to go, and that if they were candid and honest, and said what they really believed in,'.they would g» the full length of. Socialism, according to the Fabian Essays, and of the socialistic movement of England, and the Continent.; but he adds that they are not supported by the people. There is a great difference between the two statements. I think that my views as reported in Hansard are very clearly and definitely set out. SUGAR BOUNTY ACT.",12
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister if he has received a communication from the Premier of Queensland regarding'the continuance of the Sugar Bounty Act, and dealing with the whole subject. If he has, will he be good enough to lay it upon the table ?",12
3,Mr REID,Unknown,"No such communication has yet reached me, but if such a letter is received, there will be no objection to. laying it on the table. MANUFACTURES ENCOURAGE- MENT BILL .",12
4,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is it a fact that, prior to the defeat of the Watson Government, a promise was made to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, conditionally or unconditionally, that he would be charge of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill if the then Government was put the out of office, and the present Government came into power? Mr Reid ; - It is not a fact. REFUND OF DUTY . ' Sir "" WILLIAM LYNE - Can the Minislative ter of Trade and Customs give the House Commonwealth any information regarding a claim made by ality ? . Mr Sandford for a refund of duty on steel rails paid some time ago? The matter afterwards taken into court. I wish that to know if the Government have with by drawn their defence, and if they are to now prepared to pay. the claim. will the Minister lay the papers upon the table? I do not ask the question in any hostile spirit; but if the Government have done what I think they have done, the papers to be made public, so that my action, and that of some of my colleagues, answer the questions which are asked. in reference to the matter may be disclosed.",12
5,Mr MCLEAN,Unknown,"The matter came under my notice a little time ago, as one which had been partly dealt with by my predecessors. On making inquiries, I found that the that way. equities, of the case were with Mr Sandford, and I therefore sent instructions to Svdney not' to enter a defence. Sir WILLIAM LYNE * - Will the Ministerlay on the table the papers connected with the matter? MT . MCLEAN - There is no objection-to doing so. PREFERENCE . TO LOCAL TENDERERS.",13

16,Mr MCCAY,FIRST COMMONWEALTH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are asf o l l o w : 1. Neither the members, of the First nor the Second Commonwealth Contingent have yet received their medals ; but advice was recently received from, the Home Government that they shortly be ready for issue, and they may The delay, that has taken place in the matter has been occasioned, it is understood, by the large number of medals to be issued, and the necessaTy checking with the desire of the Rolls. 2. It is not intended by the Government to award any extra medals to members of the First Commonwealth Contingent. ""EXISTIN G AND ACCRUING",13
17,Mr GLYNN,FIRST COMMONWEALTH,"the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon noticeReferring to his answer to the question of the honourable member for Barker, on 8th September, on the matter of the annual increases to civil servants under State Acts, and generally to the matter of existing and accruing rights under section 84 of the Commonwealth Constitution- (1) Are the law officers, including the Attorney-General, of opinion that none of the following payments or rights under State Acts in force when the Department of the State became subject to the Executive control 'of the Commonwealth, are existing or accruing rights within the meaning of the Constitution :(a) Annual salaries.

If Yes(3) What, in the opinion of the law officers, are existing or accruing rights within the meaning of Section 84 of the Constitution?",14
18,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FIRST COMMONWEALTH,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's questions is as follows:It is considered generally undesirable to furnish legal opinions given by law officers of the Crown to the ex-Government, especially when the cases submitted may come before the High Court for decision. As already partially intimated in reply to a previous question, it may b ; stated that it was held by the Crown Law Officers that, on confirmation by the Governor General, the classification of the service made by the Public Service Commissioner supersedes the State Acts as regard salaries, increments, and allowances. The present Attorney-General has given no opinion on the matters referred to. NA CLASSIFICATION.",14
19,Mr LONSDALE,PUBLIC SERVICE,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice(1) Since the scheme for the classification of the Public Service has been presented to this House, has the Commissioner informed any public officers that they are not entitled to the grade assigned to them therein, but to a lower one? (2) If so, on what grounds, and in how many instances in respect of each State?",14
20,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PUBLIC SERVICE,"The answer to .the honourable member's questions is as follows : 1 and 2. A clerical error occurs in the printed classification, whereby six omcers in the New South Wales Customs are given wrong designation; when this was dis;overed, the Commissioner . RIGHTS."" notified the officers of same. They are described as third instead of fourth class inspectors, but the mistake is self-evident, as the classification and pay of the officers show their positions as in the fourth class. Five of the officers referred ti: have been granted an increase in the classification. The Commissioner is not aware of any other similar cases. NA REGULATIONS.",14
21,Mr EWING,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"for Mr DEAKIN) asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. When the provisional Patent regulations tentatively adopted on 31st May are proposed to be finally approved? 2. Whether any and what alterations are intended to be made in the provisional regulations? 3. Whether those interested will be afforded an opportunity of making suggestions relating such salaries. to the regulations, as proposed to be amended? 4. When will the first complete specifications an officer as part of the under the Federal Patents Act be accepted? duties, or by reason, of his Mr MCLEAN - The answers to the honoffice. orable and learned member's questions are as follow:1. Probably within the next fortnight. 2. Yes; such alterations as the working of the provisional regulations may prove necessary or desirable will be made in accordance with the piactice in such cases. They will probably, however, be of a slight character. 3. In accordance with the Rules Publication Act, the regulations were gazetted on the 31st May last, and persons interested had then sixty days' notice in which to make any suggestions. A few suggestions have been received, and these have been given due consideration. 4. Complete specifications will be accepted when the indexes of the State Patent Offices have been put in order. The difficulty of bringing the Act into effective operation in this connection was clearly indicated by Mr Deakin when the Bill was under discussion in Parliament during its second reading, when the Honourable member remarked that it would probably take a considerable time before complete specifications could be accepted. [Vide Hansard, 29th September, 1903, page 5507 ; and 30th September, page 5591.) The Patents indexes and records of all States except New South Wales are now being carefully inspected, but in regard to - the last-mentioned State a difficulty has arisen, which it is hoped may be shortly adjusted. The Commissioner is using every effort to push on with this work. TEMPORARY OFFICIALS: CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT.",14
22,Mr LONSDALE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether it is the intention of the Public Service Commissioner to recommend that the exemption of certain officers in the temporary service of the Department of Trade and Customs at Sydney (enumerated in notification of 23rd June) shall be renewed at and from ist October, 1904, in those cases where the officers have carried out their duties in a satisfactory and efficient manner?",14
23,Mr MCLEAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :Pending re-adjustment of the permanent consequent on classification, the exemption of return. certain officers in ihe temporary service of the Department of Trade and Customs, at Sydney, has been renewed from the ist October, 1904, for three months. Such exemption will not, it is anticipated, be extended further, and the persons concerned cannot be made permanent officials. FEDERAL CAPITAL SITE.",15
24,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether the Government is yet in a position to say how much of the 900 square miles to be appropriated for Federal Capital purposes consists of Crown lands such as the Commonwealth is entitled to ask the Government of New South Wales lo grant free of change, and what proportion of such area is private property such as the Commonwealth will require to resume and pay for? 2. If not yet in a position to give an answer, hew soon dees he anticipate being able to do so?",15

34,Mr HUME COOK,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether the Government intend to re-appoint Major-General Hutton as head of the Australian Military Forces?",15
35,Mr MCCAY,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The General Officer Commanding has not made any request or sugdebate gestion to the Government that his term office should be extended. On the contrary, some time ago, he asked that the usual arquestion rangements might be made to enable him second time."" to return to England in the usual way at the termination of his command, and such B arrangements have been proceeded with.

Whilst the survey is being made, no opportunity should be afforded to any. one to monopolize the land along the posed route, and this is the proper time to gestion. make provision against it.

46,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would the honourable member reserve the minerals in the land from ex,16
47,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I would reserve both the land and any minerals which it may contain for the benefit of the Commonwealth. The money received from the sale of the land could afterwards be applied to liquidating the cost of constructing the railway. I merely desire what is fair. I wish the Commonwealth to be protected in its expenditure, and I desire to prevent any expenditure being incurred in the interests of private capitalists. I am aware that the Commonwealth has no power to reserve this but I ask that the B i ll shall provide that the States shall reserve it.",16
48,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We cannot insert such a conprovision in a Railway Survey Bill .,16

I am prepared to do my best to block this Bil l unless some provision of the character I have indicated inserted in it . It appears to me that the advocates of the measure are prepared to sacrifice every principle simply to suit ^well the needs of their own States.",16
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I take no exception to the honourable member's that the States through which the proposed railway will pass should reserve it a reasonable area upon each side of it, membut I fail to see how they can do of that until the route has been determined. I am sure that if the Ministry make representations upon the subject to the Western. Australian Government no difficulty will be experienced in inducing them to give effect to their views. At the same time, nobody desires that any . mineral wealth which may be discovered shall not be worked. Personally, I am of opinion that no minerals will be found in Western Australia except within about 250 miles of Kalgoorlie. Indeed, in a private letter which I received the other day it was stated that a mining lease comprising ninety-six acres had been'applied for, about 250 miles to the east of Kurnalpie, which would be somewhere near the probable route of the railway. Of course it would be altogether adverse to the interests of the Commonwealth to place any restrictions whatever upon the working of mineral leases: But I am convinced that no difficulty will be experienced in inducing the Government of Western Australia to reserve from alienationany reasonable area upon each side of the projected line. I am sure that the representatives of that State share my opinion. Probably it would be advisable to set apart, say, twenty or thirty miles upon each side of the railway, but of course there would be nothing to prevent that area from being leased for pastoral purposes, as the land is quite, suitable for pastoral purposes %yhen water is procured. At the present time, however, we do not know the exact route - which the line will follow. I can assure honourable members that it is not merely the value of country which the railway will traverse which induces me and those associated with me to advocate^its construction. I . am impelled to do so from a desire to nect the eastern States with Western Australia, and thus to make Federation a reality. Until a Bill authorizing the construction of the line is before us, I think that the honourable member's suggestion is premature.  sure as to what the honourable member for New England desires. Does he wish to reserve' an area upon each side of the proposed line for all time?",16
51,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No .  honourable' member that there is a land tax operative in South Australia. I understand that he believes in a land tax.,17
52,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do.  him that any land which might be alienated would be subject to a land tax. Personally, I do not see how we can define the particular locality in which any area should be reserved at the present time. The honourable member ought to be quite satisfied, seeing that in South Australia a land tax is jn operation.",17
53,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not satisfied with the kind of land itax that i's levied there. I am of opinion that the country upon each side of the projected line should be reserved by the States which it will traverse. After the railway has been constructed it might be sold.  South Australia's attitude upon this matter. That State would be quite prepared to reserve land upon each side of the proposed line for certain purposes, but the suggestion that we should make provision for it in this Bill, even though we do not know the route which the railway will follow, seems to me a very impracticable one. If the honourable member will defer his proposal until the measure authorizing the construction of the line' is under consideration he will be acting wisely.",17
54,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I am quite in sympathy with the object which the honourable member for New Engjand wishes to attain, but I contend that the present is not an opportune time to give effect to his suggestion. I can assure him that the members of the present Western Australian Government are fully seized of the necessity for preventing any unfair exploitation of the resources of that State. The previous Government - were called upon to deal with several cases in which attempts con- were made by syndicates to obtain undue control of large areas. These were promptly frustrated. If my memory serves me correctly, I think that even in the direction which the railway is intended to take some veiy active gentlemen endeavoured some' time ago to secure large blocks of land. However, their little scheme was discovered, and quickly thwarted. The honourable mem- ber for New England may rest assured that the Western Australian Government are fully alive to the need for preventing exploitation of the national resources in the way that he fears. As regards mineral' wealth, however, I confess that the positionis somewhat different.",17
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"-The land is no good, and the minerals are.",17
56,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I believe that the land is good. To a large extent it is unknown territory, but the honourable member knowsthat discoveries are being made which show that parts of the world that a few years ago were regarded as utterly worththose less are of immense value.",17

A few years ago it was regarded as a terrible wilderness, and the worse criminals were consigned there in order that fitting punishment might"" meet their misdeeds; but it is now excellent for settlement. I merely mention this as an illustration of the discoveries that will probably be made when this parwill ticular portion of Australia is being surinterchange veyed. I trust that competent men will sent with the party with a view to reveal the resources of that belt of country. that be done I believe it will be found that considerable mineral wealth exists there. would ask that the consideration be kept before the House that this after all is merely a legitimate inquiry, and that Western tralia is fairly entitled to expect that ter of this kind, which is of considerable national import, will be taken in hand the Federal Parliament now that the portunity offers.

59,Mr REID,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I believe that every honourable member is in. full sympathy the object which the honourable member for New England has in view. If such prethis cautions as he suggests had been taken from the beginning in connection with the extentralia sion of railways throughout Australia, I the believe that the whole of our railway debts pletion would be represented by the value of the lands in the neighbourhood of the lines.

66,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I never feel sadder than when I have to differ from the right honourable member for Swan and the other representatives of Western Australia. I sympathize with them in their desire, as the right honourable member says, to connect the east with the west, and so consummate the great scheme of Australian CJnion; but there are practical considerations which ought not to be overlooked. The proposal made by the honourable member for New England is not without precedent, I think, in all the States. For two and a half years I , as Minister controlling the construction of railways in New South Wales, laid it down as an indispensable condition that in every instance a reserve of ten miles should be made on each side of any State railway which was to be constructed, and I have reason to know that, in consequence of that action, a very considerable increment accrued to the State.",19
67,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That matter was dealt with in each case when the Bill providing for the construction of the line was before Parliament.,19
68,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. quite admit that, in a Bill of the description now before us, we cannot provide for the actual reservation of land; but we must remember, as business men, that this is an initial step that may ultimately lead to the construction of a line costing £ 5 , 0 0 0 , or £6,000,000 .",19
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Do not ,£5,000,000.",19
70,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then I shall say £3,000,000 .",19
71,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is nearer the mark. Mr Bruce SMITH , - The principle involved is the same whether it be a line costing £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £10,000,000. must be'admitted by every honourable memAustralia. ber that if a syndicate were to come tomorrow to the Commonwealth Parliament, or to go to the Western Australian Governsaying ment, with an offer to construct the line, and propose, as a condition of the expendimoney. ture of so large a sum, that they should areservation, and ultimately a gift, of very large extent of territory on both sides of the line,, it would be regarded as very - business-like proposal, and one which any syndicate or any company would be. justified in making at all events, for the consideration of the Government about have ,the railway constructed.",19
72,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wester n Australia has suffered severely from that policy in the past, and will not incur the same suffering again.",19
73,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We are asked to embark on a preliminary survey, and if . honourable members consider for a moment they will be able to follow and acquiesce in the line of argument I am about to take. This expenditure is proposed for the purpose of laying down,' in a rough way, perhaps, the line which this particular railway is intended to take in the future. I do not say that .there will be shown, within a mile, the exact route which will ultimately be taken, but there will be an indication, as the result of a survey made at the expense of the Commonwealth, of the particular direction which the railway will follow. We all know that the intimation of the line of survey will be the signal for a number of adventurous spirits, whom I am not prepared for a moment to denounce-it will be the signal for a number of enterprising men to look round with . a view to purchasing land, which we know in some parts of I Western Australia",19

I should be very sorry to approach the Western Australian say Government with an offer, even to purchase land, a good deal of which has not yet been explored, from the fear they might accept my money.

On the other hand, if the land is not resumed, the cupiers will acquire the increment which sults from the construction of the railway through what, at present, is unexplored country. I consider it necessary that before embarking on this expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 we should require the, two Governments through whose territory the line is likely run, to satisfy the Commonwealth Governtralian ment that they have reserved from sale or lease a large extent of territory on each side.. The object is that when we, as a Parliament, hereafter undertake the actual construction, we may lay it down as a condition that the from practical experience.

I confess I am quite sure whether this was the occasion raise this particular point, but the arguby ments which have been addressed to the lead House convince me that the present opporserving tunity should be seized by the Government to enter into negotiations or correspondence with the Governments of the States conshould cerned, with a view to preserve the public rights in the public lands along the route the proposed railway. I have often pressed the opinion that the honourable learned member for Parkes was a democrat, and I think that the speech he has just livered fully bears out that contention. Some of our honourable friends interjected that the honourable and learned member's proread posal was - an example of Socialism. But there is a distinct difference between this proposal and socialistic proposals, because in this case the public rights in the lands are sought to be preserved. There is' no present. suggestion to nationalize any private capital or any private industrial enterprise. It is protective act so far as the rights of the general public are concerned, having for its object the prevention of public rights in public property being invaded for private In the past we have had so much experience of the extent to which public lands have been exploited by private individuals, when public expenditure has enhanced their value, that it is our duty to that the public rights are preserved before sums of money are voted by the FedeParliament which would have the effect of enhancing the value of the public estate. AusThe lands through which this survey is proposed to be made still belong to South Australia and Western Australia. It is only that the Government should enhave ter into communication with those States, a view to preserving to the public a certain proportion of the lands on each side of the route surveyed, and so prevent their passing into the hands of private individuals. sug-- Mr FOWLER - That is practically the the Wespolicy of Western Australia.",21

99,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If I were to allow private reasons to rise above public considerations I should vote for the construction of this railway, in order to have a rapid connection between this side of the continent and Perth.

All the evidence points distinctly in the opposite direction.",22
100,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is the honourable member against getting information ?,22
101,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not a question of getting information.,22
102,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is absolutely so.,22
103,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We are already provided to get the proof? with a considerable amount of information on the subject. We have had a very close inquiry; we have had many persons going through portions of this country, and, far as can be ascertained, the best thing that one can get to eat there is a wurrung or a chockalock, and one's supply of water has to be carried. I feel that the construction of this railway may be very necesuseless sary when the hands of civilization Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie have stretched out nearer to one another than they done. But that I think will riot be until some time next century.",22

108,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Of course I know about my own country.,22
109,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes ; but the honourable member has discovered a marvellous gold and copper mine of which no one else has ever heard I think.,22
110,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What nonsense ! is known on the Stock Exchange here.,22
111,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Will this gold and copper field, of which the honourable member speaks, justify the expenditure of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 in the construction of a railway across the continent ?",22
112,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainl y not, of itself.",22
113,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Probably there are gold and copper mines, and very good sheep walks, and perhaps good dairying country in the centre of Australia. But the duty of this Parliament is to allow further development to go on in that direction before it enters upon any expenditure on a project of this kind.",22
114,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would not the honourable member assist inquiry ?,22
115,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I shall not vote for the expenditure of one penny on this railway until we have proof that there is some justification for its construction in the near future. . Mr FOWLER - Why not give us a chance,22
116,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"My honourable friends will have that chance at some time in the next century, when I shall not be here to so vote either for or against the project.",22
117,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A, It is noticeable that so far we have not heard to-d'ay anything about a large tract of stony and country. It is rather pleasing to find in that honourable members on the other side have discovered that there is good land have between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie.,22
118,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am assuming that it is rolling plain.,22
119,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Previousl y we heard different opinions expressed. I do not know whether recent developments have had the result of throwing any light on the character of the country lying between these two points, but that would appear to be the case. From the first, I have been favourable to a survey of this line being made. In this case, as in others, we can reasonably . ask the Government to carry out their declared policy of consulting the States concerned. We should have an assurance that the States concerned are prepared to guarantee the reservation of the adjacent lands, for the reasons already given, before a survey is commenced. I do not see how we could""very well make that stipulation in the Bill , because we have no control over the lands in the Commonwealth. We are entering upon an undertaking which is of an exceptional nature. What is proposed is practically to give a It bonus to the two States which are most directly interested in the survey and construction of this line. Honourable members may feel that the construction of the line is likely to follow the survey, and, personally, I think it will. I hold the view that probably in a few years we shall have the whole of the railway systems of the States under the control of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, I am not so much alarmed as are some other honourable members that the Commonwealth should be requested to undertake the construction of this line. I do not suppose we shall rush into the undertaking for some little time. What is proposed is certainly an important departure, in connection with which we should be assured of the distinct co-operation of .the States. The honourable members for New England and Parkes have pointed out what usually takes place .when railways are projected, and there can be no doubt . that persons would be found very glad to take up a large area of land along the route of this railway. They would be able to get it at a very cheap rate, and they would naturally regard it is a very good speculation. So far from opposing this measure, T am in favour of it, but I think, with the honourable members to whom I have referred, .that we should have a distinct pledge from Ministers that they will ask the Governments of both the States interested for an assurance that the land for a certain distance on each side of the proposed line will be reserved alienation. If this were done, we should be in a position to refuse to survey or construct the line later if the States Governments failed to give that assurance. know (that some persons are always on the watch for an opportunity to acquire land along the route of a projected railway for speculative purposes. No one can find fault with them for that, but it is our duty to see that the public interests are not sacrificed to the private interests of any syndicate. For that reason, I am heartily in accord with the 'suggestion of the honourable member for New that, in this instance, steps should be taken to see that the interests of the public are conserved. The construction of this railway will be a very great undertaking, involving many important considerations that are not now before us. The whole question of the management of railways by the Commonwealth, and the setting up of a new Commonwealth ment is involved. In connection with such 'i.dertakings the States are protected by the fact that they have control of the land. In New So'.tth Wales we not only reserve land from alienation, but we have introduced, the betterment principle in connection with rail wav construction. In South Australia there is a land tax which may operate with a somewhat similar effect, but the ComMr Spence. monwealth Government would have no such protection, if it were to undertake the construction of a railway. It is, therefore, desirable, when the construction of the line is not yet before us, that we should look ahead to what our position would be if we should agree eventually to undertake it. I hold the opinion that the States chiefly concerned should undertake the construction of the line, unless some move is made to bring all the railway systems under the control of the Commonwealth Government. It would not do, I think, to have divided control of railways; because the construction of branch lines following the general development of the country would involve very difficult problems. I have always believed that the Commonwealth Government should have control of all the railways, and I have no fear that if that were the case we should be able to overcome all these difficulties. I have no doubt that the people of Western Australia would be in a position to undertake the survey, and perhaps the construction of the line, but we have to recognise the fact that South Australia is not a rich State, and we are, therefore, jusfrom tified in offering the comparatively small sum which, would be required to carry out a survey of the line. We Mr KELLY - Does the honourable member think that the sum proposed will cover the whole cost?",22
120,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Bill proposes £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 as the outside cost of the survey. From what I have read concerning the coun. try, and from what I have heard from persons who know it, it would appear to be very easy country for the purposes of railway survey and construction. A very large England, area of the country is comparatively flat, and is not covered with scrub to any great extent, so that the cost of survey should not be very great. I believe that the Government will be prepared to give the assurance for which we ask.",23
121,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Hear , hear.",23
122,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There should, I think, Departbe no objection to the proposal if we have an assurance from the Government that they will make it a condition precedent to the survey that a favourable reply shall be received from the States Governments to a communication requesting them to guarantee the reservation of a certain area of land on each side of the line.  less it is put in the Bill?",23
123,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I fail to see how we can put it in the Bill, as we have no power under the Constitution to control the lands of the States, and further, until the survey is made, we should not be in a position to plot the lands which ought to be reserved.. Western Australia is practically cut off from the Commonwealth under existing circumstances as effectually as if it were an island, and I agree with the general contention of Western Australian representatives in this connection.  mania, which is also cut off?",24
124,Mr SPENCE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We may probably later on have a service of - flying machines; ! to provide communication with Tasmania. I have no doubt that the States would give the guarantee suggested, because we have the assurance that Western Australia has acted upon the principle, and the honourable member for Perth tells us that the Western Australian Government has already refused to allow a syndicate to take up land on the route of this very line. If the States Governments are prepared to give the assurance to which I have referred, I see no objection to the measure.",24
125,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I hope honourable members will forgive me', if I make a few observations on this question, about which I frankly admit that I feel very strongly. We were told during a previous debate that a distinct bargain had been made in connection with this particular matter. I have seen no official confirmation of any such bargain. Although some of the people of Western Australia may have been induced to vote for the Federal Constitution Bill on grounds other than the provisions contained in it. and for reasons other than were put forward in the rest of the States, this House is not bound by the arguments used there by the advocates of the Bill. But if we pass the measure now before us, we shall be committed to the construction of the proposed railway, probably at no distant date. It may be that its construction will be postponed, because of an unfavorable report, but, in agreeing to the survey, we are committing ourselves to a first step towards the construction of the line, which we shall not be able to retrace. In mv opinion, the only justification for considering the proposal at the present juncture is that it will provide a means of defence. I do not think that the alleged advantages to be obtained by a quicker carriage of mails should weigh with us at all. But, even so far as defence is concerned, I feel that there are many other ways in which - the money could be more advantageously expended. The two States most concerned are South Australia and Western Australia. We have had very strong representations of the opinion of the people of Western Australia in regard to the proposal, but the opinion of the people of South Australia has not been nearly so strongly expressed here.  railway.",24
126,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is my opinion.,24
127,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is because they wish to see the railway to the Northern Territory constructed first.,24
128,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Judgin g by the reports which I have read, and the speeches which I have heard in this Chamber, the representatives of South Australia are not keen about this proposal.",24
129,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What South Australian members have spoken against it?,24
130,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,-The honourable member for Barker said there was no immediate hurry and no great desire for the line in South Australia.,24
131,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No .,24
132,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Well, the honourable member will not deny that the honourable member for Barker was lukewarm in regard to the proposal.",24
133,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,He is not hostile to the construction of the line.,24
134,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I have not said that the representatives of South Australia are hostile to the construction of the line; but they are not keen about it.,24
135,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is what the honourable member says now; but he conveyed the impression at first that they are hostile. As a matter of fact, nearly all the representatives of South Australia are very favourable to the project.",24
136,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is very different from being strong advocates of it. Mr. O'Connor, in paragraph 26 of his report, saysDuring its construction very considerable benefi'j would accrue to several of the States of the Commonwealth, and more especially to Western Australia and South Australia, through the supply of various materials required for construction works, and also food for the men engaged, including increase in revenue of railwavs by carriage of same over the local lines. I think that that will be generally admitted. If the representatives of South Australia are not strong and strenuous advocates of the line, it behoves the representatives of other States, which will not benefit so directly, to pause before agreeing to the tremendous outlay proposed. Mr. O'Connor estimated that the cost of rails, connexions, points, and so on, will be about Xr,155,000, and the total expenditure £,4,600,000. He assumes that an average speed of forty miles an hour will be maintained by the trains, and he allows for the use of 60-lb. rails. I do not set myself up as a railway expert, but I know that it has been the experience of Victoria that heavy trains cannot safely be run at an express speed on 60-lb. rails. If we use such rails, and the traffic proves to be heavy, we shall be faced almost immediately with the necessity of spending a great deal more money to improve the line.",24
137,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Mr O'Connor recommended heavier rails than 60-lb. rails.,25
138,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes ; but that would make the cost much greater than £1,155,000. As the weight of rails is increased their price increases considerably.",25
139,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But it pays to use heavy rails.,25
140,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"When the traffic is sufficiently heavy to justify their use, because, where light rails are used for heavy traffic, the cost of maintenance is enormous. Honourable members are asked to believe that the total cost of the line will be about yC4)6oo,ooo, but if they take into consideia- liament ? tion the nature of the permanent way that is provided for, and the fact that heavy trains are to be run over the line at high rates of speed, they will see that that estimate would soon be exceeded.",25
141,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,No ; the actual cost would be less. Mr O'Connor took the longer route.,25
142,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member for Perth alluded to the fact that the railway would traverse what is to a large extent unknown territory.,25
143,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not unknown territory. Every inch of it is known.,25
144,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then the statements of two of the representatives of Western Australia in regard to it are contradictory.,25
145,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It s capabilities are largely unknown.,25
146,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In paragraph 23 of the report it is stated that, even on the moderate estimate of cost which has been made, the Commonwealth will have to bear for some years an annual loss of £28,000. Mr. O'Connor goes on to sayBut this result would no doubt improve in the course of time, such being the history of railways all over the world. I am not prepared to commit the Commonwealth to a huge expenditure upon the prospect of such an improvement.",25
147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In the case of ordinary railways, .the estimate of cost may be increased by 50 per cent., and that of the revenue decreased by a similar proportion.",25
148,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Eve n at a moderate estimate of the cost of construction and maintenance, we have to face an inevitable deficit of £28,000 per annum for a series of years. I would ask honourable members to remember what took place when we were discussing the expenditure that would be involved if a dissolution took place. The opinion was then expressed that one of the first considerations should be economy, and, if honourable members cast their memories back still further, they will remember that we agreed without demur to a proposition that we should go before the electors at the same time as the members of the Senate, in order to save the cost of a second election. In the face of these facts, how are we going to justifv an expenditure which is so unwarranted at the present time, and which would go so far towards minimizing the benefit conferred upon the Commonwealth by our previous action in this Par",25
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"£20,00 0 is a terribly large amount.",25
150,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The right honourable gentleman is accustomed ,'to deal with enormous sums in a fashion with which other Ministers are unfamiliar. Fortunately for him, he was backed up by a substantial majority of the people of his State, and I admit that he expended large sums of money to the greatest advantage. However, as I am opposed to borrowing, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and I do not consider it advisable to impose direct taxation, I cannot follow the right honourable gentleman in treating lightly the expenditure of even £20,000. The honourable member for Darling told us that under the Constitution we could exercise no control over the land along the route of the proposed line, and upon that ground he based his opposition to any proposal to engraft upon the Bill a provision that the States should first agree to certain reservations of land. I would' suggest, however, that we surely have the right to make conditions in respect to the expenditure of a large sum of money upon such a work as that contemplated.",25
151,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Any excuse is good enough, if the honourable member objects to the proposal.",26
152,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That may be the view of the honourable member, but I take very much higher ground than he supposes. It has been proposed that we should take over the debts of the States, and it is possible that prior to assuming their responsibilities in that regard, we shall make it a condition that they shall hand over the control of the railways to the Commonwealth.",26
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They are not likely to hand them over.,26
154,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If we could make a tion upon the subject? condition of that kind, surely we could provide that the land along the route of the proposed railway should he vested in the my mind. Commonwealth.",26
155,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We shall require to a much better Federal spirit evinced before the States entrust any more concerns to the Commonwealth.,26
156,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable for Perth told us that the experience of Western Australia in. connection with the construction of railways had been so fortunate that he did not think that it would undertake any further works of that de scription.,26

158,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I beg the honourable member's pardon. I misunderstood his marks. The Western Australian Governcircumstances ment could not reasonably object to a proit viso such as that indicated.,26

160,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I believe that this is the proper time to make the condition. would be of no use for us to wait until the work had been commenced or completed. It must be remembered that no fixed sum for Darling. of money has been allocated to cover the cost of the survey, and that in the past is that estimates in connection with works of this kind are very frequently exceeded. If the work were in progress, country. and it were found that £20,000 was not sufficient, the Government would have no compunction about asking for a further sum of, say, £10,000 or £20,000. After havand ing committed ourselves to the expenditure of the first amount, we could scarcely avoid making the additional appropriation necessary for the completion of the work. During a recent debate frequent reference was made to the ultimate aims of a certain party in this House We must not lose sight of the aims of those honourable members who are in favour of the proposed survey. Their aim is the construction of the line, and those honourable members who do not believe in that are fully justified in opposing the proposed survey.",26
161,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If our advocacy is not justified, the survey will demonstrate it.",26
162,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I desire to know what (he survey will prove.,26
163,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member would not oppose the construction of the railway until he had the fullest informa,26
164,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I already have quite sufficient information to enable me to make up r Surely the honourable member will allow me to be the judge as to what is see sufficient in that particular regard.,26
165,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There is nothing in the proposal for the benefit of the electors of Laanecoorie; 'that is the secret of the honmember orable member's opposition.,26
166,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I shall take no notice of that suggestion. What is the survey to unprove? According to one honourable member,- we do not know this country j but, so far as we can judge from the reports, it is : a waterless waste. The right honourable member for Swan tells us that the country is thoroughly well known, and that it has already been surveyed, whilst other honourable members state that we know nothing abont it. Honourable members have eviredently shaped their arguments to fit the as they have arisen. When is suggested that a substantial area of land should be reserved along the proposed route, we are told by some honourable members that the land is absolutely worthlessI t that it is a desert.",26
167,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Who said that ?,26
168,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member  our experience people had said so.,26
169,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Darling has not been over the Mr.'SALMON - The right honourable member for Swan tells us' that the railway line will pass through magnificent country, that fine stretches of rolling downs will I be opened up by the line. Sir JOHN' FORREST - That is quite correct, and if the honourable member will look at Mr Muir's report he will see that statement borne out.",26
170,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think that we shall be thoroughly justified in postponing, at any rate for a period, the survey of the proposed line, and especially its construction. The honourable member for Newcastle made a most valuable suggestion, and I am glad that the Minister of Home Affairs has already intimated that it is the intention of the Government to adopt it. I desire to make another suggestion. I hope that if it is decided to construct the railway, provision will be made for the adoption of the method which has proved so beneficial in Victoria, namely, the butty-gang system. We have had a number of light railways constructed in Victoria",27
171,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I would remind the honourable member that we are not now dealing with the question of construction, but of survey.",27
172,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I hope that, as the result of the survey, the Government will take means to provide, not only against the exploitation of the lands along the line of route, but also that the construction shall be carried out under Government supervision upon the system which has proved so successful in Victoria. In the past we have suffered severely as the result of the enormous profits which have been wrung, from nearly all the States by contractors",27
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We do not suffer from that nowadays.,27
174,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We do. I trust that further large sums will not be thrown away in that direction. I hope that a clause will be inserted in this Bill providing for the reservation of the lands upon each side of the proposed railway. If the surve-"" be carried out I trust that it will be conducted as economically as possible, and that Parliament will not be subsequently asked to provide a further sum of money to complete a work which a considerable section of this House deems both inadvisable and inopportune.",27
175,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Grampians). - I could understand the speech of the honourable member for Laanecoorie if it had been delivered after the proposed trial survey had been made. He affirms that he has obtained sufficient information' to warrant him in deciding against a survey of the route of projected railway. Where he has derived that information I cannot even conjecture. At first I was disposed to think that there was no justification for a survey of the line, but the more I looked into the matter the more I became convinced that there were sufficient grounds to warrant it being undertaken. I have read reports which state that there are millions of acres of grassy land along the probable route of the line. I have perused the report of the right honourable member for Swan upon the country to the south, and I have also snidied the accounts furnished by Mr. Muir and others. According to these authorities there are millions of acres of grassy land along the probable route of the line, and that fact seems to me at least to justify further investigation. As I stated on a previous occasion, unless the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie possesses better possibilities than at first sight present themselves, I shall not vote for the-construction of the line. My fears are n6t only on account of the character of the land, but also on account of the want of the water. Apparently the representatives of Western Australia think that there will be sufficient justification for the construction of the line if the fact be established that good land exists between Port Augusta and the Western Australian border, even though ;here may not be any prospect of a large traffic upon' it. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Laanecoorie should twit the right honourable member for Swan with talking lightly about the expenditure of millions of pounds. Some men can handle millions sterling better than others can handle pence, and, seeing that the right honourable member has always justified any large expenditure for which he is responsible, I think that we ought to seriously regard his views upon this question instead of jeering at them. Honourable members have repeatedly jeered at the right honourable member for Swan for declaring that he had expended millions of pounds, whilst acknowledging in the same breath that he had spent those millions well. Verv early in the debate the right honourable member declared that he believed this line would pay, and that he made the statement fully conscious of the fact that he had a reputation to lose. Of course we may say that he is interested in Western Australia.",27
176,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Is that an argument whichshould appeal to this House?,27
177,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"-The objections which are the now being urged against the Transcontinental Railway were urged in opposition to the Coolgardie water scheme, which is paying handsomely today.",27
178,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I recollect my father telling me that in the early days of Victoria he was able to lead his horse over what are now grassy plains without putting his foot upon a solitary blade of verdure. The fact that there are millions of acres of grassy land, some of it timbered, upon the probable route of the proposed line indicates that there is a .possibility of obtaining water at no very great depth. To my mind, the proposed survey should be one of an exploratory character, and especially so in regard to the supply of water. I understand that to the north of the Great Australian Bight there is a stretch of limestone country where water can be obtained only at a very great depth, if at all. That is the chief difficulty which has to be confronted. A thorough search should be made for water, as the survey progresses.  for Swan says that he can conserve water along the route.",28
179,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wate r may be obtained from certain catchment areas, but I have grave doubt about it, because I understand that it soaks away very rapidly. As the survey proceeds, I am of opinion that efforts should be made to obtain water by sinking. The country to be traversed is of limestone formation, and is not likely to prove rich in minerals. I am heartily in sympathy with the idea that the land upon each side.of the line for a reasonable distance should be reserved.  honourable member be prepared to take in a private syndicate formed for the purpose of consttucting this line?",28
180,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have never had anything to do with the construction, of railways. The honourable member for Corangamite said that a century hence, when population has been settled upon the country which the line will traverse, it will be time enough to undertake its construction. To my mind, that is not the way to develop our resources. If he had visited America he would know that the railways there are pushed out from the various centres, and that settlement follows. Under the landgrant system there, it. is customary to give those persons who undertake the construction of railways every alternate block, It is idle to say to the people, "" Go out into the interior and live there as best you can for some years, and then we will construct a railway."" Tbat is not exhibiting an enterprising spirit. country which the proposed line would traverse proves to be of good quality, and if water can be found along the route, we shall have some justification for constructing it. That is my reason for voting for the second reading of this measure. If the survey does not disclose that the land is worth opening up, and likely to be able to support a population, I shall not be disposed to go any further.",28
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And if the survey is favourable, is the honourable member prepared to vote for the construction of the railway immediately?",28
182,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If a sufficient supply of water is available, and if the country proves to be of good quality, I shall be prepared to support the construction of the line within a reasonable period. Under such circumstances, I shall be obliged to take into consideration the fact that there is a large gold-field at Kalgoorlie, and that the competition by sea cannot be so keen as it otherwise would be, because goods intended - for that centre have first to be transported to Perth, and then forwarded by rail for a distance of 400 miles east. There is, first of all, the gold-fields population, which is likely to be employed for the next fifty years in opening up those fields, and if in addition to that fact the report of the survey party shows that there is. good country to be developed and that a water supply is available, I shall feel justified, but not otherwise, in voting for the line. The report might show that there is good grazing or agricultural country along the line of route, but unless it also sets forth that water could be obtained at a reasonable depth to aid in developing the country I should not vote for the construction of the railway.",28
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But this Bill makes no provision for testing the water supply.,28
184,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should like to ask the Minister of Home Affairs if provision will be made in that direction. It has been suggested that the mineral resources of the country should receive attention, but while that is undoubtedly a very important matter, it is still more important that the water supply should be tested. If the land itself were ever so suitable for grazing or agricultural purposes, it would be valueless without a proper water supply.",28
185,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,To what extent does the honourable member suggest that tests should be made? Does he proI f the pose that bores should be put down? . Mr SKENE - Bore s should be put down at likely places along the route.,28
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But the total cost would have to be kept within £20,000.",29
187,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The survey will be of very little value to the advocates of the line, unless it shows that the country is good and that water is available. I do not know whether the Minister has any faith in the divining rod, but from some information which I have received lately I am inclined to attach some importance to its use. Some of my friends have employed it with very successful results. In any event, steps should be taken to test the water supply, either by putting down bores, or in some other effective way. I certainly intend to support the proposal outlined by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. ' We should have some indication from the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia that they are prepared to reserve the land along both sides of the line. If the land is fit to be opened up by a railway, it is only reasonable that the Commonwealth should re- 1 ceive some benefit from it.",29
188,Mr CULPIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I voted against the introduction of this measure solely for the reason that I considered it premature, and I am afraid that I shall have to vote against the Bill itself, even though it be amended as suggested. The time is hardly ripe for the making of a survey,'but no one can say that it would be premature, at this stage,, to give effect to thesuggestion, made by the honourable and learned member, for Parkes, that, the land along both sides of the proposed route should be reserved. That is a most necessary and .reasonable precaution to take. The sooner the possibility that this land may berequired is provided for the better it will be. We have already adopted a somewhat similar course in , dealing with the lands required for the purposes of the Federal Capital, by providing, in the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act, that land acquired by the Commonwealth shall be assessed at its value on. the ist January preceding the date of acquisition. In these circumstances, I think it would be .well to provide in this Bill for the reservastruction tion of the land on both sides of the line. Mr DUGALD THOMSON:-The Bill providing for the construction of the line would be the proper one in which to make such a provision.",29
189,Mr CULPIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not agree with the honourable gentleman. I hold that it should be inserted in the measure now before us. We made provision for the valuation of the land to be acquired for the purposes of the Federal Capital before we had actually 1 decided upon the site of the capital, and I think that we may well provide in this Bill for the reservation of the land along the route of the projected railway. I shall sup1 port the honourable member for New England in any proposal he may make in that direction, believing that in doing so I shall assist in improving the Bill, and that the time is opportune to take such action. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I think that the House owes a debt of. gratitude to the honourable and learned member for Parkes for the splendid suggestion that steps should be taken to secure the reservation of the land along the projected route, because the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to pay for the construction of the railway. The cost will fall, not upon any one member of the community, but upon the whole of the people of the States. Great corporations often secure millions of acres of land on both, sides of lines of railways, and, locking it up for centuries, prevent settlement along them. If a private corporation were to obtain a. grant of land on each side of this projected railway, the country would probably not be populated for a hundred years. The land would be locked up, just as is the case along some of the railways, in the United States of America.. I . should oppose the selling of the land,, but if the suggestion ma'de by thei honourable and learned member for Parkes were acted upon, the Commonwealth would be able, by selling the land, to recoup itself in respect of the cost of carrying out the survey, and constructing the. Una Unless I were prepared to vote for the. building of the railway, I should not vote for the making of the survey.,",29
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is the proper position to take up. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No honourable member has a right to pledge the revenue of the State which he represents in this way unless he is prepared to vote for the conof the line if the survey shows that it would be a legitimate investment. I am bound to say, from what I have heard from the right honourable member for Swan - wb o is perhaps the greatest explorer now in the Southern Hemisphere-^that I think the line would be a good investment. Every honourable member who proposes to vote for this Bill must not let ft be a salve to his conscience' that he will not do anything further towards the carrying out of this work. The suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Parkes gives me a clearer view of the position than I previously had. am amazed that I did not think of it myself. It only shows that the honourable and learned member is in a fair way to become a real genuine Socialist, and as a Socialist I hope to follow him. If the report of the' survey party be such as to legitimately recommend the construction of the line, what will be the next step ? The five representatives of Western Australia in this 'House, although they may be divided on some political issues, are united on this.",29
191,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This is not solely a Western Australian matter. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - The representatives of Western Australia are pushing it forward. If it were not for them it would be dead.,30
192,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And the people of South Australia are with us.,30
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The building of the line would not have been thought of but for Western Australia. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It is the Western Australian representatives who have brought this question to its present prominent position. It is their battling and their buttonholing-thei r declarations that if honourable members did not vote for this railway they might as well clear out of Parliament-that have made this Bill possible today. As soon as this survey has shown that the railway ought to be built, what will be the next move on the chess-board? The five Western Australian representatives will be all over the various rooms of Parliament House - in the streets, and all over the place-praisin g to the very heavens the glorious opportunity now presented to build this railway to their State. And an honourable member who refuses to support the line will find an organization'as strong as a Japanese army to upset all his calculation. I shall positively be afraid to go into the Labour Party's room.",30
194,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Nonsense ! Talk sense! Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member for Hindmarsh is capable of nothing but sense, whereas I . may have been born without any. What I do know is that for the last three years I have heard nothing f roni the five members of Western Australia but the merits of this line-whereve r I went, upstairs or downstairs, I had to listen to the same story. Those honourable members may disagree on other matters, but they are absolutely united, as to the necessity for this line. Why should the Commonwealth not I have grants of land in the same way as have private corporations?",30
195,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Le t the honourable member take care that he does not play into the hands of the Opposition. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That interjection is all very fine. When we are spending the people's money, we ought not to think of Opposition, Government, or anybody else, but only of those who sent us here.",30
196,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We have only the right to do what is right. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is so. I shall vote for this Bill, but on condition that a clause such as that suggested by the honourable and learned member for Parkes is inserted, so that the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia may be called upon to set apart a certain width of. land on each side of the line. Such a provision would enable Tasmania to get back the money which is taken from the people of that State for the. purposes of this railway. What interest have the people of King Island, or of Tasmania generally, in this railway? Of course, when we raise the question of sentiment, or point to the necessity for military protection against outside aggression, Tasmania is interested. I do not desire to take up much time in discussing this matter, but merely to put myself right in the eyes of the public. The Bill should provide that private corporations and private "" land sharks "" and other "" boom boosters,"" should not be allowed to tie up land, and then demand immense compensation from the Commonwealth before the line can be constructed.",30
197,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I am very pleased to hear the good sound socialistic views expressed by the honourable and learned member for Parkes-to hear that he is of opinion that a certain area of territory on each side of this proposed railway ought to be held by the State. But the question which we have before us just now is whether we shall have a survey made in order to decide as to the wisdom, or otherwise, of constructing the line. The time to impose conditions is after .we have come to an affirmative decision. If the result of the survey does not satisfy me, I am not going to vote for the construction of a railwav to Western Australia. I am thoroughly satisfied, however, from what I country, that the survey party will be able to report that there is every .justification entering on this enterprise. As to preservthan ing the country from getting into the hands of speculators, I would point out that for several years it was the policy of the South Australian Government that there should be no alienation of Crown land. Under resolution of the Parliament of that State, not a foot of land was alienated for years. Unfortunately, about two years ago, a reactionary Government came into power in South Australia-thoug h I feel satisfied that that Government will be 'comno pelled to resign office in a very few months. There are decided indications that the same forward movement we have witnessed in other States will also be witnessed in Westfield ern Australia; and should that prove to the case, we may depend that the policy to which I have referred will come of gold up tp date. into operation. At the present time, in Western Australia, there is a Labour Government in power, and I feel quite sure that even if that Government leave office the labour section in the local Parliament will be sbrong enough to secure that justice is perpetrated on the community by tarded for two reasons. speculators. Under all the circumstances, I do not think we have anything to fear in that regard. Surely the honourable memown bers for Lang .and New England ought be quite satisfied that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to impose land am. taxation? The reason why a good many South Australians are opposed' to the conin struction of this line is their anxiety to first have a railway to the Northern Terable ritory.",30
198,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,How can the Comton. monwealth gather in land taxation?,31
199,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Commonwent wealth has power now to impose land taxation. There was an"" extraordinary proposal that the South Australian Government for should allow a private company to build railway to the Northern Territory, and rebetter ceive in exchange something like 75,000,000 acres, with all the minerals included.",31
200,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,In alternate blocks.,31
201,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It was a most unhas been proved. reasonable proposal, and I am satisfied that if the scheme had been carried out, the give Federal Parliament would very soon have imposed a land' tax in order to remove so glaring an injustice. This was one of the biggest offers of the kind ever made in history of the world ",31
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It was a monstrous know of the piece of ""boodling.""",31
203,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The proposal for was to hand over a tract of country larger Victoria and Tasmania combinedlarger than the whole of the United Kingdon.'-wit h all the minerals, in return for a "" shoddy "" line, which would allow of the passage of a train once a week, at the rate a of twenty miles an hour. No wonder the proposal did not meet with success, and I many am sure that the honourable and learned member for Parkes would have assisted to prevent such an iniquity. The honourable membei for Corangamite says that we have information which would justify the construction of this line. So far as South Australia is concerned, I am satisfied that if the line be built, more than one Tarcoola goldwill be discovered. At Tarcoola, one be mine alone has employed 300 men for years, and has turned out at least 50,000 ounces",31
204,Mr SALMON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Tarcool a has cost the Commonwealth a good deal of money alreadv.,31

207,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No ; a huge parcel has been proved. The honourable membei Grey can give all particulars, and show a that enormous samples have yielded much results than that. I can tell the honourable member that the mines are putting up a battery there, and are perfectly satisfied that it will pay handsomely. This country",31
208,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It must be good stuff to that result in that out-of-the-way place.,31
209,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"At the Mount Gunson copper-field, ninety-five miles from Port Augusta, thousands of tons of copper the have been taken out. I have seen numerous parcels sent down. A large profit has been made out of the field, notwithstanding the enormous freight for that distance, ninetyfive miles, over a sandy tract, and the freight thence to Port Adelaide, another distance of 300 miles. On that coppei-field many hundreds of thousands of tons of ore may be seen on the surface. Of course it is of low grade, but we all know that low-grade copper pays, so long as there is cheap means of transit. I have gone over the whole of the country up to the border of Western Australia, and much of it is splendid pastoral country. Unfortunately, it has experienced droughts, but then all Australia suffers periodically from droughts. When the seasons are good, as they now are, very large sums of money are spent in that country, and very large returns are received. I am perfectly satisfied that, so far as the South Australian portion is concerned, this railway would yield a handsome return. The honourable member for Laanecoorie said that the honourable member for Darling stated that the country to be traversed is a desert. Possibly, some persons believe that it is a desert. In South Australia, we have a large tract of country over which its representatives pass every week. For many years this country has been called a waterless desert, but it has been pioyed to be capable of growing almost anything. I am quite satisfied that a great proportion of the try which is believed to be desert in the two States, along the proposed route of this line, will be found to be, if not agricultural country, at any rate good pastoral countiy, and undoubtedly good mineral country. From the fact that he is supporting the proposal for a survey, I should take it that the honourable member for Darling does not. hold the opinion which has been attributed to him. It has been said that the land is not known. I.t is a remarkable fact that some time ago a private syndicate was prepared to build this line on the land grant system. It would be pretty careful to ascertain the nature of the country in which it proposed to invest the enormous sum lequired to build such a railway. There is no philanthropy about a syndicate, and the members of this syndicate were quite satisfied that they were going to have a very good thing on.",31
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Did they make a de finite commercial offer ?,32
211,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Undoubtedly , just as is done in connection with other schemes.",32
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Where is it? Why they is it not in evidence?,32
213,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is in evidence,32
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not here.,32
215,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I thoroughly agree that all possible information ought to be gleaned by the survey party, not only as to minerals, but also as to the water, and as to whether it can be obtained without expensive boring. I feel sure that the survey party would consider that to be part of .their duty, and as all that is now asked for is the expenditure of £20,000 to see whether there Cis any justification for building a railway which would be of advantage to the Commonwealth without being an unnecessarily heavy burden on the taxpayers, the proposal shall have n:y heartv support.",32
216,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I listened with considerable interest to the last speaker* The facts which he brought forward are rather convincing to me against the construction of the line. Knowing, as I do, the enterprise of the people of South Australia in undertaking the construction of the Port Darwin railway for a distance of 1,000 miles or more at their own expense, and learning from the honourable member about the wonderful mineral resources of the western part of that State, and the large area of agricultural land which is there available for settlement, it does seem to me a remarkable thing that they will not concoun- struct a railway through this country.",32
217,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But we are a very small population, with a heavy burden.",32
218,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member puts that forward as the reason. But, in reply, let me say that the people of South Australia will not allow the line to be constructed at the present time, even by the Commonwealth.",32
219,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,How does the honourable member know that?,32
220,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The people of South Australia are opposed to its construction. We know that there is sufficient evidence that the Government of the State has not given its assent to the survey of a route through its territory, and is opposed to the construction of a railway. 3",32
221,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It has never said so.,32
222,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the prospects, of a line 400 miles long were bright, from my knowledge of South Australia, which is much longer, I think, than that of the last speaker, and my personal knowledge of the men at the head of affairs, having been reared with them, I submit that would not be slow to give their consent to its construction at the expense of the Commonwealth.",32
223,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does not the honourable member know that it is because they in view a rival scheme?,33

Other leaders of his day advocated its tion, but no one could be found to take the enterprise. The honourable member - Hindmarsh has stated that a short time since a syndicate was prepared to construct this railway on the land grant system. Now, if it was a good thing for a syndicate, would it not be a much better thing for the State? His knowledge of human nature take ought to convince him that the promoters of a railway on the land grant system would be the "" first robbers."" They would do well out of it, and those who came afterwards might db very badly. The "" first robber always prepared to go in, so long as he gull and rob the public, but the people who bear the burden are those who afterwards suffer.

The honourable member for Hindmarsh has said that the syndicate would constructed a very indifferent kind of railway in South Australia. I am reminded by that observation that in South Australia from 'Terowie the railway is constructed on a narrow gauge, and that would necessitate another break of gauge. It is prothat a railway on a very narrow gauge would be constructed right through the desert country, causing a further break.",33
238,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,To what gauge does the honourable member refer?,34
239,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There is a 3 f t 6jn. gauge at Petersburg.,34
240,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We said nothing about the gauge ;- we left that to the Commonwealth to decide. Western Australia is satisfied to leave it to the Commonwealth to fix the' gauge.,34
241,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If a gauge of 4ft. 8Jin. were a'dopted for the line, that would involve another break of gauge.",34
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Where would break be ?,34
243,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There would be a break of gauge necessary at Terowie, and another at Petersburg, and there would to be another break of gauge at Augusta.",34
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member has made a mistake.,34
245,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so. II overlooked the fact that the line extends from Petersburg to Port Augusta, but there would be a break at Terowie, and at Port Augusta, and there would be another break between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Western Australia has had some experience of the land grant system. I have been over the line from Albany to Perth, country which is constructed on that systemthe chess-board plan-and at the time passed over it I know the whole talk scandal on the road was that although contracting company were granted nate blocks, they were allowed to the area, almost indefinitely, in any direcLands tion, so long as they did not take more than the aggregate area allowed under the terms of construction. I can see no force in the suggestion that land along the prohas posed line should be reserved for the benefit of the Commonwealth. Assuming that the land was reserved by the States Governgoverned ments for the benefit of the Commonsome wealth, let me remind the honourable but member for Hindmarsh that when a reactionary Government, such as - the honourable member referred to, came into power, it might set aside the reunless servation and sell the land. That has done in all parts of Australia before, it might be done again. In such circumof stances, honourable members will see that there would be no safeguard in the reserspend vation proposed. If land is to be reserved in the way proposed for the benefit Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is to be recouped its expenditure on the railIn way from that land, would it not be better that the States should construct the railway, keep the land themselves, and recoup themselves from it? If this proposal is such a good thing, and the resources of the country are so great as to warrant the expenditure necessary for the construction of this line, the States could keep the land and recoup themselves for their outlay on the line. Does the honourable and learned member for Parkes propose that the Government of the Commonwealth should acquire land and set up a Crown lands administration in comthe petition with the States?",34
246,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We could easily make it a condition that after the railway is constructed Western Australia should sell have these lands and recoup the Commonwealth Port to the extent of their value.,34
247,Mr HENRY WILLIS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable and learned member evidently was not listening to my remarks, or he would know that have already dealt with that phase of the question. If this proposal is such a good thing, and the' expenditure could be recouped from these lands, I ask why the States should not themselves construct the railway? Honourable members must be aware that it is because the undertaking is too hazardous, and because they know the much better than we do, that they are not prepared to incur the heavy loss I which they know would be entailed, and and prefer to experiment at the exthe pense of the whole Commonwealth. I say alterthat it is not advisable that we extend should have a Commonwealth Crown Department in competition with those of the States until we have reached the stage of unification which is looked forward to by some honourable members. Something been said with respect to the land system which should be enforced in the Federal Capital. I think it will have to be by a special Act of Parliament, form of local government measure, I have no wish to introduce a discussion upon that question. I repeat that, as a business man, I would not undertake lo expend £20,000 on the survey of this line I were prepared to go the full length been of spending £5,000,000 on its construcand tion. I am supported in the view I take the matter by the right honourable member for Swan, who has said that if we the £20,000 on the survey we should complete the construction of the line. of the Mr MALONEY (Melbourne) - I wish to say a few words in regard, to this matter. the first place, I differ from the honourable member for Laanecoorie in the view which he takes of the proposed railway a means of defence. In my opinion, parallished lel steel rails are the chief factors in warfare. I think that the railways of the Continent should be under the complete and dominating control of the Federal Govern the ment. 1 approve, too, of the suggestion the that a reservation should be made on each interest, side of the proposed line, though I admit metals-the the difficulty of getting the two States which are chiefly concerned to agree to set apart sentative a strip fifty miles wide, that is, twenty-five miles on each side of the rails. If such a reservation were guaranteed, I should vote for the construction of the railway. Inasquently, much as Western Australia at the present culation time is the largest gold-producing State the Commonwealth, it would have been a from gracious act on the part of the Govern the ment of the State to suggest to the Treanotes surer of the Commonwealth that the sum rethem quired for the proposed survey should be deducted from the Customs duties otherwise freely returnable to it. If they put an export duty upon their gold, they could easily raise the money themselves. Western Australia is the specially privileged State in the annual union. However, I have risen chiefly to years show that the proposed railway could be . aand constructed without costing the Commonto wealth a single penny piece. The island f of Guernsey, as honourable members are no doubt aware, is not a dependency of the Empire, but an allied State, because Channel Islands were never conquered Gieat Britain. In 1823 the people of Guernsey wished to build a market-place, but, as in those days borrowing was not easy as it is now, it was determined to issue £1 notes with which to pay the brickmakers, stonemasons, and other artisans employed in the construction, and they, together with the contractors and shopkeepers, agreed accept those notes as ordinary legal tender. The market was built, and each year, as the rents were collected, so many of the notes were recalled and burned, and at the end ten years the people had a splendid rentwish pi oducing property, the construction of which had cost them nothing in interest, only financial charge being the expense printing the notes. That system of payevery ment for public works still prevails in those islands. If the people require a water mill, they do not borrow money at high rates of interest to pay for its construction, but they issue notes such as I have deare scribed. . As late as March of this year note issued in connection with their education system was recalled and burnt. Mr James Mr Maloney. as Harvey, in his work on paper money, pubin London in 1877, has written of the modern Guernsey transaction in these wordsThe States of Guernsey having determined to build a meat market, voted ^'4,000 to defray cost. The market notes were guaranteed by whole property of the island, said to be worth ;£4,ooo,ooo sterling. These notes did not bear any nor were they convertible into the precious y were tokens, not possessing any intrinsic value, but only that conventional or reprevalue which they received from the authority ot the States by which they were issued. They were the symbols of the real money of the island. They were worthless to any other community than Guernsey, and, therefore, there was no inducement to, their exportation. Consethey remained permanently in local cirfor local purposes. They were inscribed in ""Guernsey Meat Market Notes,"" and numbered 1 to 4,000, each note representing £ 1 in currency of the island. They were legal tender by the authority of the States. With these the States paid the contractor, and with the contractor paid his workmen, and all who supplied him with materials. They were taken by tradesmen for goods, by landlords for rent, by the authorities for taxes. In du; season the Market House was completed, rand the butchers' stalls, with some public rooms constructed over them, were let for the total rental of ^400. At the expiration of ten all the notes were received by the States cancelled, but the meat market has returned clear annual revenue to the Stales, and continue!! afford accommodation without having cost a ai thing in taxes to any citizen of the States. If a tract of country fifty miles wide were reserved, that would give a good security the for a similar Commonwealth note issue, by while behind that security would be the guarantee of the Commonwealth Government. In the event of some such method so of raising money as that being followed, my vote would gladly be given for the proposed work. At the present time, however, the proposal absolutely stinks in the nostrils of a great number of persons in Victoria, to who ask, ""Why should the Commonwealth go to this great expense?"" The adoption of the method of financing the undertaking which I have suggested would disarm criof ticism, and is worthy of consideration. I to pay my meed of praise to a gentleman who does not wish his name to be made the known, who has gathered together books on of financial subjects which are absent from library in Australia. They are books which contain doctrines opposed to the established methods of capital, and have disappeared from the Parliamentary Library and from the Free Public Library, while they not obtainable in any other of our puba lic libraries. The American people have only just in time rescued from oblivion the narrative of the building of the Guernsey meat market, which I have read. 1I have suggested cannot be carried out, I think that the Government of Western Australia might allow the Commonwealth to pay the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 required for the proposed survey out of the Customs revenue otherwise returnable to the State.",34
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," The matter now under discussion is one which should be considered quite apart from any party spirit. The question of constructing a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States has been under discussion for many years-prio r to the time that Fremantle superseded Albany as the first port of call for the English mail steamers. Many years ago I succeeded in persuading the Parliament of New South Wales to pass resolutions in favour of extending a railway from Cobar to Wilcannia and Broken Hill , and I gave as one of the reasons for advocating the construction of the line that it would probably form portion of a line which would be carried right through to Western Australia. I have seen no reason to change the opinion I then held. In fact, the developments which have since taken place in connection with Federation have strengthened my belief that a line such as that now projected should be constructed. I know that a large number of persons, especially in Victoria and South Australia, are opposed to the construction of the li;:e, but I cannot conceive upon what grounds. shall unhesitatingly vote in favour of what I believe to be a great national work. has been said that the prospective traffic would not warrant the construction of such a railway. That might be said in nine cases cut of ten ; but as the country becomes opened up, and large centres of population are connected by rail, the traffic increases, until ultimately, in most cases, the revenue returns become satisfactory. In many places traffic cannot be developed unless a railwayis constructed ",36
249,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Coul d honourable member quote a case similar to that now under consideration?,36
250,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"This is an exceptional case. If it were not so, I should not advocate the construction of the railway as a national work. If it were proposed merely for the development of any one State I should throw the responsibility of its construction upon the persons directly interested. I heard all the discussions which took place at the Federal Convention with regard to 'bringing Western AusI f what tralia into the Federation, and I have no hesitation in saying that it was fully anticipated, and practically concurred in, that the proposed railway connection should be made.",36
251,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,B y the Commonwealth.,36
252,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . At that particular time the great object in view was to induce Western Australia to join the Federal union, and there can be no thorough union between that State and her eastern sisters - until railway communication is established.",36
253,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then if Western Australia had insisted upon the construction of the railway being agreed to, there is no doubt that would have been conceded ?",36
254,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have not the slightest doubt that if a resolution had been submitted committing the Commonwealth to the construction of the railway it would have been carried. I have very little doubt that the proposed railway will pay, because many of the passengers arriving here from Great Britain and other parts of the world in the steamers which make Fremantle their first port of call would doubtless be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity to save two or three days by making the overland journey from Fremantlei across to Sydney or Brisbane, or other parts of the eastern States. In the same way, passengers leaving Australia for London could also effect a great saving of time by makI ing the overland journey from Melbourne or Sydney-perhap s to a greater extent It from Sydney than from Melbourne-and I ' fully believe that a large percentage would join the steamer at Fremantle, instead of going round by sea.",36
255,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The experience gained in connection with Adelaide does not justify that impression. Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - Adelaid e does not bear quite the same relation to the other States as Fremantle would if the propcsed railway were constructed. One matthe ter which has an important bearing upon the question of the cost of maintaining the railway is the saving in time that would be effected by the carriage of the English mails overland from Fremantle to the eastern States. If two or three days could be saved in that way the public convenience would be promoted, and the desire of the community for the speediest possible means of communication between Australia and Great Britain would be, in some degree, attained. I cannot understand the attitude assumed by one or two honourable members. The honourable member for Robertson is opposed to the project, but I would point out that no portion of New South Wales would derive greater benefits than would the district represented by the honourable member from the construction of a railway to connect Fremantle with Sydney. mously increased traffic would pass through Dubbo and Cobar. It seems to me that the honourable member was speaking absolutely against the interests of his own constituents and of the people of New South Wales.",36
256,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable member mean that the traffic should be veyed right across to Sydney without ing through Adelaide?,37
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I believe that great portion of the traffic would be carried to Sydney via Broken Hill and Cobar.,37
258,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Only the Sydney portion.,37
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member for Boothby must not suppose that, in dealing with matters of national importmeans of communication available. ance, Adelaide or any other part of Ausmake tralia is to be specially considered.",37

261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I quite agree with the honourable member. just now, had I been supported as I should have been many years ago, railway combeen munication would have been extended to Broken Hill long before this, and ninething tenths of the traffic which now passes projected through Adelaide would have been conveyed fluence my vote. to Sydney.",37
262,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Would that tion have been of any advantage to Australia?,37

264,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What is the character of that country?,37

268,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member 'refers to the country nearest to the borders of New South Wales. An enor- Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I refer to the country bordering upon New South Wales and extending for two-thirds of the distance to Port Darwin. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Parramatta should oppose the construction of the railway. The coal mining industry at Lithgow, in his electorate, would derive especial conbenefit from the construction of a railpassway to Broken Hill , because a large quantity of coal would be hauled to meet a the requirements of the population inland. Then, again, huge forests of some of the best timber in New South Wales are to be found almost adjacent to the present terminus of that line. There are vast forests of ironbark which would be used for mining and other purposes if there were any I these remarks to justify my action in connection with that railway. Upon two I succeeded in passing measures authorizing its construction through the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales; As I said but both of these were rejected by the LegislativeCouncil. Some reference has made to the break of gauge. I must admit thati f it is proposed to adopt any-. save the 4 f t . 8|in. gauge upon the line, it will very materially in That is the standard gauge of the world, and I have no hesitain saying that if we construct this railway upon the 3 f t . 6in. gauge, it will prove a failure.

This Bill contemplates only a preliminary' vote for the purpose of ascertaining the reof a trial survey. When that survey has been completed, we shall have an opof limestone. portunity to discuss the question of the gauge which we shall adopt.",37
272,Sir LANGDON BONYTHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The able member realizes that the 4ft. SJin. gauge is neither that of Victoria nor of South Australia?,38

I should not have known so much about this country had it not been for the fact that some years ago, in conjunction with several others, I contemplated taking up a large portion of it. We obtained a period. most authentic report upon a large area which the proposed railway would traverse, with a view to taking it up.",38

The result of such a policy would be to make this country three or four times as productive as it would be in the absence of communication. In that we may expect very much more in the can shape of a return than we can at present estimate. That return would also assist in of defraying the expense of constructing the proposed line.

Under these circumstances, I cannot see any reason why we should object to a trial survey of the railway being undertaken. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has foreshadowed an amendment providing for the reservation of the land on both sides of the projected line. do not think it would be wise to amend the Bill in that direction.

297,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"They have about twentv years to run. Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - I know that a considerable area has recently been leased. I certainly think it would be unwise .to make such an amendment as the honourable and learned member for Parkes suggests, because it might hamper, and, to some extent, frighten the Government of Western Australia.

298,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They have already put a stop to further leasing.,39
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That shows that they recognise the point which I have in mind. This, after all, is a small matter, so far as the future of the railway is concerned. The project affects, not only Western Australia, but the eastern States. If the line be constructed, it will doubtless lead to a large quantity of produce grown in Eastern Australia being sold along the route right through to Kalgoorlie. A wonderful development has taken place in Western Australia, and we have to look I to still greater developments. I do not know so much about the agricultural resources of the country. Doubtless they will be materially developed, but a great expansion in the mineral resources of that State will certainly take place. Another Kalgoorlie may not be discovered, but I have no doubt that rich belts of mineral country will be opened up. The construction of this railway would lead to the discovery and development of mineral tracts of country as yet unknown, and, in any event, every additional sovereign produced in any of the States must tend to the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. For these reasons I desire to emphasize my opinion that the Bill should not be trammelled in any way, but that it should be passed, as practically one step towards carrying out the moral undertaking entered into with the people of Western Australia before that State became part and parcel of the Commonwealth.",39
300,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I think that the question before us requires very serious consideration. The Bill makes absolutely no provision whatever for that examination of the country which many honourable members supporting the proposed survey believe to be necessary. It provides solely for an engineering survey. The terms of the Bill, so far as my reading of it goes, would absolutely prevent the expenditure of any moneys under it in securing reports on the resources of the country to be traversed, or in making tests to determine whether a water supply is available. If the engineering survey proves that which I take it is the object of the Bill-that a railway can be constructed between the given points-w e shall still be in exactly the same position as we occupy today, so far as our knowledge of the nature of the country and the possibilities of a permanent water supply is concerned. I am one of those who hold that this preliminary, atall events, is essentially a State matter. Before asking the Parliament of the Commonwealth to construct the railway the Government of Western Australia should have afforded us that information which many honourable members think should be in our possession.",39
301,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Eve n if they had done so, the honourable member would; have said that the information was biased ancl unbelieve trustworthy.",40
302,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should not. I believe that if the Government of Western Australia desired to obtain a report on the nature of the country to be traversed, would-jus t as the Government of any other State would do-secur e the services of competent, reliable men, and I certainly think it would be presumption on my to dare to challenge the reports of reliable experts.",40
303,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Severa l reports have already been placed before us by the State Government.,40
304,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have given those reports fair consideration, but they do not contain the information which 1, in common with many other honourable members, dethe sire. The one great need of the country be served by the railway is a water supply. The right honourable member for Swan is a position to give the House better Informaorable tion on a subject of this kind than perhaps are most other men in Australia. We know that for many years he was engaged in ploration work in Western Australh, and understand that his reports go to shew whilst the nature of the country is favourable to a considerable degree, there is no proof of anything like a permanent water supply of the railway. along the proposed line of route. I would ask the Minister, in reply, to tell the House, first of all, whether the money that we are about to vote will be sufficient to provide for an engineering survey, and also for the geowe logical survey that we believe is necessary, more particularly for the purpose of testing the water supply. Will the Bill, for exvocate ample, cover the cost of putting down bores Will it be possible for the Government, under the terms of the Bill, fo expend money on purposes other than that for which it expressly provides? These are fair quesa tions to put! to the Minister. I am not opposing this measure because of any direct personal hostility, either to the project self, or to the State of Western Australia, but I do think that at the present time, having regard to the financial position some at least of the States, it is our bounden duty to take every reasonable precaution before sanctioning expenditure on a work which must ultimately entail an outlay of, roughly speaking, £5,000.000.",40
305,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is what we are doing. 91,40
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am convinced that the representath es of Western Australia they are perfectly justified in urging the construction of the line, and at the same time. I believe that they do not object to all reasonable precautions being taken, and to proper tests being made in order that we it may determine whether the railway is an undertaking on which the Commonwealth should embark. I cannot believe that representatives of Western Australia desire part to plunge the Commonwealth into an expenditure of £5,000,000 on a railway unless they believe there will be some substantial return. That being the case, is it not advisable on their part to assist us in getting such information as will enable the Government to proceed with the work? I repeat that under the terms of the Bill it will not be possible to obtain the information on which the Government could ask House to sanction the construction of to this line. I refuse to believe that either the representatives of Western Australia, in the members of the Government, or honmembers who are supporting this Bill, believe 'that it is merely a sop-that we are going to spend £18,000 or £20,000 exand then allow the matter to drop. I am I quite certain that no honourable member that would advocate for a moment that we should undertake this survey unless we are prepared to proceed with the constructidn",40
307,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Whether the surveyor's report be good, bad, or indifferent?",40
308,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainl y not. I i take the honourable members most directly interested, in a proper sense, in this rail.way, I believe none would be found to adthe construction of the line unless ? the report prove satisfactory. If the report is satisfactory from an engineering standpoint, what will be our position ? We shall then have to pass a vote for the purpose of geological report, or such a report as will enable us, the engineering conditions being satisfactory, to decide whether the line is itwarranted. The Bill before us will not enable such a report to be obtained. I ask honourable members to read the Bill, and of then say whether it will enable the Governn.ent to expend even £100 in obtaining information such as I have indicated. Is there one honourable member who will say that £18,000 is sufficient to obtain a proper engineering survey, and also such a report on the nature of the country as we should have before undertaking a work of the kind ? Honourable members this afternoon have set the good example of short. speeches; but before I conclude I should like to briefly draw the attention of honourable members to the financial position of some of the States. Two of the States, at least, are very severely pressed, owing to the Federal Government not returning them a sufficient sum of money from the Customs revenue to enable them: to carry on the public administration as they would wish.",40
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Wester n Australia sends Tasmania, a good present every year. Mr MCWILLIAMS:- I am not blaming Western Australia, for obtaining terms beforeenteringthe Federation-that was only a reasonable precaution; My only regret is that the representatives of other States, were not sufficiently imbued with the precaution that the right honourable member for Swan, and those who acted with him, displayed in protecting the revenue of their State.",41
310,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The Western Australian people pay for the special terms they have.,41
311,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"And , therefore, they are entitled to all the revenue for - which they are prepared to tax themselves. The Federal. Government has almost reached the expenditure limit of 25 per cent, and if we embark on works of the character now under consideration we shall find the Government compelled to resort to direct taxation, because, very fortunately for some of the States, 75 per cent, of the Customs revenue must be returned for a few years longer. Unless we are prepared to face this question, and provide a sufficient sum to enable us to obtain all information, and then, if that informa-. ti'on is satisfactory, to proceed with the construction of the railway, we ought not to pass this Bill. If we do pass the measure, we should tell the people of Australia that we are doing so in good faith; and if the survey report is satisfactory, it is the bounden duty of the Government to give effect to the hcision of the House. I do not believe there is an honourable member who is deliberately attempting to fool the people of Western Australia, and if that be so, the work ought to be proceeded with in the event of a satisfactory report. That must be the result, unless we are deliberately passing this Bill merely to afford the people of Western Australia a barren satisfaction. Is the Federal Government, or the Parliament, or the States prepared to undertake at the present time, or even in a short time, an expenditure of ^£5,000,000 ot ;£6,000,000? I am one of those who believe that we are not prepared for that expenditure, and, in that belief, I shall have to vote against the Bill. But if the Bill be passed we should insert a provision such as has. been suggested by the honourable member for New England and the honourable and learned member for Parkes, to provide that there shall be at least some chance of the Commonwealth obtaining a return for the money expended. I was absent for. some little time this morning, attending a fruit conference, but I heard two or three honourable members from Western Australia say that they were prepared, and that they believed the people and Governmentof Western Australia were prepared, to make a land reservation along the line of railway, to be handed over to the Commonwealth.",41
312,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Not to be handed over to the Commonwealth, but to be preserved against speculation.",41
313,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then it is a case of ""Thank you for nothing."" I understand that South Australia was prepared a little time ago to make a land grant to a private syndicate if it would construct a railway. If it is a fair thing for the State to hand over the land to a private company",41
314,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"But it is not a fair thing, and that is what we object to.",41
315,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Then let the State construct the railway and keep the land. Mr WATSON;-Ough t South Australia to make use of that provision to prevent a survey from taking place?,41
316,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I think that there is a great deal in what the honourable member has said. I ' believe that the Government and the Parliament of South Australia are not particularly anxious for this railway to be constructed'. It is very deeply to be regretted that such is the case.  panies which are against its construction. They control the Government today.,41
317,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then , I hope that the people of South Australia will very soon take the matter into their own hands, and see that these monopolies are broken down. But if that State were as honest and anxious as Western Australia in this matter, I believe that it could be arranged by those States without reference to the Federal Parliament. That I think would be the infinitely preferable way. At the present time we have not a mile of Federal railway, and we are now asked to embark upon the construction of a Federal line to dove-tail in .between States' railways, and the resulting complications might be very serious.",41
318,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,This is the first step towards federalizing the States railways.,42
319,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the States railways were federalized, the only question we should have to consider would be, is this railway of such a character that we could seriously and reasonably sanction its construction at the cost of the people of the Commonwealth ? I do not wish to look at this proposal too much from a State point of view. But I would invite honourable members to remember that the two States which have the smallest populations, and whose public revenues are somewhat seriously embarrassed are Queensland and Tasmania. From a direct stand-point neither of those States can possibly hope to obtain the slightest advantage from the construction of this railway.",42
320,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We send Tasmania a good present every year.,42
321,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We get nothing from Western Australia. 1,42
322,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not intend to be led into a discussion of the merits or demerits of the different States, nor shaU I attempt to pit one State.against another. But I would remind those who ask us to consider this question in a Federal spirit member that we also can ask them to look at it in a Federal spirit, and bear in mind that if the cost of the Commonwealth were increased, it would be done directly at the expense of the people of Queensland and Tasmania, upon whom direct taxation would have to be imposed to make good the deficiency in their revenues. Holding, as I do first, that this project more directly concerns Western Australia and South Australia, and that, therefore, before the Commonwealth is asked to incur any expenditure, they should furnish that information which we are now asked to obtain; secondly, that the Bill is of such a character, that, if passed, it would not enable the Government to get such information as the House would be satisfied with, before it could authorize the construction of the railway; and, thirdly, which is a more important consideration with me, that the finances of two States are in such a condition that the passing of this vote might ultimately have the effect of imposing direct taxation upon their people, I shall have to oppose the motion. But if the 912 second reading be carried I shall assist those who will attempt to place in the Bill at least some provision by which the Commonwealth would be able to get .back a direct return for the outlay which it is asked to incur.",42
323,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," Severa l honourable members, particularly the right honourable member for Swan, have expressed some surprise at the fact that the people of South Australia do not seem to be wildly enthusiastic about this proposal. The reason has been supplied by the honourable member for Hunie, who has pointed out as one of the' chief advantages of the railway that passengers could' run .straight across from Kalgoorlie to Sydney without - going near Adelaide and Melbourne.",42
324,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do not think that he meant that. What he meant was that they could run up to Broken Hill, and proceed thence vid Wilcannia and Cobar to Sydney.",42
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,How are they going to get across from Port Augusta to New South Wales ?,42
326,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Fro m Port Augusta to Broken Hill, as the honourable membe'r knows, there is a railway; 'and a connection from Broken Hill to Cobar could easily be made by New South Wales, so to rethat there would be direct communication between Perth and Sydney.",42
327,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,So there would be between Adelaide and Perth.,42
328,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Yes . The honourable member for Hume said that one stipulation upon which his vote for the construction of this railway would depend would be that its gauge should be 4ft. 8£in., as in New South Wales. The gauge is 3ft. 6in. from Port Augusta to Terowie and from Terowie to Cockburn, 5ft. 3m. from Terowie to Adelaide and from Adelaide to Melbourne, and 4ft. 8Jin. from Cobar to Sydney. The honourable member has indicated that his anxiety is to make Kalgoorlie, as it were, a suburb of Sydney. I do not mean to suggest that he deliberately advocates that a gauge of 4ft. 8Jin. should be adopted for this connecting link, with a view to preventing any traffic from going down from Adelaide to Melbourne.",42
329,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Fou r feet eight and a half inches is the world's standard gauge.,42
330,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It is, but the honourable member forgets that Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have not a single mile of railway of that gauge.",42
331,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,But there must be a uniform gauge adopted at some time.,43
332,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It will be seen that a stipulation that the connecting link must be constructed on a 4 f t . 8jin. gauge would present for a considerable time very serious complications. There would be a break of gauge at Port Augusta, Terowie, and Kalgoorlie. So that in the centre of the Transcontinental Railway there would be a strip of 1,100 miles with a gauge of 4ft. 8Jin.",43
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Wester n has agreed to alter the gauge of her railway to any gauge - which may be agreed to by this Parliament.,43
334,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"So far as Western Australia was concerned, that would prevent any complication from arising, but it is unreasonable to expect South Australia to alter the gauge of. the line between Port Augusta and Cockburn, in order to connect with the railway system of New South Wales, unless at the same time she altered the gauge of the line to Adelaide.",43
335,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That might fairly be a Commonwealth project also as part of the general scheme.,43
336,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As part of a general scheme altering the railway gauges throughout Australia to a standard gauge, which undoubtedly is the 4ft. i \ m . gauge, there might be no objection to it. It is rather much to expect South Australians to be enthusiastic for the construction, of a line, when the conditions on which it is proposed to construct it, would simply prevent the settled portions of their State from deriving the smallest benefit from it. On the part of those who think this line advisable and a proper underas taking far the Commonwealth, it is a great expenditure. mistake to put forward that kind of argument, and to lay down conditions which must necessarily arouse antagonism in States to whose interests those conditions would be diametrically opposed. not object to the survey of this line, before I would agree to its construction should certainly stipulate that the northern route, vid Tarcoola, and not that sea-coast, should be adopted. northern route were adopted, it is probable that it would lead to the development some country. It would take the line through country the value present but little known. From the information which has been supplied by the alization purposes. Government Geologist of South Australia, it is known that a very large area of that country is within the mineral and goldbearing belt, and there is a possibility, and perhaps a strong probability, of de1 velopment along that line. If the southern route vid Eucla were adopted, the railway would be for all time in competition with sea carriage, which is the most serious competition that any railway could face. Further, if that route were adopted, there could be no possibility of the develo23ment of any fresh country. It goes through limestone country the whole way. Australia The honourable member for Grey knows the route very well, and has travelled it a great many times, and I have been over a great portion of it. We have both been over the northern route as far, at any rate, as Tarcoola, and the potentialities of the two routes cannot be compared. I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill . The construction of the railway is another matter altogether, and it will have to depend upon the results of the proposed survey. I must not be understood for a moment as in any sense pledging myself to vote for the construction of the railway, but I do think it is worthwhile to ascertain which is the best route for such a line, and what are the possibilities of development to which it would give rise. Even the carrying oyt of the survey might lead to the development of some country. I had not the pleasure of hearing the speech of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and I have not up to the present grasped the advantages of the amendment which he has foreshadowed.",43
337,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The proposal is simply to require the two States to reserve twenty-five miles on each side of the line a condition precedent to the proposed,43
338,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I know what the proposal is, but I have not yet grasped its advantages. If the object of the amendment is to prevent the alienation of land, I do the proposal is one which I hardly exbut pected would emanate from the honourable I and learned member for Parkes.",43
339,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I am not so bad as along the the honourable gentleman thinks. If the Mr Frazer - We cannot be sure that the honourable and learned member's desire of is not to kill the whole proposal.,43
340,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,That is just what of which is at I wish to get at.,43
341,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,It is not for nation,43
342,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I should not object if the intention were to prevent for all time the alienation of this land, in order t'hat the increased value given to it by the construction of the railway, should remain in the pockets of the people.",43
343,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What people?,44
344,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The people of the Commonwealth. I see that the honourable and learned member makes a distinction. If the Commonwealth finds the money, the honourable and learned member does not think that the States should be allowed to retain the increased value given to the (and.",44
345,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I say that the land should remain as an asset in reserve, so that the Commonwealth, by-and-by, in undertaking the construction of the line might stipulate, that there should be some means of disposing of it in the interests of the Commonwealth towards' recouping the outlav.",44
346,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I want something more than that. There are some practical difficulties in the way of what the honourable and learned member proposes. limit of twenty-five miles on each side of the line would probably take in all the land that has so far been developed.,44
347,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I intend to provide only for Crown lands.,44
348,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"A good deal of this land is under mineral lease, and pastoral occupation. I am informed by the honourable member for Grey, that for 270 miles along the proposed route, the land is held under pastoral lease. I do not know what is the tenure of these pastoral leases, but certainly some of them have a tenure of forty-two years. I understand that the honourable and learned member for Parkes does not propose to interfere with those leases.",44
349,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"No , only to prevent sales and fresh leases.",44
350,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And the proposal would not affect mineral leases which are now held.,44
351,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"It would not affect mining in any way, either past or future leases.",44
352,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The reservation which the honourable and learned member suggests, would include much of the mineral - country which has been proved to exist along the line between Tarcoola and Port Augusta. It would take in country where there are enormous deposits of 'copper ore of low grade, which so far have not been worked, chiefly because of the cost of carriage. This country is well worth developing, .and whether the Commonwealth undertake the construction of this railway or not, I feel sure that the Tarcoola district will, before many years are past, justify the State in the construction of a line. The honourable member' for Robertson told us that Sir Cftarles Todd has said that the construction of the telegraph line was a mistake, because, temporarily, it has not paid; but as a matter of fact, Sir Charles Todd recommended the construction of the line.",44
353,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Onl v under pressure, I think.",44
354,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Where was the pressure ?,44
355,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Fro m the Government of his own State I suppose.,44
356,Mr HUTCHISON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,He recommended it to the South Australian Parliament.,44
357,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is so; we know t'hat no telegraph lines are more highly remunerative than are those connecting mining fields, and there is certainly every probability that the Tarcoola field would prove to be a very valuable field. The",44
358,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think the line is paying office rent at present.,44
359,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The field is at present under a cloud. But a great many of the world's most important gold-fields have experienced their ups and downs.  ing on the Tarcoola field yet, and it has paid its way through.",44
360,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have not the least fear that the Tarcoola field will turn out to be a very valuable field. The district is to a very large extent gold-bearing, and it is certainly worthy of careful prospecting. If it had railway communication there is no doubt it would be developed to a very much greater extent than it can be now, when the cost of the carriage of ore is so very high. Supplies have been carreid on camels for a considerable time, and of course the cost involved is so high as to be prohibitive of mining development unless with very high returns. As I believe that there are possibilities of considerable mining development along the line between Tarcoola and Port Augusta, and between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, I intend to vote for this measure. From the point of view of agricultural or pastoral development I am not sanguine as to the prospects of the proposed line. The country, so far as is known, is not suited for these purposes. The Gawler Range country is practically deserted. There are practically neither sheep nor cattle on that country now.",44
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,There used to be a great many.,45
362,Mr BATCHELOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There were up to about 1893. Probably drought had something to do with the desertion of the country, and the low price of wool coming after the drought, followed by the inroads of the rabbits, would also be factors. A very large amount of development took place as the result of men going there with plenty of money. But not much money has been made on the Gawler Range country. However, it would not be traversed if the line took a more northerly route, in which case it would pass through a much better pastoral district,' the runholders there having managed to maintain their footing, and in some cases to do exceedingly well, even in very ba'd seasons. While I believe that the survey of the proposed route is justifiable, and shall therefore vote for the Bill, I do not pledge myself to vote for the construction of the proposed railway until I ' have seen the reports of the surveyors.",45
363,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," The vi.ry handsome majority which was obtained for the motion for the appropriation of money for the purposes of this Bill was very much appreciated by the people of Western Australia, who, as I have remarked before in this Chamber, have long felt that hitherto they have not reaped any of the practical and tangible benefits from Federation which the other States have received, although they have borne their share of the cost. They regard the vote to which I refer as an assurance that their claim that this great work should be at least considered is recognised. Although we understand that some of those who voted for the resolution, and will vote for this Bill, do not pledge themselves to vote for the construction of the proposed railway, we are sanguine that when the survey and accompanying explorations are made, we shall have such a tale to tell that the opposition to the proposal will not be greater than the present opposition to the Bill. I wish to express my gratification that only three members of the Labour Party voted against the motion, though it was in no sense a party question. I should like now to deal with one or two objections which have been raised to this proposal. honourable"" member for Franklin has complained that Western. Australia has not done all that she should have done in preparing reports on the scheme. He thinks that she should have gone to the length of making the survey, a suggestion with which I shall deal later on. As for ordinary information, the Government of the State has done all that a Government could do to obtain it, and to place it before the House, and I regret that the speeches of some honourable 1 members indicate that they have not made that study of the reports which have been furnished to them which they might reasonably have been expected to make. Had they done so, we should not have heard some of the statements which have been made in regard to the absence of water and the nature of the country to be traversed. I sympathize as much as any one does with the Governments of those States which are in financial difficulties. Both Tasmania and Queensland are struggling with a shortage of funds, and are straining every nerve to make up deficiencies. But they are not alone. Western Australia has to face similar difficulties. We may be in a better position to meet our obligations; but it must be remembered that we have a falling revenue, and that the special means of revenue which we now enjoy under the Constitution will shortly come to an end. Those who referred to the poverty of their own States as a reason for not voting for the proposed survey must therefore remember that - Western Australia is also being called upon to use extra efforts to make both ends meet. 1 It seemed to me that the honourable member for Laanecoorie took a very narrow view of this question. His attitude reminded me of the struggles which have taken place in our States Legislatures in regard to railway proposals. Frequently proposals for the construction of railways, which had everything to recommend them, have been shelved for a long time, owing to the predominance of local considerations. I am afraid that a similar spirit has been introduced into this debate, because the honourable member for Laanecoorie and others have made the question one of State against State. Victoria owes much of its prosperity to its railways. The settlement of the country, and the development of its resources have been possible only because enterprising public men in years gone by built railways to places which were then uninhabited. Therefore, those who urge The 'hat we should wait for population to extend along the route of the proposed railway before entering upon its construction, ignore all the lessons of our past experience. The railway would help to develop the country, and those honourable members who are in favour of inducing people to come here, and of providing facilities for settlement, should at least be consistent, and support an enterprise which will do more to open up the continent than many anticipate. With reference to the proposal for the reservation of land along the line of route, I am glad that the honourable and learned member for Parkes has advanced so far along the line of democratic legislation as to advocate the principle of the nationalization of land. It will be refreshing to his constituents, and to the democrats of Australia generally, to find the honourable and learned member, who is so notoriously conservative, adopting such an attitude. I desire, however, to know exactly what he means. If he proposes that the Commonwealth should construct the line only upon what would practically amount to the land grant system, I join issue with him at once. If he insists that before even the survey is entered upon the States of Western Australia and South Australia shall hand over a certain portion of their territory to :the Commonwealth, he is raising an entirely new consideration. If , on the other hand, he desires merely to prevent private land speculators from deriving the advantage of the increased value given to the land by the construction of the railwav, I am perfectly in accord with him. I am quite sure that that was all the honourable member for New England intended. He wished to prevent private speculators from doing as they have done so often, namely, securing the land along the line of the proposed railway, and simply waiting for the State to spend its money in order that their profits might be secured. We are willing that that should be done, but we do not think that the States should be treated as if they were private speculators. If it be held that some return should be made by the States which derive the greatest benefit from the construction of the line, I would point out that Western Australia has already proved her sincerity, and has shown herself willing to make every effort in her power to recoup any loss that may accrue.",45
364,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,How ?,46
365,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"In the first place, she has spent thousands of pounds in sending qut exploration parties, and boring parties, and in preparing reports for the use of honourable members. Then she has made an offer to South Australia that she will make good any loss that that State may incur for ten years after the construction of the line.",46
366,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"That is, one-eleventh of the total loss.",46
367,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"One-eleventh , in addition to her own share. She has shown, also that she is prepared to deal in a liberal spirit in respect to any loss that' the Commonwealth itself may suffer. In view of these Three distinct offers, I think I can. claim that Western Australia is at least prepared to pay for her portion of the unearned increment. If honourable members want to put the screw on, and to insist upon our handing a large slice of our territory over to the Commonwealth, I think they are going too ' far. If the consent of Western Australia to join the Federal Union had been given subject to the condition that the railway should be constructed, there would have been no objection to such a provision as that now suggested. The same principle that was applied to New South Wales in connection with the granting of territory for the purposes of the Federal Capital Site, might reasonably have operated in regard to the construction of the proposed railway, if that had been in the bond. But I contend that it is unfair to insist upon taking from usa slice of our territory, in consideration of the construction of a railway to which we contend we are unconditionally entitled. The railway itself is naturally a Federal work. If the capitals of the other States had not been connected by rail-if , for instance, Sydney and Brisbane had not been so connected--the strongest representations would have been made, and rightly so, by honourable members from New South Wales and Queensland for the construction of the necessary line by the Commonwealth.",46
368,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Especiall y if one State would not assist the other.,46
369,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"There is little doubt that in such a case one State would assist the other. I regard the connection of the States capitals by rail as a matter of Federal importance, and in the exceptional circumstances of Western Australia and South Australia, we have a right to ask that the project now before us shall be regarded, not from a State point of view, but as a work Of a national character, which, when constructed, will benefit the whole of Australia",46
370,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Capricornia). - It is my misfortune that I cannot view this question in that broad, Federal spirit which seems to animate some honourable members. Queensland should not be asked to contribute anv money towards the construction of a railway such as that now proposed. The line would pass through territory which, so far as we know, is a desert. If the country had been any good, it. would have been taken up by capitalists long ago. Some honourable members have referred to the probabilities of obtaining abundant supplies of artesian water, whilst others have expressed the belief that valuable mineral deposits will be brought - to light. If the country is mineralized, however, no artesian water will be struck, because artesian water is obtained only - in country of cretaceous formation, which never occurs in a mineral belt. As - is known, ever since Queensland joined the Commonwealth she has suffered a very considerable loss of revenue, and I object to that State making any contribution towards the cost of a survey of the proposed line. If Western Australia and South Australia desire to obtain the benefits which a Transcontinental Railway would confer they should at least defray the expense connected with a trial survey of the route to be traversed. The Commonwealth would then be in a position to decide whether or not it should undertake the construction of the line.",46
371,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Who is defraying the cost of the abolition of Kanaka labour in Queensland ?,47
372,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable membei may take all the Kanakas and all the black, brown, and brindle population of Queensland. We do not want them. I maintain that the Commonwealth is paying nothing whatever for the abolition of the: Kanakas. As a matter of fact, it is deriving a revenue from the sugar which is produced exclusively by white labour. I fail to see that the proposed railway will confer any benefit upon the States othei than South Australia and Western Australia. Queensland is in a very impecunious position at the present time. Relatively to population, she is burdened with one of the heaviest national debts in the world, and I object to that State being called upon to make any contribution towards the construction of a Transcontinental Railway. I know that my constituents share my views upon this question. I would further point out that if this line is ever built it will not pay for axle grease. Reference has been made to the gold-fields. I was engaged in mining some few years ago, and, 1 speaking as a practical man, I believe that the Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie gold-fieldswill decline within a - few years. M i . FOWLER - Has the honourable member ever been there?",47
373,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Yes ; I was. there before the honourable member.,47
374,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I do not think so.,47
375,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"At any rate, I was there in 1894.",47
376,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,I was there prior to that.,47
377,Mr DAVID THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The honourable member could not see much prior u> that period, for the simple reason that there was nothing to be seen. Kalgoorlie may be a very fine place today, but there is no> well doubt that it is declining in importance, and! in another decade I predict that neither Kalgoorlie nor Coolgardie will be what they are at present.",47
378,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,They will be better.,47
379,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I have very grave doubts upon that point. We have not. a sufficient guarantee of - their permanency to justify us in expending money upon the survey or construction of the proposed! line. For that reason I shall oppose the Bill upon every possible opportunity.  able member for Capricornia, I am opposed! to this Bill , lock, stock, and barrel. If the Prime Minister would introduce a Bill providing for the construction of a railway from Port Darwin to Longreach, in Central Queensland, I should have no hesitation in supporting the measure, because that line would benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. Some time ago the right honourable member for Swan, in a fit of sanity or in sanity, declared that only last year a profit of £4,000,000 was made out of the minesin Western Australia.",47
380,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I said £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0.  was derived from the output of gold there, why was not a portion of it devoted to paying the cost of the proposed survev? If I support this Bill, I shall be practically committed to voting for the construction of the projected railway. Should the result of the survey prove favourable, I shall be pledged to almost an unlimited expenditure.",47
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,The honourable member is wrong.,47

387,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I am not complaining.  the expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on a special survey; but, I am afraid that that will not be sufficient to complete the work.",48
388,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think it will.  not. During my membership of the Queensland Parliament, various sums were placed on the Estimates to enable permanent surveys of projected lines to be made, but in no instance was the amount first set apart for the work found to be sufficient, and the Government were compelled to come down to the House with a request for a further vote. If the provision now proposed to be made be insufficient, we shall have to agree to a further expenditure to complete the survey. I am satisfied that £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 will barely complete it.",48
389,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Oh !  representatives of Western Australia to that we must find this"" money, but, as honourable member for Capricornia very wisely pointed out, the Treasurer Queensland does not know what to do in order to make both ends meet.",48
390,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Ta x the capitalists.  After all, the people have to find the money. I should not be faithful to the trust reposed in me by my constituents if mem- I were to agree to the placing of this additional shackle upon them at the present time. The Treasurer of Queensland is at a loss to know how to keep the State expenditure within its income, and now we are asked to impose a further burden on Queensland in common with the other States. I do not wish to pay special attention to the position, of Queensland. The cost of this work will have to be borne by all the States, and we do not know what expenditure will be necessary in time to I come in the construction of this railway. I am sorry to find myself in disagreement with the right honourable member for Swan in regard to this Bill, but I know that he will Australia accept my criticism in the spirit in which it is offered. If I could see my way clear, consistently with my duty to my constituents, to vote for the Bill , I should do so, but in the present circumstances I do not think it would be right for me to support it .",48
391,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I intend to vote for this Bill , 1 not in the interests of Western Australia, but because I believe it was part of the Federal compact that the Transcontinental Railway should be""constructed by the Commonwealth. I shall also vote for the Bill, because I believe that the Federal Union will never be complete until this line has been made. Another reason why I support the measure is that I think the making of the survey will do much to open up the great mineral resources of the west-the fringe of which some of us have been privileged to visit-and take away the workless workers of the east, who desire to reach the rich gold stores of the western State. It will open up new country and fresh markets, and bring about that real union at which the Federation aims. I am unable to see how we shall ever be able properly to defend the Commonwealth until we are in a position to convey our troops by rail from east to west. A number of other reasons might be advanced in support of this the measure. and it is singular that say honourable members should "" harp"" upon the the Government proposal, more particularly has when the Bill now before us provides for of an expenditure of only .£20,000.  upon it.",48
392,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"We reis quire further information as to the nature of the country. In many of the States large sums have been expended in surveyin ing the routes.of projected railways, in some cases the information so obtained has been such that even some est advocates of the lines have declined to further advocate their construction. A tract of the country through which the Transcontinental Railway would pass remains practically unexplored, and the carrying out of the surve-- may open up new avenues of employment for ing tens of thousands of persons. If it results in the discovery of only another Golden Mile something will - have been accomplished. Fresh discoveries of mineral wealth are being made almost every week in the western State. We have tens of thousands of'idle men in the States, and they would be glad to find ployment in the west. In these circumstances - it seems to me little short of marvellous - that honourable members should hesitate to - expend £20,000 in obtaining the informaof tion necessary to guide us in coming to - decision in regard to the construction of the line. Even from the point of view .of the mineral resources that may be oped by the making of this survey, we shall certainly be justified in going with the work. If in any of the othei States the prospect of - discovering a .gold-field-of opening up a new avenue employment, and finding fresh scope for 'business people-were one-fifth, or one-tenth, as great as that which this dertaking offers, how readily those guide the destinies of that State would expend the money necessary to further development. - - - Mr KELLY --There are great sources wealth remaining undeveloped in the honconsiderable orable member's own constituency. ' Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The honwant '01 able and learned member for Parkes takes up the position that the CommonState, wealth should not 'be' asked to bear this expenditure. I have heard him say again and again that the Union should be a thorough one, and that we should not look at the questions' which from time to time come before us from a provincial standcause point. What if a' work proposed to' undertaken by the'Commonwealth would slightly more advantageous to South Australia/Western Australia, or Queensland "" than to the other States? Why view .these matters from a provincial aspect? This a Federal undertaking. It was part of the Federal compact, and if Western Australia had insisted on its being provided for the Constitution itself, no doubt its reand quest would have been gladly granted.",49
393,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Does the honourable memof the warmber really believe that?,49
394,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I do. My vast honourable friend, of course, asks the question because he thinks that the right honourable member for Swan should have stood out more strongly than he did for provision being made in the Constitution for the buildof the railway, or that it was due to his unsophisticated nature that he did not demand as much as he might have done. Perhaps he considered that there were other concessions which it would be impossible to secure after the compact had been sealed, and, recognising that sooner or later the eastern Federation would be compelled to make emthis line, he probably accepted those concessions whicn he was doubtful of obtaining withoutexpress provision being made for them in the Constitution, and left the carrying out this work by the Federation to a certain : a extent to chance, believing that it would certainly be carried out. I , too, view this matter from the stand-point of New South Wales, develand I know that there are many men in that State who are out of employment, and on desire a chance to reach the gold-fields df 1 the west. . They also need the new markets new which this railway will enable them to seof cure. Consequently, I shall' support the Bill. We are not asked to take a leap in even the dark. We are simply called upon to unvote for the making of a survey in order to who obtain information that will guide us in determining whether the railway should be that made. Any one who has visited the west must recognise that, after all, prospecting of has not been carried on there to any very extent, prospectors being handicapped in going out to the back blocks by of water and other difficulties. But looking at the possibilities of that great honourable members must be strongly disposed to follow the lead of its representatives. They now call upon us to help them to open up this territory, assuring us that"" if we do so, we shall discover fresh avenues of employment for our people, and other cities to spring up like those be which have already grown in the westbe like mushrooms in ""the night.",49
395,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," It was not my intention to take up the time of the House by dealing with this matter, for it was f u discussed a few weeks ago, and but for the assertion made by the last speaker, that the building of this railway was part of the Federal compact, I should not have spoken. If I could find that the construction of the line was provided for in the Constitution accepted by the people of Western Australia in. common with those of the other States, I should vote for the Bill ; but I have failed to discover any reference to it in the Constitution, or to find that there was any Federal compact which would justify us in making this survey.",49
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,What about fence ?,50
397,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"The argument that the railway is necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth has frequently been used; but as I dealt with that phase of the question when the matter was before us on a previous occasion, I shall not now refer to it. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has spoken of the large number of men in New South Wales, and other States, who aire 'anxious to obtain employment, and would readily go to the west. Surely we are not asked to believe that the unemployed in Victoria, New South Wales, or any' part of eastern Australia would travel west by this railway if it were constructed ? Such persons could not afford the high fares which will be charged, and would inevitably choose the cheaper route by sea.",50
398,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,Peopl e cannot go to the gold-fields by steamer. There is at present a long railway journey to be faced at the end of the voyage to the West.,50
399,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"If the railway for which the honourable member is so anxious were constructed, it would still be cheaper to travel to Fremantle' by sea, and thence by rail to the gold-fields. If Tasmanian politicians had been as wide awake as was the right honourable member for Swan, that State would have been able to retain its Customs revenue. But the Tasmanian representatives did not ask for that privilege be- fore the Constitution was voted on, and we are now willing to abide by the bargain which was then made. In my opinion, however, Tasmania was very badly treated when she was not allowed to keep her Customs revenue for a time. I do not think that we have any right to vote any sum of money for railways until the States' railways have been taken over by the Commonwealth.",50
400,Mr BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A," I have supported this proposal up to the present stage, l ly but I confess I cannot become so enthusiastic on the subject as was the honourable member for. Eden-Monaro a few minutes ago. The Bill before us leads us into new avenues, and we ought to consider very caref u l ly before we commit ourselves. In the first place, the States have not seen fit to hand over the control of the railways to the Federal Parliament. If the administration of the railways had been one of the transferred functions, the proposal before us would have merited very earnest consideration. At present, however, we are prac'tically asked to initiate a work which de- the States primarily interested do not seem disposed to undertake. No doubt this is a very large project, and its magnitude may be one reason why the States I have indicated are not disposed to further it . But I cannot think that the construction of such a railway will bring about the great development which the honourable member for Eden Monaro would lead us to suppose. If thai were so, this project would invite almost immediate State action. I have supported this proposal hitherto, and I shall give it my vote today, because I recognise that the people of Western Australia received, in effect, a promise that something in this direction would be done as an inducement to them to enter into the Federal compact.",50
401,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,We received definite promises from many of the leaders of. the Federal movement.,50
402,Mr BROWN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I understand that is so, and while there is no provision in the Constitution like that, for instance, relating to the Federal Capital, I am prepared, as far as I can, to honour the understanding then arrived a't. One reason why I think we ought to consider a vote of this kind is that it affects two State's-that it is not wholly confined to one State. True, the project affects one State more than another, but neither Western Australia nor South Australia can advance without the assistance and co-operation of the other. It seems to me that by making this exploratory survey we may induce! those two States to undertake the actual work of construction. If , after we pass this Bill today, we are called upon to consider the propriety of expending money on the actual construction, a new issue will be raised, which I must then consider. I wish to say, however, that in voting for the proposal before us, I do not feel that I am pledging myself or my State to the carrying out of this particular work. We are simply paving a way for the States primarily interested to combine in order to carry out the work. Mr DUGALD THOMSON"" (Minister of Home Affairs-Nort h Sydney) - I shall refer very briefly to some points which have been raised in the course of the debate. First, I think the discussion has taken lines that should precede a Bill for the construction of a railway, rather than lines that should precede a proposal for a mere survey. The honourable member for Bass said that there was nothing in the Constitution engaging the Commonwealth to construct such a railway; and with that we must all agree. But I think it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the majority of honourable members that when, during the discussion of the Constitution, the other States decidedthat Western Australia, owing to that isolation, would not, and could not, in her own interests, enter the Union,, the 'people of that Statu were induced, by certain promises, if not of the removal of that isolation, at least, of an inquiry into the practicability of its removal, to come to a decision which rather surprised the people of the eastern States. Mi. MAHON - The promises went much further fhan that.",50
403,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"I say that is the very smallest claim, and it can be well supported by evidence. ",51
404,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Severa l of the leading men connected with the Federal movement.  such promises in the reports of the Convention debates. Mr DUGALD. THOMSON - I do not wish to enter into that question at this time. I can only say that that is the conclusion I have come to, and it is the conclusion which must be come to by any one who looks into the matter carefully.  tion is where one would expect to find some reference to this matter. - Mr DUGALD THOMSON - No , because it was not a matter which it was proposed to provide for in the Constitution.",51
405,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,And it was not piovided for in the Constitution.,51
406,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"As to certain proposals which have been made, and which I fear may prove hampering proposals, T am perfet-.tlv at one with thosr honourable members who wish to preserve to the Commonwealthand to the States the increment in value which will be given to lands along this railway line if it is ever constructed. But by endeavouring to put such a'condition Into this Bill, those honourable members are practically giving into the hands of South Australia- a State, the Government of which have been of late more or less antagonistic to the proposed construction of this line-wha t ought to be retained in the hands of the Commonwealth. That, I think, is not desirable. .1 quite agree that it is desirable, in the negotiations which must take place with the Governments of those two States, the Commonwealth Government should sefe that satisfactory arrangements are madebefore the survey is proceeded with. But I do not think that we should put in ar» Act of Parliament a rigid provision which might not be capable of being adhered to by the States concerned, and which omitted a great many other things equally important which ought to form part of the negotiations prior to any survey being made. That is my opinion on that matter, and I hope that it will receive from honourable members their consideration. Several suggestions, and very proper ones, have been made by the honourable member for Newcastle and the honourable member for Grampians, as re-, gards testing the country for minerals, for pastoral purposes, and for water supplyThese, of course, should receive consideration. I do not see that that can be done out of this survey vote. It must be a matter for united action by the States, in whose interests settlement would take place on the lands, mining enterprises would be developed, and-apar t from the supply of water for railway purposes- a discovery of water would be made. The proposed vote is not sufficient to enable the Commonwealth, to undertake these inquiries. But I think that when an expedition for one purpose was crossing the territory, the States concerned might arrange for united action in those other directions. I do not. think I have any more to say, except to refer to the statement by the honourable member for Franklin, that he would be perfectly willing that a survey should be made by the State of Western. Australia, and that a decision should be come to on that report. We have had several reports from that source. I think that any report ought to be such as would command respect fromthis Parliament, not merely as regards the capacity of its compiler, but also as regards the unbiased position of those who superintended the work of the survey. For these reasons, especially for the very important reason that I think Western Australia has a claim to satisfaction, so far as an inquiry goes, I support the proposal. I recognise that there will be a great many questions to be faced after a survey is made. We shall have to consider all the information which the report may contain, and, further^ to face the very important financial consideration, not merely whether the line shall be constructed, but whether it shall be constructed immediately, or at a later period. But as regards gathering information and seeking to satisfy the people of Western Australia that we are determined not to keep them isolated, but to carry out what they were led to expect before Federation-a n inquiry to see if we can remove the isolation- I think that the Bill should receive from every honourable member favourable consideration.
