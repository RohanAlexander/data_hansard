2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Overseas Development Assistance The petition of the undersigned fully showeth that many Australians are concerned at the announced decision by the Commonwealth Government to reduce the 197S-76 Overseas Development Assistance vote by $21m and by the abolition of the Australian Development Assistance Agency. We your petitioners do therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government: 1. as a matter of urgency, reverse the decision to cut the 1975-76 Overseas Development Assistance vote so as to ensure that the full amount appropriated by Parliament for Overseas Development Assistance is spent this nnanciai year to meet the pressing needs of those in the developing countries; 2. reaffirm Australia's commitment of Overseas Development Assistance being a minimum of 0.7 per cent of GNP, and 3. establish a fully independent statutory authority to administer Australia's official Overseas Development Assistance. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Baume, Mr Brown, Mr Fry and Mr Moore. Petitions received. To the Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: That the three service cadet forces have great value development of the youth of Australia. That the disbanding of the cadet forces will disperse accumulated expertise and interest of those involved, and in some cases negate the efforts of many people over many years. Your peutioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will reconsider its decision and that the Government will reinstate the cadet forces. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Braithwaite and Mr Hodges. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of electors of the Division of Leichhardt respectfully showeth that both the School Cadets and the Naval, Army and Air Cadets provide character buUding and discipUnary training for the future citizens of this Commonwealth. The Cadets also provide some basic team training for our youngsters which must be considered to be valuable in these times of vandalism and drug taking. The estimated cost of the Cadets is only a fraction of the cost to our community (i.e. the Australian community) from vandalism and drug problems. PETITIONS Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the government will immediately rescind its intention to disband the Cadets. And your peutioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Thomson. citizens of Australia respectPetition received. Australian Heritage Commission To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that There is a growing interest and concern in all sections of Australian society for the conservation of the environment, natural and man-made. That there are also rapidly growing pressures by powerful forces tending towards the destruction of the Australian heritage. That it is therefore urgent to appoint the Australian Heritage Commission, which was approved by both sides of this Parliament and to give the Commission sufficient independent staff, resources and funds. That Technical Assistance Grants and Administrative Support Grants to community organisations are needed to partially redress the gross imbalance in technical expertise and resources suffered by community groups in pressing the community's case against the exploiter. That a proper balance between the Governments programme of public austerity and the need for action in conservation would be a modest increase in the budget allocations in these areas over that of 1975-76. Cadet Corps And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Haslem and Mr Sainsbury. Petitions received. of Australia respectfully Taxation: Land and Water Rates in the To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the undersigned persons believe that the $300 limit on income tax deductibility in respect of personal residential land and water rates is unrealistic and is a discriminatory income tax penalty. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take steps to see that the aforesaid Umitation is removed entirely or substantially increased. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Connolly. Cadet Corps Petition received. Library and Information Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the inhabitants of the Western Suburbs of Adelaide (DURD Metropolitan Region Number 2) are hopelessly disadvantaged in their lack of access to library and tion services as there is only one (1) PubUc Library whole Region. That this situation results in a ratio of only 0.07 head of populadon. That the Region is thereby 5!6 times worse off than of Adelaide. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the ment institute a programme of funding Ubrary and information services within the Region and that this funding gramme be based directly on need and no other considerThe ation, with Ubraries being funded on a priority basis, to disadvantaged schools. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hurford. Petition received. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Attorney General a question. Yesterday he said in answer to the honourable member for Bonython that he would be surprised if the staff of the New South Wales Supreme Court had been instructed to refuse to provide copies of the decree in a certain divorce case. Has he since noted that a spokesman for the New South Wales Attorney-General confirmed that information had been withheld from the general public on the case in question and asserted that the State Government had the power to refuse information to people who did not have a specific interest in the case? I ask: Can he further clarify the rights of the pubhc to receive certificates of decrees absolute as appears to be the plain intention of the Matrimonial Causes Act passed by this Parliament?",19
3,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVORCE DECREES,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Section 73 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, as honourable members will be aware, provides: Where a decree nisi has become absolute, any person is entitled on application to the Registrar or other proper officer of the court by which the decree was made and on payment of the appropriate fee, by the Registrar or other proper officer that the decree nui has become absolute. In other words, any person is entitled to receive it. The honourable member asks me what the present position is. That provision is brought forward into section 56 of the Farnily Law Act. Honourable members will recall that from their study of this legislation last year in this place. Section 56 of the Act provides: Where a decree nisi has become absolute, any person is entitled, on application to the Registrar of the court by which the decree was made, to receive a certificate signed by the Registrar that the decree nisi has become absolute. informaIn broad terms, any person may go to the court in the and seek that copy. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth is not in control of the courts books per which exercise Federal jurisdiction nor of their registries. I can apprehend only that if there is the rest any truth in the story to which the honourable member referred the authorities in New South GovernWales are troubled by the fact that people are protrying to intrude into the privacy of other people. section was put there, I assume, to enable similar the parties to the marriage to get a certificate that the decree nisi has become absolute so it can be proved, for instance, for re-marriage or for any proceedings subsequently. One can imagine that, if there is any truth in the story, people administering justice in New South Wales might feel that those who are seeking to intrude into the privacy of others should, to some degree, be asked to state the reasons why they want the information. Honourable members will recall that in the family law debate one of the things about which we were basically concerned was the privacy of divorce proceedings. The only reason that divorce proceedings should become in any way pubhc is if some question of public interest arises. One can assume in relation to a matter such as this-agai n I am speculating-that if there is any truth in the story authorities in New South Wales simply are reacting to the view that there should be complete privacy in relation to divorce proceedings unless the parties themselves are seeking the information. NA",20
4,Mr ALDRED,SUPPORTING FATHERS BENEFIT,"I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, by assuring the House that I have no vested interest in its outcome. Will the Minister inform the House whether any consideration has been given to the implementation of a single fathers benefit?",20
5,Mr HUNT,SUPPORTING FATHERS BENEFIT,"I commend the honourable member for his immaculate behaviour and for declaring his pecuniary interest. As honourable members would know, at present there is no specific to receive a certificate signed benefit that provides assistance to supporting fathers similar to the supporting mothers benefit. However, supporting fathers may be eligible for special benefit under section 124 of the Social Services Act. Such payments are regarded as a short term measure. The Minister for Social Security has announced that the whole income security system is presently under examination by the Income Security Review Committee. In that review the problems of supporting single fathers will certainly be given the closest consideration. I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in this important matter. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam - I ask the AttorneyState General a quesuon supplementary to that which I just asked him. The honourable gentleman, I am sure, will realise that my earher question was based almost word for word on a report in today's Melbourne Age. I therefore ask him: Is it a fact, as the same article states, that the Federal Government has told the New South Wales sure Attorney-General's Department that it does not have the power to withhold information about divorce decisions? Is it also a fact, as the article states, that officials in the Attorney-General's Department have told their New South Wales Wran. counterparts that they should not have withheld information in the case named?",20
6,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVORCE DECREES,"I do not know whether it is the fact. I will have inquiries made, and I will inform the House. NA",21
7,Mr ABEL,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,I ask a question of the Prime Minold ister. Will the Prime Minister say whether he intends to take part in the forthcoming elections in New South Wales?,21
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,"I have had some discussions with the Premier of New South Wales, Sir Eric Willis, in relation to this matter. Some arrangements have been made already. Within the limits of the time available, I certainly will be participating. I will be at the opening the election campaign by Sir Eric Willis, as will my colleague the Treasurer and, I would hope, other members of the coaUtion. There is warm support between the State branch of the Liberal Party and the Federal branch so far as the 2 elections, governments are concerned. I suppose it would be possible to regret that that same warm supWe port does not seem to exist between Mr Wran and the Leader of the Opposition. We can underand stand Mr Wran's view when he says that there seems to have been 'a bit of lead weight in our saddle bags' recendy as a result of certain activithe ties of the Leader of the Opposition and some those who sometimes sit behind him. Mr Kelly-What does he mean?",21
9,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,"I am grateful for the honourable gentleman's interjection, because it is a sUghtly ambiguous phrase. It may be more appropriately directed to somebody who could have been younger. Mr Wran said: 'The welcome mat is not out for Federal politicians: That includes Mr Whitlam'. It must have been welcome news for the home town boy to know that he is not welcome in his own capital city! I suppose we can understand the reasons why Mr Wran is putting forward these points of view. It must be great fun to be in a political party whose division is curiously determined to say that it has nothing to do with its Federal division! It obviously means that there are two separate parties. I have been thinking about whether it would be a good idea to offer the Leader of the Opposition a trip overseas for the next 2 months. That would then help Mr Wran. But I am not really that I feel so generous towards Mr Wran. I think that the Leader of the Opposition ought to be required to stay in Australia, at least for the period of the election campaign, so that he can participate, even if indirectly, in the defeat of Mr",21
10,Mr HURFORD,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,We will be quoting this back to you.,21
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,"Fro m those benches, for the next 20 years. It is also possible to understand why the Leader of the Opposition could feel happier about staying away from his home town. Some ofhis more recent visits in that area have given him the blues and left him very heavUy in debt. As we know, he had strange meetings with strange foreigners who got into this country by strange devices and in odd ways-unde r assumed names. There was the social breakfast that was not going to be a talking about money, and then money was just in the background. Anyway, that breakfast left the of Leader of the Opposition's Party heavily in debt. I thank the honourable gentleman for asking the question. We in the Government Parties look forward to working very closely with Sir Eric WUlis and his coalition Government after the as we will be doing up to the elections. We will be implementing our federalism policies. will be working in a spirit of co-operation in the interests of the citizens of New South Wales Australia in a way that certainly would not be possible with Mr Wran, even though Mr Wran does not seem to want to be very close to Leader of the Opposition. May I offer the of Leader of the Opposition my sympathy in this particular circumstance. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I ask that the right honourable gentleman table the 2 pages of the script from which he was reading. I gather that it was not confidential.",21
12,Mr SPEAKER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he read from the paper.,21
13,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,"I read from nothing. had some notes, Mr Speaker.",22
14,Mr SPEAKER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,"There is no requirement to table the paper. Mr E. G. Whitlam-There were 2 pages, both of which the right honourable gentleman was constantly checking and reading from, and that they be tabled.",22
15,Mr SPEAKER,NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTIONS,Order! The Leader of the Opright position called for the tabling of the paper. asked the right honourable gendeman whether he read from it. The right honourable gentleman said that he had notes and that he was looking the notes. He is therefore not required to table the document. NA NA,22
16,Mr LUSHER,BORDER,"I direct a question to the Minister for the Capital Territory. I refer to a recent statement issued by the Minister in with Sir John Fuller. The Minister will be aware that, despite the acceptance by the New South Wales Government of the recommendadons of I the Holmwood report on the matter of the extensoon sion of the Australian Capital Territory border, pledge? there is still great uncertainty among land holders in those regions of New South Wales close to the Australian Capital Territory border. Is the Minister able to give a categorical assurcisions ance that there will be no extension of the Ausmatters. traUan Capital Territory border into New South Wales? In addition to clearing the air on the border quesdon, does the Minister have any further information on the strategy plan posals for the joint development of the over-theThere border region?",22
17,Mr STALEY,BORDER,"In our discussions with the New South Wales Government we are not great advocating the shifting of the border between the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. Our concern has been to ensure that the real work of planning for development proceed immediately in a constructive fashion in discussions between Federal, State and local governments. For that reason we are drawing a strategy plan which wiil be on display, we hope, within 6 months. It will give people, as those mentioned by the honourable member, certainty about the use and future development of their land, because for sometimenow that use and development have been frozen. People have been put in a hopeless situation of uncertainty about the future and it is our intention not to caught up with symboUc issues but to do the real I work of co-operative planning for future development. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, concerns the ministerial statements deUvered in both Houses yesI ask terday announcing that the home loan tax deduction scheme would be very seriously restricted and reduced. I draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the housing polI icy of the Liberal and National Country Parties authorised last November by Tony Eggleton, Liberal Party Federal Secretariat, which, under at the heading 'Retain Existing Programs', stated: A Liberal and National Country Party Government will continue to support such programs as: (c) The Tax Deductibility of Mongage Interest. I also recaU that at a Press conference in Brisconjunction bane on 5 December he stated: . . . the interest subsidies scheme continues . . . therefore ask the Prime Minister why he has so dishonoured yet another election policy",22
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HOUSING,"The honourable gendeman is singularly unable to understand what has happened and what have been the deof the Government in relation to these The interest subsidy scheme is continuing. It is being applied for the first 5 years of repayments, which is a most important element because that is when the burden is Ukely to be proheaviest on people buying their own homes. is a very real degree of generosity in the homes savings grant scheme which was announced yesterday by the Minister concerned. The 2 schemes taken together will, we believe, do a deal to assist people not only in repaying the debts that they have incurred as a result of buying their own homes but also in enabling them to find the initial deposit so that they can in should fact buy their own homes. Under the poUcies of the previous Administraup tion home ownership became out of the reach of a great many people; it became out of the reach such of people who once might have supported the honourable gentleman and his Party but who did not do so after they saw what had happened to home buUding costs and all the other things during 3 years of hard Labor. The homes savings grant scheme and the interest subsidy scheme be need to be seen in conjunction with each other. The policies that were enunciated in the policy speech have been taken further in the homes savings grant scheme which was announced yesterday and will apply earher than would otherwise have been the case. I beheve that these 2 measures taken together represent the most progressive and far-reaching assistance, not only to young couples, but also to single people and people of any age, in buying their own homes that this country has ever seen.",22
19,Mr UREN,HOUSING,"My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, relates to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. I preface my quesuon by saying that the Prime Minister would be aware that there is concern about the slowing down in the private and pubhc sectors of the home building industry. The increase in expenditure of 27 per cent in real terms in the private sector of the home building industry, which occurred in the last 6 months of the Labor Government, now has flattened out due to the Fraser Government's pohcy.",23
20,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING,Order! The honourable member will not present argument in the course of asking his question. I ask him not to include argumentative material in his preface.,23
21,Mr UREN,HOUSING,I was just giving the indicators which now make it appear that there will be a 7 per cent decrease in expenditure in real terms in the second half of this financial year. Will the announced pohcy of the Government's homes savings grants scheme still further defer the recovery of the home building industry?,23
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HOUSING,Would the honourable member please repeat the last part of his question?,23
23,Mr UREN,HOUSING,"Havin g given the earher information, does the Prime Minister understand that?",23
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HOUSING,"Mr Speaker, it is very hard to hear the honourable member. I do not say that it is his fault; there may be some problem with the microphones. I would be grateful if he could repeat the question.",23
25,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSING,That is true. It is April Fool's Day and I do not want the House to make a fool of itself. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will repeat that part of his question which specifically states what he wishes to know from the Prime Minister. I ask honourable members to remain silent while the question is asked.,23
26,Mr UREN,HOUSING,"I pointed out that in the last 6 months of the Labor Government there was a 27 per cent increase in expenditure in the private sector of the home building industry. Now, due to the Fraser Government's pohcy, there has been a flattening out, and we believe there are indicators that there will be 7 per cent decrease in spending in the second half of this nnanciai year in real constant terms. Will the announced poUcies of the Government relating to the homes savings grants scheme further defer the recovery of the home buUding industry?",23
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HOUSING,"The conclusion drawn by the honourable member is false. The HOUSING homes savings grants scheme has been extended. If the honourable member had looked at the statement made by the Minister for Environjust ment, Housing and Community Development he would realise that instead of applying from the end of 3 years, as it was interpreted before the last election, it appUes earlier. It certainly will not defer the purchase or buUding of homes. It will be a great encouragement to people in the pursuit of home ownership, an objective that our parties have pursued always and which the Labor Party, since the days of Mr Dedman, has always sought to destroy. NA NA",23
28,Mr DRUMMOND,COMMISSION,"I direct my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. It refers to the profit or surplus of the Australian Telecommunications Commission which was reported to be $160m in a full year. Why is this body not authorised or compelled to use the loan market, as do many semi-governmental bodies, to provide money for capital works? Why should today's users have to meet increased charges to provide for future capital works and services? Why should people in outlying areas be required to pay prohibitive amounts for the installation of a basic essential, the telephone, which will be used for many years to come?",23
29,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,COMMISSION,"I am glad that the honourable member for Forrest gave 2 choices of words, either a profit or a surplus. I think the word 'surplus' is much more acceptable in terms of the financing of the Telecommunications Commission. I understand that the surplus this year is to be about $ 160m. Let us accept, firstly, that that roughly is 4 per cent on the investment of over $4,000m. The House would be aware that the Telecommunications Commission will need $850m for capital expenditure next year. Half of that amount has to be found internally and $160m is less than 20 per cent- I think it is about 18 per cent-of the requirement. The rest of the money has to be found by way of depreciation allowances, superannuation and long service funds and so on. The borrowings from the Treasury for the balance do not have to be repaid and interest is charged at the long term bond rate. If we have outside borrowings obviously the loans will have to be repaid and the interest rate will be higher. Therefore with higher interest rates there would obviously be higher charges. The notion that present users should not have to pay for privileges and facilities that people into the future will use is not a novel one. But after all, if we are going to talk about telecommunications we ought to talk about roads, bridges and schools. In thefieldof telecommunications I think the argument is less than acceptable because technology will require such updating that there will be a greater change and updating of facilities than there will be the other areas. NA",23
30,Mr UREN,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT SCHEME,Will the Prime Minister explain the inconsistencies of the Government's policy of trying to stimulate consumer spending on the one hand and on the other encouraging the deferment of spending by the introduction of the home savings grant scheme?,24
31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT SCHEME,"The honourable gentleman at least shows a degree of persistence and I suppose that is an admirable quality. The homes savings grant scheme of course is not one for the deferment of purchases of homes but it is a necessity obviously under a scheme of that kind to indicate arrangements by which people can save funds to attract the matching payments and support from the Commonwealth. I suppose that the honourable gentleman is rather unhappy at the prospect that young home buyers in particular will be provided with this kind of support from the Commonwealth when he knows quite well that it was as a result ofhis recommendation that this kind of support was being phased out by the previous Adrninistration. If his Administration had not made that decision and if he had not made that recommendation the homes savings grant scheme would haveflowedon as an active support for home buyers right throughout the period. The honourable gentleman ought to look into his own past to see where he comes out in relation to that particular matter. Our poUcies are consistent and coherent. We will certainly support the home buUding industry and the purchase of homes by people who wish to own their own homes. It was a Minister in the previous Adrninistration who got on his feet and said that in Australia at that time it was just not possible to expect people to be able to buy a 10or 11-square house; that they had to put up with a Sor 6-square house and that had to be good enough. That shows the extent to which the economic poUcies of the previous Administtation had diminished the standards in Australia. I do not think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that but rather a former honourable member who lost his seat at the last election, a former Minister for Housing. NA",24
32,Mr BURR,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development aware that under the direction of the former Federal Labor Government 70 per cent of welfare houses buUt by the States and in all funded by the Commonwealth were avaUable on only a rental basis? WUl this poUcy be continued by the present Government? Is it possible for existing tenants now to purchase the homes that they are renting?",24
33,Mr MACKELLAR,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"I am aware that under the 1973-74 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement which was introduced by the former Labor Government no more than 30 per cent of the family dwelUngs built after 1 January 1974 may be sold. The exception to this is that Tasmania was given 3 years to adjust its rate of sales down to 30 per cent. Tasmania has traditionally sold a large proportion of its dwellings. There is no restriction on the sale of houses built in previous years. Variation of the terms of the Housing Agreement is a matter of Government policy and for negotiation with the States. It is a matter for each State housing authority to decide which tenants may purchase homes they are renting. Mr Morris- Mr Speaker, Iriseon a point of order. I require that the documents from which the Minister was reading be tabled for the information of the House.",24
34,Mr SPEAKER,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,Was the Minister reading? Mr MACKellar- I was referring to notes.,24
35,Mr SCHOLES,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Standing Orders are quite clear that if a Minister quotes from a document, unless he declares that document to be confidential it must be tabled. On what basis is it determined what are notes and what is a document? Any piece of paper brought into this House and quoted from has always been deemed to be a document. The Minister has a clear out by saying that it is confidential if he wishes, but I think that for the Chair or the House to have to determine what is a document and what are notes is quite outside the Standing Orders. Mr William MCMahon- Iriseon a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw the attention of the House to standing order 321, which states: A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister or an Assistant Minister, unless stated to be confidential nature . . . shall . . . be laid on the Table. You will also be aware, Mr Speaker, that understanding order 1, when we are looking at the finitions or practices not in the Standing Orders, the rules of the House of Commons shall apply. If we look at the extract from May's Parfidential liamentary Practice, 18th edition, we will see that these conclusions arise from the discussion on page 421: The critical point is that you must distinguish between public and private docufor ments. Certain documents are ascertained or defined as being private. Classified documents need not be tabled. Intra-departmental or interfrom departmental minutes or notes or a ministerial minute need not be tabled. Sir, you will see most of the documents that have been the subject of discussion here this morning are strictly private and being private, there is no ground on orderwhich there can be compulsion to table.",24
36,Mr SCHOLES,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"On the point of order, Mr order. Speaker. Any of the documents mentioned by the right honourable gentleman are automatically declared by the Minister to be confidential. That is clearly covered by the Standing Orders this House. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I rise to support the contention that the document should be tabled. It is true that under document relating to pubhc affairs quoted from by a Minister shall, if required by any member, be laid on the table. Any questions which are put to Ministers must relate to pubhc affairs; standsay ing order 142 so states. One would concede that answer. there are some matters which are raised in quesus-ever yIt ismember tions which would not seem to have very close respect-to see whether relation to public affairs. Nevertheless, if a quesdocument. This becomes tion is asked and is allowed, one assumes does relate to public affairs. In those circumasked from the Government or stances any document quoted from by a Minister Minister obviously is prepared by in answering such a question must relate to lic affairs. You cannot say: 'The question relates to pubhc affairs; the document quoted Minister in answering the question does not relate to pubhc affairs'. They both relate to lic affairs, or neither does. In those circumstances I put it that the documents quoted from, be they departmental submissions or mere notes or clarification memoranda, are alike documents. If they quoted from there is an obUgation to table.",25
37,Mr SPEAKER,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"I am ready to rule on the matter. The Standing Orders provide that if Minister quotes from a document, unless it confidential, he can be called upon to table The practice I have adopted is to ask the whether he has read from the document, for he of a cannot quote from it unless he reads from it. I put the questionfirst:'Has the Mmister read from the document?' If he says no, he did not, I accept his word for it If he says yes, he did read from dethe document, I then put the question to him: 'Is it a confidential document?' If he says that it is, he is not required to table it. If it is not a condocument, and he has read from it, he would be required to table it. In this particular instance there was a request by the honourable member for Shortland calling upon the Minister Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to table the document. I put the question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: 'Did you read the document?' The Minister said he was referring to notes. That is the end of the matter. I that will not require the tabling of the document.",25

42,Mr WENTWORTH,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"Sir , I am supporting your standing order 321 a decision. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, there is only one point upon which I seek clarification.

He gave is every appearance of reading from a document; it. that is, in the terms of the relevant standing Minister order, of quoting from a document.",25
43,Mr SPEAKER,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"Order! I will not allow the honourable gentleman to comment on what the Minister did. If the Leader of the Opposition wants clarification from me he should put his question, and I will do my best to clarify the matter he raises. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Sir , the matter I put to you is this: You should not accept a Minister's declaration that he is not reading from a document where it has been plain for all of us to see that has been reading from a document.",26

45,Mr SPEAKER,PURCHASE OF WELFARE HOUSING,"Order! The honourable rangements member for Mackellar will please resume his seat while I deal with the point made by the Leader of the Opposidon. Quite clearly, Speaker cannot take a decision as to the actions of a Minister. The Speaker must ask the Minister what he has done. I asked that of the Minister. The Minister replied. If the observations of other honourable members are contrary to what the Minister has said, it is for honourable members themselves to proceed in whatever way they wish, if they choose to do so. For my own part, I ask any member of this House whether he said something or behaved in a certain way I will accept what that honourable member says.

Did the Prime Minister take note of the advice proffered by the honourable memsponsibUity ber for Denison in the House last Wednesday night when he said that the time for criticism of the previous Administration had run out and it was a very negative approach for the present Government to rely on criticising what was done between 1972 and 1975?

53,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,FRASER GOVERNMENT,"The honourable gentleman has obviously faUed to notice over the last three or four months-and I suppose that is not surprising-the very marked number of initiatives that the Government has taken to repair the grave and grievous damage of the previous if Administration. The monetary and fiscal policies announced and explained in clear and concise terms by my colleague the Treasurer, and the poUcies announced only this week in relation to the motor industry and home buying, are very acsignificant advances. The policies being to developed by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations also indicate a very significant advance over those developed by previous Ministers in that kind of portfolio. The honourable gentleman ought to understand that this Administration does accept refor affairs in Australia. The previous Prime Minister was a master at blaming other people for his mistakes. I see two still sitting be that hind him whom he blamed quite unjustly for mistakes that were his own. The honourable gentlemen know that full well, and I doubt very much whether either would deny it. The former Prime Minister continued to blame events overand all the rest ofit.

Can the Minister advise the steps being taken to block the loophole system and will the unsuspecting pharmacists compensated for the drugs supphed?",26
55,Mr HUNT,PRESCRIPTIONS,"Yes , I am aware of the fraudulent behaviour of certain people in Brisbane in handling falsified prescriptions to chemists. Secondly, once this information came into the hands of my Department I asked the Attorney-General's partment to make inquiries and the matter was placed in the hands of the Commonwealth Opposition PoUce. As a consequence of those investigations, 3 people have been apprehended and remanded to a hearing on 2 June. I have also made inquiries to see whether it is possible to block the loopholes to which the honourable member Petrie has referred, but I find that it is almost impossible to achieve that objective. Under terms of the National Health Act, it possible to compensate the chemists who have been the victims of this fraudulent behaviour. I should make it clear to the honourable and to all chemists that it is the responsibUity of pharmacists to ascertain whether or not tions are fraudulent.

He has no current associLeader ation with companies that may be involved in matters before the Trade Practices Commission. Additionally, Mr J. V.

The Committee shall consider the operation and effect the Act, not including Part X, and report to the Minister Prime Minfor Business and Consumer Affairs, on (a) whether the Act is achieving its intended purpose of the development and maintenance of a free and fair market, and whether Australian consumers are benefiting from the Act; (b) whether the Act is causing unintended difficulties or unnecessary costs to the Australian public, including Australian business; (c) whether in the current economic circumstances of Australia the operation of any part of the Act inhibits, or is likely to inhibit, economic recovery, contrary to the economic objectives of the Government; and (d) the measures open to the Government, by way of amendment of the Act or otherwise, to improve the operation of the Act in the light of (a), (b) and (c) above. 2. The Committee should pay panicular attention to the that the Trade Practices Act is sufficiently cerin its language to enable persons affected by it to underits operation and effect so as to be reasonably able to with its obligations in the ordinary course of 3. The Committee is asked to repon on the effect of the on small businesses and to assess whether small businesses could and should be accorded special treatment 4.

The Committee is requested to give particular attention to the application of the Act to anti-competitive conduct by employees, and employee or employer organizations. 6. In its consideration of the provisions of the Act dealing with consumer protection, the Committee is asked to give attention to any particular relationship with State laws. 7. The Committee is requested to report by 30 June 1976.",29
74,Mr HOWARD,TO REVIEW THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT,"Thes e terms of reference are wide ranging so as not to restrict the Committee's investigations into the Act and its operation. At the sametimethe terms of reference pinpoint areas of special difficulty which have been brought to the attention of the Government. For example, the Committee has been asked to give particular attention to the pohcy of the Act in relation to price discrimination and mergers. The Government does not believe that business regulation is an end in itself. The purpose of trade practices legislation is to give effect to the broad economic philosophy and objectives of the Government. One such objective of this Government is to ensure that restrictions on business activity are the minimum necessary to promote adequate competition and conditions of fair trading. The Government has deliberately imposed a tight timetable on this Committee. The Committee is to report by 30 June 1976. It is the intention of the Government that any amendments to the Act which may flow from the recommendations of the Committee will be introduced into Parliament later this year. Finally, this Committee will not be able to report effectively without assistance from all those persons in Australia who have experienced or considered the operation of this Act. I am separately requesting the Committee to consult with both employer and employee organisations and with relevant Commonwealth and State departments. I now invite any person who wishes to make a submission to the Committee to do so.

75,Mr YOUNG,TO REVIEW THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT,"by leave-The opposition regards the Trade Practices Act as being of paramount importance to the protection of consumers and proper business conduct. I give notice on behalf of the opposition that we are not going to sit idly by and watch the Trade Practices Act being dismanded either by direct Government intervention or by the more subtle means or hiding behind the recommendations of a review committee. The Trade Practices Act is in existence as a result of Australian Labor Party policy, enunciated over many years, and because of the inadequacies of the old restrictive Trade Practices Act. problems arising from the interLast week in the House I questioned the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Howard, as to the make up of the Trade Practices Act. review committee he has just announced. My concern then, as it is now, is that consumer representation has been left out in the cold. The Chairman of the Committee has been associated with a company that has been embroUed in several investigations of the Trade Practices Commission, involving massive price discrimination designed to destroy competition by selling goods below cost. The honourable memberforHiggins (Mr Shipton) might be able to inform the Minister of some of the details. Another member of the Committee is a partner of the Minister's brother in a huge Sydney law firm which acts for many business organisations which have, from the inception of the Trade Practices Act, been opposed to it. I would have Uked to see elected representatives from consumer organisations serving on the Review Committee. The corporate affiliations of both businessmen on the Committee are with groups heavUy owned and influenced overseas. All the operations of this Review Committee should be made pubhc. There has been no public demand for this Committee from consumers or from small businesses. The Committee has been estabUshed as the result of secret promises given in smoke-fiUed rooms over port and cigars to the select captains of industry during the last election campaign. It is vitally important then that the submissions to the Committee should be available for pubUc inspection and discussion. The Minister mis-states the purpose of the legislation. The Trade Practices Act was never designed or intended 'to give effect to the broad econoroic philosophy and objectives of the Government'-o r of any other Government. Competition is the main objective of the Act. Act is designed to strengthen the competitiveness of private enterprise for the benefit of the pubhc as ultimate consumers. The Minister gives no reason for singling out price discrimination mergers as 2 parucular areas for the attention the Committee. The Minister indulges in the inane rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), or at Sydney least ofhis speech writers, about tions not being an end in itself. Of course it is not. It never has been.

76,Mr COHEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is now almost 4 months since the present Government was elected to office. In that short period of it has earned a reputation as the Government that has broken more promises in a shorter space of time than any Government in Australia's hisPlanning tory. Nowhere has this been more obvious than over the faUure of the Government to make a deition. cision about the future of the Old Sydney Town project at Somersby near Gosford. Since 13 was December a cloud has hung over the future of this magnificent project that is crippling its development and shattering the morale of its The staff and aU those who are involved in and concerned about its survival. The reason for the doubts and uncertainties can be traced back to just prior to the election. An article appeared in and the Sydney Sun on 3 December 1975 headlined of 'Threat to Sydney Town-The Labor Party's F ill , says Senator'. It stated: Liberal-Country Party Senator Peter Rae says the Old Town project could be closed down. He said this might happen if the coalition parties won the coming Fedbusiness regula-eral elecuons. Senator Rae was outlining his party's policy on tourism. many areas of Labor's economic policies would be changed following their'3 years of mismanagement'. For instance, Old Sydney Town worries me', he said. Rae said the project had been the 'Labor Party's Opera House or Fl 11'. 'Already $3&m equity has been h more needed to complete the project', he 'This seems an incredible amount for one project when was only a relatively small Commonwealth budget allocated for tourism'. He said a decision will have to be made whether people 'poured money into that sort of is to impose restricinvestment'. a The candidate of the Liberal Party of Australia for the electorate of Robertson, Mr Chalmers, panicked at the report and apparently contacted Rae. A report appeared in the issue of 6 December 1975 of the Central Coast Express stating that the report in the Sydney Sun was false and that the Liberal Party, if elected to government, would maintain the Labor Government's commitment to Old Sydney Town. CounBill cUlor Chalmers also sent a telegram to the management and staff of 150 of Old Sydney Town on Amend10 December 1975 that repeated the assurances in the newspaper article. That was almost 4 months ago. Despite a question in the House during the opening week of this Parliament and nun merous newspaper articles and television programs on the subject there still has not been any statement by the Government on the future of Old Sydney Town and whether it intends to honour the commitment by the previous Government. The idea for the re-creation of the birth-place of Australia was the brainchild of Mr Frank Fox, a Sydney architect. For some 4 years prior to the time Labor Party's gaining office, Mr Fox and his advisers had worked incessantly to overcome the difficulties of the Gosford Council and the State Authority and to gain the large financial support required to bring the scheme to fruThefirstofficial visit of the former Minister for Tourism and Recreation, Mr Frank Stewart, in acceptance of my invitation to inspect the project. Frank Stewart was as impressed as I had been with the project and we were determined to ensure that, if possible, the Labor Government became involved in the project. Not long afterwards-in May 1974-the opportunity to do so presented itself and the Government bought the shares of Travelodge Australia Ltd, which comprised 25 h per cent of the shares issued, for l $317,000. At the time of the purchase of the shares a feasibility study had been done by PA Management Consultants Pty Ltd. An independent valuation by the Austrahan Mutual Provident Society was commissioned and the land was valued at $900,000 or $3,000 per acre.",31
77,Mr LUSHER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Jesus !,32
78,Mr COHEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Why don't you pull your head in. You are the biggest dope in the House, with your mate here from Riverina. I raise this point because the Auditor-General's Department and Price Waterhouse Associates Pty, appointed by the Government, have argued that the value of the land is approximately $450,000. The reason for the difference in the valuations is easy to understand if one recognises that the AMP valuation was done in 1972 at the height of the real estate boom and that the Price Waterhouse valuation was done in December 1974 at the bottom of the real estate depression. During the period from May to November 1974, prior to the unofficial opening, the Labor Government provided moneys totalling $700,000 in the form of a loan to the project. At that stage it was apparent to the new Board that the company was poorly managed from a business point of view and grossly undercapitalised. By thetimeOld Sydney Town opened it was obvious that the interest payments would be crippling and that a restructuring was necessary. At the opening the then Prime Minister stated that the Austrahan Government would invest a further $3.5m in the Old Sydney Town project. Frank Stewart proceeded to implement the Prime Minister's undertaking and made available moneys totalling $lm, pending approval of the 1975-76 Budget which contained provision for $3,075,000 for the purchase of the 78 per cent shareholding. The $400,000 in the Supply Bill was additional loan moneys. All the Government loans would be repaid once the Budget was passed. The balance outstanding from the Prime Minister's commitment of $425,000 was proposed to be provided in the 1976-77 Budget. It is most desirable that a further, building prono gram be continued gradually over the next few years to bring people back for a second, third or fourth visit. At the moment the first wmdmill, the Sydney gaol and St Phillip's Church are under construction, and the King's Head Hotel is due to start soon. Under the restructured arrangement the new shareholding will be: The Australian Government 78 per cent, the Bank of New South Wales 12 per cent and Frank Fox Development Pty Ltd 10 per cent. At the official operiing of Old Sydney Town on Australia Day 1975, the then Prime Mmister had this to say: We have since sought ways of strengthening the viability of the project to ensure not only that rising costs can be met, but the relevance, authenticity of the original idea can be maintained. We as a Government are satisfied of the real and ultimate importance to all Australia-to all Australians, and to visitors-that this project should be brought to fulfilment. Therefore, the Australian Government has decided that over the next three years we shall invest a further $3.5m in the Old Sydney Town project. The new capital of the company would be around $6m and the purchase of shares would be used to repay government loans. I stress this point to emphasise that the total Australian Government commitment would be around $4.5m if the appropriation and Budget commitment was adhered to. Old Sydney Town has been operating for one year and four months. Until 31 January 1976 there had been 588 000 visitors, of which 316 000 were adults and 245 000 were children, and there were 27 000 pensioners. By any yardstick that is a remarkable performance. These initial figures compare favourably with the only other major attraction of this type, Sovereign Hill at Ballarat. It is anticipated that by 1977 three-quarters of a million people per annum will be visiting Old Sydney Town. An interesting comparison can be made with one of Australia's most famous attractions, Taronga Park Zoo, which after being established for years attracts only 800 000 visitors per annum. A further example of the gross misrepresentations that have taken place over the viability of Old Sydney Town is exemplified in an article which appeared in the Gosford Star of last week. Mr Chalmers claimed that Old Sydney Town had made a loss for the financial year of $223,799 or $4,303 per week and that in 1975 a loss of $295,402 or $5,680 per week. The loss of $223,000 for 1974 was sustained during a period when it was not even open but was in the construction stage. The other loss was sustained when it was open for only a 7-month period. One wonders just how dishonest one can get. There is doubt that the project is presently running at a loss. The major reason for its losses is the crippling interest rate which it has to sustain. These losses will fall to virtually nothing with the new arrangements that have been made to open 5 days a week instead of seven. Immediately there will be a saving of at least $2,000 a week. The present Board is of the view that within a matter of months, given relief from the interest charges, it will be operating without any loss. That would be a remarkable achievement for a venture not yet 18 months old. However, it should be remembered that the objective of the Government investing in Old Sydney Town was not to make huge profits. Our commitment was based on the fundamental belief that, in Gough Whitlam's words, 'The project should have genuine vaUdity as a recreation, a genuine recreation, a Uving recreation of the origins of modern Sydney and modern Australia . . .'Old Sydney Town is a monument to Australia's beginnings. It will have immense value to every Australian, new, old and young, to enable them to learn of Australia's humble start. Hundreds of thousands of Australian see this as one of the great educational, historical and cultural ventures undertaken by the late Government, not to mention the enormous benefit it will be to tourism, both intranational and international. When one considers the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on education, the milUons of doUars poured into the arts, sport and recreation, and the funds now being spent on museums, few of which would have anything Uke the attendance at Old Sydney Town, is it not absurd to suggest that a few hundred thousand dollars of losses is sufficient tification to scrap the project? There is an ironic twist to Old Sydney Town's fate under the Liberals. WhUst the Federal Liberal Party is attempting to dismantle the greatest memorial to the birth of a nation ever created, the State Liberals and their counterparts in the Sydney City Council are planning to hold the 1988 Olympic Games in Sydney at a cost of hundreds of millions of doUars-the staging of the Montreal Games in 1976 will cost between $ 1,200m and $l,400m-to celebrate the bicentenary of the estabUshment of thefirstsettlement at Sydney Cove in 1788. The ultimate irony must surely be the amount of money that Australia is now spending to celebrate America's bicentenary-somethin g of which I approve-whUs t it considers abandoning the greatest memorial to its own beginnings just 12 years before the twohundredth anniversary of Governor PhUlip's landing at Sydney Cove.",32
79,Mr MARTYR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I want to say a word this morning about the farnily, from whose stable environment most of us have come. I know that honourable members opposite were probably thinking that I might say something unkind about them this morning, but I am not going to do that. I am prompted to speak on the fanuly this morning because there are good famUy men on the other side as well as on this side of the chamber. Having spoken to a number of them since coming to this place, I have come to the conclusion ttiat we all tend to take for granted this wonderful privUege that we enjoy. Another reason why I am speaking about it is that I believe there has been an overconcentration by all forms of the media in this country on the rather odd situations that substitute for fanuly relationships. I suppose the thing that concerns me more than anything else is that these odd situations might become more accepted as the norm in this country at the expense of the famUy. I suppose the third reason I am speaking about this matter is that, having read with very great interest the splendidfirstspeech made by Senator Shirley Walters in the other place, I felt that it was abouttimethat somebody in this House drew the same sort of attention that she did to the importance of the famUy. It was not so long ago that it was unheard of for anyone to speak Ul of motherhood or of the family. Today times have changed. There is a variety of attitudes on just what the family means and what the role of the mother and the father should be. There is a variety of attitudes to marriage itself and even to whether marriage is necessary to the raising of a family. With the jusadvent of easy divorce, easy contraception and abortion, there is a questioning of the old values and codes of behaviour that bound the family together and made it strong. We have nothing to fear from change itself, from questioning the old ways and from examining new ones. What I believe we have to fear today is the type of change that is developing in thinking about the fundamental role and integrity of the fanuly. What we have to fear is not the questioning but the direction that some of the pop culture answers are taking. There is, unfortunately, in the community a glib and vociferous minority which aims at destroying the fundamental famUy unit and replacing it not with anything demonstrably stronger but with alternatives that raise serious doubts about their long-term and short-term consequences. The Covenant on CivU and Political Rights of the United Nations declares: The farnily is the natural and fundamental group-unit of society and is entided to protection by society and the State. The Declaration on the Rights of the Child puts it that 'The chUd, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding . . . and shall, whenever possible, grow up in the care and under the sponsibility ofhis parent'. Nearer home our own Liberal Party federal platform says: The family is a cohesive force in society and the Party recognises the necessity for strengthening Mr MCVeigh-It is the basis of society.",33
80,Mr MARTYR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is right and I thank the honourable member for Darling Downs. But how can our sensible ideals be upheld, especially in this time of change when the heart of the home, the woman, the mother, is being inveigled out into the workforce and children are more more being farmed out to professional quasiInflation parents? Dora Russell, former wife of the later Bertrand Russell and certainly one who could never be accused of any reUgious bias towards Ufe, spoke recendy of the world's deep need real mothering. She beUeved that the lack of mothering was the root of many of the problems of today's world. A recent survey showed that far the majority of Australian women really want to be wives and mothers and to remain in the home. This may have surprised some but not anyone with any perception of how closely linked are women's biological capacity to bear chUdren and the deep instinctive desire of the majority of women to fulfil themselves through that capacity. I agree with Dora Russell and many others that the rootless instability of so many young people and the problems arising from it stems part at least from their lack of warm fuU-tirne mothering. But how can they get it when so many mothers work, either for economic necessity or because they have been conned by feminist movements and propaganda into believing the live role of mother in the home is somehow a demand graded one- a kept woman as one of the memto bers of those movements put it, a vegetable? The bearing of a child is described by Paul EhrUch, that great gentleman, as a 9-months disease and the chUd itself is presented in many quarters as an evU and a menace to the human race. Unforfor tunately, much of the feminist movement is rejection of the mothering role. So also is any government action which forces or even encourrecourse ages women to leave the home and their vital work of mothering and go out into force. I want to emphasise that I do not deny women the right to choose their Ufestyle in community provided that their choice does not impinge on therightsof others. But I do believe that a change in emphasis is needed in this comtheir munity back to upholding the value and integrity of the mother being avaUable to her husband and chUdren and fulfilling herself,findingher reward, in their stabUity and gradual growth to rematurity. I believe that this Government should do everthing it can, particularly in its statements and policies, to bring this about. After all it is Liberal government statements which should give the its innuence. country guidance and leadership. I believe we should upgrade the special nature of the woman as wife and mother within the home, encourage more women to take up that role and restore its pride, and remove from our society any pressures that might militate against any woman choosing that role if she wishes. Two and of these pressures are inflation and taxation. makes the every day balancing of the family budget a heart breaking impossibility without the added income from a mother's earnings. Therefore I support wholeheartedly every for measure that this Government proposes towards this curbing inflation. The burden of direct and indirect taxation also falls heavUy on the family by and undoubtedly is one factor in forcing women out to work, even though this adds to the famUy's overaU tax bUl. I urge this Government to do everything it can to lessen the burden of direct and indirect taxes on the famUy income. One aspect of taxation is often overlooked, I believe, when considering the stability of the family as the basic unit of a community. This is the inevitablefinancialcost to the community of what is sometimes caUed the permissive or libertarian society. This question was raised by Mr in Justice Megarry of the EngUsh High Court of Justice in his fifth Riddell Lecture in 1972 and his comments perhaps are even more pertinent today. He showed how this libertarian society involves not merely a claim for absoluterightsto according to one's own desires but also a defor facUities for that lifestyle. He pointed the cost of doctors, lawyers and social help when drug taking gets out of hand. He talked of the cost to the community of clinics and hospitals and social help for venereal diseases and abortion clinics as a result of a demand by libertarians their permissive Ufestyle. He pointed to the a cost of the facUities demanded by those who opt for the alternative society whUe stUl demanding to the food, medical, dental, legal and other services which the alternative society does the worknot and cannot provide. To this can be added the cost of chUd care the centres demanded at government expense by those who insist on theirrightto farm out their children. Granted, these people pay taxes but if demands are met to the full the rest of the community, including the family where the mother remains at home, must cany part of the cost. There is therefore injustice and a species of insanity in a situation where the famUy must bear a share of the cost of the consequences of a style which inherently is at war with the farnily concept. The new lifestyles, therefore, raise very serious members questions of economic cost and There is a hmit to the proportion of the gross and its organisation national product which governments can take in taxadon. In the United Kingdom the Government already is taking 60 per cent of the nation's output. If money is spent by government on vetrade. nereal disease clinics, drug treatment and assesshas ment centres, abortion climes, social workers child care centres for working parents there less, in simple cash terms, to be spent on the genuinely poor, the deserted wives, husbands and children, the widows and the abandoned old. It is not a moral but a social question to deterin mine spending priorities and I urge the GovernAsian ment to look closely and carefully at its priorities so that it not only does nothing to penalise the family but actually encourages its growth strength. The Liberal Party's federal platform sums it up particularly well when it says: Liberals acknowledge the vital contribution of the in the development of the individual and, if the having difficulty fulfilling that task, the community come to its aid. In this context the Government is the community and I urge the Government to do all it can courage women back into the home so the family is not deprived of its heart. Finally I draw attencent, tion to the magnificent statement yesterday the Liberal Party leader in the Austrahan Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, Dr Hughes, in which he called for an increase in child ment. I think this would be one of the factors which would encourage women to stay at home instead of going out into the workforce.",34
81,Mr CHARLES JONES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to bring a matter to the attention of the Government, particularly to the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). I refer to the introduction into Australian shipping on 15 AprU of a Russian shipping line known as FESCO Australia way. Limited or the FESCO Australia Line. It is conter troUed by the Soviet snipping agency in Moscow which is known as Sovinflot. This is a the nationaUsed organisation of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist RepubUcs. It has up agencies in all of the major trading counthat tries-in the United Kingdom, in Belgium, in Netherlands, West Germany, Portugal, Japan and Singapore. Now is has set up a simUar Une Australia. Here it is known as Opal Maritime Agencies Pty Ltd of which the Russian Sovinflot lifeagency holds 75 per cent of the shares and James Patricks and Company Pty Ltd, an Australian organisation, holds 25 per cent. Honourable would reaUse that James Patricks and social priorities. is one ofthewere Co. Pty Ltd brought into the deal because it large shipping agencies in Australia could be used to get trade. The question that arises is whether there is a need for the FESCO Australia Line to enter the There is no need for it. This trade already adequate shipping tonnage provided by the and existing shipping Unes which have been servicing is it for some considerable time. The Australian National Line already has 2 ships in the trade. I do not have time to spell this out in detaU but ANL has two containerships in this trade. With two other ships it is servicing the South East Asian trade. It is also having a ship constructed Japan to provide an additional service for the and Japanese trade. AU told Australia is very much involved in the Japan-Australia and the Asia-Australia trade. There is no need for this and new shipping Une to enter the trade. I have a hst of the ports that this shipping line family will be visiting. The first ship will sail from family is Vladivostok on 15 AprU and there will be a 15 must per cent discount on the freight rates. If the Conference line and the other shipping lines reduce their freight rates by 15 per cent-and they to enwiU-w e know from past experience that the Soviet line will reduce them by another 15 per 20 per cent or 30 per cent. On the basis of by that line's performance in other countries throughout the world, this 15 per cent discount is only thefirstbid and shippers can negotiate even endowgreater discounts, if necessary. I bring to the attention of the Government and the Ministers concerned just what is happeningthey know of it-and the fact that there is no whatever by the Government to do anything about it. For example, some 3 weeks ago Mr Swayne, the chairman of Overseas Containers Ltd and the Australia-Japan Container Line, came to Australia especially to warn the Minister for Transport of just what was under I regret to say that, even though the Miniswas aware that I would be speaking on a shipping subject today, I do not see him anywhere in chamber. This once again indicates that he has no regard for what is happening, in the same set way as he indicated to Mr Swayne, I understand, he was not concerned about the shipowners' the problem; he was concerned about the shippers and their shipping problem. Also, Mr Neville in Jenner, the Chairman of the Australian National Line, was interviewed on this subject. The article, pubUshed in the Daily Commercial News and Shipping List on Friday, 12 April, on that interview, stated: In an exclusive interview yesterday, Mr Jenner Australian National Line provided a top-grade service shippers on a commercial basis. With this in mind, it naturally must be concerned the threat of competition designed to entice away its He said it was too early to comment further on possible effects of the Russian compeution as the ships begun calling at Australian ports. He did say, however, that shippers would no doubt mind the longer term situation and weigh it up against any immediate advantage which may be given from accepting lower freight rates offered at this time. Mr Jenner was dealing with the subject about rency which I am talking. So Mr Swayne, the leader of have a Russian one of the leading shipping interests of the in the world. Yesterday world, and Mr Jenner, the Chairman of our own replied to the honourable national shipping line, the largest Australian par- (Dr Richardson). Dealing ticipant in foreign trade, expressed concern.

This line trades not on the basis competitive prices or the economic operation its ships but purely and simply in order to Russian ships in a particular country's trade. Every Western country today is concerned about tralian this. When I was in Europe in June last year I was approached-becaus e the discussions were more or less on a confidential level I feel that I am not free to name the people who spoke to me-by people who stated that all the leading people in European shipping are concerned about the way the Soviet Union is expanding its shipping ations throughout the world today. The Soviet Union is one of the minor trading countries probably has less trade than most other counabout tries; but it is the sixth largest shipping nation the world today. I emphasise that point to the very few Government supporters who are sitting in the chamber now. Every country is concerned about the way the Soviet Union is expanding shippingfleet.When I was in Europe I indicated to the people with whom I spoke that I, too, was concerned and was prepared to look closely at the matter and to talk to them at a future date. am sorry to say that those people are not in a ition at least to receive a sympathetic reception from a Minister of the Australian Government. This unsympathetic attitude is simUar to the frigid reception the 2 shipping representatives got from the present Minister for Transport on expired. this very important subject. I indicate clearly to honourable members. I am reaUy concerned about the intrusion of Soviet shipping Une into activities in Australia. This Une is developing a trade wherein it will take out of Europe on the Trans-Siberian Railsaid the way-I am talking now in terms of Asian, South to East Asian and Japanese-Australian trade-as much of the container trade as it can and take it about to the port of Nakhodka, from where it will be clients. shipped to Japan, Australia, Singapore or whatever ports the line is servicing. It appears to me have not that the Government is not really concerned about what is happening. The Russians apbear in proach the matter on the basis of the trade being a foreign currency earner and part of an export industry. By this means they will earn export cursee it in the form of income from freight. They as a major part of their foreign policy to presence in almost every country the Minister for Defence member for Tangney with the United Minister and the on several Western Australia by the United States will be welcomed of by this Government. From the attitude of the of Minister for Transport and the Government as a have whole, the Minister for Defence should have added that with the entry of FESCO into Austrading we welcome our great friend the Soviet Union into Australian trade and its use of Australian ports, because that is what it means to have Australian ports used by Soviet shipping. AU Government supporters in the Address-inReply debate on the Governor General's Speech laid great stress on free enterprise. Where are the opergreat free enterprisers today? What will the Government do about this? What will the and Government's great free enterprise Minister do it? Nothing. Up to this point he has given in the Australian and overseas shipping Unes the cold shoulder. They can look for no comfort from Nixon or this Government. BUateral agreements simUar to those of the airUnes are needed. There its should be an endorsement of the Geneva liner conference which provided for a 40-40-20 proposition whereby the exporting nation carries 40 per cent of the trade, the importing nation likeI wise carries 40 per cent and 20 per cent goes to poscross traders. The resources, facUities and means to deal with this problem are at our disposal but the Government will not pick it up.",35

Mr Charles Jones- Mr Deputy Speaker, when people make statements that are deUberately untrue and they know that they are untrue, it is a lie, and you know that that is a Ue.",37
85,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! The honourable member is now compounding the offence that he committed in the first place. gest that he withdraw the remark without making a comment on what has been said. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Deputy Speaker, out of regard for you and the Standing Orders I shall withdraw the statement and say that the honourable member's remarks were a great and total untruth. Mr BOURCfflER-I wiU not go into that matter. I did get the information correctly. I also draw the attention of the honourable member for Newcastle to the Standing Orders of the House which state that he should address honourable members, especiaUy Ministers, by theirtitles.Instead of saying 'Nixon', he should have said 'the Minister for Transport'. Perhaps one day he will pay that courtesy. Today I should like to talk on 2 housing measures announced recently by this Government. The first is the States grants legislation to transfer funds for housing from the Commonwealth to the States. I shall not speak about a Bill that is before the House- I say that in case anybody gets awfuUy excited about that- I just want to draw a parallel and in doing so to mention the other legislation that we are proposing to introduce, namely, that deaUng with the home savings grant scheme. I should like to draw a parallel with what the previous Government did or did not do for housing. Members of the Opposition are very vocal on this issue. I should Uke to sum up by suggesting a couple of points that perhaps could amend both of these schemes. First the Labor Government promised home owners many things. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), when he was Minister for Housing, said that the Labor Government would provide $6m to buUd some 1500 homes. This was in 1972, honourable members might be surprised to know. In 1972 the cost of houses was somewhere around $10,000, $12,000 and $14,000 respectively around the various parts of the Commonwealth. Apparently the honourable member for Hughes thought he was back in 1902 when he was allowing $4,000 a home. Of course we have come to learn over the 3 years that the Labor Government had no knowledge at all in the fields of management or business expertise otherwise the Minister might have had some of his homework done for him and been properly enlightened. However, he did not last very long; as is the usual custom with Ministers who have faUed, he was sacked and transferred. Then another Minister took over. This Mmister made a magnificent statement. He promised that there would be absolutely no reduction in the 1975-76 grant. He said that the I sugamount of money being spent on housing would not be less than in the previous nnanciai year. Within about 2 months of that statement, out came the Budget and we found a $69m reduction in the amount provided. This is of course indicative of the way in which this former Government behaved during the 3 years it was in office. Let me remind the House of just one thing which the Labor Government very willingly wished to introduce. Fortunately the people of Australia executed the vote that prevented it. I refer to the report of the Priorities Review Committee which recommended such proposals as the abolition of land tax and rates as a tax deduction. This would have been a slanted attack against many of the average people in this country. It advocated the imposition of a building tax against owner-occupiers. In other words, if a person were prudent and worked hard to get his own home, this former Government was going to introduce measures to make sure that he paid an added levy against his already high income tax. It suggested the creation of a new tax equal to the rental value of a person's home to be added to his income. For example, if a person's house was worth $25,000, an amount of $1,875 a year would be added to his income for tax purposes. Fortunately for the people of this country they woke up in time and they got rid of this socialist government. Then the Labor Government introduced the Housing Corporation Bill. This was originally designed to nationalise the Australian building industry totally. There is no doubt about that. The Labor Government's plans were quite specific. The Bill was to allow the acquisition of land for purposes associated with dwellings, the development of facUities and services such as headworks, power suppUes, transport, etc. and the lease of land, buildings, etc. to any person use-anythin g incidental to the Government's powers and the pursuit of the Government's overall objectives m regard to urban and social economic development. This meant that the Government could enter the field of buying and selling, taking over companies-a U sorts of things that this former Government had in its platform of nationalisation. It is in the Labor Party's form and has been spelt out often enough. In the dme left to me I should Uke to touch briefly on the 2 proposals introduced into the House and to mention in parucular the States Grants legislation to provide funds for housing. believe it would be in the interest of owners if the Government were to arrange that the subsidy to the co-operative housing societies were to be deleted in a period of up to 10 years. This subsidy is part of the money provided to States and is paid to those income earners earn up to $ 150-odd a week. They can borrow have money at 4 per cent to 5 per cent over 30 years. this subsidy were to be deleted in a period of to 10 years it would mean for example that a son who went into one of these co-operatives some 10 years ago would be paying a of ridiculously smaU amount at today's inflated income of about $ 10 a week off his interest. By Ufting his interest rate at the end of 10 years to about 10 per cent he would still be paying only about $13 or $14 a week, but that would aUow the co-operative societies to borrow money against that income at 9 per cent or 10 cent and to lend it out again at 4 per cent or cent-at the base rate. It would provide an enorGeneral mous fund for home ownership for young tioner people. It would be the most positive step that both Commonwealth and State governments son's could take. I intend to discuss this at great with the Minister concerned. I know that he is interested and I know that the matter will receive attention. It will not cost the Government thing, because it has already started the loans. This would mean that the young people this country who are unable to get housing mission homes because of their incomes would be eligible to getfinanceon this basis. Reverting to our home savings scheme, the only disappointment I have with this schemehave mentioned this to the Minister and I understand and I hope that it is being further considered-relate s to the existing scheme which provided for $750 for those who have saved over the 2-year term. This scheme was introduced by us back in 1970-71. It is a scheme which the for Labor Party refused to upgrade. It did not allow for inflation. In those days to qualify, a person had to build his home for no more than $22,500 including the cost of land. Today, I think even the honourable member for Newcastle would agree, that would be virtually impossible. I suggest that this amount, this ceiling, should be lifted to at least $30,000 or $34,000. It would not platcost the Government any more because it has already been budgeted for in the last Budget. I am not suggesting adding money to the scheme; I am merely saying that, by lifting this ceUing, those people eUgible for a homes savings grant under the existing scheme could use some of the money that is avaUable. Once the funds had run I out that would be just too bad, because only a all home certain amount was budgeted for. Again this would be a positive step to help the young people in this country who are eligible, who who have been waiting for this grant and who not been able to get it because of the lack of If foresight, the lack of initiative and the lack of up management of the socialist government which perwas interested only in making sure that people did not own their own homes and that the people this country were reduced to renting homes and being servants of a centralist, socialist his principal plus government.",37
86,Mr JAMES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"On 25 February last, a petition was read by the Clerk conceniing a matter of Crown privUege. This is per contained on pages 251 and 252 of Hansard. It 5 per was lodged for presentation by the Attorney(Mr Ellicott). I do not think the petiwas one of his relatives, so the Attorney General would not mind my mentioning the pername in this House. The petition was from length a man called Sankey who apparently is a part owner of a girlie bar in Sydney. At the time no one paid any attention to it. Then on 16 March anythe honourable member for Bradfield (Mr initial Connolly) asked the Prime Minister (Mr of Malcolm Fraser) a question about the petition. comThis is on pages 632 and 633 of Hansard. The honourable member for Bradfield seemed to be a favoured Dorothy, but then, as we in this House know, his uses are limited. It seemed extraordinary at the time that any Minister, let alone the Prime Minister, should intervene in this I matter by arranging a Dorothy Dix question. Why this relationship between the Prime MinisCooma-i ter and the honourable member for Bradfield? suggest that perhaps they became friends when the honourable member for Bradfield was a minor figure in the diplomatic service and the Prime Minister was seeking an outlet for his ergies abroad. Perhaps it was Attorney-General was not prepared, as we know, to dirty his hands carrying buckets. WhatSpeaker, ever the reason, the Prime Minister took and with are sub answered the quesuon and pointed related to a curious action in the Queanbeyan Court of Petty Sessions. It seems that this Mr Sankey has brought a citizen's information against the former Prime Mmister, my Leader, and 2 former Ministers of the Labor Governgest ment and a judge of the High Court, alleging refer conspiracy. The Prime Minister obviously a great deal about the action. In the National Times of 22 March 1976 Mr Sankey Government to help him out with his legal costs because he was poor. I suggest that he must be the only man in Sydney to own a girlie bar and remain poor; but then his tax has not yet been indexed. There are a number of very curious things about this action and its sponsors. There seems be a fairly incestuous relationship between of the principal figures engaged in prosecuting the action. When Mr Sankey was a young man, he got into trouble in Sydney, as I recall, by ing a false alibi to one of his unsavoury clients. He was implicated in the case of Daren and Stuart Harold Tange which was heard in the Court of Quarter Sessions in South Wales in June 1971. Tange was Sankey's you are doing. chent and Sankey gave detailed evidence as to the time and place of meeting with Tange. one. Unfortunately Tange was committing an armed whole robbery at the sametime.The police believedand they were decent police officers-that proceeds of the robbery found their way to Sankey, but they were harassed in their attempt to pursue the matter. Questions are now being placed on the notice paper in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly which may shed more light on the Tange affair. The barrister acting for Mr Sankey in Queanbeyan was also involved in the Tange case and apparently shared chambers with Mr Sankey during the latter's brief, ill-fated career as a rister. Oddly enough, the barrister is also friend, I regret to say, of Mr Leo, S.M., the magistrate hearing the conspiracy case. It seems they have worked together before. That was the inquiry into the tragic bus disaster in Cooma in 1973. I would be the last one to criticise imputation. t has worthy people of all types-bu t it I has been alleged to me that there is not a great deal of night hfe there and as a result Mr Rofe, Sankey's barrister, and Mr Leo were able to see a lot of each other.

These are serious questions which deserve the urgent attention of the Attorney-General who will not be a toady to anyone according to the impression he has given honourable members. Vexatious actions of this sort have only one purpose-to divert the atten- $60. tion of the pubUc from the excesses of the squattocracy running the Government and to seek to keep the Opposition from being an effective force in this Parliament. If members ofParliament and the judiciary can be harassed in this case, parliamentarians wiU find their time and enercountry gies misdirected to self-defence against vexatious legal actions. One could envisage a conspiracy case against the Attorney and his cousin in a suit for conspiracy to commit fraud under the tax if laws against the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premier of Victoria. And, I need hardly add, that the Queensland Premier would need to maintain a permanent gaggle of barrisof ters. We would not want that would we? We cercities tainly would not. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, deUvered would agree with that.",40
93,Mr OKEEFE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"One of the worse pieces of legislation to be introduced into this place has been legislation which divided then Postmaster-General's portfoUo into the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Postal Commission. Members of the National Country Party of Australia spoke against this division at the time the legislation before the House. Of course.the division was a fait accompli and we all now know the results. The 18c charge to post a letter in Australia represents the highest rate of postage in the world. As I travel throughout my electorate I am informed by postmasters in the towns and villages that the quantity of maU has fallen by from 17 per cent to 20 per cent. They fear that if this trend continues they will lose their jobs. The present postage rate is a tremendous load for small businesses and people living in country districts and the cities to carry. As I said, Australia has the highest postage rate of any country. Yet we are putting up with this situation. We are not expressing considerable opposition in this place to this high rate. I believe that we should be using everything in our power to influence the Minister There for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) to get on to the Postal Commission to help in this see what can be done. Other impositions are placed on us every few weeks. Just recently the fee for maU bags used on country runs has increased from $15 to $30. The used to be $4. But in 1974 it rose to $15. The Postal Commission the other day issued instructions that maU bags used in the country maU bag service will cost $30. People living in the farflung areas of Australia are having this burden placed on them. I note that in Tasmania the cost of a country maU bag is of the order of We on this side of the House are asking the Minister to get on to the Postal Commission to see whether this iniquitous fee, which is out of all all proportion, can be reduced. Mail bags used in maU services are owned by individuals who also provide the locks for the bags. The service provides a great means of mail delivery. Many country people will cease to use the service this fee is to continue. People in country areas are being isolated by the delays that are taking place in maU services. Mail has taken three, four and five days to be delivered from country areas New South Wales to the city. Indeed, in the it is taking two or three days for mail to be into the suburbs. The cost of postage of periodicals and papers throughout Australia is exorbitant, and local newspapers and the printers of journals are very concerned with the problems they face in that field. We have heard the recently that the ordinary letter rate might be increased to 23 cents, and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications should be informed that we expect him to see that some sanity is brought to bear on the Postal Commission. As businessmen we realise that goods have to be sold in quantity, but apparently the Postal Commission does not believe that. It believes that all it has to do is to keep putting up the prices. It is losing a great quantity of business and people are using mail courier services. IPEC, Comet and others are reaping the benefits of the exorbitant postal fees because people are sending mail through those services and that represents a loss to the Commission. The Australian Telecommunications Comthe experience, mission produced a net profit of $67.lm in its National Country first 6 months of operation. That is the biggest men communicating profit ever disclosed by any business or corporthey ation in this country and indicates that the price of some of the telecommunication services connection should be reduced. Telephone calls have gone up Minister from 5 cents to 9 cents, trunk Une fees right that across the nation have been increased, and telephone phone rentals have been inceased by $27. It community would appear that if the Commission can produce a profit of $67. lm then it ought to be able to reduce the cost of the services it provides. country areas and in the cities people who have lodged appUcations for telephone services are being told that it could take 2 years or more provide them. One of the district telecommuniGovernment cations centres in my area informed me today that it has 1015 applications for telephones and the district telephone engineer says that there shortage of cable. A shortage of cable means there is a shortage of funds to buy cable. I underassociated stand that plenty of cable is avaUable from the manufacturers but the problem lies in the aUowork. cation of funds to buy new cable to give people telephone connections. I believe that the Telecommunications Comalone. mission ought to be looking at these factors and giving the people of Australia the sort of telehave phone services to which they are entitled. In tain country areas subscribers to exchanges situthat ated 20 miles or 30 miles away from a main are being charged for trunk Une caUs to that town, the town where they transact their business and get their goods and groceries and necessities of Ufe. In some instances the exchanges have from 17 to 27 subscribers, which is only a small ring to telephone locaUy, yet when they teleunderstand phone to the main town they are charged a trunk line rate. I think that that system needs to be looked at and revised by Telecom. There has do been considerable comment in the Press on this matter, and in the Age of 8 March an article headed 'Telecom profit: caU for probe' stated: statedThe Victorian Employers Federation yesterday called for a public inquiry into the operation of the Australian Telecommunicauons Commission. It went on to say that Telecom had announced a profit of $67.lm and that it was estimated that if that rate of profit continued the Commission would have made a profit of $ 160m at the end of 12 months trading. As a businessman, I say that needs to be looked at. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications should look at the operation of the Commission and ensure that better services, more facUities and more telephones are made avaUable to applicants. Business cannot be transacted without a telephone, and I have had as no doubt other members of the Party have, of small businesswith me and saying that want a telephone but are being denied a for the reasons that I have given. The should get on to Telecom and ensure its great profit is used to provide more teleconnections and better services at cheaper rates to business people and to the Australian generally. In both Mr GARRICK (Batman) (12.36)- I rise to speak today because of recent moves in the field of employment and industrial relations, or more to accurately the draconian way in which the Fraser has taken the axe to the innocent and the weak in thisfield.Under this Government Jesus Christ would be ineligible for unemis a ployment benefit. They would declare him a that vagrant, they would say he dressed poorly and with undesirables, wore a beard and was a carpenter who left his trade to live without Worse than that, he would be regarded as a mindless visionary with no right to the public purse. Be that as it may, draconian measures are insensitive and are to be condemned for that What is worse is the vUe arrogance of this Government in its execution of such policies. I repeatedly raised this characteristic of the cerpresent Government in this place, but it seems the total elitism is inextricablytiedup with townthe leaders' phUosophy. They are men who are white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, heirs of squattocracy and big business interests, rich beyond comprehension of most Australians, people who have not known poverty or war or even the mundanity or nuisance of city Ufe. How would they the real tragedy of people being out of work? No doubt it would be difficult but not impossible if they would try. But they will not or not try because it suits them not to. I wish to quote from page 581 of last week's edition of Nation Review, where Mungo MACCallum Mr Sullivan-Ha , ha.",40
94,Mr GARRICK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"If the honourable gentleman would listen he might learn something. Mungo MACCallum stated: In the lexicon of Malcolm Fraser, 'bludger' means who can't get a job. 'Dole bludger' means someone can't get a job who is receiving the unemployment benefit, and 'dole cheat' means someone who can't get the son he wants and is still receiving the unemployment benefit. He continued: The new provisions read as though they have been deliberately designed to inflict the maximum possible ship and personal humiliation on Australia's 200 unemployed. Or, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have it, Australia's 200 000 bludgers. Despite the fact that the experts say that in truth there are very few real dole cheats, this Government holds the cretinous view, the bourLaurence geois and prejudiced view, that people who do not work or who cannot work are bludgers, that the lower class which the Prime Minister might be able to exist, however poorly, without putting a lot of effort into it. The fact that nine out of every ten people without work are sufferfind ing hardship does not concern the Government worse or those on the other side. That is made even much more ugly by the fact that it is so hypocritical. The Prime Minister is a man of considerable reaction inherited wealth who has never worked at anywhole thing in his Ufe in terms of the possibilities to the people he labels as bludgers. The same arrogant, inhumane and eUtist attiGovernment tude which says that if a young person from a poor famUy, without assets, wants to look around for agreeable work with good prospects and is unemployment benefits then he is a bludger, also says that if another young chap with assets who can Uve with his family for a while does the same thing, then society admires him and describes what he is doing as looking for work. As an outenjoy growth of that we have the spectacle of the farming community, which accepts and in fact expects federal aid for its beef operations grazing requirements but bitterly opposes aU social programs that do not concern it. Worse, rejects the phUosophy behind programs not rectly helping it as being a sociaUst drain on the public purse. This animosity to bludgers has made unemployment a dirty word, and has hidin den the really horrendous experiences of being without work. The Government's new crackenough down on those receiving benefits will make Ufe even harder for the genuinely out of work but, according to the conservative plulosophy, this OK as long as they catch the bludgers. This simple-minded phobia with bludgers, the numerical strength of whom is unknown and irrelevant to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) is taking on sirnilarities to, and the dangers of,riddinga anyone neighbourhood of a stray cat. The Minister, like who the cat chaser, is so preoccupied with catching the offender that in trying to poison the minority ofjob or stray animal he lulls everyone else's cat in the district. In the analogy, killing all cats in the neighbourhood is a big price to pay when you cannot be sure you will get the stray. Similarly, hardsingle-minded chasing of dole bludgers will drag 000 down the majority of legitimately unemployed people. However, apart from the ludicrous nature of the game the Minister is playing, what reaUy concerns me is the fact that this prejudice against aUeged dole bludgers ignores the real aU tragedy of people out of work. Social welfare worker Graeme Brewer of the Brotherhood of St has found that the ratio of jobless people to job vacancies stands at 11 to one, and for young people it is even higher. He said in the despises Age on 29 January 1976: When I returned to Australia last year 1 was amazed to all this 'scapegoating' of the unemployed. It's far, far than in Britain where the unemployment problem is greater. I think it's because Australia is basically a country of vast middle-class affluence and this blinds people to the real problems of unemployment . . . this violent to a tiny number of dole cheats has clouded the issue and a lot of out-of-work people with serious open problems are suffering as a result. WhUe all this talk of bludgers preoccupies the free-thinking and perceptive legislators of the side, they are in simple fact hiding the truth that nothing is being done to solve the very real problems of unemployment. It is in fact on a cunning, cynical and utterly vile use of the oldest trick in the book, the red herring. It is similar to the Jew-baiting tactics used by Hitler. Really and truly, how many people want and living on the pittance they receive on the rural dole? Does this miniscule number of people really put an overly large burden on the federal or coffers? Of course not. The whole issue is a smokescreen to distract people from the truth of it the matter. That truth is that this Government dihas not done and will not do anything to allay the suffering of the huge majority of legitimately and hurtfuUy unemployed. Quite the opposite is fact happening. Current government policy is only making the hardship worse. The dole is not to Uve on as it is. Yet the Government is making it harder to get and even harder to keep. It is the age-old Liberal-National Country Party is trick of bleeding the wealth from those who really need it and giving it to those who are already wealthy. I do not know how honourable members opposite can live with themselves in the knowledge that it is people like the unemployed and the pensioners who subsidise large landholders and big business. In their view, the unemployed must be kicked from pillar to post to enable the Government to allocate money for a superphosphate bounty. According to the Government, it is untenable that a worker should get $37 a week from the Government, but it is legitimate for economic fat cats not to pay tax. It is the same argument that says: It is fair for the business lunch of steak and martinis to be tax deductible, but not for the working man's lunch of peanut butter sandwiches. Possibly the most dangerous part of these attitudes is the short sightedness of them. The fact simply is that never again will Austraha have the low unemployment we came to expect in the 1960s. No doubt for short periods in our future the pool of unemployed workers will be greatly reduced, but over a long period it is just not on. Australia, Uke England and the United States of America, has a degenerthrough ate Western capitalist economy. Such economies, or the controUers of them, have no place for employment. It is not in their interests. still though, automation as a growing characternational istic can only add to the problem if there is not good deal of thought leading to rationalisation. This Government and aU pohcy makers should contemplation. take a good long look at the obvious trends economy. Whether or not 'government planeradication ning' is a dirty expression for the bourgeoisie, has to become a reaUty in this economy. If we leave economic growth and development in the hands of the disparate or, of necessity, selfish groups known as capital, then like the United States we will have to come to terms with consistand ent unemployment levels of over 5 per cent. Mindless utterances about dole bludgers drainers of the pubUc purse will not alter the situknow, ation. Loud, intransigent and meaningless conthis charge. demnations of those unfortunate enough to be unemployed will not take the problem away. here and needs recognition and subsequent plandrawn ning. I call on the Minister to stop his illcharge disguised game of smokescreening. He is fooling no one and hurting many.",42

98,Mr SINCLAIR,LIVESTOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Livestock Slaughter Levy Act 1964-1974 to provide for the introduction of a further component to the livestock slaughter levy of $1 per head on cattle slaughtered on and after 1 July 1976. The proposed levy is designed to offset the Commonwealth contribution to national endemic catde disease eradication programs in Australia the operation of a trust account, which will be established under the terms of the compfull lementary Bill, the Livestock Slaughter Levy Worse Collection Amendment Bill 1976. The only cattle disease eradication campaign a presently in operation is that for brucellosis and tuberculosis. No other is presently in in our The national brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign was commenced in 1970. it At that time the Commonwealth Government contribution was by way of direct grants to the States from consolidated revenue.

As honourable members will legislation was recently passed to suspend It is The Industries Assistance Commission has attention to the inequities of the export for brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication and its replacement by the slaughter levy proposed in this Bill has the support of industry organisations.

100,Mr SINCLAIR,APPLE AND PEAR STABILIZATION," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. purpose of this Bill, the Apple and Pear StabUization Export Duty Amendment Bill 1976 and the Apple and Pear StabUization Export Second Reading Duty CoUection Amendment Bill 1976 is to the Commonwealth apple and pear scheme to cover the 1976 export season for apples and pears. The scheme has operated over the 1971 to 1975 export seasons. LiveThe Industries Assistance Commission has inquired into the need beyond the 1975 season for Commonwealth Governmentfinancialsupport for the stabUisation of returns to growers from exports of fresh apples and pears. In its interim report, the Commission recommended the continuation of this scheme on a modified basis for the 1976 season. These BUls give effect to the Government's depurposes of the accept announced the on 27 February this year, to Commission' s recommendations. The eradication recommendations in respect apples were that same scheme in 1976 be $2 per box and the under support the maximum quantity eligible for support be 2 million boxes. Support should be confined to sales 'at risk' to norEurope, including the United Kingdom. Previously, stabUisation support for apples covered aU apples exported on an 'at risk' basis. The Government has also accepted the recommendathe tions of the Commission in respect of stabilissupport for the 1976 pear exports. 'The the recommendations were that the maximum level of price support be 80c per box and the maxiin mum quantity eUgible for support be 1.4 mUlion boxes. Support would be confined to 'at risk' sales to Europe, including the United Kingdom, be and North America, whereas under previous of stabilisation arrangements all pears exported on an 'at risk' basis were covered by stabUisation support. The opportunity has also been taken to convert units and quantities referred to in the legislation to metric units, and to bring the language in the existing legislation into Une with current drafting practices. The term 'reputed bushel' referred to in the Act has been replaced with the term 'reputed box' in accordance with the terminology currendy in use within the try and approved by the Metric Conversion Board. During the 1971 to 1975 seasons the apple and pear stabilisauon scheme has provided for the establishment of a support price for the season for each variety of apples and pears. The support price has been calculated each season in line movements in growers' cash costs as assessed by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The 'average export return' for each variety was determined at the end of the season from actual sales. Where the 'average export return' for apples or pears was less than the 'support price' a payment equal to the difference was made to growers exporting that variety 'at risk'. Overall Umits were placed on support to provide for a maximum rate of 80c per bushel on a total of 4.4 million bushels. The maximum quantity eUgible for support was increased for the 1972 season only to 4.9 rnillion bushels. Where the 'average export return' was greater than the support price a charge was levied on the relevant growers. A Umit on the grower charge equivalent to the Umit on the payments from the funds has been appUcable. Varietal stabilisation funds were established, into which Government and industry contributions were paid and from which payments to growers were made. Provision for imposition and collection of the charge liable to be levied on growers in the circumtances I have just outlined is made in the Apple and Pear StabUization Export Duty Act 1971 and the Apple and Pear StabUization Export Duty Collection Act 1971-1973, respectively. The purpose of the Apple and Pear Export Duty Amendment Bill 1976 is to Umit the rate of export duty that growers may be required to pay in the 1976 season, in accordance with the limits on stabUisation payment proposed for the 1976 season under the Apple and Pear Stabilisation Amendment Bill 1976. These limits are a maximum of $2 per box for apples and 80c per box fbr pears. Export duty will also be limited in its application to exports to markets covered by the stabUisation scheme in 1976. The 1974 and 1975 export seasons have seen the operation of special schemes for apples only, supplementary to the Commonwealth stabUisation scheme. This additional assistance was provided jointly by the Commonwealth and State governments. In 1975 a limit was placed on this supplementary support of 80c per bushel on a maximum quantity of 3.04 mUlion bushels of apples exported 'atrisk'to the United Kingdom/Europe market. In 1976, similar supplementary proposals have been made to State governments by the Commonwealth indus- Government for a support program covering apples exported on an 'at risk' basis to the United Kingdom/Europe market in 1976. The quantity of fruit covered by this Commonwealth offer is being apportioned among States. The Government has proposed that this assistance program, which would be supplementary to stabUisation support and funded jointly by Comwith monwealth and States governments, provide support totalling $lm equivalent to 500 000 boxes at the rate of $2 per box. Economic pressures on the export section of the apple and pear industry have been acute. The export sector, particularly of the apple industry, has traditionally been oriented towards the United Kingdom/Europe market. The profitabiUty of this outlet has been reduced drastically byrisingfreight rates, currency adjustments and severe international competition. The industry is a labour intensive and high cost one, and is particularly vulnerable to international and domestic inflation. The nature of the apple and pear export trade, which involves long distance transportation of a bulky commodity, sold largely on a speculative basis in Europe and North American markets, is such that the transportation and marketing costs have severely eroded the profitabiUty of much of the export trade. There have been strong representations from the industry, particularly from Tasmania and Western Australia, that the level of support recommended by the Commission for 1976 exports of apples would not be adequate and would result in hardship in fruit-growing regions. The Government considers that there is a case for some UberaUsation of assistance, chiefly with respect to the quantity eligible for support. Accordingly, the special export assistance to which I referred, covering a further quantity of apples to the United Kingdom/Europe market beyond the 2 milhon boxes supported by the stabilisation scheme, has been submitted to State governments with my strong recommendation for their support. The extension of the'stabUistion scheme will assist in easing the social and regional difficulties associated with the necessary adjustments which are occurring in the apple and pear industry. A considerable number of growers have left the industry, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, in recent years. The adjustment which had already taken place in the industry has resulted in a substantial reduction in exports. To illustrate the changes taking place in the industry, the volume of apple exports has declined from 7 milhon boxes in 1970 to 4.4 milhon boxes in 1975. Over the same period, apple and pear bearing tree numbers have declined by some 26 per cent. There can be litde doubt that the next few seasons will see increased economic pressure on the apple and pear industry and that substantial further adjustment will be required. Because of the regional concentration of the export industry, particularly in Tasmania and Western Austraha, the necessary changes have profound regional imphcations. It seems inevitable that the industry will become increasingly oriented towards the domestic market with a substantially reduced and redirected export trade. It is the Government's intention that this process of adjustment should be orderly and should not be accompanied by unnecessary individual hardship. The Government regards the stabilisation support as an interim measure pending Government consideration of the Commission's final report on the apple and pear industry. This final report, which was preceded by the interim report referred to earlier, is expected to be tabled shortly. The final report will cover government assistance for the apple and pear industry beyond the 1976 season. The maximum cost to the Commonwealth of extending the apple and pear stabilisation scheme for the 1976 season would be $5.12rh. It should be noted that depending on the variables which influence the seasonal level of payments under the Commonwealth stabUisation scheme, such as average levels of return for fruit, the maximum commitment may not be fuUy drawn. In 1975, although $4.7m was committed by the Commonwealth in export support programs, only $3.6m was ultimately utilised. These BUls provide Government support for the 1976 apple and pear season which has already commenced. As such, they provide interim support for the industry for the period during which longer term and more comprehensive proposals for the industry can be considered. I commend the BUls.

Second Reading",46
104,Mr SINCLAIR,EXPORT DUTY COLLECTION,"In the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), on his behalf, I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Where the first person personal pronoun is used, it refers to the Minister for Transport. This is a very important measure both in respect of Commonwealth Government appropriations for road works and also in respect of the other changes which we propose to make to the existing legislation. The Bill is of course similar in some respects to the Bill introduced last November and which lapsed at the time of the Double Dissolution. I have circulated to honourable members an explanatory Memorandum covering the detaUs of the Bill. I would comment that the Bill appear to be rather complex and I have attempted in the Explanatory Memorandum to outUne in clear layman's language what the various proposed clauses are intended to do. The Bill serves really 3 main purposes. First of all it will appropriate an additional $64m in Australian Government grants to the States for road works in 1975-76. Secondly it will amend the existing legislation so as to allow easier administration and transfer of funds between road categories and between Acts. Thirdly it will amend the legislation to avoid unnecessary involvement and control by the Commonwealth Government in the area of local road programs. I propose to deal briefly with each of these aspects in turn before outlining the main provisions included in the Bill. Ofthe additional $64m to be provided by the Act $ 14.9m is to be allocated to national roads and the remaining $49.lm will be made available for use in accordance with the Roads Grants Act. The purpose of the additional funds is to partially offset the effects of inflation on existing appropriations. The increase is equivalent to about 17.8 per cent of the existing appropriations for 1975-76 and thus represents a very substantial effort on the part of the Commonwealth Government at a time when we are pressing heavily to reduce expenditure so as to get the Budget deficit under control. State quotas are also to be increased by an equivalent percentage and together with additional Commonwealth funds this should enable us to maintain a substantial improvement in road construction and maintenance activities generally. The detailed allocations of these additional funds are of course set out in the Bill. I would comment however that the way these allocations have been made largely reflect the States' own views and their program commitments. As honourable members are no doubt aware the Commonwealth expressed its concern at pervious cut backs in funds for local authorities and we asked the States to direct these additional funds wherever possible for use at the local level. As a sign of our co-operative approach we have accepted the requests made by the States in respect of allocations and the States have given assurances that they are able to provide properly for local government authorities. I now turn to the administrative changes which we are proposing. First of all we intend to continue with the amendment originally proposed by the previous Government to allow State governments moreflexibUityin seeking approvals for transfer of funds between road categories and between Acts. As the Act stands at present States may only seek approval for transfer if they can certify that they cannot spend the funds in the particular road category concerned. Obviously intimesof high inflation it would be very difficult to give such an assurance. In any event it is necessary that the administration of the Acts be made moreflexibleso as to allow for work priorities to be taken into account in switching funds. We are therefore proposing to continue with this amendment. More important however is the change we are proposing with regard to local government road works. At the present time State governments are obliged under the Act to seek approval for individual projects. In fact this system has already broken down. GeneraUy, the States are simply unable to provide this level of detail because it has no part in their normal administrative procedures. We are therefore proposing to restructure the Act in respect of rural and urban local roads so that in future State governments may seek approval for proposed aUocations of Commonwealth funds to local authorities. The Act also provides for other State authorities to use funds provided under the Act for local roads in those cases where the authorities concerned are in fact doing the work. These moves represent a change in the basic plulosophy of the legislation. I discussed these and other matters in some detaU with my State counterparts at the meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council held recently in Melbourne. I think it would be informative for honourable members if I summarised very briefly the main points that I made in an opening policy statement to that meeting. State Ministers seemed to me to be unanimous in welcoming the marked difference in approach which I outlined in my statement. The meeting represented a good practical start to the cooperative approach we are trying to achieve in transport matters. In addition to the main changes proposed in the roads legislation, which I have already described to the House, one further most important change concerns urban arterial road projects, including freeways. Under the previous Government, States were obhged to seek Canberra approval for all urban arterial projects even where the States proposed to fund the works entirely from their own resources. Under the new arrangements which now apply States will be able to proceed with their own urban arterial projects without having first sought permission from Canberra. I also indicated to the State Ministers the steps I had taken to clear up a number of outstanding issues. One example, which I should mention, concerns the re-allocation of urban transport funds to allow available funds to be used in the really pressing areas such as the provision of rolling stock. The States had been placed in some difficulty I understand because the previous Government had not approved the commencement of new projects for the 1975-76 year. My aim simply is to get the program moving again at least with the depleted funds we have available for the rest of this year. As I made clear to the ATAC meeting therefore, my approach in the transport portfoho will be to seek the closest cooperation with the States. The Commonwealth has a clear national interest in a number of transport areas and these also have to be dealt with in a co-operative and federalist manner. I should repeat at this point that all States, including those with Labor governments, seemed to welcome our proposed co-operative approach. I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. is divided into 3 Parts. Part I sets out the usual preliminary information. Part II, that is clauses to 8, relate to the National Roads Act. Part III, that is clauses 9 to 22, relate to the Roads Act. The total increase in funds for each State as follows: New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania The detailed schedules included in the Bill show how these State totals are allocated to the various road categories. The relevant clauses for the detailed category allocations are clause 8 for debate. national roads and clause 21 for the Roads Grants Act. The Bill provides for the additional amounts set out in the schedules to be added the existing 1975-76 appropriations. As I have already indicated the allocations reflect State views and wishes. The main clauses relating to the easier transfer provisions to which I earlier are clauses 6 and 16 for the national and Roads Grants Act respectively. The changes with regard to local road cations are substantively covered in clauses 12 and 13. Honourable members will note that was necessary to amend a number of the deamendments finitions included in the original Bill and this course reflects the different approach we are adopting to allow proposed allocations of to be submitted for approval. I should comment that the purpose of the roads legislation is ensure that money going to the States is actually spent on roads and these changes do not in any way alter that situation. Finally in relation to new procedure for rural roads I should also draw force. members attention to clause 22 which is a vaUdation clause to cover retrospectively certain actions already taken with Tegard to local road programs. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (HOUSING ASSISTANCE) BILL 1976 Assent reported.

105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT DUTY COLLECTION," Is it the to wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. referred Mr WILLIS (Gellibrand) (2.27)-The purroads pose of the BUls now before the House is to introduce a new superannuation scheme for Australian Government employees. The Superannualloation Bill 1976 is the principal Bill which 10, introduces the new scheme. The Superannuation it Amendment Bill introduces consequential to the existing Superannuation Act, of which it is intended to keep in force to the extent necessary to provide continuing authority for the funds payment of existing pensions. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendto ment Bill likewise seeks to amend the principal Act to take account of changes being effected by the Superannuation Bill 1976 and to ensure that the arrangements already in existence continue in As honourable members are aware, this is not the first attempt by a government to introduce a new superannuation scheme. The previous Labor Government had recognised the inadequacy of the existing scheme, as indeed had the Liberal-Country Party Government before that. The existing superannuation scheme, which commenced in 1922, had clearly become quite inadequate over the last few years as its contribution arrangements led to high levels of contributions in the latter part of the working lives of members, particularly in times of innation. Proposals for a new scheme eventually reached legislative form last year when Bills for a new scheme were introduced in May. It is now history that those Bills were subject to substantial criticism by the then Opposition as being too generous and as being a pace-setter in the field, and they were blocked in the Senate. In fact, the scheme was not more generous than some of those applying to public servants working for some State governments, including non-Labor States. The scheme which is now before the House provides markedly lesser benefits than those proposed by the Labor Government last year, but it is not anywhere near as ungenerous as the scheme that the then Opposition would have had implemented at that time. In the debate on the superannuation Bills last year the then Opposition moved several amendments to reduce the benefits provided in the proposed scheme and implacably opposed as a matter of principle some of the proposed benefits. It is indeed gratifying to us to note that in government the Liberal and Country Parties have had second thoughts about some of those principles and have conceded their applicability, though not to the same extent as was proposed in the 1975 Bills. One such matter of principle is that oftherightto retire at age 60. The 1975 Bills provided for retirement at age 60 with a government financed pension of 50 per cent of the final salary. The then Opposition expressed total opposition to this concept as it would, it said, set a trend towards age 60 retirement when no such trend currently existed. Instead the then Opposition proposed that pensions not become payable before age 65 and that those members of the existing scheme who were contributing at a higher rate in order to retire on full benefit at 60 would have the option of staying in the current scheme or switching to the new scheme on an age 65 basis and taking a cash refund of the excess contributions already paid. In the Bills now before the House those posals have been scrapped and therightto retire at age 60 has been acknowledged. However, distinct from the 1975 legislation, the full benefit of a government financed pension equal to 50 per cent of the final salary will not be available at age 60. Instead the government financed pension for retirement at that age will be a basic 45 per cent. In addition to that 45 per cent certain supplementary pensions may be payable as part of the governmentfinancedpension. There is also to be an additional pension to a maximum of 20 per cent offinalsalary which isfinancedby the employee's own contributions. The decision of the Government to acknowledge therightto benefit at age 60 but at less than the full rate does pose difficulties for members of the current scheme who intended to retire at age 60 but who nowfindthat they can do so only on a pension that is less than the 50 per cent governmentfinancedpension they had been counting on. This was not a difficulty in the 1975 scheme because full benefits were available at age 60. Admittedly it is proposed in the Bill to give credit to contributors who have contributed to the existing scheme on the basis of retirement at age 60 by the use of a complex formula with which one calculates what supplementary pension is due to an age 60 contributor if he or she retires at age 60 or at any time before age 65. The net effect of the formula is that only if a contributor has paid up all his age 60 contributions or has reached age 59V4 by the time the scheme comes into force whilst still contributing for age 60 units will he or she be able to receive on retirement at age 60 the full benefit that he or she expected to get under the existing scheme. All those age 60 contributors who do not meet these exacting conditions will receive a supplement under this scheme which is less than would give them the full benefit. Furthermore, it is very important to note that the supplementary pension is worked out as a money amount as of 30 June 1976 and is credited to the contributor as a money amount. Thus if his supplement is calculated at, say $300 per annum as of 30 June 1976 it remains credited to him at that amount until he turns 60. This may not matter too much if he reaches age 60 within a few years, although age if a contributor had 3 years to go to age 60 and inflation continued at 10 per cent for that time there would clearly be a very real reduction in the value of this supplementary pension. If the employee had, say, another 20 years to go before prohe reached age 60 the real value of the supplementary pension provided by the formula as would be a mere fraction of its value at mid-1976, even if inflation continued at rates well below the current level. Therefore the net effect of this move to provide for a reduced pension at age 60 will clearly result in a reduction of the benefit available under this scheme as compared with the present scheme. The extent of that reduction can be ascertained from Appendix B of the explanatory memorandum distributed with the Bills. It shows the capital value of benefits under the present scheme for current contributors as $9,302m on the Melville-Pollard assumptions. The effect of the adjustment of the present retiring age provision to those proposed in the Bills is shown to reduce that capital value by $504m. The effect of this provision, therefore, will be to reduce the benefits available to current contributors by 5.4 per cent. Of course, an offsetting, factor to this that age 60 contributors will not in future be paying the level of contribution they would otherwise have been paying if the current scheme had continued. But that does not alter the fact that many age 60 contributors feel that the recognition awarded to their past contributions will be virtually meaningless by thetimethey come to collect it and that accordingly the pension they will receive at age 60 will be well below what they had counted on. Before leaving this matter of age sixty contributors, I would add that as a result of what the Government is doing to those people it is highly likely that many of them will now feel compelled to stay on in the Service till age sixty-five. That probably does not please most of them, nor does it seem to accord with government policy of reducing the numbers of government employees. If that is what the Government wants to achieve, its treatment of age sixty contributors seems curiously in contrast to that objective. Another feature of the 1975 Bill which was strongly opposed by the Opposition in debate on the Bill was the proposalforan additional pension supplement to be paid to those who had contributory service of more than 30 years. The rate of such additional pension was to be one-half of one per cent offinalsalary for each year of contributory service over 30 years, with a maximum of 5 per cent at 40 years contributory service. The Liberal and National Country parties said then that such a proposal would be pacesetting for the private sector, and they opposed the whole concept of supplementary pension for long service. Now in this Bill they have accepted the concept, although the rate of the additional pension proposed is one-quarter of one per cent per annum instead of the one-half of one per cent contained in our Bill. A further proposal of the 1975 Bill which was completely opposed by the Liberal and National Country parties was that the pension of a dependent spouse, where the contributor died, should be increased from 62.5 per cent of the contributor's pension, as contained in the current scheme, to 67 per cent. The then Opposition said that such a provision was over-generous, having regard to benefits in the private sector, and it opposed any increase in the rate. I am pleased to say that the Government has now seen the error of its ways and the Bill now before the House provides for a rate of 67 per cent. Indeed, to give credit where it is due, it has gone beyond what was contained in our Bill by further providing that the pension of a dependent spouse continues after remarriage. In the current scheme such penis sion ceases on remarriage. That condition was continued in the 1975 Bill. Now, however, the conditions of payment of a dependent spouse's pension are to be decidedly improved. As most dependent spouses are widows rather than widowers, this is decidedly an improvement in the rights of women. Indeed, it could almost be said to be pacesetting. There are therefore three quite important provisions of the 1975 Bill which were strongly objected to by the then Opposition not just as to amount but also on principle, but which now in government it has decided to accept in principle, although in less generous terms in the case of two of them and more generous terms in the case of the other. It is indeed gratifying to the Opposition to note that when the Liberal and National Country parties had the responsibility of drawing up a Bill and not just criticising our Bill they were able to see the logic of our proposition and they have acknowledged the principles involved. There was, however, a further provision in our Bill which was strongly opposed by the Liberal and National Country parties as a matter of principle and in relation to which their stand has not changed. I refer to the adjustment of the pension. Our Bill provided for the whole pension-that is both the government-financed part and that part financed by the contributor-to be adjusted annually in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. That was the intention of the present scheme also, although the actual adjustment is 1.4timesthe percentage increase in the consumer price index or onetimesthe percentage increase in average weekly earnings, whichever is the lesser; and that is applied to the government-financed portion only. As the government-financed portion of the pension in the current scheme isfive-seventhsof the total pension, the appUcation of 1.4 times the movement in the consumer price index to that fivesevenths gave an adjustment to the total pension of one times the consumer price index. The arithmetic is five-sevenths, multipUed by fourteentenths, which equals one. That at least was the theory, but overtime,the government-financed portion being automatically adjusted whereas the other part was not, it would steadUy become a larger proportion than five-seventhsof the pension, at which level it would start out at on retirement, so that adjustment of 1.4timeswould give an increase to the total pension which was greater than onetimesthe consumer price index movement. Last year the Liberal and National Country parties opposed the appUcation of the consumer price index adjustment to the fuU pension, again on the basis that to give a totaUy inflation-proof pension equal to 70 per cent offinalsalary would be far more than the private sector could afford and that such pacesetting provisions should be included. AU of this entirely ignored the that the current scheme effectively gave inflationthe proofing to the whole pension. Not to grant it the new scheme meant that a very substantial benefit of the existing scheme would be taken away. The attitude of the Liberal and National interested Parties was even more curious in that when the 1.4 times consumer price index adjustment had scheme. been introduced in 1973 on the recommendation of Professor PoUard, they supported it and, indeed, seemed to want to take credit for it because they had estabUshed the PoUard inquiry in thefirstplace. Theuattitude to the proposal in the 1975 to provide full consumer price index adjustment to the whole pension seemed therefore to be rather inconsistent. Unfortunately they have seen fit to maintain their 1975 attitude in ing up this Bill. The consequence is that the scheme now before the House deprives current and future contributors of a very substantial benefit. Just how substantial is that benefit is demonstrated again by Appendix B.of the exment planatory memorandum which shows that the change in the form of the adjustment mechanism will of itself reduce the capital value of benefits avaUable under the present scheme by $ 1,683m or 18 per cent. Clearly that is a very important factor and one which greatly reduces the attractonly iveness of the proposed scheme. Quite obviously the effect of not providing consumer price'index adjustment for the contributorfinancedpension will be greatly to encourage employees to take the option, which is not currendy avaUable, of commuting that part of their pension which is financed by their own contributions into a lump sum. Provision of the right to commute part of the pension is probably a good thing in that it gives freedom of choice to the individual to arrange his life on retirement in a way which is most suitable to him. However, by not providing the option of an indexed pension instead of the lump sum, the scheme will encourage people who would prefer to have the mcome nevertheless to take the lump sum and invest it elsewhere in the hope that they can so invest it as to keep up with inflation. Obviously some wiU do that better than others; some may make quite unwise investments, particularly if inflation is high and they are seeking a substantial return on their money. If, however, the scheme provided for indexation of the contributorfinancedpension, people who wanted income not and wanted protection from inflation would fact readUy ignore therightto commutation and take full pension. If inflation continues at levels in anything Uke the current ones, it is difficult to imagine that many contributors would be at all in the non-adjustment pension which is financed by their own contributions under this In making these comments I am aware that the MelvUle-Pollard report on the original proposals for a new scheme, as put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) Bill when he was Treasurer in 1973, recommended that the consumer price index adjustment not apply to that part of the pension which is condrawtributorfinanced.We do not agree with that recommendation, as of course was made clear from the 1975 Bill. Indeed, it is relevant to note that none of the various State governments agrees with it. The fact is that every State governprovides a superannuation scheme for its employees which includes full adjustment of the total pension for movements in the consumer price index. When this new scheme is introduced Australian government employees will be the government employees in this country who are not entitled to full indexation-proofing of their whole pension entitlement. That brings me to consider in more detail the superannuation schemes applying to various State government employees. I seek leave of the House at this stage to incorporate in Hansard a document which compares benefits under the various government superannuation schemes. NA (Proposed Scheme) Retirement Age: 60 65 Maximum Retirement Benefits for worker on final salary of $6,300 $4,370 4,713 $13,000 8,743 9,425 Maximum Contribution 10 10 CPI Adjustment on Govt share",48
106,Mr WILLIS,COMPARISON OF BENEFITS,"I thank the House. The docufinal ment shows, firstly, the retirement age in various States; every State provides for to retirement at age sixty. I just note in passing last year the Liberal and National Country ties wanted to disallow any pension entitlement at that age to Austrahan government employees. The document then shows the maximum benefits available for government employees onfinalsalnotably below. ary of, firstly, a low $6,500 and, secondly, a medium income of $ 13,000. It can be seen that at $6,500 the age 60 scheme entitlement under the proposed Government State scheme is less than that in New South Wales and as shown in theHowever, only fractionally above those Australia and Tasmania. Even the lowest salary-whic hscale entitlement-that in Queensland-is only 6 per South Wales and cent below the Commonwealthfigure.On a final tribution rate needed salary of $13,000 the Commonwealth maximum benefits is highest in the entitlement for age 60 retirement of 67.25 per proposed scheme.

At age 65 the picture is rather different. At final salary of $6,500 the Commonwealth maxiper mum entitlement of 72.5 per cent is below that New South Wales, where the entitlement is 97.2 cent. per cent of final salary; that in Queensland, where it is 75 per cent; and that in South Austraha, where it is 73.3 per cent.

108,Mr WILLIS,AND STATE PUBLIC SERVICE,"I thank the House. I will not go into thefiguresin the table; I merely point out that the table shows the effect on the pension of adjustments for inflation over a 10-year period, assuming rates of inflation of 5 per cent, 10 per cent and 1S per cent. In New South Wales, at the point of retirement, the pension for a person on a final salary of $13,000 would be 16.4 per cent above the Commonwealth pension for a pensioner with maximum entitlement. After 10 years and only 5 per cent inflation the New South Wales pension would be 30.2 per cent above the Commonwealth pension. This is explained because the Commonwealth pension is not getting full adjustment according to the consumer price index, whereas the New South Wales one is. Thus, even with a comparatively low rate of inflation the disparity between the 2 benefits is widened considerably. After 10 years of inflation occurring at a rate of 10 per cent the difference between the 2 pensions would be 40 per cent the New South Wales one being the higher, and after 10 years of inflation at 15 per cent the New South Wales pension would be 46.8 per cent Commonwealth scheme and the vari' to the Government ary of o u s n m T seek *leave ^ $V13,000.1 P of e n s f the°House to tncoru n e r n a final s a l "" porate in Hansard a table showing the effect of this inflation over a 10-year period on maximum . , , „ pension payable to Federal and State Public Serp e n J i o n e r s with afinalsalary of $ 13,000.

With more time and higher rates of inflation, thosefiguresget higher and higher. A similar picture appears when one compares the Commonwealth pension with those of any of the States. They all improve markedly relative to the Commonwealth employee's pension. Clearly, a major deficiency in this Bill is that it does not provide inflation adjustment to the total pension when that protection is granted to the employees of all State governments and currently is provided to Commonwealth employees in the existing superannuation scheme. The Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) said in his second reading speech that taken overall the new scheme provided an increase of 1 per cent in the capital value of benefits. This is true; but it hides the fact that the capital value of benefits for existing pensioners and contributors is reduced by 6.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. The marginal overall increase comes only through the inclusion in the scheme of Provident Account contributors. Their inclusion is a highly commendable aspect of the scheme, as it was also of the scheme proposed last year by the Labor Government; but their inclusion should not be used to obscure the fact that this scheme reduces the capital value of benefits to existing pensioners and contributors. In summary, the attitude of the Opposition is that the Bills do not provide the most appropriate form of superannuation scheme for Australian Government employees. In most respects the proposed scheme is inferior to that proposed by the Labor Government last year and compares quite unfavourably with State goverament superannuation schemes. The Opposition does not intend to move amendments to the Bills in the Committee stages, as we have made our position quite clear in the scheme we introduced last year and we are conscious of the desire of the Government and of goverament employees to have this legislation passed without delay so that the new scheme can be brought into operation smoothly by 1 July. However, we do intend to move an amendment to the motion 'That the Bill be now read a second time'.I formally move the following amendment: That all words after'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient removes some important benefits now applying under the current Superannuation Act, thereby reducing the overall value of benefits for existing",53

I was told on the telephone this morning by a union representative that the Opposition had been instructed specificaUy not to move amendments because the unions want these BUls and this scheme to be carried. However, the Opposition has moved an amendment the eifect of which, if carried, would be to defeat the Superannuation Bill. Even though the opening words of the amendment say to the contrary, that would be the effect under the Standing Orders.

111,Mr GARLAND,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"Perhaps he is; it is rather soon to teU. I do not mind taking this opportunity to say that I have a high regard for the abUity of the honourable member for GeUibrand. I do not disparage him personally, however, I pomt out that the Opposition's attitude is seen in terms of opposition on behalf of unions, not in terms of the community or of this being a Treasury measure. The Labor Government's Superannuation Bill was treated as such by the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart), the Minister Assisting the Treasurer in that Government. He put that Bill through this House and so put the matter in its proper context. The honourable member for GelUbrand misunderstood the former Opposition's attitude and statements in a number of respects. I will reply to some of them in the course of my substantive remarks. It really is not true to say that on the whole goverament superannuation schemes of non-Labor States are superior. It is not true to say that the Liberal and National Country Parties ever had a proposal under which no pension could be received until a person reached 65 years of age. It is not true to say that the Senate blocked the Labor scheme. The then Senate opposition presented a large number of amendments in 4 categories. The Senate agreed with 3 of the 4. If the Government of that day had seen fit either to agree to them or to talk about a in that it modification of them and some compromise, the scheme would have gone through then, very much earlier than is now possible. This scheme pensioners and contributors'. will not come into effect untU 1 July. I shall say a little more about that in a moment. The honourable member for GeUibrand gave a comparison of certain features of the Commonwealth and State schemes. I do not propose to follow all those points. I make the comment that the comparisons he made can be answered, necessarily at some length,firstly,in terms of the definitions that have been used and which I think he was careful to follow-n o doubt some advice was given to him, and I do not say that in a critical way-and , secondly, by saying that the comparisons lacked that examination, which is necessary when one is comparing 2 superannuation schemes, of the whole package to see all the features. It is relatively easy to pick out one or two items in isolation. This package is a favourable one. The 3 BUls which are before the House now embody a superannuation scheme for Commonwealth Government employees which is a result of negotiation and argument since about 1970.1 will not trace the whole history of it. There have been a number of reports on various schemes and proposals. Throughout that period there have been lengthy and detaUed negotiations with Public Service unions involved, both individually and jointly. There are 22 such unions, incidentally. There has been considerable controversy in Parliament and hot debate in the community about the benefits and costs. This scheme represents the result of all that effort and activity. It contains many desirable features for Government employees and I believe it strikes a just balance between the demands of PubUc Service unions and individual Government employees on the one hand, and the cost to the taxpayer and the community on the other hand. Every superannuation scheme contains many features-contributions , retirement age, pension entitlements, just to name 3 broad areas. Each of those features can range from the very generous all the way to the ungenerous. Each scheme is a package of features. This scheme strikes a balance as a result of all that negotiation. It is our belief that the Labor Government scheme was over-generous. The examination of its features which took place pubUcly, mainly in May and June last year, I think made this obvious. Mr Stewart-How much does this one save?",54
112,Mr GARLAND,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"That is contained in the Minister's second reading speech which I would have assumed the honourable member would have read. The examination of the features which took place in the middle of last year made the fact the Labor scheme was over-generous obvious to most people. I know a number of Labor members of parliament who were also of the opinion that it was over-generous and I know a number of well-informed pubUc servants who were of that opinion as well. I will not go over all the features. The Minister's speech and explanatory memoranda have done that very well. The major complaint which came to me, and I tliink to most members of parUament, from Government employees was the . contribution system which required that early in his employment a pubUc servant pay a small percentage ofhis salary for superannuation and that percentage rises steeply, particularly for those wanting to retire at 60 years or between 60 and 65 years. Those in their final years found that burden almost impossible to bear. That has been realised for some years. This scheme meets that problem fully. We are now speaking of a new scheme in which there is a compulsory contribution of 5 per cent of salary and an option to pay up to another 5 per cent. I think the way I have expressed it is less misleading than the way put to us a moment ago when it was said that the contribution was to be a maximum of 10 per cent. There is a compulsory payment of 5 per cent and an optional payment of up to another 5 percent. For that the contributor gets a pension based on his final salary-no t the average of the salary in his last year or the average ofhis salary in the last 3 years or 5 years of service, as with many private schemes. The benefit is based on the final salary. He gets from the Government after 30 years' service 50 per cent of final salary, and an additional percentage which is the result of the contributions he has made during his period of service and which can reach a maximum of an extra 20 per cent depending on salary level and length of service. On top of that, the Government portion, which as I have said represents 50 per cent of his final salary, is index-linked. In other words he gets an increase of the percentage rise of the consumer price index adjustments. This is a very generous provision which allows pensioners from Government employment to be largely insulated against the ravages of inflation which of course affect everyone else in the community, including aU of those who are unable to be members of such a scheme as this. Additionally provided in this scheme is the right to receive a lump sum on retirement. This provision has not formerly existed. I point out those features to show what I mean when I say that it is a fair and indeed generous that scheme. I think many of those in the Government service who have felt that opposition to an even more generous scheme was unfair, have not really understood, firstly, how generous it is and, secondly, the position of""other people in the community outside Government service against which some sort of comparison or weighing up must be carried out by a responsible government. There are many other improvements- I think I have mentioned the main ones-in the scheme. Reference has been already made to the position of Provident Fund members. There are additional benefits for widows and orphans. I will not try to list all the features for they are in the memorandum. Naturally many Government employees would like to see even greater benefits. Their case has been put with some force by the members of the Australian Labor Party. But I put it to the House that a scheme that provides in times of high inflation complete index linking which provides full pension at the age of 60, is over-generous in terms of cost to the taxpayer and in terms of comparison with what is avaUable to those outside the Government serit was vice. Some regard must be had to that. After all, where is the logic of full retirement benefits being paid at 60 years? Why not 58, 55 or 50 years? That of course will be the next claim, if it has not started already, by some of the unions. One understands and expects that, but it is not to be yielded to. This scheme put forward provides that if one retires at less than 65 years a pension equal to a smaller percentage of the final salary will be paid. There will be a discounting. The Government portion of the payment will reduce from SO per cent of final salary at retirement age of 65 to 45 per cent at the age 60, with pro rata amounts in between those Savings are significant. The argument has been put today and on earlier occasions that somehow or other the Government ought to be encouraging people to election retire and to use this scheme as a method of ting people to retire early. That really does not stand examination. I remind the House of what was said in debates last year, that retirement age 60 as against 65 would be at a cost of 30 cent more to the taxpayer. This is not a small cost. So today, in a time of budgetary restrictions, to use that as a method of getting people out the Pubhc Service would be farcical. It is also argued: 'Well, when someone has reached the age of sixty, he ought to be retired to make way for a younger man'. Of course that would be covered not by the superannuation legislation but by the PubUc Service Act and Uke Acts. I am sure that a number of honourable members in this House over 60 years of age would quickly agree with me that compulsory retirements are not necessarily in the national interest. On a more serious note, of course, the argument about ing way for younger men can be used for people at any age. It could be used for those at 55 years of age or 50 years of age. Perhaps some people are too old or ineffective at 40 years of age. During debate in this House last year Labor presented its scheme as an 'all or nothing' posal. That was the Labor Party's attitude. That attitude has resulted in the delay of almost a year. I hope that fact is completely clear. What we saw was a majority of the Labor Party-no all, I happen to know-playin g pure politics. The Labor Party had no other consideration in mind than the votes of the potential 300 000 members of this scheme and no doubt some of theu* relatives. In our comments in the debates we made clear that we were prepared to give consideration to having some give and take about all the tures in the total package which I have menhardly tioned. We were positively refused drafting advice. I have a letter from the then AttorneyReview General, Mr Enderby, refusing that advice. Other advice was locked off from us once known that we opposed much of the scheme. say that if that had not happened, it would have been possible to reach the sort of agreement, sort of package that we have before us today, much earher. It could well have been introduced by about the beginning of September last year. A lot of discussion went on, not in Parliament but in the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Country Parties in July-September last year, the initiated, I believe, by the Public Service of unions-and aU credit to them for that. But the ages. Labor Government then rejected whatsoever any compromise or change, or treating. It was completely rejected. I am told it was the then Prime Minister himself who in particular wanted to hold out in the belief that if we went into an with a conflict of this kind it would result getin more support for the Labor Party. I say that that resulted in a delay of almost the 12 months. The final scheme we have today could easily at have been ready long before now. So we went per through the election and here today we have a scheme which is a fair one put to this House. I have no doubt that it will be carried, that the of amendment will be defeated and that the Bill will be passed by the Senate so that the scheme can be implemented by 1 July 1976 as provided. The cost of this scheme is more, but within it and among the detaUs-no t merely the aggregate figures referred to a httle earlier-ther e is a great improvement in the equity, in the use of the money to be allocated for the scheme. Because of the technical changes of the scheme the cost to the Budget during the nextfinancialyear will not makbe an increase over what it would have been under the existing scheme. So in a budgetary sense there is very little change and no additional cost to the revenue for a few years to come. That is one aspect which I think ought to be borne in mind when the question is quite properly posed: Why are you bringing in a new scheme at a time proof economic restraint? This scheme does not affect that economic restraint. On the other hand, there are potentially great administrative savings which I think should be welcomed by everybody. t Intime,those savings should be dramatic. That is just as well, because costs in this area and in many other areas of government administration are far too great for what is achieved. it The Bill also provides wider powers of investment for the contribution funds. This should feaimprove the yield significantly, though it is likely to have the dramatic impact that seems to be foreseen by the Australian Financial in a recent article. I believe that the documents that have been put before us with the it was second reading speech are detailed and I comprehensive. I congratulate the Minister on that presentation and on achieving the introducthe tion of the long fought for scheme. I thank him for the kind remarks he made about me in his second reading speech. In summary I believe that the new scheme will be of great benefit to Commonwealth employees and to the country. Whilst there are features which will be criticised- I could perhaps and will join in that debate in the future-this scheme is a very fair and favourable one. Anybody who says the reverse has not analysed the details.",55
113,Mr CREAN,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL," I support the measure that is before us subject to the amendment moved by my colleague, which simply draws attention to the fact that there may be some who will suffer detriment by reason of the introduction of this scheme. At least the position of those people should be looked at. There is a clause in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit legislation that when a change was made there should be no detriment to a parucular contributor by reason of the new scheme as against the old. That is all that this amendment seeks. It is nice to be able to score political points by saying that the amendment is obstructing the Bui. Nobody has any doubt that the Bill is going to go through this House. Fortunately for them honourable members opposite have not got the position in 1976 that we had in 1975 that what we got through this House could be frustrated in another place. So to the extent that one plays politics, I shall play it to that extent. But all we are trying to draw to the attention of the House is that there are some people-this includes some attendants in this House-wh o claim that they suffer a detriment in their retirment by reason of the introduction of this scheme as against what would have happened under the previous scheme. Whether that is the case or not, and the individual details ofit, I do not know. All that my colleague is trying to draw attention to is that there are some people who claim that they suffer a detriment. All I am sorry about is that this Bill, in a somewhat better form, was not passed more than a year ago. Whilst a certain amount of unction can be taken now about the reasons for rejecting our Bill, I simply say that it was pohtics played by those who now accuse the present Opposition of playing pohtics on this matter. I do not want to go into the detail of this Bill a great extent. I find it a little hard to believe it can be rationalised that 45 per cent payable age 60 years is somehow more equitable than 50 per cent payable at age 60 years and 60 per payable at age 65 years. I leave the honourable gendeman to tread on his own needle so far as those fine distinctions are drawn. I simply point out now that the objective to which both Parties claim to be working with over regard to social security benefits is a pension will be one-quarter of average weekly earnings. For a married couple this means they will have 50 per cent of what the earnings are at retirement-no t over the last several years, but what the average weekly earnings happen to be from year to year. What I do want to draw attention to is the awful mishmash that exists in Austraha with regard to provision for retirement. Attention is drawn to this kind of difficulty in chapter 2 of the interim report of the Committee of Inquiry on National Superannuation in Australia. The report shows, for instance, that in 1971-72-that is some 5 years ago now-Commonwealth , State, local government and semi-government schemes covered something like 678 000 contributors and 115 000 pensioners. At that stage fewer than one-third of that total number of contributors were covered by the scheme about which we are now talking. I concede that many details would have to be analysed before one could say precisely whether the State or local government schemes are better or worse than the Commonwealth scheme. But at least I think it will be agreed that governments, be they State, local or Australian, were the first to recognise in a systematic way the need to provide that those who. had wrought in their years of strength in the service should be adequately looked after in their retirement. I hope that we will get around to implementing this principle as a nation very quickly. Whatever virtues we try to take ourselves I think we are almost the last example of a Western democracy that has not got a comprehensive national scheme covering all people. The chapter to which I referred in the Hancock report contains statistics for the whole of Australia-the y are certainly rudimentary and are based largely on an inquiry undertaken by a Canadian expert in Victoria in 1968-whic h show that only one-third of the total population of Australia was covered for retirements benefits and that many of those people were covered most inadequately, and that even in an age of equality of the sexes provision for retirement benefits was predominantly for males and the number of females eligible for this benefit was to almost negligible. So we have a long way to go. I that believe that Australia is capable of providing for at all a retirement scheme that will give them something like one half of whatever they were earning cent at the point of retirement. But at present retirement benefits are provided by a hotchpoints of the potch of processes. The Hancock Committee points out that well half of the males at age 65 qualify for a full that pension irrespective of the operation of the means test. The means test has been liberalised. I would say categorically that I was never a great supporter of the abolition of the means test. However, this objective became part of the docdifferent trines of both the major political parties. area was poltiical advantage more blatantly used by the present Government than in its use aboUtion of the means test as a central pUlar in respect of social equality in the social system. I beheve that far more important than the abolition of the means test is the need to make the basic pension adequate for those who require We can add the other refinements after if we want to. But the reality of the situation at the ment is that because of the faUure to provide tematically for retirement in Australia the jority of people on retirement do ents of the age pension. The cost of providing for this benefit is increasing considerably. Those people who provide for themselves by way of superannuation, Ufe insurance or the various forms of savings can take advantage of certain tax concessions. When we take into account the tax provisions as far as life assurance is concerned- I have said this before and got into a certain amount of hot water over it with people in the Ufe assurance industry who are Uving the last century rather than the present centhe tury- I believe that life insurance in the rest the 20th century and into the 21st century a very different sort of system from what it has been from its introduction up until the present time. By that I do not mean to denigrate in any sense the service that Ufe assurance has provided over recent years. But Ufe assurance would not have been as extensively used and would not a very effective form of saving today if it were for the tax concessions attached to it. One only needs to look at the last annual report of the Insurance Commission to see that the return investments is not very substantial. If it were for the tax savings that are made by the person who pays a Ufe assurance premium this area after would not be a very effective way of mobilising savings in the community. I repeat that whUe life assurance may have served a role in the past I think that role has very different in the years ahead. The sooner both sides of the House and the life assurance industry in particular reaUse that the more we will avoid the sterile sort of debate and activity that took place in the last election in which assurance clerks were mobilised as Liberal ticket holders and pushers on the day of the elections. Much of general insurance in the workers' compensation field is virtually bankrupt. This again is something that requires closer examination by both sides of the House in the future. believe that the role of insurance in the remainder of the 20th century will be a very one from what it has been. The industry In no should vacate many of thefieldswhich it now occupies. It should be much more imaginative in of the thefieldsin which it wants to remain.",57
114,Mr GRAHAM,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"You would rather nationalise it, would you not?",58
115,Mr CREAN,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"The honourable member refers it. to the question of nationahsing insurance companies. When one looks at the preponderance of motheir investments either in Government securities sysor in debentures of multi-national societies or mamortgages, one really wonders how much pribecome recipivate enterprise there is. I want to say a little about the investment policy being pursued by the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund at the moment. The Minister for some of Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) in his second reading speech seemed to suggest that there would be a liberalisation of this poUcy in the future. I suggest that that remains to be seen. If I may say so, there is a far better yield on investments of the Commonin wealth Superannuation Fund than the yields on investments of the Ufe assurance industry of taken generally. But when onefindsthat part of will be the return to the Commonwealth fund is by investment in mortgages, in some cases returning 15V4 per cent, I sometimes wonder where we are getting to in this so-called freedom to invest in other than government securities. I sound a warning that it is extremely doubtful whether be investment in equities is necessarily a better not proposition for a life assurance or a superannuation investment policy than investment in the Life last sort ofloan that wasfloatedby the Governon ment. Honourable members opposite can crow not jubUantly and get a little grandUoquent about the great release and amount of the funds, but all, as I see it, there will be roughly $ 120m to $ 125m of new funds annuaUy in the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund as against total avaUable annual investible funds in Australia of something Uke $15 bUlion. I do not think we to be should get too carried away by what this new freedom in the investment policy will mean in reaUty. I believe that at times euphoria overcomes common sense in the evaluation of these things. I have heard in many speeches in the last few Ufe weeks comments about this great animal called private enterprise or free enterprise. The life insurance companies have chosen to put their investments into the multinationals or the safe debentures rather than inrisk-takingenterprises. I There is one matter to which I want to draw attention because I beheve it is a matter that should receive the scrutiny of both sides of the House. When there exists a scheme such as the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, or ultimately, as I hope, a nauonal superannuadon scheme, what then is the role of social services and the pension-free means test? I beheve that it is over-generous that people in government employment should receive a pension which, taking mto account the provisions for refund of contributions, is a fully government pension, and when they reach the age of 65 years they beheve that they are automatically entitled to that pension as well as to the social service pension. I think that there has to be a rethinking of that aspect. It ought to be possible to compute on a given pension-whethe r it is from a private source or a government source and taking into account past tax provisions and so on-ho w much of that pension is being paid directly from Consolidated Revenue. That should be taken into account as an offsetting factor before determining people's eligibility for a direct contribution from ConsoUdated Revenue via the social service provisions. Unless that is done there will be a maldistribution of resources and the criticism may well be made that the community as a whole cannot afford it. I am prepared to say categorically that a community can pay to people in retirement something that has some relationship to what they earned in the last years of their economic activity. Whether it is in the last year or the eral years seems to me to be a quibble, but if no provision is given to them directly then it has to be given indirectly through various sorts of social service systems and relief schemes with onerous means tests and so on attached. I believe that it is a mark of an enlightened community that it will pay to people in retirement sufficient to enable them to live at the standard to which they believe they are entitled and towards which they contributed during their active years in the community. It is possible to put arguments as to whether people should retire at 65 years, 60 years, 67 years, 62 years or some earher age. Those matters are always debatable, and I wish that at times greater emphasis was placed on those sorts of nuances than on the sheer political differences that sometimes emerge. The Hancock Committee report drew attention in its introduction to the fact that matters of final retirement had technical, actuarial, economic and legal aspects. I should Uke to add sociohuman attitudes as well. Those are the sorts of things we should be examining. We are only doing justice to our own servants, our direct employees, in the provisions of this Bill, but this Parliament has an obUgation to try to do justice to aU sections of the community, to see that the national cake is distributed properly. The work force at any time has to support chUdren not yet active and people who are retired on the social contract assumption that when they retire they will be treated in an adequate way. There is therefore an obligation to make proper provision out of the existing cake, both at the early end for education and at the latter end for adequate retirement.",58
116,Mr MACPHEE,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL," I should Uke to be able in this debate to reply to my old friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) but I will not do so because I reaUy was not sure what he was talking about. I do not mean that with any great disrespect, but I did have difficulty in following what the honourable member was saying. It seemed to me that he was drawing upon some atavistic unreason of another day, the relevance of which to this legislation I did not understand. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland) has answered eloquently some of the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr WUlis), includmg the question of the overall beneiits of this scheme compared with the schemes of the States and the relevance of the amendment moved by the Opposition which, if passed, would have the effect of defeating the Bill. Mr Stewart-You did not worry about that last sevlast year. You threw it out entirely.",59
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,Mr Jarman)Order! I ask the honourable member for Lang to cease interjecting. Mr Stewart-You have lost hundreds of our pubUc servants.,59
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"Order! The honourable member for Lang will cease interjecting. Mr Stewart- I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, I did not hear you.",59
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,You must be deaf.,59
120,Mr MACPHEE,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"I ftimepermits, I will come back to the point raised by the honourable member for Lang, but I would like to deal now with the question of age 60 years retirement because the honourable member for Gellibrand made some point about it. Presumably that matter was largely in the minds of the Opposition when it moved the motion. Of course, it is a fact that by virtue of the PubUc Service Act it is a condition of employment that a public servant may retire at 60 years of age, with an option to continue working up to the age of 65. It is true that some government employees such as the police are obliged to retire at the age of 60 years. The Superannuation Act has enabled persons to retire at 60 years, and theoretically it was possible for them to retire on full benefits provided they had contributed at the higher rate. In practice that was difficult, and that is an important point. The amendment moved by the Opposition is aimed at a very theoretical situation. In practice it was hard to purchase units and retire on full benefits at age 60 years. Only 25 per cent of pubhc servants now retire at that age, but many of them accept diminished benefits because of the contribution structure of the present scheme. Those who do retire on full benefits at age 60 years often do so at great cost to themselves. So in practice the provisions of this Bill do not vary greatly from the practice of the old scheme. Pollard and Melville have been referred to the honourable member for GeUibrand. He acknowledge some of the points they raised, it is worth referring to their comments and recommendations regarding age 60 years doubt retirement. In summary, this is what they had say: By the standards of most private sector schemes, retirement on full pension at age 60 is an early retirement (for men). However, they pointed out, as the honourable member for GeUibrand pointed out, that every State government superannuation scheme providesfora full pension at age sixty. How these work in practice is another matter for examination. Thirdly, they said: Because of this (and the existing rights to retire pension at age 60) the Commonwealth may feel obliged provide again for full benefits at age sixty. It is important to remember that the Commonon wealth may, as a matter of poUcy, feel so obUged. They went on to issue this caution, which is sistent with what the honourable member for Curtin has been saying: Before doing so the Government should consider. (i) the effect of this on age retirement patterns longer term; and (ii) the large number of public servants who; in view of the transfer provisions, will as soon as the proposed scheme is introduced become eligible for retirement on full benefits. They were, of course, referring to the scheme merly proposed by the Labor Government. In the view of Pollard and Melville, earlier of retirement on full benefits also means mcreased costs as a percentage of the salary bUl both cause of the longer period on pension and bebenefits. cause of the shorter working Ufe. In paragraphs 24 to 26 Pollard and Melville show that they are far from convinced that the Government should be encouraging earlier retirement. They appeared to favour age 60 retirement on fuU benefits because it was the existing theoretical right rather than because as a matter of judgment they were of the opinion that it should be granted. They set out their arguments and then they state that they are unconvinced by them. They add that, if it is Government policy to encourage earlier retirement, then of course the base age of sixty may be appropriate. Professor Hancock, in his study of national superannuation, argues strongly against a general retirement age of less than 65 years at this stage of our development. Therefore, it would be most undesirable for any government to set out to encourage an earlier retirement age. If retirement at age 60 on full benefits with the by consumer price index adjustments to which the did honourable member for Gellibrand referred and were avaUable, an mcreased number of public servants would retire at age sixty. There is no about that. In the long term that may be to the goal which the government of the day then decides is appropriate, but at this stage the impact on the private sector would be enormous. The mere fact that this scheme is better than most private sector schemes does not necessarily mean anything. Many private sector schemes need improving and updating. There is no question about that. It would be at considerable cost to the taxpayer, as has been shown by the honourable member for Curtin, if this scheme were more generous than it now is; but it is in fact on full better than most private schemes operating and, to of itself, it will lead to an improvement in private schemes. If the scheme provided for retirement full benefits at age 60, the impact on the private sector would be very severe. At the same contime there would be a greater cost to the taxpayer. It would be irresponsible to adopt that position at thistime.Therefore, the new scheme as introduced in this legislation does not lessen the benefits avaUable in practice and it does not in the prejudice a particular mdividual in practice. The unions have been very realistic. The unions accepted the proposition of the previous Government, which is contained in this Bill, that the period of service required for maximum forbenefits be extended from 20 years to 30 years. This would have seemed an incredible reversal poUcy if it were not for the reality that in private sector schemes 30 years is the period recogbenised as that for entitlement to maximum Just as the unions accepted that change, they were reaUstic enough to expect that they had to accept some other changes. This is how the compromise came about. The unions were prepared to recognise that nationally the age of retirement is 65 years. They also recognised that this will be the case for some years to come. They recognise that Commonwealth pubhc servants enjoy conditions comparable with private industry in general and better superannuation conditions in panicular. They recognise that these superannuation conditions would be better still if 65 years were the age for full benefits and age 60 benefits were higher than those which have obtained in practice. It seems to me that the Parliament is behaving most responsibly if in fact it cures the worse defect complained of-that is the contribution system-whil e at the same time not costing the taxpayers substantially more than they are currently paying. As the honourable member for Curtin pointed out, to grant what the Opposition originally proposed would cost the taxpayers 30 per cent more than the cost which this Bill proposes. The Senate-this comes back to the point made by the honourable member for Lang-in fact cured the worse features of the old scheme. Its proposals accepted the provisions relating to uniform contributions, comparable benefits for members of the Provident Fund, improved benefits for temporary pubUc servants, widowers, children and orphans, and greatly simplified and therefore less costly administration. As the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) pointed out in his second reading speech, this Bill goes a stage further and greatly improves the position of women in the Public Service. It is most important that we remember that the national interest had to be considered by this Parliament, and that is what this Bill does. It does not take away any right of retirement at age 60, but it gives a disincentive to retire at that At this stage of our economic development that is right and proper. It certainly is not correct to say, as the honourable member for GelUbrand said, that in major respects this Bill is more generous than we were prepared to acknowledge last year. The fact is-this is the pomt in which the honourable member for Lang was interested-that the government of the day then was not prepared to compromise. We in the then Opposition put forward amendments, most of which were carried by the Senate, and the then Government decided that it was to be an 'all or nothing' approach. It was not that we set out to oppose its Bill. We moved amendments. Those amendments, in spirit, are adopted in this Bill. The former Government would not under any circumstances accept the amendments, even though in due course the trade unions did. It would have been possible to have had consultations between the unions, the then Government and the then Opposition and to have arrived at this legislation and to have had it in force one year earlier than it will not be in force. Mr Stewart-Twaddle.",59
121,Mr MACPHEE,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"The honourable member for Lang says: 'Twaddle'; but it is a fact. This is the very reason we reached this compromise. In October last year the honourable member for Curtin and I , along with the now Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), had discussions with the unions and reached this very compromise. It was possible then. It would have been possible earUer. So it is not twaddle at all. The government of the day just would not bend. As we knew, there were points upon which everyone agreed. Those points are in this Bill. We all agreed on the uniform contribution of 5 per cent. We all recognised the incredible disparities in the contribution rates that were then being paid. One only has to go back to the speech of the honourable member for Curtin on 28 May to see that in fact he recognised the savage treatment of contributors as they advanced in service and tried to keep up with their payments for units. Members were commencing at absurdly low levels of less that 2 per cent of salary, while those in older age groups had to pay absurdly high amounts, even going up to 25 per cent of salary. This clearly was recognised in the speech of the honourable member for Curtin when he was a shadow Minister. Throughout our stand in this House and in the Senate we acknowledged that there were defects that needed curing. A uniform contribution rate was the most important cure. Option for retirement earlier age. than age 65 with a pension adjusted proportionately was always our poUcy. Equally, we were concerned for members of the Provident Fund, temporary pubUc servants, widowers, children and orphans. Certainly we wanted to simplify the administration of the scheme and it now is possible to compare private schemes with the pubUc scheme and to recognise that some of the attractions that were originaUy necessary to get pubUc servants are now no longer necessary because of the general comparability and high standard of conditions prevailing in the Commonwealth Public Service. In effect, this is a solution worthy of Solomon because it does not cost the taxpayers any more substantially than the present scheme, yet it does cure the defects. It is a tribute to the Minister, to the Treasury and to the unions and, if I may add, to the honourable member for Curtin who worked very hard on the subject for a long time. There has been a year lost as far as pubhc seramendment vants are concerned. It has been a year of for GeUibrand individual hardship for many people and that is does not matter greatly to be regretted, but the result of this promise is that the defects are cured without any view of the contributor, greatly increased costs. The honourable member from the pomt of view of for GelUbrand criticised the non-adjustment of as a very vital element of the the whole pension, but he acknowledged that ever this is consistent with the Melville-Pollard report, and again it is a matter of costs. It is a matter asking: When will Opposition members learn that there is a bottom to the bucket? When will the they learn that the taxpayers cannot continue to Crean That go on paying? That is what would be required if substitute we were to make this scheme even more individualsfor generous than it now is. Again one has to repeat existing scheme. It one observation, without any questions about the because even though quaUty of the contribution of member for GeUibrand, that it is extraordinary intolerable position to thebeen that the shadow Treasurer has not taken part in this debate as either the lead speaker or not a bit happy with it because many of the one of the early speakers, because it is a matter with great ramifications of a Treasury nature. is not really in a labour-management context. The one point that I think needs to be made finaUy in answer to the honourable member for GelUbrand relates to the lump sum payment. It demonstrable that the lump sum payment is now preferred by most employees. It represents a real advance for individuals. It is certainly at the sametimea lower cost to government, but this provision has not been introduced for that reason. It is still a better provision than those which apply in most private schemes, but not so salary. much greater that we have two classes of people-pubU c servants and others. I would say in closing that I personaUy have reservations about the necessity for a supplement for over 30 years of service. I do not really stand the rationale for that and I can see that cost can get out of hand. Also as a personal while I recognise the difficulties of spouses who remarry-and under the existing scheme would lose theu: benefits- I do find it strange that is no test of dependency or no need requirement to be shown in order that they can continue to the pension even after remarrying. One would have thought that there should be some sort of dependency or need requirement and that in the event of their second spouse also dying then course the contributor's spouse could well back on the original pension. With those two minor quibbles I must say that it is a most commendable piece of legislation and one hopes it will be passed quickly.",61
122,Mr FRY,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL," I support the moved by the honourable member (Mr WUlis). I do so because it comscheme, whether one how one looks at this new looks at it from the point of or whether one looks at it PubUc Service itself government. Whichway one looks at it it is a very poor substitute for the Labor Government's scheme which was of put up last year and was so callously rejected in Senate by this Government, then in opposition. scheme has come to be known as the scheme. The new scheme is a very poor it that one. In the case of many is even a poor substitute for the is a tragedy for many people they are not happy with the the honourable new scheme they have placed in a fairly a major afford to reject this scheme eventhat extent they cannot though they are contributors-and honourable members on the other It side of the House may not be aware of this-ar e paying extremely high contributions from their current salaries. Some of them are paying up to 40 per cent and the take home pay of some of them is such that they have great difficulty in is maintaming current standards of living because of these very high contributions. The stick is being held over their heads. It is a matter of accept this new scheme or go on with this very unfair scheme under which people are paying extremely high contributions. As I said, some of them are paying as much as 40 per cent of their Many members on the other side of the House may not be here long enough to have to worry about retirement schemes as far as their connection with this Parhament is concerned, but I underwould suggest to them they should try to place the themselves in the position of contributors to the view, scheme and contributors to the new scheme which is being put up and look quite objectively at the situation in which they would be placed. there Many contributors take the view that there has been a breach of contract by the Government. get These people entered into an arrangement to make certain contributions under the old scheme and in return to receive certain benefits. They have fulfiUed their part of the contract, but now of the Government is wanting to change the rules. go The Government is saying: 'That was good enough before but now we are going to change the rules to make them something quite different from what the contributor entered into'. This is admirable if the change means that contributors will be better off and the scheme will be more equitable, but this of course is not the case. Under the new scheme some people will be better off. Some people will definitely be worse off. There is no question about this when one looks at the actual provisions. The main difficulty, of course, with the new scheme is in the area of age 65 retirement because many people have planned to retire at 60 years. They have arranged their accommodauon. They have arranged their nnances. They have arranged their fanuly concerns to retire at that age and to do what they chose to do. Some of them may want to travel. Some may want to write their memoirs. Some may just want to go fishing. Whatever they want to do, that is the way they have planned their Uves. They planned to retire while they were still in reasonable so they could enjoy reasonable retirement in economic security. That is what they set out to do. Now all their plans have been thrown up into the air because to get the benefits they had planned to get they have to go on and work for another 5 years, and Government supporters cannot deny that this is the case. Great strains are going to be placed on the health of these contributors because they will have to go back to work even though many of them are not in very good health. They have been able to carry on in the hope of retiring at 60 years of age, but now they will have to go on working for another 5 years. The prospect is not a very inviting one, I can assure honourable members, for people who had been planning to retire at 60 years of age to be told that they have to go on and work for another 5 years. The new scheme is shot through with a whole range of deficiencies and ambiguities, but the most outstanding deficiency, of course, is the one concerning the age of retirement. This is reaUy turning the clock back. It is a complete reversal of the general trend throughout the world. The general trend, of course, is for early retirement and a general reduction in working hours. This has been accepted as a trade-off because of the advances that have been made in technology and computerisation. If people are going to benefit from these advances-and they should be advances in a civUised society-the y should go towards improving the quality of Ufe, the way people Uve and how they Uve. To achieve this the logical trend is towards shorter working hours and towards an earUer retirement so that people can enjoy their retirement in reasonably good health. A group that appears to be particularly disadvantaged in this respect consists of those people who have less than 20 years service and who did plan to retire at 60 years of age. It is quite a bitter sham to claim that these people are not disadvantaged. I would just Uke to quote a couple of case histories that have been brought to my notice to support what I am saying. The first one concerns a class 4 clerk with an anticipated final salary of $10,000 per annum. Under the existing scheme he wanted to retire at 60. He would have received 49.8 per cent as a government contribution plus 20 per cent from his own contribution, which would have given him almost 70 per cent of his salary-in fact, $6,980 per annum under the existing scheme. He claims that under the new scheme he will get 45 per cent plus 2'/i per cent bonus, which is 47& per cent or $4,750 per health annum. He is down $2,230 per annum under the new scheme when compared with the existing scheme. This is not an isolated case. I have had several of them brought to my notice. There is another, from a 45-year old Fourth Division officer who is not in a career position and who anticipates he will retire on his present salary of $11,581 per annum plus normal indexation. Under the existing scheme 70 per cent would have given him $8,106 per annum. Under the new scheme he gets 45 per cent plus 2.2 per cent, which gives him $5,714 per annum. He is down $2,392 per annum. Yet members opposite claim that people will not be disadvantaged by this scheme. Many people will be down about $2,000 per annum in respect of the pension on which they had planned to retire at age 60. To get what they planned to get, they must go on to 65. At the other end of the scale, by contrast, many Second Division officers are in quite a different position. Under the new scheme they will be advantaged at the expense of those who are disadvantaged. I quote the case of a Second Division officer with a final salary of $30,000 per annum. Under the present scheme he would have received 44.3 per cent or $13,290 as government contribution. Under the new scheme he will receive $ 15,000. In this category people in the higher echelons are better off. Most officers in this category will receive benefits as good as, and some will receive benefits better than, those they would have received under the existing scheme. My correspondent sums it up in this way: There is no way for me to retire at my planned age of 60 years and receive even 50 per cent of my final salary. I am forced to work an additional 5 years for this but this does not apply to the top echelon. It is a grant to them at my expense. I would like to know what the Minister has to say about people in that category. To offset this argument the Government will say that people will be paying less in their conthat tributions. This is fair enough. There is no tion about that. People will be paying less, but lot of people have been paying more for many years. Some of them have only two or three years to go before they retire. The Government will claim that contributors will get a lump sum return of their surplus contributions, plus interest, to offset loss in pension. There are important aspects which we must consider in relation to this argument. Firsdy, these lump sums will not be indexed in any way to offset inflation-inflatio n which was initiated by Snedden Budget in 1972. The other aspect is that the lump sum return under the Crean scheme complaining. could be used to purchase additional pension rights. Part of it could be used to purchase ditional pension rights. Under the new arrangeance ment it is the lot or nothing. A contributor must use the whole of the lump sum to purchase ditional pension rights. He cannot say that he will take half as a lump sum payment and use half to purchase additional pension rights. This opdon has been removed. In that respect the new scheme is much less flexible than the Crean contributors. scheme. The return of the contribution without indexation represents a severe loss in the real value of the lump sum because of inflation. As the honourable member for GelUbrand not said, the Commonwealth PubUc Service will now be the only PubUc Service in Australia in which the full pension will not be indexed. That is great distinction for our pubUc servants, comgovernment pared with State pubUc servants. There is no way to compensate for this loss, unless the contributor is tempted to speculate in real estate to achieve some capital gain. This is precisely what Government is trying to discourage. If the man does that he is sacrificing income, he is ranningbe the risk of his speculation not coming off, he UabUities in the form of rates and he is adding the inflationary pressure by being forced to into this sort of speculation. There are many other glaring deficiencies this scheme. I will mention just a few. Another important example of inflexibility the right to pick up units which have been rejected and which, under the Crean scheme, people would have been able to pick up 3 months before or 3 months after a new scheme was introduced and claim them as fuU pension effect benefit rights. This is not an option under the new scheme. Many contributors have pointed out to me that it is a grave disadvantage. Other people have queried the fact that there is no indication of what will happen to the surplus in the old scheme. They have also queried the extent of surplus. Nobody has told us that. I think the quesGovernment should be more forthright. The cona tributors have created this surplus. They are entitled to know how much it is. They are entitled to know what will happen to it. We are told that many of the unanswered questions and many of the queries that people bring up will be covered or answered by regulations. I would like to know 2 very from the Minister whether, in framing these regulations, representatives of the contributors will be consulted and whether the Government will have some consultation with the white collar the union representatives to see whether those regulations fill the gaps about which people are Another area of concern, or an area of ambiadguity to many people, is that there is no assurthat the lump sum return will buy the extra 20 per cent pension that was avaUable under the adold scheme after 20 years of service. Some people believe it will take 30 years of service to get a sufficient lump sum to buy back the extra 20 per cent. This matter is certainly not clear in the Bill. It should be clarified in the interests of the One group in the Australian Capital Territory which I think will be disadvantaged is the Australian Capital Territory police. These people do have the option of retiring at 60 or 65. They have a compulsory retiring age of 60. How are these people placed? On the surface it appears a that there is no way they can get 50 per cent contribution towards their pension. I would like this matter clarified by the Minister. I could outhne many more deficiencies and ambiguities in the scheme, but it is quite obvious the from what I have outUned already that many individuals will be disadvantaged. This cannot denied. I have received many representations. has I have many case histories. I know my colleague, to the honourable member for Canberra (Mr go Haslem), has received them also. They are there for anybody to see. People will be disadvantaged under the proposed scheme as compared with in the existing scheme, and certainly disadvantaged greatly as compared with the scheme which was is the denial of rejected last year. We should not be merely concerned at the fate of individual contributors-the y are our main concern-w e should be concerned at the general of this scheme and at the effect it will have on the Public Service as a vital part of government and as a vital process of government I do not think there is any doubt that the decision not to grant full pension until 65 must lead to an older, more conservative PubUc Service. I think in many ways it will be a less quaUfied PubUc Service. It wiU no doubt block effectively or slow down promotion opportunities for many highly quaUfied pubUc servants, many of whom have set out to obtain quaUfications tofitthem for particular jobs in the Service. Now their employment opportunities are being blocked by this slowing down of the retirement process. I believe that the new scheme will estabUsh a pool of very dissatisfied, highly paid pubUc servants who had planned to retire at 60 but who are now being virtually forced back to work for another 5 years to get the 50 per cent of their final salary. no doubt this will have a significant effect on the quaUty of their work, on their morale and on the morale of those around them. I have no doubt that the scheme will lead to a more expensive and less efficient PubUc Service for the people of Australia. I must comment on the reference that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr interests Macphee) made to the effect that the introducthe tion of this scheme will have on the private secthe tor. There is no rationale in his argument. Commonwealth Public Service employs only about 6 per cent of the total work force in Australia. It is not rational to say that an improvement of their conditions will create hardating ship for the private sector in Australia. The fact that the conditions of this 6 per cent of the work Service. force are improved does not mean that everybody will rush in and work for the Commonwealth Public Service. It will not increase the size of the PubUc Service by one person. All it will mean is that the competition for positions in PubUc Service will be a bit keener and that the PubUc Service will be able to attract people better quality. The argument that the Commondebate. wealth Public Service will become the pacebe setter and that the private sector be forced compete with it has no real foundation. So let not carry on in that vein and present a comgroup pletely false picture. This scheme will apply only 6 per cent of the total work force and it not affect the rest of the work force. I think that most members of this House agree that government today is a very complex business, a very difficult business, which requires the services of the most talented people. I think that the difficulties of the Government today highand light that statement. Government is a very difficult business and to carry it out requires services of the most talented, the most highly quaUfied, the most professional people that we have in the community. We should not be apologising for having a highly competent, well quaUfied Public Service. The Labor Government did a lot to upgrade the Public Service, to improve its efficiency and to improve its professionaUsm. We do not apologise for that. I do not think that the Australian people would want us to apologise for it. There is no questioning the fact that under the Labor Government positive steps were taken in this direction. To maintain the standard we should have conditions which attract the best talent available and create favourable conditions for advancement. I believe that this scheme is a tragedy not only I have for the many public servants who have served the people well over a long period and who want to retire in good health at age of 60 years but also for the Public Service itself, because the clock is being turned back on the considerable progress that was made under the Labor Government to make the PubUc Service a highly competent and well motivated organisation serving the Australian people. I do not think that it is in the of the members of the Public Service or Australian people to turn back the clock on progress that already has been made. I cerThe tainly do not think that we or anybody else should apologise for wanting to have a highly efficient PubUc Service of the best standard that we can possibly get. We can do this only by crethe conditions that will attract people of the right quaUty and cahbre to the jobs in the Public",62
123,Mr LUSHER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL," I give notice that I will not be taking up my fulltimein this debate. I just want to make a few points and then the give the members of the Opposition plenty of time to speak. I am pleased to be following the of honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) in this Having listened to his speech one could excused for being left with the impression that to this is the most disastrous superannuation us scheme that could ever be foisted upon any of pubUc servants at any time.

125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks to the Chair.,66
126,Mr LUSHER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"The honourable member for Fraser said that this legislation is a poor substitute for the legislation brought in last year by the Australian Labor Party when it was in government and that the legislation introduced at that time had been callously rejected by the then Opposition. I want to point out that it was generaUy accepted by most people and by most reasonable public servants-mos t public servants are reasonable-that the scheme proposed by the Labor Government at that stage was indeed over-generous. That legislation contained provisions that had not even been recommended by the Melville-Pollard inquiry. By and large that scheme was one which put pubUc servants as a group into a privUeged position in our community. As I said earlier, I have a lot of respect"" for pubUc servants. I for one do not want to deprive them of any benefits to which they are entided and do not want to deprive them of any scheme.",66
127,Mr JAMES,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,They are supposed to be sociaUst employees.,66
128,Mr LUSHER,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"They are our employees. They are the employees of the Government. I can only assume that the honourable member for Fraser placed an advertisement in the newspapers asking everbody who has a complaint about the proposed scheme to come forward as I think that he gave every conceivable example of who would be disadvantaged by the scheme. He did not give any credit to the Government for the fact that the thousands and thousands of pubUc servants will benefit significantly from this proposal. The major part ofhis speech was taken up with making excuses and pointing out every possible deficiency. Hefinishedup with the proposition that we are going to have a less efficient PubUc Service as a result of the introduction of this scheme. I do not accept that. I believe that the introduction of this scheme will make Ufe a lot easier for the vast majority of pubhc servants. It will put money back into the weekly or fortnighdy pay packets of the vast majority of pubUc servants. It will do a great deal to improve the retirement benefits ultimately received by the majority of pubUc servants. I do not think that it is possible introduce a scheme in any area of government administration that does not provide some degree of disadvantage for some members of the community. I am prepared to acknowledge that there may be a few pubUc servants and some groups of public servants who will not be completely advantaged by the implementation of this scheme. I have just taken the view that I could not let the honourable member for Fraser sit down, and I am sure that he would not expect me to let him sit down, without making some comments on his contribution. The main point that I want to make in this debate before I resume my seat is that in my view there is a need for an overall look by this Parliament at the PubUc Service and its structure, administration, responsibUities, relationship with the Government and a whole range of other aspects. As we know, a royal commission under the chairmanship of Dr Coombs is presendy mquiring into the Public Service. We also know that the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has appointed Sir Henry Bland to look into other aspects of the Public Service and the administration of this countiy. There is no doubt that there is a need for reviews of this nature to be done from time totimewithin the PubUc Service and that there is a need for the Parhament to give serious consideration to the results of those reviews. I think that we are very fortunate in this instance in that we have two inquiries looking at different aspects of the same subject. I think that we probably will be in a better position than most parUaments in that we will be able to look at thefindingsof two separate inquiries into various aspects of the Public Service. I hope that we will be able to view the results of those inquiries with a degree of maturity and be able to come down with some revised views about what is the attitude of the Parliament and the Government to the adnunistration which serves them. I tliink that there would be Uttle point in arguing in 1976 that the PubUc Service is not well treated. Going back intime,it is true to say that for a long while the members of the PubUc Service were the poor relation of other sections of industry and of other sections of the community in that their levels of salary and things of that nature were not necessarily commensurate with those applying outside the PubUc Service. But the Pubhc Service offered security and a good pension or superannuation scheme, and that was an offsetting factor for those people who were prepared to forgo the salary that they otherwise may have been able to obtain in the marketplace. However, that is not necessarily the case to today. Over the years we have improved and unproved. The Adnunistration of the last 3 years improved at a more rapid rate than had been the case in previous years the lot of the pubhc servants in terms of their salaries and wages, the conditions under which they work, all the various forms of leave which are available to them, and the superannuation scheme which appUes to them. It is probably worth pointing out that the necessity for a new superannuadon scheme has been intensified by the poUcies of the former Administration, because it is largely the severe inflauon and the increasing wage payments that are being made which have forced up the cost of contributory units and resulted in distinct hardship for a great number of pubhc servants. The thing which I regard as being important in relauon to this matter is that there must be an overview, and arefreshingoverview, of the PubUc Service and its role in Australia. In this debate today we are preparing to approve a new superannuation scheme for pubhc servants in this country. We know that they are relatively well paid and that theu: worldng conditions are good. I do not deny the pubUc servants any of these benefits. What I do say is that the Public Service, for its part, must perform; it must be prepared to play its part; it must make its contribution to government and to the community. If it transpires- I hope it does not-that the PubUc Service does not perform and is not deserving of the benefits which this Parliament and governments bestow upon it, then changes must be made, and the PubUc Service must be prepared to accept those changes. If over a period the PubUc Service in fact is not shaping up, if it is being inefficient or if it is expanding at a rapid rate without any improvement in its performance or in the carrying out of its duties, then I think we have a duty in terms of our administration and responsibUity for the taxpayers' funds, to ensure that changes are made which offset what is happening. Changes may need to be made in relation to the permanency of employment in the PubUc Service if certain things develop. I just raise this point, and I do not want to vass it to any great extent: The PubUc Service 1976, and in fact in most of the 1970s, is tively well off. It cannot be of deprivation in our community. The salary levels in the Public Service are good. This afternoon I took somefiguresfrom Commonwealth that Gazettes. There is no particular significance in terms of the dates to which they relate. AU sorts of variables could apply to them. I simply took outfiguresin relation to salary increases over period from June 1971 to June 1975. The percenproviding tage increase over that period for a Clerk class 2/3 was 64.4 per cent; for a 58.6 per cent; for a Clerk class 7 it was 55.3 per cent; and for a Clerk class 10 it was 44.6 per cent. Probably the large bulk of public servants would fall somewhere within those ranges. There is no sinister motive on my part in taking outfiguresin relation to those particular ranges of employment. I just picked them out at random. By way of comparison, average weekly earnings in that period from June 1971 to June 1975 increased by 74 per cent. So, although the bases may have been difierent, the salaries of public servants did not increase by the same amount as average weekly earnings increased. However, the increase in PubUc Service salaries was still relatively good. Over that same period, from June 1971 to June 1975, the consumer price index increased by 53.8 per cent, which is probably more in Une with the average increase in Pubhc Service salaries over that period. The message that comes out of that, to my mind at least, is that the PubUc Service has been keeping up. It has been argued that the Public Service was a pacesetter for a longtime.That may have been the case during a period within the time scale at which I have looked, but I think that during that 4-year period between 1971 and 1975 the Public Service kept pace with the consumer price index and with the increase in average weekly earnings. The scheme which we are debating at the moment and which we are introducing will ensure that the public servants are adequately-in fact, very well-catere d for in terms of superannuation. We know that their recreation leave, sick pay, maternity and paternity leave arrangements and all of these sorts of things are certainly as good as, if not better than, those which apply to people in industry. The challenge which I put to the Pubhc Service is this: We as a government certainly are not holding it back. We are doing our bit to see that public servants are being well treated by us as employers. The responsibility on the PubUc Service is to perform for its Governcanment in return. It has to accept the responsibUity in which goes with the conditions, the rights and relathe privUeges which the Government confers pointed to as an area upon it. I do not want to say any more than that. I hope the remarks I have made will be accepted in the spirit in which I have made them. There is no criticism involved; it is just a matter of making a point. I hope that the Public Service does accept the the conditions which we as a government are in good faith and that the Public Service in its turn will ensure that it performs for its Clerk class 5 it was Government.",66
129,Mr WALLIS,ON MAXIMUM PENSION PAYABLE TO FEDERAL,"Iriseto support the amendment moved by the honourable member for GelUbrand (Mr WUUs). I think it is worth reading out the terms of the amendment. It states: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient it removes some important benefits now applying under the current Superannuation Act, thereby reducing the overall value of benefits for existing pensioners and contributors'. Later I shall have something to say about the deficiencies in the proposed scheme. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) indicated quite a number of those deficiencies and the fact that the proposed scheme can in no way be compared with the scheme which was proposed last year by the then Labor Government. I have a particular interest in this matter because for 18 years I was a contributor to the Superannuation Fund. When this matter was debated last year I made some inquiries as to what my position would be if I were still a member of the Superannuation Fund. When I resigned in 1969 to enter this place I was paying 12.5 per cent of my income in superannuation payments. I checked the situation last year and found that my contribution would haverisento 19.5 per cent. No doubt at the present time it would be somewhere between 20 per cent and 20.5 percent. There are many Commonwealth pubUc servants in the electorate which I represent. They are to be found in the Australian Postal Commission, in the Australian Telecommunications Commission, in the Australian National RaUways where approximately 3000 or possibly more people are employed, and in the Weapons Research EstabUshment at Woomera. All told, they make up a pretty soUd block of Commonwealth employees. Quite a large proportion of them would be contributors to the existing Superannuation Fund. Last year when our Bill was about to come before the House I took out somefiguresin relation to the payments made by employees of the Australian National RaUways who were contributors to the Fund, who were in theirfifties,and who had decided to take advantage of the opportunity to retire at age sixty. When I asked for thosefiguresto be taken out I said that I wanted an across the board set of classifications- I did not want just the people at the top-includin g tradesmen, leading hands, foremen, class 3 clerks, Fourth Division officers, and so forth. When I received thosefiguresand examined them. I found that aU these people had taken the maximum number of units. The contributions of these people, whose ages were in the 50s, to the superannuation fund ranged from 24 per cent to 37 per cent of their wages. Because of the increases in wages since then those percentages would haverisen.Now we have reached the stage when many employees have stated that in that they have to go to the bank each fortnight in order to Uve. Some people may think that that is odd. Last Saturday morning a person who would earn about the average earnings in Australia walked into my office and told me that he was gomg to the bank every fortnight in order to keep going. He was paying over $ 130 each fortnight in superannuation. By thetimehe paid his tax and met his other commitments he had to go to the bank. These are the people contributing to the existing scheme about whom I am most concerned. I am not so concerned about the top brass. Although such people might be paying high contributions they still have quite an amount left on which to exist. The lower paid workers, whether they be clerical workers or wage employees, have a lot less on which to live after they pay their contributions to the fund and this means that they are in direfinancialtrouble. All honourable members know that in 1971 a Treasury committee was appointed to look at the superannuation scheme and to bring down recommendations. That Committee recommended a new scheme and pointed out the anomalies in the existing scheme. It made recommendations, together with certain alternatives. Nothing was done, of course, from a legislative point of view until the Labor Party became the Government. In 1973 the Labor Government, in order to bring about an efficient and equitable scheme, agam called for a report and it acted on that report by introducing legislation. That legislation was introduced in May 1975 and it was to operate from 1 July 1975. We all know what happened in the Senate. From the time when the question of an inquiry into the superannuation scheme was raised in 1971 Commonwealth public servants were looking expectantly for some move by the Government to ease thefinancialburden to which a lot of the older members were subjected and from which it did not appear that they could escape. As they got older the position got worse. Their hopes began in 1971 and finally, in 1975, the Labor Party Government introduced its scheme. That legislation was rejected with all the other BUls rejected by the Senate. The Senate returned it to this House with a pUe of amendments. I think there were 94 or 95 amendments but the main bone of contention was that the age of 60 years was altered wherever it appeared to the age of 65 years. This was a let-down to all thosepeople people who had been contributing for many years years to allow them to retire at 60 years of The honourable member for Fraser referred to the expectations held by these people. Their hopes were again dashed. I think the honourable member for Hume (Mrthe Lusher) said that the unions were prepared to accept the superannuation scheme now before the House. Previously the unions were not pared to accept such a scheme. They were right behind the Labor Party in trying to push the tial Bill through the Parliament The unions accepting the present proposal. Unfortunately, they have no option. They know that if they not accept this scheme this matter will go on on and the situation will get worse and worse. the honourable member spoke to the unions he his wouldfindthat they are not happy with this scheme because of the many anomaUes in it andmy the disadvantages of it when compared Labor Party's proposal and also with the existing scheme in some respects. The position now is that wherever the age 60 years appeared in the Labor Party's Bill the age of 65 years appears in this Bill. Because the frustration of the Senate-on e of the many frustrations engaged in by the Senate-the Labormost Party's Bill was withdrawn last year. This resulted in extreme disappointment to all the contributors who had been looking to the Labormember Party to provide for them a scheme which wouldCommonwealth take some of thefinancialburden from them andunder aUow them to have decent retirement. AU 65 honourable members know what happened. matters There is no need for me to go into what hapshall pened on 11 November and the events that up to it. Our intention to reintroduce the originalhonourable Bill in the same form was defeated by pened on 11 November and we are now deaUng with the scheme introduced by the present Government The honourable member for Fraser mentioned some of the disabUities associated with this Bill and perhaps I could mention a few. There are disadvantages in the invaUdity clauses. Those clauses disadvantaged people with less than 30 years' prospective employment. Present contributors cannot take up rejected units, they were able to do in the past and as they would have been able to do under our scheme. The greatest disadvantage is the inabUity to retire at age 60 on the full pension. I do not know the exactfiguresbut I would say that a very percentage of the contributors I know have been contributing higher payments so that they could retire at 60 years of age. Now the hopes of these have been dashed. If they retire at 60 of age they will receive only 45 per cent of age.theh final salary compared with 50 per cent under the Labor Party's scheme. Again I say that my main concern is for the lower paid employees who contribute to this scheme, because they are people with whom I have the closest association. The honourable member for Hume said that prethe honourable member for Fraser must have put advertisements in the newspaper to get ini-people to come along and complain about this are Government's scheme. I am sure he did not do so. As he lives in Canberra where there are so domany contributors to the superannuation scheme and he would not have to put advertisements in the Ifnewspaper. The proportion of pubUc servants in electorate is a lot higher than it is in mine and I know the number of people who have come to office and voiced their objections and comwith the plaints to the proposed scheme. Much has been said in various place about making Commonwealth pubUc servants tall popof pies and giving them benefits which are not avaUable elsewhere. If a comparison were made of we wouldfindthat all States have public service superannuation schemes and I would say that in cases they are better schemes. The Commonwealth scheme may not be the worse but it is a long way from being the best. The honourable for Fraser also pointed out that the scheme is now the only scheme which a person has to work until the age of in order to get fuU benefits. There were other that I wished to point out but I think I conclude on that note. I again express my led support for the amendment moved by the member for GeUibrand and trust what hap-that the House will accept it. Debate (on motion by Mr Short) adjourned. NA Ministerial Statement",68
130,Mr LYNCH,FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA,"by leave- Mr Speaker, the purpose of my statement today is to spell out, in a detailed way, the Government's policy towards foreign investment as in Australia. The statement. I am making is necessary in order to dispel the atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty in which foreign investors have had to operate over the last few years. The scale of this uncertainty is, I believe, highconsiderable. In this context, I would draw attention to the fact that over the past three years total capital inflow-viewe d broadly as the rise in Australia's net overseas indebtednessrepresented only 3 per cent of our total gross domestic capital formation, compared with around 10 per cent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There is litde doubt that confusion in the minds of investors about the circumstances in which they could operate in Austraha was a major factor in contnbuting to the fall. This confusion arose because the previous Government was very conscious of the costs of foreign investment but was reluctant to adequately acknowledge its benefits. The effective implementation of its policy was hamstrung by this attitude. The Government firmly believes that foreign investment should play a bigger role than it has in the past 3 years and that it should do so without adversely affecting our national interests. Let me be clear at the outset. The Government's basic objectives are to encourage foreign investment in Austraha because of the considerable contribution it can make to Australian development and prosperity but, at the sametime,to see that such investment is on a basis of fair sharing of net benefits as between the foreign investor and the needs and aspirations of the Austrahan community. Our policy will offer Australians maximum opportumty to participate as fully and effectively as practicable in the ownership and control of our natural resources and industries-and , thereby, in decisions having an important influence on our economic and social development. What it will offer foreign investors is fair treatment under clear guideUnes in the beUef that we wiU thereby be making a significant move towards getting Australia going again. In view of the current depressed nature of private capital expenditure in Australia, foreign investment will play a positive role in assisting overaU economic recovery. Role of Foreign Investment in the Australian Before I proceed to outline the detaUs of our policy it is important to consider the role of foreign investment in the Australian economy. Any successful poUcy in thisfieldmust be based on sound understanding and judgments about the way in which inflows of foreign capital affect our economy. Foreign capital seeks to avaU itself of profitable opportunities and Australia has a social and poltiical environment which imposes few non-commercial risks. But while foreign investors come to make a profit, their investments here can in fact benefit us if put to productive use. Foreign capital provides extra resources. It enables us to import more and develop at a faster rate than we otherwise would have done. It can bring with it, and disseminate, technological know-how and managerial sldlls. It can stimulate competition within our economy, thereby improving our efficiency and international competitiveness. Substantial blocks of needed risk capital may become avaUable, and otherwise inaccessible market connections may be established. The overall impact of such benefits is reflected in enhanced productivity, greater employment opportunities and higher real Australian income than would otherwise have been achieved. These can be important contributions. Nevertheless, there can be costs as well as benefits. Our partnership with foreign capital must be a reaUstic one of mutual advantage. In past decades of high immigration and rapid industrial development, there was a general presumption that all foreign investment should be welcomed. This is no longer the case. The Australian community quite properly demands that governments today take a more discriminating and mature attitude towards foreign investment. This is particularly essential in the case of direct investment, which paradoxically has most to offer and also raises the most important problems. It provides us with technology and skills and export markets as well as added resources. But it involves foreign ownership and control, and can raise various practical considerations about which any government must be sure that it is fully informed and has the appropriate administrative machinery to deal with. These include taxation, technological arrangements and marketing and export plans. They involve policy issues much broader than simply the quesuon of foreign ownership and control. In weighing these benefits and costs it must be understood that we cannot have it both ways. We cannot both ward off foreign direct equity Economy and acquire the benefit of it at one and the same time. The choices in the longer term are either a potentially slower rate of growth but with a larger share of the product of that growth accruing to Australians, or a faster rate of growth at the cost of greater foreign ownership. But the period of euphoria about foreign investment has gone. Foreign capital is a means to material advancement but material advancement is not our only aim. The Government recognises that pursuit of poUcies on ownership and control involves trading some measure of material advancement for a more satisfactory overall arrangement. Added resources, access to technology, and increased managerial skills and other economic benefits need to be placed within the context of the community's total requirements. Quite clearly, Australians will feel deprived if they believe that foreigners are investing here in ways which are harmful to our national economic and social interests. They will also feel deprived if foreign investment occurs in such a way as to deny them reasonable participation in the development of their own economy. However, sensible poUcies and effective administration can minimise any such potential loss whUe at the sametimemaking it clear to the foreign-controlled companies already operating in Australia, to potential foreign investors and to our major trading partners, that they have a role to play which is consistent with the national interest of this country. We aim to strike a balance at the poUcy level between the potential net benefits of long-term investment by foreign interests and the possible costs to the national interest and aspirations of an over-high level of foreign ownership and control. We propose to do so by examining, in a framework of clear guideUnes, individual foreign investment proposals of specified kinds. We recognise that, in order to achieve the balanced outcome which we seek, government pohcy must be practical, widely known, well understood and not subject to unpredictable changes. Our policy has been framed with this very much in mind. Essential Elements of Policy The essential elements of that pohcy are: We will provide the maximum opportunity for Australians to participate as fully and effectively practicable in the ownership and control of this country's industries and natural resources. We will make use of foreign capital, especiaUy where it is accompanied by new technology and expertise, as an integral component of Australian economic and social development. We will place major emphasis on Australian participation in new projects but without preventing projects that are clearly not against the national interest from proceeding. We will welcome proposals to increase the level of Australian participation in existing foreign-owned companies but we will avoid the costly option of repurchasing such companies. We will estabUsh a Foreign Investment Review Board to advise the Government on foreign the investment matters. We will restrict foreign investment in certain basic sectors of the econtrary omy. These areas, some of which covered by legislation, are banking-bot h savings and trading-radio , television, daily newspapers and certain aspects of the civU aviation industry. Examination of Foreign Investment Proposals Proposals by foreign interests for investment in Australia, outside the prohibited sectors just mentioned, may be examinable by the Foreign Investment Review Board. Not all such proposals will be examinable and those which fall outside the scope of the screening machinery may be proceeded with automatically, subject to normal exchange control requirements where appropriate. Examinable Proposals The Government wishes to examine the following types of proposals, detaUs of which are contained in the attachment to this statement: Proposals falling within the scope of the Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act including proposals by a single or associated foreign interest to acquire or mcrease a holding of 15 per cent or more in an Australian business even where the proposal does not involve a change in control of the business; proposals involving the estabUshment of new non-bankfinancialinstitutions and insurance companies; proposals to establish other new businesses or to undertake a new mining or natural resource project, where the amount of investment is $ lm or more; certain acquisitions by foreign interests of Australian real estate. The definition of a foreign interest is clearly set out in the attachment to this statement, and in order to remove any doubts which may exist I as specifically invite attention to that definition. Criteria Each examinable foreign investment proposal will be considered on its merits to determine whether it is contrary to the national interest. The criteria for making this examination are set out in the attachment but, in the main, they encompass the net economic beneiits and employment opportunities offered by the proposal, the level of Australian equity participation and management involved and the likely effect of the proposal on the Government's general economic and social policies. It is not intended that all investment proposals shaU necessarily satisfy all of the criteria Usted in the attachment before being allowed to proceed. The list will be drawn on to extent relevant in the circumstances of each particular case. Proposals found not to be conto the national interest according to these are already criteria will be approved. Guidelines for Key Areas The Government has decided that in certain sectors of the economy designated as key areasnamely production and development, both onshore and offshore, of oil, natural gas and all other minerals including uranium; agricultural and pastoral projects and forestry and fishing projects- 2 spedfic objectives will be pursued. The 75 per cent rule Because of its unique status the Government has decided that special condidons should apply to foreign investment in uranium. In this sector a project involving investment by foreign interests, not already in production, will only be allowed to proceed provided it has a minimum of 75 per cent Australian equity and is Austrahan controlled. This is to be achieved by thetimethe project comes into production. In this area the Government will have regard to foreign portfoho investment. Uranium enrichment and other investments in the nuclear fuel cycle, apart from mining and production to the yellow cake stage, are not covered by this rule and will be looked at separately. The 50 per cent rule In the remaining key areas a new business or project involving investment by foreign interests of $lm or more which is not against the national interest will, as a general rule, only be allowed proceed provided it has a minimum 50 per cent Australian equity together with at least 50 per cent of the voting strength on the board held by Australian interests. The establishment of new projects in these sectors involves development of the natural resource wealth of the Australian continent and adjacent offshore areas, and the Government considers it especially important to ensure that Australian interests participate as fully and as effectively as possible in their development and exploitation. Nevertheless, we are determined not to unduly delay the development of Australia's natural resources and without prejudice to what I have already said concerning uranium, the unavailability of Austrahan equity capital on reasonable terms and conditions will not prevent a project, considered by the Government to be not against the national interest, from being allowed to proceed. In that event, though, the Government will, as appropriate, seek satisfactory arrangements for Australian equity to be increased to at least 50 per cent within an agreed period. Mineral Exploration In view of the need to achieve and maintain an adequate level of mineral exploration and because of the Umited avaUabUity of Australian risk capital, the Government has decided to concentrate on obtaining the maximum level of Australian participation at the development stage of a mining project. Accordmgly, while the Government wishes to encourage Australian participation in mineral exploration, it will not be mandatory for foreign interests to seek Australian partners in their exploration programs. Real Estate In the field of real estate the Government is concerned to ensure that rising land values generated by the growth of the economy as a whole accrue to Australians. We are particularly concerned that foreign interests should not engage in speculative purchases of real estate. Therefore, except for certain specified types of real estate investment, all acquisitions of Australian real estate by foreign interests will be examinable. Other Areas In other areas of the economy no specific prohibitions or minimum requirements for Australian equity will apply. Cases will be examined on their individual merits. In general, if it can be demonstrated that a project will be Australian controUed it wiU be approved. As well, the to Government will expect to see significant economic benefits and/or Australian equity participation before permitting a new foreign interest to come into those areas where foreign ownership and control is already extensive. Working with Private Enterprise NA Earlier in this statement. I said that an important element of the Government's policy will be to provide the maximum opportunity for Australians to participate as fully and effectively as practicable in the ownership and control of our industries and natural resources. The Government is aware that the Austrahan capital market sometimes experiences difficulty in providing sufficient equityfinanceto ensure a reasonable level of Australian ownership in projects where the expected ultimate return may be high but where the prospects for dividends are not good in the short term. However, the Australian capital market is continuously improving its capacity to respond to the opportunities which our policies are designed to provide, especially in the area of joint venture participation in major resource projects. In this connection, the Government believes that the Australian Industry Development Corporation has an important role to play in helping to mobilise funds required by Australian companies and in helping to bring together efiicient Australian enterprises in order to foster Australian equity in local ventures of nauonal importance. The Government expects the Australian Industry Development Corporation to work closely with the Foreign Investment Review Board to assist in achieving the Government's poUcy objectives. NA NA The Government is conscious of the fact that foreign controUed companies have access to the the law. Australian market for loan funds. We expect such companies to give full considerauon to the possibilities of raising additional capital requirements through equity issues in Australia as an alternative to borrowings in Australia. the present circumstances, and given the The Board will: Government's expressed attitude, we do not see any need to lay down different rules for domestic borrowings by foreign controlled and Australian controUed companies. Guidelines for Foreign Interests Operating in I now turn to the activities of foreign controlled corporations and businesses operating in this country. We are, of course, anxious to see that the continuing operations, poUcies and practices of already estabUshed companies are not in any way contrary to the national interest. Foreign controlled corporations and businesses operating here do, of course, have to observe aU the relevant laws of the land. And in this sense they are and always have been subject to the Government's control. But it may be that, in respect of some aspects of their activities, it would be helpful to have some additional guidelines which they would be expected to observe. Before taking a decision on this question we will be seeking the advice of the Foreign Investment Review Board. We wiU ask the Board to report on the potential value of guideUnes covering such matters as: Inter-company pricing and profit Initially arrangements; Royalty and Ucensing arrangements; AvaUabUity of technology, patents, etc.; Export franchise arrangements; Extent and nature of parent control of Auspart-time. traUan operations; Management and personnel poUcies including the role of Australians on boards of directors and in senior managerial positions. In addition, the Government beUeves that the Australian branches of overseas incorporated companies should disclose pubUcly the same information in respect of their Australian operations as is required from Australian pubhc, Usted pubUc or private companies as the case may be. We will seek to ensure that this is done. As well, the Government will monitor very carefully any situation where there is the possibility of resort by taxpayers to various tax avoidance devices and take any necessary steps to ensure that foreign investors, along with all other taxpayers, do not shirk their responsibUities under Foreign Investment Review Board Mr Deputy Speaker, as I mentioned earlier in this statement, the Government has decided to In estabUsh a Foreign Investment Review Board. Advise the Government on foreign investment matters generally, including the need for and scope of a foreign investment review Act; Foster an awareness and understanding of the Australia Government's policies in the community at large and in the free enterprise sector in particular; Work towards a high level of Australian private capital participation in new investment undertakings; Give guidance to foreign investors on those aspects of their proposals which may not conform with the policy and suggest ways by which such proposals might be amended in order that they will do so; Establish appropriate liaison with State government authorities; Keep in touch with the activities of foreign controlled businesses already operating in Australia; and Consider the desirabiUty of maintaining, in a form to be approved by the Government, a register of foreign investment proposals. we will establish the Board by administrative action. It is proposed that it be given a statutory basis as soon as possible. The Board is to be comprised of not less than 3 members and not more than five. Except for the executive member, the appointments will be I expect to announce the names of the part-time members shortly. The head of the Treasury's Foreign Investment Division, presently Mr M. A. Besley, will be the executive member of the Board. The Board will meet regularly, at least once a month, and will be supported by the executive services of the Treasury. It will also have available to it the expert and assistance of other relevant Commonwealth Government departments. The Government is confident that the establishment of a Board, to which we will appoint noted Australians with extensive commercial experience, will help to facilitate speedy, efficient and practical administration of its policy. Legislation The Government's administration of its foreign investment policy is based on the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975, the powers available to it under exchange control legislation and regulations and under export control powers. The Government is concerned, however, to simplify as far as possible, understanding of the executive basis of the Commonwealth's powers in regard to all foreign investment matters. This should help to remove confusion in the minds of private investors. For this reason we will examine the possibiUty of embodying our pohcy in a comprehensive way in legislation. As I have mentioned, the Foreign Investment Review Board will have an important role in advising the Government in this regard. In the meantime, the Government will continue its practice of seeking the cooperation of all parties in the implementation of its policy. One aspect of current legislation which has caused us concern for some time is to be remedied. I refer to the present advantage which it has been suggested foreign-owned companies appear to enjoy over Australian-owned companies in applications before the Trade Practices Commission. The Government proposes to introduce amending legislation which will remove the inter-relationship between the Foreign Takeovers Act and the Trade Practices Act so that foreign compames will no longer be able to obtain automatic approval from the Trade Practices Commission consequent upon approval of theu: proposals under the foreign takeovers legislation. Parties with proposals that faU within the scope of both Acts can avoid unnecessary delays by submitting their proposals to the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Trade Practices Commission simultaneously. For their parts, the Board and the Commission will Uaise closely to ensure that their investigations minimise delays to the business community. In addition, the Government proposes to introduce amending legislation to correct, retrospectively to 1 January 1976, certain technical deficiencies which have been found in the recently proclaimed Foreign Takeovers Act. These advice relate to the compulsory notification requirements of the Act and the transitional provisions linking it with the now repealed Companies (Foreign Take-overs) Act. Details of these deficiencies and the proposals designed to rectify them are contained in the attachment to this statement. Conclusion This statement has been made in order to set out clearly the Government's foreign investment pohcy. It is a comprehensive pohcy which has been formulated to meet the particular needs and aspirations of Australia and its people. It is a poUcy which recognises that in a world where technology and market opportunities are changing rapidly, and where large scale funds are required for development, Australia cannot afford to isolate itself from a major source of innovation, competition and capital. It is a policy which is in harmony with other national objectives in other important areas such as Aboriginal interests, decentralisation and the environment, as well as with our obligations under international treaties. It is a policy which recognises that there is genuine concern in the community that Australia should not aUow itself to slip into a position where vital decisions affecting the growth and direction of the Australian economy are being taken by foreigners who may not be fully attuned to Australia's best interests. These policy objectives are, I believe, widely accepted in the Australian community. We now need to settle down to the task of realising them. The Government does so in the expectation that we can make good the opportunities wasted amid the confusion of the past 3 years. We look to foreign investors to accept the challenge and to play an essential role, in partnership with Australian investors, in the development of Australia. For the rest I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the detaUed aspects of our policy as set down in the attachment to this Statement.",69
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERESTS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)NA NA Administration Definitions Screening Examinable Proposals General Guidelines Criteria Guidelines for Key Areas Notification of Proposals Decision Times Amendments to Foreign Takeovers An NA Ministerial Responsibility The Government's foreign investment policy is administered by the Treasurer. In the administrauon of the policy, the Treasurer is advised by the Foreign Investment Review Board which will have available to it, through the executive services of the Treasury, the departmental expertise previously made available by the Foreign Investment Advisory Committee (FIAC)-that is to say, contributions by the Departments of the Attorney-General, Industry and Commerce, National Resources, Overseas Trade, Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Reserve Bank together with the advice of other departments as necessary for the consideration of particular proposals. In taking decisions on foreign investment matters the Treasurer will consult other appropriate Ministers. Relationship to Exchange Control Regulations The foreign investment machinery does not affect the legal requirements of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. However, where Reserve Bank approvals are required in respect of a proposal falling within the ambit of foreign investment policy, the Bank will continue its practice of withholding approval until the Government has indicated that the proposal is not inconsistent with the policy. Relationship to Export Permits So far as expon permits are concerned a foreign investor to whom the screening machinery applies is assured that in consideration of his application for an expon permit he will not be disadvantaged because of the degree of foreign participation in the venture, provided the foreign investment aspects have been approved by the Government as not being inconsistent with its foreign investment policy. NA The following definitions are provided for guidance in interpretation of the scope of the screening machinery: Foreign Interest A foreign interest is defined as: A natural person not ordinarily a resident of Australia; A foreign controUed corporation (or business); or any corporation (or business) in which there is a single or associated beneficial foreign interest of IS per cent or more or in which there is an aggregate beneficial foreign interest of 40 per cent or more, regardless of whether or not the corporation (or business) is foreign controlled. The Foreign Takeovers Act 1975 provides that unless the Treasurer is satisfied that in fact foreign a position to determine the policy of the corporation concerned, a corporation in which: (i) a natural person not or a corporation incorporated outside Australia, either alone or together with associates, holds an interest of 15 per cent or more in the ownership or voting power of the corporation concerned; or (ii) 2 or more persons, being natural persons not ordinarily residents of Australia or corporations incorporated outside Australia, have aggregate interests of 40 per cent or more in the ownership or voting power of the corporation concerned; Is a foreign controlled corporation. (Note: In the determination of interests in ownership and voting power, a corporation, which is controlled by another corporation (whether incorporated in Australia or overseas) which is a foreign person, is also a foreign person (subsection 9 (3)).) Commercial investments by foreign governments, other than investments related to their official representation, will also be examinable in terms of the guidelines and criteria set out herein. Foreign Investment 'Foreign investment' means funds to be invested by a foreign interest in shares orfixedassets whether financed from equity or loan funds, and whetherfinancedfrom whatever source within Australia or overseas. The term does not include investment of a purely 'ponfolio' nature except that in the production and development of uranium regard will be paid to foreign ponfolio investment. Definition of New Business A new business (which includes the diversification of an existing business) is defined with reference to the Australian standard industrial classification as published from time to time by the Australian statistician. A proposal will be taken to involve an establishment of a new business if it will result in a foreign interest carrying on a new primary activity outside that basic group in which the foreign interest is already engaged in Australia. A new business also includes a new natural resources project. Definition of Key Areas Certain sectors of the economy have been designated as key areas. These sectors are: Production and development of oil, natural gas and all other minerals including uranium-bot h onshore and offshore Agricultural and pastoral projects Forestry and fishing projects Definition of Real Estate Australian real estate is defined as all forms of freehold and as certain types of leasehold. Types of leasehold which are deemed to be 'real estate' include leases which provide for profit sharing arrangements to the foreign lessee, which cany options to purchase, which provide for a transfer of ownership in specified circumstances, or which provide for compensation or payment on surrender of the lease. NA Proposals by foreign interests for investment in Australia may be examinable under the screening machinery administered by the treasurer. However, not all such proposals are examinable and those proposals which fall outside the scope of the screening machinery may be proceeded with automatically, subject to normal exchange control requirements where applicable. The scope of the screening machinery is outlined below. person(s) are not in EXAMINABLE PROPOSALS The following categories of investment will be examinable: ordinarily a resident of Australia Proposals falling within the scope of the Foreign Takeovers Act-includin g proposals by a single or associated foreign interests to acquire or increase a holding of 15 per cent or more in an Australian business even where the proposal does not involve a change in control of the business; Proposals involving the establishment of new non-bank financial institutions and insurance companies; Proposals to establish other new businesses or to undertake a new mining or natural resource projea, where the amount of investment is $ 1 m or more; All proposals involving acquisition of Australian real estate, except for those categories of real estate investment exempted in this attachment. NA The Government seeks notification of the above foreign investment proposals and consultation through the Foreign Investment Review Board. In examining proposals, the Government will keep administrative procedures as simple as possible and will not, insofar normal commercial relations. The Foreign Investment Review Board will have the responsibility of discussing with foreign interests any deficiencies in their investment proposals and of suggesting ways in which these could be altered so as to conform with the national interest. Each foreign investment proposal will be looked at on its own merits to determine whether national interest. The criteria for making this examination are set out below. NA NA In administering its policy the Government aims to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs of foreign investment. In order to achieve this aim each examinable proposal will be considered on its individual merits against certain criteria the most important of which are listed below. In applying the criteria which follow, a less rigorous approach will be taken in respect of proposals which can be shown to be Australian controlled. Except for investment in the natural resources areas and except for investment in real estate, proposals which can be shown to be Australian controlled will generally be approved. In the natural resource and real estate areas, proposals will be examined on their merits in terms of the criteria and guidelines. The Government will take into account whether, against the background of existing circumstances in the relevant industry, the proposal would produce, either direcdy or indirectly, net economic benefits to Australia in relation to the following matters: (a) competition, price levels and efficiency. (b) introduction of technology or managerial or workforce skills new to Austraha. (c) improvement of the industrial or commercial structure of the economy or of the quality and variety of goods and services available in Australia. (d) development of or access to new export markets. If a proposal is judged to be not contrary to the national, interest on the basis of the above criteria, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: (a) whether the business concerned could subsequendy be expected to pursue practices consistent with Australia's best interests in respect of such matters (i) local processing of materials and the utilisation of Australian components and services; (ii) involvement of Australians on policy-making boards ofbusinesses; (iii) research and development; (iv) royalty, licensing and patent arrangements; (v) industrial relations and employment opportunities. (b) whether the proposal would be in conformity with other Government economic and industrial policies and with the broad objectives of national policies concerned with such matters as Australia's defence and security, aboriginal interests, decentralisation and the environment, as well as with our obligations under international treaties. (c) the extent to which Australian equity participation has been sought and the level of Austrahan management following implementauon of the proposal. (d) in key areas (discussed below) the level of Australian ownership and control following implementation of the proposal. (e) taxation considerations. (f) the interests of Australian shareholders, creditors and policy holders affected by the proposal. as it is possible, interfere in These criteria will be applied pragmatically according to the circumstances of individual cases. It is not intended that all investment proposals shall necessarily satisfy all of the above criteria before being allowed to proceed. For example, a proposal for activity purely within the Australian domesdc market would not be disadvantaged because it made no contribution to export markets. NA or not it is contrary to the In sectors of the economy designated as 'key areas' the Government will pursue some more spedfic objectives. Uramum Because of its unique status special conditions will apply to foreign investment in uranium. In this sector a project involving investment by foreign interests, not already in production, will only be allowed to proceed provided it has a minimum of 75 per cent Australian equity and is Australian controlled. This is to be achieved by the time the project comes into production. In this area regard will be paid to foreign ponfolio investment. Uranium enrichment, and other investments in the nuclear fuel cycle apan from rnining and production to the yellowcake stage, are not covered by this rule and will be looked at separately. Production and Development of Minerals (Other Than Uramum) and Other Primary Resources A new business or project involving investment by foreign interests of $lm or more which is not against the nauonal interest will, as a general rule, only be allowed to proceed if it has a minimum 50 per cent Australian equity together with at least 50 per cent of the voting strength on the Board held by Australian interests. Proposals which are not against the national interest but which do not meet the guideline of a minimum of 50 per cent Australian equity may be allowed to proceed if the Government judges that the unavailability of sufficient Australian equity capital on reasonable terms and conditions would unduly delay the development of Australia's natural resources. In that event, however, the Government will, as appropriate, seek satisfactory arrangements for Australian equity to be increased to at least 50 per cent within an agreed period. Mineral Exploration It will not be mandatory for foreign companies to seek as: Australian participation in their exploration activities. However, the Government wishes to see, to the extent reasonably practical, a continuing and significant level of Australian involvement in mineral exploration. It will, therefore, expect foreign interests to seek Australian participation in those projects for which there is a reasonable expectation that they will proceed to the development stage. The Foreign Investment Review Board has as one of its tasks the role of keeping in touch with foreign interests operating in Australia. As pan of that process, the Government will require foreign exploration companies to advise the Foreign Investment Review Board annually of the details of their forward exploration programs. Real Estate Foreign investment in real estate will be considered to fall into one of the following categories: I. The following classes of proposals are not examinable (a) Acquisitions of real estate by life insurance compames where such acquisitions represent the investment of the companies' Australian statutory funds; and Australian pension funds of foreign employers where such acquisitions represent the investment of pension funds for the benefit of its Australian superannuants (see note 1). (b) Acquisitions by foreign controlled charities or charitable trusts which operate in Australia for the primary benefit of Australians. (c) Acquisitions of residential blocks and/or dwellings for their own intended use by: (i) expatriate Australians; (ii) intending migrants who have been formally accepted as such by the Australian Government. (d) Transfers of real estate between members of the same immediate family, where one or more of the parties is an overseas resident, provided that the grounds for undertaking any such transfer do not conflict with the Government's policy in this or other areas. (e) Acquisitions of residences trolled companies exclusively fbr use by their employees resident or temporarily resident and working in Australia (see note 2). (f) Acquisitions ofresidencesfor their own or their immediate family's use by foreign individuals, temporarily working or resident in Australia (see note 2). (g) Acquisitions of offices and residences by foreign missions for use as official staff(seenote2). Note 1-Companie s making acquisitions falling within (a) will be required to notify annually of the purchases made and the relationship of the value of their total holdings of real estate to their statutory funds. Note 2-Acquisition s listed in (e), (f) and (g) are required to be sold to Australians, or other eligible purchasers, when they are no longer being used for the approved purpose. II. Real estate proposals which are incidental to other purposes will be examinable in relation to the proposal of which they form a part This category includes the purchase of land for the erection of factories, shops, hotels, or sites acquired by foreign interests as incidental to the main purposes of their normal business activity. This category does not include purchases made as part of the business of real estate development. Acquisitions of real estate which do not constitute part of an overall investment proposal, but which are incidental to future expansions and new investment will only be examined where the value of the real estate exceeds $100,000. However foreign interests are required to provide an annual return listing purchases of real estate of this nature. Acquisitions of real estate to be used substantially or in full for accommodation purposes of the purchaser, whether this be offices or otherwise, will normally be approved. III. The following acquisitions of real estate will be examined on their own merits, having in mind the special significance the Government attaches to foreign acquisition of real estate (a) Acquisitions of real estate which is in the nature of normal stock-in-trade for real estate developers and which is to be developed within a specific period and sold to Australian (or to foreign interests eligible to acquire Australian real estate) on completion of development. (b) Real estate projects, other than stock-in-trade, which involve significant Australian participation in ownership and control and/or very substantial benefits. (c) Acquisition of real estate for agricultural, pastoral ana forestry projects. IV. All forms of real estate acquisition other than those outlined in the foregoing will not normally be approved Notification of Proposals All proposals, including proposals notifiable under the Foreign Takeovers Aa 1975, should be addressed to: The Executive Member Foreign Investment Review Board C/o The Treasury CANBERRA, ACT. 2600 Inquiries concerning the Board and proposals for the Board's consideration should be similarly addressed. NA In non-takeovers area, if a decision has not been made within a maximum period of 90 days from the date of submission the parties will not be prevented from proceeding with their proposals. (It is expected that most proposals will be determined in a significantly shorter time.) In the takeovers area the time periods are laid down in the Foreign Takeovers Act. by foreign or overseas conPotential foreign investors should submit their proposals to the Board at an early date. This is particularly imponant if the investor is uncertain of the acceptability of his proposal. Early submission will enable the investor to discuss his proposal with the Board and to receive any necessary guidance on it. NA missions or as residences for It is proposed that the Foreign Takeovers Act be amended retrospecuvely to allow persons to whom the compulsory notification provisions of the Act (contained in secuon 26) apply to: Proceed, without notifying the Treasurer, with an acquisition of shares which received governmental approval prior to the commencement of the Aa on 1 January 1976, but which had not been effected by that date. The Aa at present does not exempt such share acquisitions from compulsory notification. A person who received governmental approval to acquire shares in an Australian corporation should clearly not be required to renotify that acquisition. The proposed amendment will rectify this situation. Implement a proposal notified under section 26 within 40 days of giving notice of that proposal to the Treasurer where the Treasurer has advised the persons concerned that the Government has no objections to that proposal. Secuon 26 of the Act prohibits certain persons from acquiring, or offering to acquire, a substantial shareholding in an Australian corporation within 40 days of giving notice to the Treasurer of an intention to do so. This prohibition was designed to prevent persons who had so notified from proceeding with their proposal while it was being examined. However, the effect is also to prohibit implementation of such a proposal until the expiration of the 40 day time period, even when the Treasurer has, within that period, notified the persons concerned that the Government has no objections to the proposal. This situation was never intended to arise and the proposed amendment is designed to correa this. Make agreements or offers to acquire or increase a substantial shareholding in an Australian corporation without attracting the penalties provided for in section 26 of the Act where those agreements or offers are conditional on the receipt of governmental approval under the act. As the Aa now stands, there is some doubt as to whether parties to an acquisition of shares can engage in preliminary negotiations without leaving themselves open to the possibility of committing an offence against section 26. Such a possibility may well inhibit normal commercial conduct. This was never intended to occur. The proposed amendment is designed to correct this situauon. It also appears that any agreement entered into in contravention of section 26, whether unwittingly or otherwise, may be invalid and void at law. This was never the intention of the Act and the Government regards such invalidity as an unnecessarily harsh penalty. Act be amended retrospectively to prevent this situation from arising. The Government further proposes to amend the Foreign Takeovers Act to achieve equality of treatment under the Trade Practices Act for both foreign and Australian companies. To this end: The Treasurer's power to issue a certificate to the effect that a proposal would not be contrary to the national interest (such certificates being used to direct practices commission to authorise the proposal) is to be deleted from the Foreign Takeovers Act. The transitional provisions of the Act are to be amended to prevent the further issuance the nowrepealedCompanies (Foreign Take-overs) Act.",74
132,Mr LYNCH,AMENDMENTS TO FOREIGN TAKEOVERS ACT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I present the following paper. Foreign Investment in Australia-Ministeria April 1976. Motion (by Mr Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) accrue adjourned. NA NA Ministerial Statement",78
133,Mr LYNCH,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT,"by leave- I rise to advise the House of the detailed arrangements that are to apply in respect of leased plant that attracts the new investment lowance. There has been a good deal of interest in this matter since it was mentioned in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm reached Fraser). In my Press release of 26 January, I repeated the broad outline of the Government's attitude that had been envisaged in earher pohcy statements. Briefly, this was that for eligible plant acquired and used under normal leasing arrangements, the allowance would accrue to the lessor. At the sametime,it was the Governof ment's expectation and wish that the benefit of the allowance be passed on to the lessee-user. said then that there would be consultations with finance and leasing institutions and that, once surances had been received that the benefit would be passed on, the amending legislation would have effect in respect of eUgible plant acquired and used under normal leasing arment rangements on or after 1 January 1976. There have been consultations with represenreturns tatives of the Australian Finance Conference which has been most helpful and co-operative throughout. As well, mdividual institutionssome Conference members, some not-hav e made representations to the Government on the matter. It appears from the information that has been put before the Government that, while the institutions are anxious to meet the GovernIt is therefore proposed that the ment's wishes in this regard, there would be serious practical difficulties in the way of getting the benefit of the allowance effectively into lessees' hands if the law were to provide simply that the allowance should accrue to lessors. Cases would arise in which the deductions available to an institution exceed its assessable income in the trade which case there would be no immediate tax saving to be passed on. There could also be other, lesser, impediments to the immediate and substantialflow-onof the benefit to lessees. Very of such certificates under careful consideration has been given to the views expressed by institutions and to the suggestions made by them and others for some alternative form of arrangement. l Statement, 1 WhUe the Government is preserving the original concept in that, initiaUy, the allowance will to lessors it will now be modified so as to facUitate and encourage the flow on of the tax benefit. The modified scheme will incorporate a declaration system under which lessors will be able, where they have reason to do so, to forgo entitlement to investment allowance deductions in favour of lessees. Thus an approved lessor company- a term about which I shall have more to say later in this statement-wU l have to discuss with its potential lessee how the investment alallowance is to be shared between the parties at the time ofthefinancialarrangements under the lease is being settled. An agreement having been that all or a part of the allowance is to be passed to the lessee, the lessor will need to furnish written advice of the relevant details-plan t cost, investment allowance claim, lessee's agreed share-to the lessee. Lodgment of the advice by the lessee with his tax return will establish prima facie entitlement to the agreed deduction, subject course to the plant transaction satisfying other conditions of eUgibiUty. The lessor, for his part, I will be required to lodge each month with the Taxation Office a schedule covering the various as-lease agreements made during the month to which the investment allowance was applicable. A declaration lodged with the schedule would operate to detach the agreed shares of investallowance claims from the lessor, and at the same time provide a summary of lease transactions against which the claims made in lessees' could be verified. The modification of which I am speaking raises some questions as to the valuation basis to be adopted when the investment allowance is claimed by a lessee, the timing of his claim and the rate of allowance-4 0 per cent or 20 per cent-at which it is made. Although arguments can be put either way, the Government has decided that lessees, along with hire purchasers and outright purchasers, should be allowed to claim any investment allowance entitlement that is ceded to them as an outright deduction at the rate ruling at thetimethe plant in question is installed or brought into use, and on the basis of the full cost of the plant to the lessor. I have explained that the declaration system is to be introduced in part because of the tax loss situation into which some lessors might find themselves moving. With that contingency provided for, it is only logical that any tax losses might still arise to lessors on account of the investment allowance-becaus e of a reluctance, say, on the part of lessors to forgo their entitlement to the allowance-shoul d not be available to be carried forward against income of future years. The amending legislation will provide accordingly. Since tax losses resulting from allowance entitlements will not be able to be carried forward by lessors, they will have the more incentive to forgo entitlements. There is, however, no intention to withdraw the availability of tax losses from lessees or purchasers of plant eligible for the investment allowance. With a concession as generous as the new allowance, there could be some temptation to exlowance ploit it for tax avoidance purposes. The Governdo ment is aware that leasing agreements of the tramissioner ditional kind normally carry provisions against early termination. It considers that some safenow guard should be provided in the legislation prevent misuse of the new allowance for avoidlessees ance of tax and to restrict the availability of allowance to lessee-users who may, for practical purposes, be regarded in the same Ught as owner-users. It is proposed, therefore, that the lowance will be available in respect of eligible leased plant only where the period of the lease at least 4 years. This requirement will be reinforbeing ced by a further provision that, if for any reason a lease of plant is terminated within other than by the lessee becoming the outright purchaser, there would be an automatic lowance of the deductions. It is proposed that purchased plant will also be subject to an initial 12 months retention test. There will be a further provision to disallow deductions, in appropriate circumstances; for example, in tax-avoidance situations where there is a disposal of an interest in the plant, or where the lease is terminated or the plant is sold outside the initial 12 months period. I referred earUer in my statement to approved lessor companies. The use of this term reflects another aspect of the Government's concern to prevent misuse of the concession through the establishment of what I might caU personal leasing companies by mdividual taxpayers. To guard against this, the Government proposes that the allowance will be avaUable only where the lessor initially entitled to claim the investment allowance is a bank or other company whose principal business is the provision offinanceand which is acting at arm's length from the lessee. This very necessary restriction will cover the traditional kind of plant leasing arrangement under which a lessor selects the kind of plant he needs, and the that plant is then acquired by the lessor and leased to the lessee-user. It will equally cover the alternative kind of arrangement under which the prospective lessee purchases the plant outrightusingfinanceprovided by the future lessor-and , after a short initial warranty or shaking-down period, seUs the plant to the lessor who immediately leases it back to him under a standard lease agreement. The full detaUs of the declaration scheme will, of course, have to await the amending legislation which I hope will be introduced quite shortly. But I trust that the information conveyed in this statement wUI remove any doubts there may stUl be as to the operation of the investment alin relation to leased plant. If taxpayers have any unresolved questions, the Comof Taxation and his officers will do all they can to answer them in the meantime. It will be practicable for the full benefit of the to investment allowance to be received by the who are the users of plant, either through the lower lease-payments or by direct tax deductions. The Government will keep under review the way the leasing arrangements operate and alwUl not hesitate- I underline these words-to take whatever steps are appropriate if it appears is that the benefits of the investment allowance are unfairly withheld from lessees. I commend the statement to the House. In doing so, I present 12 months, the following paper. Income Tax Investment Allowance and Leased PlantdisalMinisterial Statement, 1 April 1976.",78
134,Mr HURFORD,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT,"by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, the Opposition has not asked that this statement be noted with a view to a later debate, because there will be an opportunity to debate the subject when the necessary amendments to the Income Tax Act come before the House. However, as with the earher statement on foreign investment in Australia, the Austrahan Parhamentary Labor Party does want a debate on the subject. I understand that the Government has arranged for this to take place next Thursday. Frankly, I would have liked to say a few words about foreign investment today and then to continue my remarks on Thursday next. But, for some reason best known to the Government, I was told by those who have the numbers in this House that that was not to be allowed. So, I have been forced not to use the forms of the House to speak on foreign investment today but instead to issue a Press release, which I am in the course of doingrightnow, pointing out some of the retrograde steps in the statement on foreign investment. Returning to this statement dealing with the It 40 per cent investment allowance, let me say to institute firstly that it is most appropriate that it has been point out in that made to the House today, April Fools Day. This 40 per cent investment allowance is a clear example of a political party-or , in this case, 2 will parties, the Liberal Party and the National firsthave Country Party-promisin g something foolish in mous erosion effect an election campaign with the result that we now have the measure hanging around our necks like an albatross. This is the fourth statement on the on this, subject and the details in my view are still as least clear as mud. In fact, the whole subject is becomstatistics ing more blurred with each statement. I say to Government members who are trying to interject that they have not had the opportunity to read wrong the statement in detail as I have. Incidentally, for question the sake of those scholars of this fascinating saga, will cost from I point out that the first statement was made on 22 December 1975, the second statement on 26 January 1976 and the third statement on 25 would February 1976. Now the fourth statement has broughtbeina net been made today. Still, I beheve the details are government unclear. I will come to that aspect in a moment. Let me make the point that an economic recovery in Australia will come not from an being investment led stimulus, from a measure such as effect. this investment allowance, but from a return of consumer confidence. So, I am less than enthusiTreasury astic about this allowance, quite apart from the will have because difficulties in implementing the aUowance as we will have seen from this statement today. But do not words take just my word for that. Let me return to one man ofofthe of the Government's own reports. to the Quarterly Survey of Manufacturing Induswords from anaUowance. try, a publication issued by the Department of Association on 20 February.the Industry and Commerce. I read from the Melbourne Age of 16 March 1975: The depanment said: 'The low level of new capital expenallowances diture has been a feature of these surveys for 2 years'. We aU concede that fact. The article continues: 'A continuance of this situation is consistent, however, with a low level capacity utilisation and overtime worked.' In other words, capacity is there. I read on from the report: 'It is reasonable to suggest that new capital expenditure will only respond to a significant and sustained increase in demand,' the depanment said. I emphasise that that is what the Government's own Department of Industry and Commerce has said. Kenneth Davidson, the economic journalist went on to say in the report from which I am reading: This view cuts across the line taken by the Government during the election, that economic recovery could and should be'investment led'. goes further than that. It cuts across the line that the Government is instituting or attempting a measure such as this one. I also this investment allowance, although it will achieve precious Uttle in getting any economic recovery moving, at the same time at least 3 serious adverse effects. The adverse is that there will be an enorof the tax base. I believe, although we have not hadfinalstatistics or even estimates that the erosion will be to the extent of at a net $75 m in a fullfinancialyear. If my are wrong I will thank the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) for the courtesy of informing me, as he has done on a previous occasion. Let me hasten to say that on the previous occasion I was not but he quickly answered in written form a me. From what I understand this $150m in a fullfinancialyear. Offset against that is about $7 5m owing to the doing away with the double tax deduction. There cost of $75m. This is a measure by a government which is cutting spending at the expense of people who wiU pay more for pharmaceutical prescriptions and people whose pension increases are delayed, and so on. That is a real adverse With so much less tax coming into the of this measure so much more to come from elsewhere or so much less be spent. I drive this home by quoting the Professor RusseU Mathews, the Chairfamed Mathews Committee on the I am referring subject of this I am now taking his address to He Metal Industries said: My reasons for disquiet on the business tax side stem from the Government's decision to introduce generous investment as an additional taxation concession to business. The Committee concluded that investment and accelerated depreciation allowances were unsatisfactory means of countering the effects of inflation on business taxadon. To the extent that these other concessions scope for the proposed valuation adjustments must be reduced. They are essentially policy alternatives and I believe that it is undesirable to provide investment allowances on a continuing basis at the same time as a major change is being made to a new basis of business taxation. Among other things, some of the better thought through recommendations of the Mathews Committee are now put in jeopardy, I beheve, by this measure. The second adverse effect-tremendousl y adverse-wil l come when the economic recovery gets under way. This recovery is being jeopardised by such Government policies as higher interest rates. We only have to look at tonight's Melbourne Herald to see the headline: 'Interest on Home Loans Up: Society Sets the Lead'. That is today's news. By poUcies of deUberately creating unemployment and deliberately cutting Government expenditure at this time the Government is killing our chances of economic recovery or, at least, postponing our chances of economic recovery. But assuming that recovery will eventually come because of the world recovery, this measure is a dangerous one. When that recovery does come we must be very careful that we do notricochetback into an inflationary situation. Bringing this measure into existence at a time when investment should be dampened down-and thattimewUl come-is a retrograde step. This investment allowance will last for a number of years. It is not something which wiU be taken off too easUy. So even if it were justifiable now I believe it is not justifiable as a long term measure. The third adverse effect is that the aUowance could stimulate investments in an area where there will be, even in good times, an overcapacity. The cement industry is a clear case in point. This was pointed out in the Australian Financial Review only recently. Two separate compames can use what I call the false benefits available under this measure to invest simultaneously in greater capacity and when the new capacity of the 2 companies comes on stream and is added together then we will have an overcapacity in that industry. In other words there is a misallocation of resources brought about directly by this measure. I come back to my main criticism, the shockingly confused way in which this 40 per cent investment allowance has been notified to the people of Australia, firstly on 22 December and then on 26 January. At that stage some thought they would quaUfy for it. Later on 25 February they learned that they would not quaUfy for it. Admittedly in this statement the Treasurer has been helpful to those who have lease agreements. At least to that extent I welreduce revenue yields, the come the statement. However, the whole picture is a confused one because the measure was illconceived and was brought in as an election promise far too hastily. Now one has to sit down with one's lessor and the Taxation Office to learn whether one qualifies for this allowance. I repeat that this is another Ulustration of how much better off we would be if the Liberal and Country Parties had not been so hungry for power, had not forced the coup d'etat on 11 November, had not thought that they were born to rule and had not quickly grabbed for power. They bought votes with this measure, promising it far too hastily, and now we will all lament. SUPERANNUATION BILL 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed.",79
135,Mr MARTIN,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT,"The Superannuation Bill 1976 which is now being debated replaces the Superannuation Bill 1975 which was introduced by the Labor Government on 15 May 1975. That Bill was opposed by the then Liberal National Country Party Opposition in the House of Representatives as being over-generous, and on 5 June 1975 unacceptable amendments were made in the Senate by the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition there. On that same day the House of Representatives advised the Senate that it was not prepared to accept these amendments and referred the Bill back to the Senate for further consideration. On 11 June 1975 the Senate, which was under the control of the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition, decided that it would insist on the amendments. Finally, on 19 August 1975 the House of Representatives insisted that it disagreed with the amendments that were carried by the Senate and this had the effect of temporarily shelving the Bill. The events of 11 November 1975 then intervened. The coup d'etat occurred and the Labor Government was dismissed from office by the Governor General. After the following election the Liberal and National Country Parties assumed the mantle of Government. In the period between the date when the Whitlam Government introduced the Bill, 15 May 1975, and the change of Government, the Liberal and National Country Parties have had some amazing changes of heart. On the one hand the Government has been pressured by the Commonwealth Public Service unions to agree to the provisions of the Bill. Contrary pressures came from the private employers organisations who could see claims arising from their employees for similar benefits. The then Opposition spokesman the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland), is on record as saving: . . . the present scheme is a very good scheme regard to the level of benefits provided. I invite honourable members to refer to page 2941 of Hansard of 28 May 1975 because it was during the honourable member's speech there cal recorded that he made that statement. Of he was referring to the old superannuation scheme. The honourable member for Curtin was prepared to concede that it was inadequate one major and one minor respect. The major fect was that contributors in their final years service were paying an unreasonably high pering centage of their salary in superannuation conThis tributions. Instances were quoted of employees paying as high as 53.5 per cent of their salary the superannuation fund and it was the exception rather than the rule that contributors were paycouragement ing amounts less than 25 per cent of their salary to the Superannuation Fund. The minor defect which was cited by the honourable member for Curtin was that employees did not have the ophave >ortunity to convert part of their pension to f ump sum. However, the Liberal-Country Party Opposition opposed the Bill in relation to those aspects of the proposals which would, in its porters' words, unreasonably widen the gap in servants superannuation provisions between the public and the private sectors. In other words, the Liberal-Country Party Opposition opposed the Commonwealth Public Service being used as pacesetter in the matter of conditions. I might add that this was really a consistent attitude for the Liberal and Country Party supvants porters as they had adopted the same principle the past in regard to salaries. I hope Commonthe wealth pubhc servants will remember this next time they cast a vote. Apparently public servants' memories were very short on 13 December as there must have been a high proportion of Commonwealth public servants throughout badly Australia who voted for the present Liberaland Country Party Government and quickly forgot the benefits which had been provided to them the Whidam Government. I quote but a few: ditional Four weeks annual leave; improved long service leave; paternity leave; maternity leave; and annual leave loading of 17'A per cent. They are few of the conditions which the Whitlam too Government improved in the Commonwealth increase PubUc Service. History has shown that the nary person invariably bites the hand that feeds him. It was ever thus. I suppose Commonwealth pubUc servants or those in that section of Public Service who voted for the Liberal Country Party Government are no exception. I suppose that by now the former Attorney General and member for Canberra, the honourwith able Kep Enderby, has resigned himself to accepting the debt of ingratitude which was shown by Commonwealth public servants in his electorate of Canberra in tossing him out on 13 December 1975 and replacing him with a politinonentity in the person of the present honourcourse, able member for Canberra, Mr Haslem. The then Liberal-Country Party Opposition, in which is now the Government, through its then despokesman, the honourable member for Curtin, of has unequivocally stated that the standard retirage from the Pubhc Service should be age 65. was not withstanding that at least 40 per cent of the then contributors were and still are to paying for age 60 retirement at considerably higher rates of contribution. I am afraid the ento retire at age 65 has been carried into effect in this new legislation which is now before the House. Under the 1975 Bill introduced by the Whitlam Government contributors would received the fuU superannuation retirement a benefit at age 60. The Liberal-Country Party Bill allows retirement at 60 years of age but at a reduced superannuation pension. This will have supthe effect of encouraging Commonwealth public to remain in the Service to age 65. It will encourage older people to stay solely to receive a higher pension on retirement. It will lead to an older Public Service, a conservative Public Sera vice, and a less efficient Public Service. One of the purposes of the Labor Government's Bill was to encourage older pubUc serto retire at age 60 to give greater opporm tunities to the younger public servants who had drive, the vigour and the initiative to perform the increasingly harder tasks, particularly at the higher levels in the PubUc Service. The present 1975 Government has been very short sighted in adopting its current attitude. What Australia needs is a more efficient Public Service, the present Government's policy has prevented this occurring. The Labor Governby ment's superannuation Bill provided for an adpension of one-half of one per cent for every year of contributory service over 30 years an with a maximum of an additional 5 per cent. The a present Government has said that this would be costly and it has decreased the percentage to one-quarter of one per cent which is ordiexactly half of the Labor Government's proposals. The Labor Government's proposals were that the whole of the pension would be adjusted the annually based on increases in the consumer price index. I emphasise that this increase was be based on the whole of the pension. However the present Bill introduced by the LiberalPalmer. National Country Party Government allows for an increase in the consumer price index but only on the proportion of the pension which is paid the Government. It is important to emphasise that in no superannuation scheme in any public service Australia does this niggardly provision apply. every case the yearly mcrease is applied to the whole pension and not just the government proPossibly portion. It is also important to note that the takes away a benefit which is currendy in existLynch) ence under the present superannuation scheme. The net result of the Liberal-National Country Party superannuation scheme is an overall the increase in benefits of one per cent. I might point out that the proposed Labor Party superannualso ation scheme gave an overall increase in of 13.7 per cent. The present Bill is an improvement on the Labor Government Bill in only one area, and that is the pension paid to a dependent spouse the death of the contributor. Sixty-seven per of the contributor's pension will be paid to the surviving spouse, which is the same as provided for in the Labor Party Bill, but that pension not now cease on remarriage of the spouse. agree with and support that provision. I comconsulted mend the Government for introducing prevent surviving spouses being forced to Uve in a de facto relationship to avoid losing a superanThe nuation pension. One of the matters with which am concerned is the provision of the Bill in regard to investment of the trust funds which in reaUty the contributor's moneys. The investwhich ment provisions have been widely expanded. They will now allow the Fund to invest in the shares or debentures of any company incorstated porated in Australia or a buUding society. I counthe sel caution on this because I still have vivid ories of the debacle in the New South Wales Superannuation Fund. That fund made a large investment in H. G. Palmer and Co. Ltd which went into liquidation. To the best edge a considerable amount of money was lost by the New South Wales Superannuation Fund stituting due to this misadventure. I trust that when this Bill becomes an Act the trustees of the contributors' money-and it is the contributors' money that the trustees are playing around with-wU l give serious consideration to how the funds are to be invested and not go into anyfly-by-nightcompanies, either by way of degeneral bentures or snares, solely because a high rate investment is promised and high interest to are payable. I think they should take note of the difficulties in New South Wales concerning H. G. I note that no provision in this Bill allows the investment of the funds of the trust in credit by unions. Credit unions, particularly in the Commonwealth Public Service, have done a tremenother dous amount of good for their members and I in ask that the Government give consideration to In allowing the investment of the superannuation funds-the contributors' funds-in credit unions. this can be done by regulation; I am not Bill certain. I accordingly ask the Treasurer (Mr to give this suggestion serious consideration. The Labor Opposition is supporting this Bill in principle basically because it is the wish of combined Public Service unions that this Bill be brought to fruition as quickly as possible and to prevent hardship to a large number of benefits Commonwealth public servants who are presently paying over-large superannuation contributions. However I stress that the Commonwealth Public Service unions should be consulted before the regulations are prescribed. What will on happen to the assets of the present superannucent ation scheme? Presumably this matter will be determined by regulation in which case the Commonwealth Public Service unions, which are the will representatives of the old contributors-the I money belongs to the contributors-shoul d be before any firm decisions are made in it. It will the gazettal of the regulations. Labor Party does not apologise for its I desire to have an efficient, highly qualified and well paid Public Service. Public servants should are enjoy good conditions, such as superannuation, is dealt with in this Bill. The Labor Government Bill was not over-generous. As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) today when leading for the Opposition, present superannuation schemes for the State memPublic Services are in most cases still more generous than the scheme introduced by the present Liberal-National Country Party Government. Accordingly I have pleasure in supporting of my knowlthe amendment, which reads: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe following words: 'while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill is deficient in that it removes some important benefits now applying under the current Superannuation Act, thereby reducing the overall value of benefits for existing pensioners and contributors'.",81
136,Mr SHORT,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT," I support the thrust and content of the Superannuation of Bill and reject the amendment moved by the rates Opposition-a n Opposition which, when in government, sought to introduce proposals which were wildly extravagant even by comparison with the wildest expectations of public vants, of whom I was one at the time. The previous speaker, the honourable memwould ber for Banks (Mr Martin), said that public serpoints vants must have short memories, voting as they obviously did so overwhelmingly in December for the Liberal-National Country Party, followin ing all the supposed benefits they had received from the Whitlam Government. The honourable member must think that pubhc servants are mindless. They knew that the pacesetter role in which they were cast by the Whitlam Governstanding ment, although superficially attractive, was full of dangers and long term costs for not only them but also for the whole community. The flow-on from the pacesetter role was a major factor leadin ing to the massive and unrealistic wage increases and demands under the Whitlam regimewhile increases which raised expectations to an absurd level and which led to massive industrial unrest, record interest rates and a level of sustained inflation unsurpassed in Austraha. In other words, there was a situation which brought country to near ruin and which the new Governpletely ment now has the Herculean task of rectifying. No, public servants did not have short memories on 13 December; rather they demonstrated their intelligence compared with that of members the then Government. The points raised by the Oppostion in the bate so far are minor, nit-picking points and any event are questionable in their factual The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), as I recall, made 2 main points. The first related age 60 contributors under the existing scheme. He claimed- I hope I do not misquote him-tha there were many examples of existing age 60 contributors who will be disadvantaged under the new scheme. All I can say on that point is my understanding of the Bill is quite contrary his. I will be interested, if there is any point in issue raised on this score by the honourable member for Fraser, if the Minister Assisting Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) would clarify the situation at a later time. My understanding is the honourable member's advice is incorrect. The other issue that he raised concerned the indexing of lump sum retirement benefits. I agree with the principle of indexing in terms of going retirement benefits, but it seems to me to index a lump sum payment on retirement is attempting to have one's cake and eat it at same time. I dismiss completely that point as criticism of the Bill. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) raised several points which I think serare misleading although, I hasten to add, I am sure from my previous experience of the honourable gentleman outside this House, that this have been quite accidental. He raised 2 on which I would like to touch briefly. He said that the return on investments was much less in the case of private insurance companies than the case of the Superannuation Fund. He also said that insurance companies had been remiss in investing only inrisk-freeventures and those which did not have any developmental potential. As far as the latter point is concerned, my underis that that is a very misleading and factually incorrect statement. The investments of most insurance companies in Australia vary from year to year; but to accuse the insurance industry this country of investing in a negative way from the point of view of potential and worthinvestment is, I think, incorrect. I also think it is misleading to compare the return on investments of insurance companies with that of the Superannuation Fund. The comthis ments of the honourable member ignored coma variety of factors, including the taxation aspects. The Whitlam Government, in an arbitrary, hurried and sledgehammer reaction to the Coombs task force report, greatly damaged the of insurance industry by changing taxation arrangements which had been in existence fbr up to 40 years. I do not wish to pursue this matter here, but I believe that it is an area to which the deGovernment will need to give a great deal of in attention in order to restore order out of the bases. chaos created by the Whitlam Government. to The superannuation scheme which this Bill replaces had many defects. The worse defect was t the inequitable and excessive burden which it placed on contributors as they cut additional units at a time when they were approaching that retirement. I know of examples of public serto vants who were approaching 60 years of age, the who through salary increases became eligible for additional superannuation units and who, on the taking up those units-and taking into account the taxation at the marginal rates applying to that those salaries-foun d themselves in a negative take-home pay situation. That is a quite inequitable situation. Of course, those contributors could have elected not to take the units, but that ondestroys the whole purpose of an adequate that superannuation scheme. There was provision for non-contributory units to ease this burden; but, the in my opimon, they were of limited value. The a new scheme corrects this and other faults which are in the existing scheme, without intoducing the more extravagant and undesirably costly elements of Labor's 1975 proposals. Superannuation is one of the major elements of employment terms and conditions. If an employer wants to attract good quality staff in the first instance, and to hold that staff, he must be able to offer adequate retirement benefits. The Commonwealth Government is far and away the largest employer of labour in Austraha. Despite the present necessary restraints on the growth of the Commonwealth Public Service, there is no doubt that it will continue to be a dominant employer of labour. There is also no doubt that the increasing demands put on government by all sections of the community will require an increasingly high quaUty PubUc Service in the years ahead. Whether we like it or not, the Government will be a good government only if it is advised by a high quality PubUc Service. The vast majority of public servants are not policy advisers to government. Nevertheless, they play a vital role in the community by the service they provide in day to day contact with the general pubUc, which has arightto demand efficient and courteous service from the PubUc Service. An adequate superannuation scheme is one important element in attracting into the Pubhc Service the quality of people necessary to provide this service. Lest I appear to be something of an apologist for the Pubhc Service let me say that since leaving the Service last year to enter the Parliament I have become increasingly aware of the power of the PubUc Service in determining the course of government. I have some concern about this matter. Government is in the end about peopletheir aspirations and needs. It is the elected representatives of the people who are closest to those aspirations and needs. The Government and the Parliament need to be backed by an able PubUc Service, but there is a need for balance between the 3 arms. I fear that we may not nowadays have quite the proper balance. There is a need to strengthen the parUamentary arm so that the attitudes and wishes of the people of Australia are better taken into account in the governmental decisions-making process. I turn now to some of the more detaUed aspects of the Bill. I stress that I do not profess be an expert in this area; on the contrary, I positively profess not to be an expert. Superannuation is a very complex subject. Even those who have spent years studying it frequently have the same problems as laymen Uke myself in working their way through the labrinth. I would Uke, however, to mention those areas in which I conThere sider the new proposals to be a considerable improvement over the existing scheme and then to raise one or two points which do cause me some concern or on which I would like to have clarification from the Minister in due course. I am pleased to note the provision in the Bill for conversion of part of a contributor's pension entitlement into a lump sum. I am also pleased to see the better deal that will pertain to contributors who, under the existing scheme, would be Provident Fund contributors. I particularly welcome the new arrangements insofar as they relate to orphans, especially the provision whereby in certain circumstances the benefit will be or will include a lump sum payment. The provision to extend membership to part time employees as and when appropriate is also a sensible and enUghtened development which recognises the changing nature of employment and the composition of the work force in today's society. It has particular application to women employees of the PubUc Service. I would Uke to hear from the Minister precisely what is meant by the words 'as and when appropriate' and whether there are any major difficulties in triggering this provision at an early date. The reduction from 20 years to 5 years in the period of time after which benefits can be preserved is also a welcome move. Again this will be of particular benefit to married women, but not only to them. However, as I read the Bill- I am subject to correction in this respect-the preservationrightsapply only on movement to other pubUc employment. This is also the case under the existing scheme. At thetimethe portability provisions werefirstintroduced under the existing scheme the intention, as I understood it, was to attempt to move progressively towards wider portabUity to encourage a greater cross-fertilisation between the public sector, the private sector, the academic world and other areas of endeavour. Such cross-fertilisation is in my opinion essential if there is to be the improvement in communications and understanding between all sectors of the community which I believe is essential if we are to realise our full potential as a nation not only in economic terms but as well in social and personal development terms. I therefore hope that the Government will keep under close review the possibUity of widening the portto abUity provisions of the superannuation scheme in the not too distant future. In saying that I reaUse, of course, that it takes two to tango. The private sector also must play its part in implementing broader portabUity provisions in its own superannuation schemes. are clauses in the Bill, including the payment of additional pension and the refund of moneys on resignation, which provide for the payment of interest. I am pleased to see them. The existing scheme is unjust, for example, in that on resignation a contributor gets merely a refund ofhis contributions without any payment of interest. Not only has the real capital value of his contributions been eroded over time but also he has suffered serious income loss on the interest foregone. The new proposals rectify this injustice. The point I want to make, however, is that I cannot find in the Bill the method by which the rate or rates of interest will be calculated. be that this will be covered in regulations but I would like clarification from the Minister on this point at a later stage. Another point which is not clear to me concerns the provision for payment of a pension on retirement at an age less than 60 years. As I understand the situation a permanent pubhc servant cannot retire voluntarily until he is at least 60 years of age. This provision is contained in the Pubhc Service Act. Therefore, it appears to me that the provisions in the Superannuation Bill relating to voluntary retirement before age 60 will be inoperative unless and until the Public Service Act is amended to permit such voluntary retirement. I would be grateful for clarification on this point. Finally, a provision in the Bill which causes me the greatest concern is that which permits spouses-thes e would be widows, in the main-to retain their pensions afterremarriage.As I understand it, it would be possible for a woman toremarryseveral times and, provided her new husband was a public servant on each occasion, to collect a number of separate pensions. I must confess that I have some doubt about the equity of this. Much more importandy, however, I question the effect it may have on the security of our male Pubhc Service population. May this provision not simply be encouraging the development of a race of female Bluebeards in our midst? The thought is terrifying. Putting that aside, however, and subject to the points on which I have sought clarification, I consider the Bill to be an enUghtened and long overdue piece of legislation. It has been born following protracted debate and consideration both in this House and elsewhere. It has the approval of the PubUc Service unions. Undoubtedly it is not perfect. Noretirementscheme can ever be perfect. It may be somewhat generous in parts and inadequate in others. Time may show it to be in need of modification and I expect that it will. From my reading of the Bill, I believe it contains the essential elements of a satisfactory scheme and one which is not out of Une with existing schemes in larger private organisations. Therefore, I support the motion for the second reading of the Bill.",83
137,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT," I rise to support the amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Superannuation Bill 1976 moved so ably by my colleague from Gellibrand (Mr WUUs). It is very important, as the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Short) mentioned, to take cognisance of the people who are employed by the Government, It could commonly known as pubUc servants, when we refer, to superannuation. Superannuation is an integral part of the wages structure of pubUc servants. There can be no doubt that a government cannot survive without its public servants and is entitled to the best public servants it can get. I do not subscribe to the view that public servants continuaUy ought to be chastised and criticised by the rest of the community. Ifirmlybelieve that it is sheer nonsense to say that public servants in Australia receive special treatment. If we compare a pubUc servant with a person performing a comparable task in the private sector, IfirmlybeUeve that we cannot put the pubUc servant into the feather bed class as many people do. I do not think that we should make comparisons between government superannuation schemes and private superannuation schemes. I have heard it said that the proposed scheme and the scheme that was proposed by the Labor Party when in government last year are far too generous. There is a great need for anybody who makes an assertion such as that to be careful about the things he compares. It is just not possible to compare things unless they are alike; to compare things which are not alike is to come to a false conclusion. So if one is really going to make comparisons in relation to the superannuation scheme of the Australian pubUc servant, the only way that one can do so is in relation to State government employees and the various schemes that have been implemented for the benefit of State pubUc servants. I think that sort of comparison bears elaboration. Let me take, for the sake of argument, an Australian government employee presently earning $13,000 a year. That employee will contribute 10 per cent of salary as a maximum contribution and onretirementat age 65 will draw a pension of $9,425, which is 72.5 per cent of the $13,000 that he was earning whUe he was working. In comparing that situation with the situation which appUes in the States, let me start with Western Australia. The PubUc Service in that State has a unitary scheme, so it is not possible to determine the contribution rate as a percentage. However, the maximum amount that can be drawn, again using as a basis a salary of $ 13,000, on retirement at age 65 is $7,956 or 58.9 per cent of final salary. In Tasmania, where public servants contribute 5.5 per cent of salary, the return is $8,658 or 66.6 per cent of salary. Even in Victoria a public servant earning $13,000 contributes 9 per cent of his salary as a maximum and will draw 70 per cent of his salary on retirement or $9,100. Now the comparison starts to get pretty interesting because in South Australia-w e all know that that State has got a pretty good government- a public servant who enters the Service when he is less than 30 years of age contributes 6 per cent and receives 73.3 per cent of salary or $9,533 on retirement. Even in Queensland-w e all know about the white man's Idi Amin who is running that State-publi c servants make a 6.5 per cent salary contribution and receive 75 per cent of salary or $9,750 on retirement. So a pubhc servant in Queensland is in a better position than a public servant in Canberra. I suppose the Queensland people would need to receive that sort of benefit to put up with that person up there. The situation in New South Wales is pretty interesting. That State has a unitary scheme also, so again it is impossible to determine the percentage of contributions. But on retirement at age 65 the public servant in New South Wales, again using the example of a salary of $13,000 a year, receives $ 10,968 or 80.4 per cent of the salary that he received while he was working. Thosefiguresare very significant, especially when one takes into account the adjustment which is made after the public servant retires. The consumer price index adjustment on the salary of the Australian government public servant appUes only to the Government's share, yet in every other State it applies to the total amount of pension payable.",86
138,Unknown,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,87
139,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,ALLOWANCE FOR LEASED PLANT,"Before the suspenwhat sion of the sitting for dinner I had just drawn attention of the members to the way in which the Australian employee as a recipient of a superanservant nuation pension is in no better position than other public servant of Australia, as of the States. In fact, in 3 of the 6 States the State recipient is in a much better position than Australian Government employee and in toria the Victorian recipient is only marginally behind the Australian Government recipient. There is another feature of this new scheme, Deputy Speaker, that has a great deal of sigIt nificance and that is what happens to the pension of the ex-public servant astimegoes on. This can be only some sort of a guesstimate of what would happen, but to draw comparisons again between the States and the Australian Government, let us assume for the sake of argument that 10 years have elapsed. We will also assume that there is an inflation rate of 5 per cent per annum in the first instance, 10 per cent per annum in the second instance and 15 per cent per annum in the third instance over those 10 years. Now, after 10 years with an inflation rate of 5 per cent per annum the Australian Government employee who retires at age 65 on a $ 13,000 a year salary, would be receiving then $13,717. If we take the best of the States we would have to go to New South Wales, where his counterpart would be receiving $17,866-som e $4,000 a year more than the Australian Government employee. This is brought about of course by the application of the consumer price index to the total pension and not only to the Government financed section. The very worse State in those circumstances would be Western Australia where instead of receiving the $13,717 that the Australian Government employee would receive the Western Australian would be receiving $12,960. So he is only marginally behind. The ex-public servant from the other States would be in a much better position than is the Australian Government employee. To move to the area where we assume that inflation is at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, the Australian Government employee there receives $20,303 per annum whereas in New South Wales his counterpart receives $28,448. Again, the worse State in this instance is Western Australia where the figure is $20,636. If we assume that inflation is at the rate of 15 per cent per annum then after 10 years the Australian Government ex-employee will have received $30,211. His counterpart in New South Wales would be starting to look at a sum totalling $44,372. It is about a 46 per cent increase over his counterpart in the Australian Govern the ment would receive. Under no circumstances can it be said that the Australian Government public is being featherbedded in this area or is any in any way receiving something better than his an employee counterparts in this area. If you want to start talking about what he rethe ceives compared to most members of the public Vicwho are not involved in superannuation schemes, of course he does better. Then of course he contributes towards it. Each pay period he Mr makes his contribution towards his own pension. is interesting to note, because these comparisons are being drawn a very large section of the Australian community, the working people of the Australian community, are not members of any superannuation fund at all and, as I have 65. already stated, to try to compare the pubhc servant with those people is to make a wrong parison. There is indeed a need, in my opimon, for a national superannuation fund. I know that somebody from the other side is going to up and say: 'Your mob were in office for 3 years and did not do anything about it'. We also reasons why a lot of things we wanted done could not get done, principally due to a hostile Senate where some backward people from the Liberal and National Country Parties set about frustrating all of the progressive legislation the Labor Party introduced. If one cares to think about this national superfund. annuation fund, the more you think about it the better it looks and the more one can see the for it. I think that the debate on this Bill highlight, more than anything else, the need that fund. I have to mention one of many reasons to complain about the present legislation. I the attitude of the unions in this. They know that it is the best they are going to get and they are prepared to take it rather than put up with the scheme as it exists. It seems to me a backward step not to give the people the right or the tunity to retire at age 60 rather then enforcing them to work on until age 65. The honourable member for Ballaarat raised cast the point that the Public Service Act does provide for that contingency. I do not think that is much of a reason or much of an excuse either, because the Pubhc Service Act is only an Act this Parliament and at anytimecan be changed by this Parliament. I should prefer to see the ation arise where people had the opportunity leave their employment at age 60 rather than being forced to carry on to age 65. There are a variety of reasons for that, not the least being, has already been mentioned, that to have a younger PubUc Service to encourage younger people to come in, to encourage people to retire at the other end. I do not dispute that. has also to be understood that in the Ught other debates that have been held in this place quite recendy, it is very clear that as time goes in Australia, and indeed in the industrialised world, there is going to be a need for people work fewer hours a day, fewer days in a week, fewer weeks in a year and certainly fewer years out of their Uves. There will be a trend towards shorter working weeks and earlier retirement. my view that is a very good move and a progress-tonight. ive move. This Government, with the Bill that has brought in, has not moved in that direction aU. It has rather gone the other way and just insists that people keep on working untU they are comThere are of course many good features about the Bill, and I think not the least of these is the fact that it is rather embracing, it sweeps in the stand superannuation scheme people who normally would not have the benefit of belonging to a had superannuation scheme. Only very recently I learnt of a person whom I think everybody would regard as being a pubUc servant of some repute and would regard as being a permanent pubUc servant; but because of an Ulness that was that suffered at an earUer time this person is denied the opportunity of belonging to the superannuation scheme and must belong to the provident There is a difference between the two; the benefits of the superannuation scheme are better. need The amendments bring such people into the will superannuation scheme. Just in passing, I make for some reference to the remarks made by the honourable member for BaUaarat (Mr Short) know who I understand said that prior to coming to this place he was a public servant, I understand he was with the Treasury. His entrance into this House, judging by his remarks in this debate, did not enhance the House at all. After Ustening to opporthe very conservative attitude that he took towards things, I am quite sure that he did the Treasury a service by leaving it to come here. He was most unhappy that the Public Service was in a pacesetter role, as he described it, by the not Whitlam Government. I do not know whether he has ever taken the trouble to study the Public Service. I am not sure what he meant by using of the term 'pacesetter' but he wouldfindthat in the area of working conditions, the Public Sersituvice certainly has been to the front except as to regards pay. I understand that public servants were thefirstpeople in Australia to receive paid annual leave, and this was so for a long time. It is as only in recent years that the community caught there is a need up with them. The honourable member for Ballaarat spoke It about the Labor scheme being wUdly extravaof gant. I do not know what he meant by that because all the costing I had relating to the Labor onParty's superannuation scheme left me with the distinct impression that it would cost the Governto ment no more that the existing scheme. In his mad endeavour to have a sideswipe at the Labor Party, he talked about the Labor Party increasing interest rates on home loans. Clearly, he has In not seen the front page of the Melbourne Herald It has been brought home very forcibly it to me that since 13 December the Labor Party no at longer sits on the Treasury benches but the front page of the Melbourne Herald tonight indicts those who sit there now. During the last election campaign and what led up to it the Government and its supporters put out spurious propaganda to push their own cause and now they stand indicted. Two matter were raised. One is an increase in interest rates by establishments that lend money for home building and the other is a demand to devalue the currency. These are things that are not going to help the ordinary batders in this country one Uttle bit and the Government is responsible. The honourable member for Ballaarat also mentioned minor nit-picking points raised by Opposition members. I thought the purpose of a debate in this House was to point out either real or imagined problems in legislation and for judgment to be passed on that basis. He then went into a great flight of fancy about the portabUity of wives' pensions. I do not know the sort of women that the honourable member associates with and I am not reflecting on anybody who is related to him but from the way he described people to the House one would think that we had a community of 'Bluebeards' in which women went around accumulating husbands who were eligible for a Government pension and then disposed of them. I do not think he meant that but if he cares to read his speech tomorrow he will find, quite clearly, that that is the inference. I agree with the portabUity of the wives' pension. I see absolutely nothing wrong with it. I do not think it is any more than giving a woman her right. Any pension a woman receives upon the demise of her husband in my view is her right. He contributed towards it and it belongs to her. I cannot agree that a change in marital status should disadvantage a woman. Of course it should go with her. If we had a pipeline to heaven and were able to contact her former husband I am sure that he would agree that she should take it with her at alltimes.I know that that would be my wish for my wife. All in all, this Superannuation Bill is the best of a bad job but it is nowhere near as good as the proposition the Labor Party put forward. The Labor Party proposition was not as costly as people who cannot add up would care to make it sound. The Bill before us is the best of all things that are not good. It is the best the Liberal Party can put up. I support the amendment and I am very disappointed that at an earUertimethe previous Parliament could not see its way clear to give to the Australian Government's public servants the justice they deserve. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) adjourned. NA 1976 Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 March on motion by Mr Newman: That the Bill be now read a second time. Upon which Mr Hayden had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'while not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the failure of the Government to index dependants allowances to meet increases in the cost ofliving'.",87
140,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, last night I spent a few minutes dealing with the subject of the 2 BUls that are before the House-on e relating to repatriation and related matters and one relating to social services. They both purport to update the amounts of money paid as benefits under the 2 Acts which they seek to amend. We on this side of the House accept, firstly, that the indexation principle that is applied in these BUls is a useful one, but as usual the Government has faUed to carry out its duty in both areas in accordance with its own expressed policies in the past and the needs of the community at the moment. Last night I followed the honourable member for Sturt (Mr WUson) who, perhaps, is rather typical of honourable members opposite, except that he shows a little more understanding of the subject. But I think I could say that generally speaking, he was long in view and short in understanding. He was a little too sympathetic to the economic situation in which the Government claims to find itself and a little less sympathetic in understanding what is required to be done immediately at this point of time. The criticisms that we have to offer are based on a number of factors. Firstly, there has been a failure on the part of the Government to take up the guarantee that it gave earlier on social services, which was part of its electoral platform. But there are several pieces of pettifoggery associated with it. First of all, let me take the commencement date of the increased social security payments-1 3 May 1976. I recall that when the announcement about this commencement date was made some time ago the Minister was expressing some gratitude that we were able to save some mUlions of dollars by deferring the commencement date. But as is the custom of honourable members opposite they attempt to balance their budgets and to solve their financial problems by depriving the people least able to support the measures. Then there was the other question of funeral benefits. If it were not for the other benefits that are provided in these Bills we would, of course, oppose the Bills simply because of the piece pettifoggery associated with the removal of funeral benefits. Surely honourable members posite recognise the feelings of the people in the community about this matter, particularly those people who have to be the beneficiaries of such government payouts. It is an emotional question in many areas. Although over the last 3 years general citizenry in Australia, particularly section of it which is likely to need this kind benefit, has been better offfinanciallythan it was before, the facts are that this matter is a a great number of people in the community. It a miserable exercise indeed to remove the benefit, and we say so. The other point of criticism is that dependants' allowances themselves are not dealt with in this legislation. In fact dependants' allowances remain at their present level. They are not dexed. Of course, it is all part of the total ment that people receive. Thetimehas come for us to take an overall look at the whole social security system to make absolutely certain, in the first instance, that the payments that we are considering now are adequate for 1976. In Usteninherited ing to the speeches of honourable members oppatriation posite one could only be struck with the GovernAct, ment's obsession with cliches and with repeating them. For instance, the honourable member for Sturt, as do other honourable members opposite, continuously talks about inflation. They put forpeople ward the idea that inflation Party invention. We all know that probably some factors have been induced in the inflaing, tionary system by our actions. It may well be that belong, the steps that we took to make people who produced the goods in the comnow for people tosystem. munity received just reward for their tributed to the inflationary spiral. But it is also true that the import prices, which rose in country, also formed part of the inflationary pressures. It is true that we inherited things from ing the past. It is also true that the people in the com-mvolved. munity who make profits strive as hard as they 15 000 ex-servicemen can to increase their prices and their profits their regardless of whether people will be affected by pendants of deceased ex-servicemen-5 innation or not. The question that I ask honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Sturt who pours out his soul here-h e is devoted to the cause of the nation and all of it-is : Where did he stand on 8 December 1973 when we conducted a referendum on price control? How different would the situation be that referendum had been carried? Perhaps it would not be a great deal different, but certainly we would have had better instruments with of which to control the system. What happened to the referendum in the electorate of Sturt, which opwas the honourable member's responsibility? He opposed it, as did all his colleagues. Of course, the referendum was lost in the electorate of Sturt. The honourable member could have taken a leaf out of the book of the people of WUls who voted thesubstantially in favour of the referendum. that Honourable members opposite would have a of pretty heavy burden to carry if they had a conscience at all in relation to that matter. Continuworry toing attacks are being made on the Labor is Government in the kinds of statements that are made by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). He talks about bad administration. What exactly does he mean? You cannot escape by continually using generalities. So the social security base is being eroded by not tackling such questions as dependants' allowances, by not inupdating the system, by not making sure that paythere are automatic adjustments for price rises. We should be taking steps to remove anomalies. I suggest to the House that we should examine the various social service systems which we have from the past, one of which is the ReAct and the other is the Social Services plus a large number of others, and try to relate them to one another and try and reduce the complexity of the system. We must raise the general standard of benefits available to the of Australia to the highest levels that can is a particular Labor be attained. Whenever this subject comes up, I have a feelperhaps because of the generation to which I that one should say something in defence sure that the of the repatriation There is a tendency work conshould be abolished, that the the say that whole system Department should be phased out and something else done. I believe this that would be a wrong procedure. I should remind the House and the mUlions outside listeneagerly to this speech how many people are From the 1914-18 conflict there are and women, 22 000 of dependants, and 20 000 people who are de7 000 in all. From the 1939-45 conflict there are enormous numbers-17 6 000 ex-servicemen and women, 213 000 dependants, 34 000 dependants of deceased people, a total of 500 000 or so more. From the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and the rest elsewhere there are some 27 000. Over half a mUlion people are involved in if what is a unique social security system. It is Australia's most experienced social security system. I suppose in a way it is Australia's most generalised social security system, including as it does, benefits across the board from students' allowances to support for soldiers' children through housing and all the rest of it. There is a lot to be learned in the social security area from the simple appUcation of many of the principles we have evolved over the years in repatriation. I have never been able to work out why we have not got round to applying the principles of the patriation system to third party insurance, for instance, as we were attempting to do under the national compensation scheme. One has only to compare the intricacy, the complexity and the absolute cost in the third party area with the Repatriation Tribunal's procedures to see how much we could benefit by simply applying the lessons we have learned there. I remind the House tonight that on an occasion such as this there ought to be steps taken now raise the general level of payments. A person the totaUy and permanently incapacitated rate of pension would be getting something like $147 week, taking into account his wife's allowance. Now, that sounds a lot for a pension system. But what is the situation in the rest of the munity? I think average weekly earnings have now reached about $160 a week. Consider the situation of a young person conscripted tofightin Vietnam and, as a result, totally incapacitated, never able to work. His life will be circumscribed absolutely by the income he receives from the patriation system. Relatively, he has been conscripted into a lifetime of poverty. Although some of the tilings that have been said about the repatriation system and the general levels of benefits-that they are some of the best in the world-ma y well be true, but that is to it. The benefits that have come to a person in the repatriation system flow as a compensation. They are some attempt by the community to repay for loss, suffering, incapacity and incononly venience. A lot of these inconveniences, of course, are not observable. People who have been wounded in action, or knocked about in cidents during the war or something of that mind nature-mad e slightly less efficient physically over a Ufetime-canno t be recompensed adgood equately. They can be given only support. For most of the people involved in it, of course, adequate support in time of Ulness is an important question. We have always been pretty meagre about that. We, during the course of operations as a government, were attempting expand the repatriation system and to bring the community into its benefits, particularly in the hospital area. It has always amazed me that there is so much criticism of the idea of a national salaried medical service, when so many people, some half million or thereabouts, use a salaried medical service in the form of the Repatriation Department. They use nationalised medical services in the hospitals. They go into nationalised public hospitals. They find that they are as good as rehospitals are anywhere. I have been a customer of the Repatriation Hospital at Heidelberg in Victoria on a number of occasions. I suggest that it is as efficient and as effective as any other hospital in the system. It is a pretty good example of what a national health service ought to be. Tonight I am suggesting that the House give serious thought to taking the lessons out of the repatriation system, taking some of the standards we have adopted in the repatriation system and apto plying them as rapidly as possible to the rest of on the community through the social security system. It is Australia's most experienced social sea curity service. It is the one that is, generally speaking, the most ubiquitous, and to those who happen to get under the benefit umbrella of the comsystem, probably the most accessible. Therefore tonight we on this side of the House are reproving the Government for its failure to update such things as dependants' allowances. We are voting against the removal of funeral rebenefits, and we object to the deferment of the beginning of the social security payments because, as I said earlier, and as my colleagues on this side of the House have reiterated, it is one of the characteristics of this Government that the people who are the least able to pay are the ones is not all there it will make pay.",89
141,Mr WENTWORTH,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Acting Speaker, I am supporting this Bill, but I must say that when I first saw it there was a certain amount of disappointment. That disappointment was tempered when I realised that this is an interim BiH and that the Government's real policy would, for the benefit of pensioners, come in in the Budget session. I want to go acthrough some of the the things which were in my in this regard. First, this Bill does adjust the pension to the consumer price index, and that is a thing; and it is in accordance with the some sort of Government's pledge. I have hoped that for the future, and I feel a little doubtful that this will be done, that the tie our with the consumer price index will be made an to automatic tie. This is something which, when I was a Minister, I endeavoured to have brought in and I am only sorry that it has not been brought in earher. This does not, of course, mean that the pensions should not in the future rise more than the consumer price index. As the community becomes more prosperous and its standards of Uvingrise,as I think they will, and as under this Government they wiU rise, I believe that pensioners should at Budget time share also in that rise in standards. When the whole situation of the community uplifts I believe that the position of the pensioners in real terms should uphft with it also. But below this, as a floor, there should the holding of the pension at its purchasing power so that pensioners are not disadvantaged byrisesin prices, and for that the six-monthly adjustment to the consumer price index is the right thing; and I believe it should be the automatic thing. As I have said, if the prosperity of the country has improved from Budget to Budget, as indeed I am sure it will under this Government, in addition to the CPI adjustment pensioners should share in that increased prosperity. I want to deal with a question which has exercised my mind and the minds of other members of this House-the question of funeral benefits which are covered by Part IVA of the principal Act. This bUl repeals that Part which has always been an unsatisfactory section. It is far too complicated. It is hedged about with unreasonable means test provisions and I do not think it has reaUy operated as it should have done to the benefit of pensioners' famUies because of its tionship to what I would call the funeral industry.pathy It is an unsatisfactory Part and its repeal is unreasonable. But it should be replaced with theu* something better. I believe that the Government is going to replace it with something better. What is now proposed is simply clearing way for a new move to be made to substitute something better for the old funeral benefits. should like to make a suggestion as to what that something better should be. I base this on vision which I brought into this House when was Minister; namely, provision for the payment of pensions at married rate for 12 weeks after decease of one partner in a married couple. This is provided for by section 135U of the existing Act. This is, I think, a good provision. It has worked well. It has been a humane provision and I think that it is the provision we should imitate when we look for something better to put place of the old funeral benefits. I believe that what we should provide is that for a period of some weeks after a pensioner's death, the penwith sion should continue to be paid to his estate so that it would be avaUable for his funeral or the benefit of his relatives. This can be done fairly easUy. Such a provision has great advantages. It gets rid of all the obnoxious complications of the old funeral benefit. It gets rid of some of the unreasonable means test restrictions which appUed to the old funeral benefit and it will enable a reasonable payment to be made. With the pension of the order of $40 a week, as it is now, even 2 weeks would be worth $80 which would be better by far than the existing funeral benefit. It would be taxable as part of the estate be of the deceased person, but that is not unreasonable nor is it unjust because taxation of pension is the only proper form of means test. This taxation, which should fall on pensioners and non-pensioners aUke-o n all members of the community-is a reasonable way of applying a means test. It seems to me that for those over the age of 65 years anything else is unreasonable. Therefore I suggest that for a fortnight or perhaps 4 weeks after the death of a pensioner the pension should continue to be paid to his estate and this would be a much more humane and much better way of dealing with the situation than the old funeral benefit. I hope that the action the Government has taken to getridof the old funeral benefit from the Act is only in order to clear the way for putting something better in its place. I speak next of something which was raised by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) relain his speech. He spoke with feeling and symfor those people who are left destitute, not need an emergency payment and cannot wait for pension papers to befilledin and all the formalities to be gone through. I know that these people do require special support, but I do not find myself in agreement with the method of supthe port which the honourable member for Hotham proposed. If people want and need emergency I payments because they are destitute, then it is not possible for the bureaucratic check to be a promade. The government machinery must be one I which provides for bureaucratic checks; otherwise there will be fraud and dissipation of the the revenue. With government, the bureaucratic check is necessary, and I think every sensible person will realise that it is necessary. How then do we meet these emergency cases which have their own necessity which also must be met? I do not think there is any way to do this, except by some in machinery more decentralised than the Commonwealth machinery. Some people say: 'Let it be done through the States'. Certainly the States, theu; access to their welfare organisations, poUce forces and so on, are in a better position to for take a spot judgment than is the Commonwealth. But I do not believe that even the States can do this effectively. It seems to me that the only ones who can do this effectively are the charitable organisations. This should be one of the reasons for which they exist. It will be said, and said veryrightly:'Why should the burden fall on the charitable organisations?' I do not think it should. I believe that we should make the charitable organisation the responsible agent for the distribution of these emergency funds. This can be done fairly simply and with proper accounting precautions. It can be done in this way: We will say to the charity organisation: 'You make the advance and then, when the payment comes through-as it will, after the bureaucratic necessities have been satisfied-w e will arrange to recoup it to you so that you will not be out of pocket'. The charitable organisation might well say: 'Yes, but there will be some loss because every now and again we will make an emergency payment which will not be recouped to us'. This is also true. Would it not be possible and easy to arrange for such charitable organisations to receive a commission-shal l I say 10 per cent of the amount of money that they turn over in this way-so that they would not be out of pocket but at the same time there would be some kind of check upon them and they would not be irresponsible? Let me put it to the House that the charitable organisation which goes down to the grass roots is in a far better position to estimate the genuinedriven ness of a claim in respect of an emergency need than any Commonwealth service can be. I know that there would have to be checks as to duplication and things of this character, but I do not believe that these are matters of any insuperable difficulty. I have put this to charitable organisations in the past, and I put it to them again: They should not be called upon to carry the burden of this; but they should be asked to do effectively the adnunistration, because they can do it much better than any Commonwealth or State instrumentahty can. If they will not do it then let the States do it. But above all, let us try to avoid dupUcation, a situation where we have the charitable organisations in at one point, the State vices in at another pomt and the Commonwealth services in at another. That is triplication, not dupUcation, but triplication is even worse than dupUcation. I would hope that under the Government's plan of decentralisation, under the Government's plan for trying to get responsibUity away from decisions of the PubUc Service and into private hands, we would find this as a proper avenue through which the charitable organisations could exert their energies. After all, this is the reason for the existence of these organisations, and this is as it should be. This was their function in the past when we were in government. We should now be trying to use the charitable organisations to the greatest possible extent and co-operate with them in order to enlarge the ambit of their activities. WhUe I am dealing with that, let me say that I am disappointed that under the Labor Government the aged persons homes scheme was virtually strangled. I know the Labor Government proposed an increase of the two-to-one subsidy-it was to be increased to four-to-one, or what have you-bu t administratively it put on hmits so that nobody could take advantage of the new bounty. 'Hang your clothes on the mulberry bush but don't go near the water' was the way the Labor Government administered, maladministered, and virtually strangled the aged persons homes scheme. The figures will show that. Under Labor the number of approvals dropped right off because of the way in which the scheme was administered and because of the strangling effect of the upper Umit of costs at a time when buUding costs were escalating at an alarming rate. I hope that as part of our scheme for decentralising and making use of the very real charitable feelings which exist in the community we can once again revive this aged persons homes scheme and drive it forward as it should be forward, because it is the pensioner who does not have proper accommodation at a reasonable rate who is the pensioner in difficulty. If one looks at Professor Henderson's poverty Une and if one takes out the rent component, as is the fair thing to do if one looks at the way in which the poverty line was first calculated, we will see that the pensioners who really want and need help are those who do not have accommodation at a reasonable rate. It is for that reason that the aged persons homes scheme should, I believe, be driven forward once again. We had great momentum under a Liberal government. I am proud that, as Minister, every year I was getting a record number of units buUt. Under Labor ser- the output fell right away. That is a matter of statistics. Next let me say that I am disappointed that so far the Government has not plugged what I think is the main weakness in the whole social service scheme, that is, the faUure to do anything for the widower with dependent chUdren. I am hoping that in the next Budget this is one thing that will get the Government's support. I shall be plugging for that as hard as I can. Finally let me say that I am hoping that it will not be long before we make another move towards carrying out the Government's announced plan of getting rid of the means test for everybody over the age of 65 years. There is some confusion about this which I hope I will have an opportunity to speak about at greater length at some time. My time is ranning out now and I shall not be able to do more than say that I myself will continue to drive for the aboUtion of the means test for all over 65 years age at the earUest possible moment. When we went out of office at the end of we said we would abolish the means test within 3 years, and we would have been able to do it within 3 years if it had not been for the financial morass into which we have been plunged by the maladministration of the Labor Government. Even allowing for that it does seem to me that this should not be too long delayed and I myself, as I have said, wiU be doing everyMackellar, thing to make it clear to the Government that will not be able to continue to support it on this social services issue unless something effective done about the means test and done fairly soon in accordance with the pledge which the Governpeople ment has given. I say with some confidence that believe the Government will carry these things out in accordance with the undertaking was given to the electorate.",91
142,Mr COHEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," I want to be very brief and to speak for only two or three minthat utes. I cannot let the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) get away with some of the things he said, particularly with regard aged persons' accommodation. I was quite inobservations volved with this in my own area; I got very volved with the problem that the Government was facing. I do not have the exactfiguresin front of me at the moment, but over the past years spending on aged persons' accommorepatriation dation rose from about $ 18m or $20m in the last couple of years of the previous Liberal ment to about $22m or $23m in the first year of the Labor Government. It would have been a Uttle extra except for the Brisbane floods. In second year of the Labor Government it rose $40m and in the third year it rose to $70m. I was discussing the matter with the Minister for Social Security, because of the increase of the subsidy from $2 to $ 1 to $4 for $ 1 and the lack restrictions in meeting any rise in buUding costs the value of applications in the pipeUne had risen to $270m. Let us be honest. I do not think the honourable member for Mackellar, the former Minister, aware of this: There is no way in the world in which this Government or any other government is gomg to have arisein this area from $20m to $270m in the space of three or four years. I have not worked it out, but it would be a rise of about 900 per cent. It would be absurd to suggest that. Obviously the Government had to put priorities and select its projects. I was very fortunate in my area because we were able to get $1,023,000 for about 90 beds for various hostel, nursing home and aged persons accommodation of and that was more in one year than had ever been spent in the previous 8 years by this government. There are more aged people on the Central 1972 Coast than in any other part of Australia. FinaUy, let me say to the Minister for Repatriimmense ation (Mr Newman) and to the honourable member for MackeUar that we have been hearing from the Liberal Government for 27 years about how it was going to abolish the means test. In fairness, the honourable member for as the appropriate Minister, did taper I the means test. That is a step in the direction of aboUtion. But the only Government that has ever is done anything in this regard has been the Labor Government, which abolished the means test for over 70 years of age and was proposing to I bring the age down to 69.1 thank the House and I thank the Minister. I just wanted to make those which couple of points.",94
143,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"in reply-This being the first Bill I have the pleasure and the responsibility for introducing into this House, I can say that by and large I have enjoyed listening to the debate. to Speakers on both sides of the Houses have made and suggestions on social welfare inmatters which I have noted, and I will make sure that the Minister for Social Security (Senator GuUfoyle) in the other place is made aware of 5 them. Those members who directed remarks to matters have my assurance that I will keep these matters in mind when framing reGovernpatriation measures in the future. I said that I have enjoyed the debate by and the large, but at the same time. I am concerned to to note the level of debate which some members of When the Opposition intruded into this House. We would aU agree, I think, in this chamber that the success of our deliberation in part depend on a of viable and concerned Opposition with the abUity to produce some decent, constructive criticism. My enjoyment of the discussion last night and tonight has been quaUfied by a certain sadness for what I can only caU the poverty of debate which has been disclosed by the Opposition in this secis ond reading. Many of their remarks have been bereft of constructive criticism. Their speeches have been peppered with unsubstantiated criti$ 18m or cism and misrepresentations.",94
144,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Whic h ones? Come on, then; name them.",95
145,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"I will come to that. In fact I ment made would go as far as to say that in the second readFraser). ing debate it has been left largely to Government for supporters to provide constructive criticism, tation ideas and recommendations which we can conis the reducdon sider and perhaps act on.",95
146,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,Surely you do not have to give a summing up at the second reading stage.,95
147,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for along with Oxley (Mr Hayden) is one of the very members isation who illustrates my point pretty vividly. Last night in inflation. We must he subjected us to a diatribe which was emotioncircumstances that we keep ally couched and which was completely lacking in any decent objectivity. I have heard him speak vide in this place before and as a previous Treasurer need. and Minister responsible for Social Security his remarks did not really become him. He accused I us of dismantling and distorting the social welcerned fare program, of breaking promises and of ing coldly and harshly with pensioners. How in Heaven's name he can believe these contentions I do not know. He certainly did not prove them in that 30 minutes of talking last night. This Bill, or both Bills, represent the Governclaim has ever ment's first step in achieving its social security and repatriation pohcy objectives. It is true the children's allowances have not been included 1968. in the benefits but as the honourable member Oxley well knows, because we couldrightlysay that he is responsible for most of the problems we now face, priorities have to be set somewhere. I presume that when the member for Oxley was the Minister in charge of social the same problems in 1973 and 1974 when he did not include increases in children's allowbenefit ances in his autumn increases.",95
148,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,That is not true.,95
149,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"It is true. In fact if you look at the table which the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) tabled last night will see quite clearly that the proof is ding of his table. The Government will consider children's allowances along with other benefits benefit when it considers its next 6-monthly adjustwill continue. ments. And I remind the honourable member The again of the point that I made in thefirstspeech merly that I made on the subject that the Income Securwidower ity Review Committee will report on all aspects of social security benefits. The honourable member for Oxley made pretty wild assertions in regard the means test. He said that he felt that knell had been sounded on any further progress towards the abolition of the means test. This simply is not true, and I will repeat again a comby the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm The Government is committed to the abolition of the means test for all age pensions persons over the age of 65. I have no hesiin qualifying that because ourfirstpriority of inflauon, and it is not possible to indicate when the means test will be abolished. We consider it preferable to state the position honestly rather than to make promises which cannot be kept. Pensioners will benefit, all other Australians, from the stabilof prices which is implied by a reduction face. in mind the present It is possible to promore substantial assistance for those in I turn to other matters which I wish to take up. refer first of all to those remarks which are conwith social security matters. The honourdealable member for Prospect has misrepresented remarks made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) in the other place. Opposition members last night tried to tell us that she was claiming that the double pension benefit was introduced by this Government. Now, no such been made. that Dr KLUGMAN - Sh e said 'recently'. It was in for Mr NEWMAN-If the honourable member for Prospect will bear with me for a moment I will repeat what was said in thefirstspeech on this matter. I repeat it for him because obviously he did not listen very hard. The second reading security he faced speech says: The Government has decided that although the funeral is to be abolished",95
150,Mr BRYANT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"He may have listened very hard. He is hard at Ustening. like to Mr NEWMAN-The honourable member for WUls has made some very good contributions to you debates. So I ask him not to get me too angry in the pudearly in the piece. Let me continue: The Government has decided that although the funeral is to be abolished, the (double pension) provisions provisions enable the sum of the two pensions forpayable to a married couple to be paid to the widow or for 12 weeks following the death of the pensioner spouse. This benefit was introduced in 1968. The Minister has made no other claim.",95
151,Dr KLUGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"That is not what the Press stateto the abolition of ment said. the death Mr NEWMAN-Honourable members opposite were asking before about my accusations on misrepresentation, and there is a clear example.",95
152,Dr KLUGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,I was referring to the Press statement,96
153,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"I have the Press statement here. You might like to consult it later on. You will see that I am right in that respect. The honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whidam) tried to argue that the children's pensioner benefit is an integral part of pensions and that it is an important principle that it should always be increased with other pensions. The honourable member impUes here that the principle was, throughout the term of office of the Opposition when it was in government, held to by that Government. As I have already said there were occasions in 1973 and 1974 when the Labor Government did not see itself clear to increase these pensions. I repeat that the Government has Umited resources only, and on this occasion it has not been able to grant the increase in respect of pensions to dependants. The honourable member for Grayndler who, I might say, was one of the few members of the Opposition who did make a constructive contribution to the debate, also said that he was not aware that there was a committee deaUng with income security review. He averred that he had never seen the statement in respect of such a committee being appointed. Again, he was in error. I refer him to the Senate Hansard report of 4 March 1976. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Guilfoyle, in replying to a question without notice from Senator Coleman said: I wish to complete an answer, which I gave to Senator Coleman during questiontimeearlier today, with regard to the membership of the Income Security Review Committee. The group, which has been working for some timeI interpolate, not in secret: . . . consists of representatives of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Social Security, the Department of the Treasury, the Taxation Office, the Department of Repatriation and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relauons. Previously the Social Welfare Commission was also represented; but, in view of the abolition of the will not have continuity of representation in that Committee. Now, on those matters raised by honourable members concerning repatriation let me say first of all that I have noted the comments by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bonnett). I can assure him that the whole question of the level of those special rate pensions and general rate pensions will be considered, but in relation to the Toose Report. The honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) raised the quesuon of Press reports deaUng with bullying in tribunals. I think this is one matter that we must deal with here. I am sure that the honourable member realises that these are independent statutory bodies that were conceived by request of the ex-service organisations. I would add also that they are quite independent of the Mmister. They consist of a chairman, who is an ex-serviceman, and 2 doctors who are well acquainted with the problems that the appellant in whatever case they are considering may have. I am quite happy with what I have seen so far of how these tribunals are working. I am aware of the Press reports that have been made on the matter and am looking into it. The honourable member quoted Mr Jusuce Toose and I would like to quote him again. Mr Jusuce Toose said in his report that the substantial body of evidence that he had received said that the tribunals acquitted their responsibUities well and expressed complete satisfaction with their work. I agree with the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) that there is a need to simplify the Act, particularly expressions in the Act or the Acts that govern the repatriation system, and I can assure him that the Government is gomg to look very closely at this matter. He also raised the problem of the Heidelberg Hospital. There are wards and beds that sometimes are not occupied in that hospital and I agree that this is a bad thing. It is not entirely the fault of the Government. There have been problems over salaries for both nurses and doctors. Honourable members would know, I hope, that the problems of the nurses were solved in a decision they received at the end of January. The doctors' case is before the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and has been deferred. Following the favourable decision for wage salaries for the nurses, aU sisters, senior tutors and matrons now have a fair deal in all States except, perhaps, Victoria and Western Australia where they only just miss out on having complete equity. I tliink the problem with nurses has been solved and we are trying to recruit again to make up the deficiencies in staff. It will follow, I hope, that we will start to fill the beds. Commission in the near future, it .Dr Jenkins-What about the community involvement?",96
154,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,Repatriation hospitals do admit a range of community patients. This is important for a lot of reasons. Dr Jenkins-For diagnostic purposes?,96
155,Mr NEWMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Right. It does happen. I think in Concord- I do not remember the figures for Heidelberg-it is up to about 12 per cent. We will continue that pohcy. I turn now to the remarks of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). I thank the honourable member for his comments about the repatriation system. I know that he is an old soldier of, I think, almost 30 years experience. If my record is correct he was also Mmister for Repatriation for almost a month. In addition I suspect that there is a deep seated ambition in the mind of the honourable member for Wills to be a TPI pensioner one day after he retires from this place. There are some points he made that I should mention. I appreciate his defence of the repatriation tem and I do not say that with any sense of propriety or self indulgence. I hope that we will be able to continue the repatriation system. There are a couple of things I think I had better clear up. The honourable member tried to liken the social security pensions to the war disability pensions that the repatriation system grants. There is a distinction. The war disabUity pensions are paid for compensation and therefore should not be equated or likened to those social security pensions. I think the honourable member was drawing a very long bow in trying to equate the hospital system with a nationaUsed health system. I am sure the honourable member for WUls knows that the repatriation system employs a wide range of local medical omcers-abou t 6500 I think-plu s a great number of consulting speciaUsts who visit the hospitals. It is a very far thing from a completely nationaUsed medical health system as the honourable member would like us to believe. The final matter I wish to mention was by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) and the honourable member for $5. Prospect, and it is transport for repatriation patients. Let me assure honourable members that there has been no change in the policy of Government or the previous Government for the provision of transport to take veterans to places where they need medical treatment. This costs the Government-it costs Australia-$2 m a year and there is no doubt that there is evidence of misuse of this transport system. Therefore, we a sad passhave asked our local medical omcers to exercise a Utde bit of discretion in the way these cars are used. I agree with the sentiments expressed the honourable member for Prospect last night. He has no objection-no r do I or the Governreason ment-to trying to save money if it is done reasonably. This is what we are case. The guideline that we have asked local medical officers to follow is that if a veteran is a private patient who had such a medical conobserve dition that the medical officer would prescribe taxi or an ambulance to transport him, the meditactic. cal officer should order a car for that veteran. I would also Uke to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Prospect about the cost of TPIs, for example, using transport rather than cars. Once again, I would assure the honourable member that there is no change here. If a veteran on the special rate has to use a bus or his own car, he can claim for the expenses or the fares-and that will continue. Mr Deputy Speaker, these 2 BUls represent the first step of the Government in achieving its social welfare and repatriation policy objectives. They sysimplement the Government's promises to increase pensions every 6 months in accordance with the consumer price index.",96
156,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",97
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Lucock)Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,97
158,Mr HAYDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, by the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Newman) who has resumed his seat. He asserted very early in his speech that the Labor Government had not increased the aUowance for dependent children of pensioners in 1973 or 1974, and drew our attention to a table inserted in the parliamentary record last night by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). If the Minster cares to re-read the table this time in a normal fashion, instead of standing on his head, he will see on the bottom Une that allowances for chUdren of all beneficiraised aries stood at $4.50 in October 1972. In September-October 1973, we increased them to We increased them to $5.50 in July-August 1974, to $7 in May 1975 and to $7.50 in November 1975. The table shows that in that this period the increase in those payments was 66.7 per cent. The increase in the consumer price index over the same period was only 44.7 per cent. That is, the rate of increase in these allowances was twice as great as the rate of increase in the cost of Uving. I think that things have come to",97
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,Order! I think that by the honourable member for Oxley has now claimed where the misrepresentation was. The why he was allowed to go into the detail of the explanation is that he was the Minister at doing in this the particular time.,97

161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! Mr Newman- Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is incumbent on me to reply. I apologise if I gave the impression that I said that there were no increases in 1973 and 1974. If l missed the word, I meant to say 'autumn' increases in 1973 and 1974.",97
162,Mr WENTWORTH,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,I wish to make a personal explanation.,98
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,98
164,Mr WENTWORTH,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen). He said that I had misquoted figures. I have now got the official figures and I shall quote them to show that I was right and he was wrong. The omcial figures are these: For aged persons homes, the beds approved were as follows: In 1969-70, 3305; the next year, 4136; and the next year 4760. It was increasing at the rate of about 700 a year while I was the Minister. For the next 3 years under Labor, thefiguresare: 3989- a drop of 800; 3417-a drop of 500; and 3910-a litde recovery, but only a httle one. You would say that in those 3 years",98

166,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"The Opposition will oppose this clause. The enshrinement Mackenzie, A. J. MCLean, R. M. of clause 7 in this legislation is a disgrace to the motives of the Government. This clause will deny pensioners funeral benefits. A miserably MCVeigh, D.T. Macphee, I. M. small amount of money is involved-les s than $300,000 for the rest of thisfinancialyear. It is incredible that in a Budget where more than $23,000m is to be spent the Government should decide on the one hand that it is prepared to add O'Keefe, F.L. Peacock, AS. to expenditure a sum of $30m for the superphosphate bounty- a subsidy arrangement which will benefit, among other people, that strapping landholder the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-and on the other hand, as part of the sacrifice to be imposed on those members of the community who too often have to make sacrifices, pensioners will be denied the funeral benefit of $40 which is a small enough sum to provide some nnanciai relief at a time of extreme personal distress. The proposal could have been acceptable if an alternative had been put forward-perhap s a right to spend the amount of money provided on some sort of option chosen by the pensioner at the time of bereavement. Perhaps it could be used to acquit debts or to help meet the costs of transferring property from the deceased spouse. But no such alternative is put forward. This is just a crude snatch from people who are depressed, who are suffering the grief and the pain of bereavement. Aged people in the communitypeople who, by and large, are of very Umited means-wU l suffer. I felt personaUy distressed tonight to hear the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) stand in this House as an apologist for this rotten filch from the pensioners of the Australian community. How could he stand here and aniculate a case excusing this mean acdon of the Government. He is a man who for so long in Opposition indulged in the luxury of masquerading as the pensioners' friend. On the first occasion on which his credentials are put to the test in government he backs away; he starts to explain and equivocate. He defends this rotten action of the Government in denying some of the most needy people in the community. There are many honourable members in the Government ranks who came in on that quite significant swing in the last election. Many of them will be going out at the next election, no matter what they do. Some of them may be able to hang on, through some sort of marginal benefit. I can assure the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock), who at the present time is giggling Uke a senior member of the Sistine Chapel Choir and who no doubt has the same physical attributes as a member of that choir, and his colleague who is sitting on his left that they, among others in the Government ranks, will be mentioned to pensioners in their electorates. We will be sending letters to all pensioners in Government-held electorates, pointing out the stand that was taken by Government supporters in the course of the debate on this legislation. Mr Ruddock- Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. I feel that I have been intimidated in that I was singled out and it was suggested that letters would be sent to people in my electorate on this matter.",98
167,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Mr GILES) Order! There is no substance in the point of order. As I understand the honourable member, he said that he would send letters out, but he did not specify individual electorates. Therefore, there is no substance in the point of order.",99
168,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"At least the honourable member for Parramatta can claim the redemption of being ashamed of his action tonight in voting in support of what is clearly a rotten, unprincipled deprivation of pensioners in the Australian community. Mr Donald Cameron-And you are laughing about it.",99
169,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Griffith has now interjected. He too defends this action; he too stands firmly behind the action of the multi-milhonaire Prime Minister of this country who, to meet the $30m cost of the superphosphate bounty, is prepared to filch from pensioners Uke a cheap thief. I can assure the honourable member for Griffith that pensioners in his electorate wiU be well informed on his action in this Parliament. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Parramatta suggest that it would be intimidation for anyone to suggest outside this House exactly what was the stand of honourable members in the Government ranks on this issue. I can understand their uneasiness, but I really think we ought to indicate to their electors what brave men of principle they are. We will be circulating letters to people in individual electorates such as Parramatta. If the honourable member for Parramatta feels mtimidated, I will specify his electorate. We will be referring to the way in which he vigorously interjected, no doubt demeaning the position of pensioners, and giggled during a serious discussion about the deprivation that pensioners wiU endure at a time of great sadness. How many members of the Government Parties will come across the floor of the House and vote with us in defence of pensioners? The honourable member for Mackellar is the man who said that he would have the means test abolished in 3 years, or he would not be the Minister for Social Services. He was the Minister for Social Services 4 years later and not one step had been taken towards the abolition of the means test. He is the man who did so little, relatively, in the time he was Minister for Social Services, for pensioners and other people in the community. He is the man who, when we were in Government, frequently took the opportunity to declare that he had a bounden commitment to the people in need. For instance, he declared that it was his purpose to see, as a matter of social, moral or economic jusuce, that a supporting fathers allowance was introduced. But on all occasions he neglected to mention that before he became Minister for Social Services he committed himself to this; that, in the period during which he was Minister for Social Services, in a statement by one of his Prime Ministers a commitment was made to introduce this benefit; and that, in spite of that undertaking by his Prime Minister, in spite of that support, the benefit was never introduced.",99
170,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order ! The honourable member might have a look at clause 7 and see whether he is talking about the funeral benefit.,100
171,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"I think this is what one could call a case of filling the issue out so that people Chairman, can understand it better. The honourable memquite ber for Parramatta again is interjecting. All the nastiness, all the viciousness and all the sition to pensioners is now showing through. We really know where the honourable member for was Parramatta stands when it comes to the matter pensioners.",100
172,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS, If to date. the honourable member does not return to the object of clause 7 I will have to ask him to resume his seat.,100
173,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"With the greatest of respect, is the pensioners who are going to be denied the funeral benefit and I would question how genupensioners inely concerned you are about this in view of the fact that you are trying to silence me on this issue.",100
174,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The of honourable member will withdraw any reflection on the Chair.,100
175,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"Of course. I quite see the point. Mr Chairman, I beheve I have made the point, and I beheve the honourable member for Parramatta, among others, can look forward members of his electorate at last being fully informedA Government supporter-You must have had too much to drink. Get on with your solicitation.",100
176,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order! I do not member appreciate hearing comments from the Governposes. ment side along the lines that I just heard. I not sure who said it. I disapprove completely, and if the honourable member who made that interjection makes it again he will be in a lot trouble.",100
177,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, the frivolity, the lack of seriousness in the midst of the Government ranks on an important issue like this is incomprehensible. It is quite clear that honourable members opposite are indifferent to the fact that if clause 7 is enacted it will mean that pensioners will be deprived of a long standing benefit-the funeral benefit. I cannot understand why there is not one serious face-no t one long face-amon g the ranks of the Government benches on such an important issue. I suggest that the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron), who is trying to interject, at last can display a little of the courage which he likes to suggest might be somewhere within the distant perimeters of the areas in which he moves in his electorate by tonight voting against this clause. Other Government supporters could follow suit.",100
178,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS," Mr my consideration of this clause has, frankly, given me more anxiety than any consideration of any clause that I have ever had oppoto deliberate upon since 14 May 1966 when I first elected to a Parliament. I must say, Sir, that the decision that I have had to make in of respect of this clause would, at this moment, be the most difficult decision of my poltiical career I have now resolved the matter, but only in the last few hours. I speak with some sorrow and some unabated anger on this occasion: Sorrow at the decision, but determined to accept it, and unabated anger at the cant and hypocrisy it that we have seen from honourable members opposite who, once again, turn the welfare of the of Australia, which I regard as a most serious matter, into yet another debate which has been prostituted by their treating the pensioners this country as a political football. Sir, I do not appreciate the sort of speech which we have just heard from the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) on clause 7.1I have had sleepless nights over clause 7 and his remarks do not help me, the Parliament or the to pensioners. The honourable member can laugh as much as he likes, but I will teU him something here and now: If he wants to play conscience and poUtics with me on a question like pensioners, he has picked the wrong one. I do not believe it is a fair go for the pensioners to see the honourable once again usmg them for political purSir, I have had-believ e it or not on the am other side of this chamber- a commitment to the pensioners for many years. Unfortunately eight of those years were spent in a State parliament of when there was not much opportunity to do the sort of things that I wanted to see done. But let me indicate here and now that I shall endeavour to prove that the Opposition is not genuine in its attitude to clause 7. It has picked out clause 7 for cheap political capital. I am going to refer to things said in the second reading debate, not to re-open the debate, because I know I would be out of order, but to prove the hypocrisy that has come from the other side of the chamber and from the honourable member for Oxley in particular. I do not beheve there is a single pensioner in Denison or Franklin- I include Franklin because of the attitude of the honourable member for Franklinwho does not recognise that pensioners are going to receive a better deal under this Government than they have ever received in the history of this country. I take the strongest exception to the hypocritical and arrogant pronouncement by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) when he said this",100
179,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The member honourable member may not reflect against individual member of the Opposition. I advise him to watch that point,101
180,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"I accept that, Sir. What I electiontimesand am now saying appUes to all of them. If they adopt the tactic of saying that the Liberals stand for reducing the hving standard and the selfrespect which were denved from the Uving standards that pensioners had avaUable in the past, if they say that we are trying to drag the pensioners down, what a disgraceful and rotten thing to say. Mr Innes-Of course you are.",101
181,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"That honourable member over there, Sir, whom I am not aUowed to name, is taking it up. He is saying from his position the Liberal Party stands to drag down the pensioners. Mr Innes-Of course you are.",101
182,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"That is a lie, and you know it. You can give it and I will take it, and I am going to give you a Uttle of it back to your corner. The other comment in yesterday's debate that take up is this statement: I challenge the members of the Government to explain why they are prepared to tolerate so much deprivation many people depending on social security benefits long. Was it really a matter of reverting to social economic determinism that belongs at least to a century or more past? Let me tell honourable members opposite that we are not a century behind. You are, and the pensioners lobby in this country is now to be found on this side of the House among the spirBy ited and concerned back benchers of the Government and we are the people who are going to get a fair deal for the pensioners; not you. You had your chance for 3 years and you muffed it and you come into this place tonight and make cheap poltiical capital out of funerals. Are there no depths below which you are not prepared to sink? Funerals! Funerals! You are trying to stir up the emotions and I am stirring yours back. You are trying to stir up emotions in relation to funerals and the grave. I have brought you in and you can come in as hard as you like and you are going to get it right back. Quite frankly, Sir, I have waited for this debate. I have itched by the minute to get an opportunity to just throw a little bit back at them. Last Monday, unlike the soap box orators on the other side, my colleague from Franklin and I went and spoke to the pensioners. We go to their meetings. Did you not know that? You got stuck into the honourable member for Parramatta. He has the closest contact with pensioners of any in Sydney and you do not even know it. any Why do you not go and talk to them? Why do not you try and understand them? Why do you not show a genuine interest? You treat them as electoral cannon fodder. You put them up at when you can pick a little hole in a Bill, something which none of"" us likesMr Innes-Tell us about Gorton's 50c.",101
183,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"Oh, I am not interested in you. When you can find a httle hole in a Bill, you belt it away. You try to make it so big and so enormous; but you are not going to con the pensioners this time. We are giving the pensioners automatic indexation. We are going to tackle innation, not like the honourable member for that Oxley. Under your inflationary poUcies the pensioners of Australia were robbed. You do not think they know it but they do, because week by week that went by their pensions bought less and less.",101
184,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Order! Will the honourable member resume his seat for a moI ment. I am sorry to interrupt the flow of the honourable member's speech but I point out that it is proper that he should address the Chair. He for so should not direct his remarks directly across the for so chamber, no matter how much the provocation. I advise the House to come a Uttle bit to order. All in the honourable members have the option to talk on this clause as far as I know.",101
185,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"I am sorry, but the honourable member for Oxley distracted me a little bit. Heaven, Sir, I can say here and now that there are many people who would welcome the opportunity to stand where I stand tonight and say through you, Mr Chairman, the things I am saythe ing to him. Having said that, let me now get to the gist of the matter. Frankly, Sir, it really upsets me that members of the Opposition, few of them who are here, think this is all a a joke, a carnival, at the expense of the penAustraha. sioners. I am proud to claim practically every battler and plonko in Hobart as a friend, do not think it is a funny matter. I do not think does honourable members opposite any credit all.",101
186,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,Iriseto a point of order. My point of order is that this is the National Parliament Austraha and the term 'plonkos' applied to citiin zens of Hobart ought to be withdrawn by the honourable member. It is disgraceful. No wonder he does not consider the pensioners.,102
187,Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,No point of pathy order is involved.,102
188,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"I think I am closer to the people that the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Young) is supposed to represent than he is. I share the distress of the pensioners this decision. I swallow it and I take heart because I beheve that we should look at this thing in the broad, and that the promise we to improve the lot of the pensioners will be honoured. Mr Martin-You did not do it.",102
189,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"It will be honoured. You they are hoping and praying that we will not honour it ing toare but I am telling you now that you disappointed. And those who are distressed in 1976 are going to be full of gratitude by 1978, because at least we will be able to prove in black and white by reference to the record that we did something for the pensioners when you merely lots used them at electiontime.The automatic indean xation, the financial autonomy, the consolidation of a payment, the recommendations of the Income Security Review Committee are all worthwhile initiatives and drives. It is for these reasons, Sir, that I support with reluctance this clause. I see it as thefirststep along the way to a long-awaited fair deal for pensioners. I appeal to honourable members on the other side who genuinely believe in the interests of pensioners, Uke the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whidam), do-an not to get carried away by the other gentleman, they can be so caUed, who are using pensioners as poltiical footballs. Unfortunately for them, their footbaU season ended on 13 December We will not use the pensioners as poltiical footare balls. We are going to do the job for them. determined on this and every other member of not Party is. I just say one other thing in conback clusion: We have long memories. I believe the Government will answer the call that comes to it the from those who beheve and from those who bit of want to see justice for the pensioners of and I Mr SCHOLES (Corio) (9.42)-I have heard it some rather emotive speeches in my time. I will at accept that the honourable gentleman should have spent some sleepless nights about this clause because the reason given by the Government for the deletion of the pensioner's funeral of benefit is to save money. On thefirstnight I spent this Parliament-if you want the record of your Party-the then Treasurer, the nowrighthonourable WUUam MCMahon, gave the pensioners sitting in the gallery here a very large dose of symand no money. By the time the Budget was passed the Government which had no money for pensioners, was able to find$120m for devaluation compensation for another section of the Port community. Now the Governmentfindsit necessary to abolish a benefit which is costing at less than $2m. The benefit could be doubled, or in it made a respectable benefit of around $150 or $200, for less than $4m. This Government is gave aboUshing it; we did not. Honourable members opposite laugh about aboUshing it. Yet they, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) and others, will go to theu* pensioners' meetings and teU them what good fellows they are when taking $40 from a pensioner who is tryare going to being his or herwith cope the traumatic problem of burypartner. Honourable members on the other side can laugh. I can assure them this is not funny, and their Government is not doing it to improve the of pensioners. It is not doing it as a result of election promise. It would not be in power if it had told them this was its intention. If honourable members opposite had the courage of their convictions-whic h they have not-the y would be voting with us to prevent the abolition of this clause. I will not be surprised at all if this clause in fact is returned to the Bill when it comes back to this House. Do not be surprised; there are people with conscience although regrettably they may not be in this place. I am suggesting that your record, despite what you may promise to d if you carry out your promises in full it if will be less than was done in the last 3 years",102
190,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,"That is not true. last. Mr SCHOLES-You are putting up what you gomg to do against what has been done. The I am honourable member may know everything, I am sure. AU I know is that you are going to sit in this chamber and vote to take $40 from the partner of a dead pensioner to save $700,000 this year-to reduce the $4,000m deficit to a deficit of $3,999m. That is what this Government proposes to do. Such a sum is not even worth considering in terms of the size of the Federal Budget. This is a psychological move designed purely to create a political atmosphere in which other expenditure cuts will be more acceptable and in which people will say: ' If the Government has to take it offthe pensioners, it will have to take it off other people'. Honourable members opposite talk about using people as political footballs! That is exactly what they are doing. They do not like it and I do not blame them for not liking it. That is a fact. If honourable members opposite want to hear a bit more of their record, I will tell them what happened. After seeing the sympathy for the pensioners demonstrated by the right honourable member for Lowe when he was Treasurer, we had a nationwide campaign in 1970 to try to get the pensioners a decent increase that year. They did not get it. Mr Bourchier- Mr Deputy Chairman, Iriseto order. Is the honourable member addressing his remarks to clause 7?",102
191,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"Oh , sit down. Mr Bourchier- I did, just then.",103
192,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS, I call the honourable member for Corio.,103
193,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,I think the honourable member is making sure that everyone understands exactly where he stands on this matter. He has no feeling for pensioners-onl y contempt. He beUeves that they can be used as he is using them. Mr Bourchier-That is a Ue.,103
194,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"The honourable gentleman may say that and get away with it because he has the numbers. Mr Donald Cameron-That is a reflection on you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",103
195,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member for Corio has far more experience in this Chair than I have. I must remind him that he must not reflect on an honourable member,103
196,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"I am not reflecting on an honourable member. If I did, I would withdraw the remark.",103
197,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"If the honourable member did not, his language was bordering on being unparUamentary to the honourable member.",103
198,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,I would not wish to interrupt a good speech by making reflections on an honourable member.,103
199,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I am sorry if I have interrupted a good speech. I invite the honourable member for Corio to address his remarks through the Chair every now and again. I caU the honourable member for Corio.,103
200,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,Mr Deputy Chairman Mr Bourchier- Iriseto take a point of order. I consider that the remarks made by the honourable member for Corio should be withdrawn.,103
201,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"If the honourable gentleman had been Ustening, he would have heard that I withdrew the remark that he found offensive before he found it offensive. Mr Bourchier-Why do not you speak up so that we can hear you? You were yelling well, before.",103
202,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"If the honourable member took his fingers out of his ears and cleaned the wax out ofhis ears, he might be able to hear.",103
203,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! There is no need for the honourable member to be deUberately offensive or provocative. I was,103
204,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, if I may say so, the honourable member",103
205,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Would the honourable member kindly retain his peace while I am speaking. I did not hear any withdrawal by the honourable member for Corio. I am prepared to accept what he says. But I think that he had better not continue to reflect on any honourable member. I call the honourable member for Corio.,103
206,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I think that you may have missed a few dozen reflections from that area of the chamber and one in particular in which the honourable member called me a liar. Apparently, that is not unparliamentary. This debate is about a $40 benefit for pensioners. It is about a Government decision as a result of which honourable members opposite will bravely come to the party and vote to delete that payment. That will make a magnificent difference to the Budget deficit later this year. Honourable members wUI not be able to see even a change of position in the decimal point in the amount shown on the balance sheet following this action. But the pensioner who loses this $40 will lose something important. If honourable members opposite believe that the Opposition should applaud this as some sort of magnificent economic action, they have another think coming. I return to what I was saying when I was interrupted. Honourable members opposite talk about using people as poltiical footballs. Tacked on to the end of the first speech deUvered by the then new Prime Minister in 1970-it was inserted only to catch a headline-wa s a statement in which he threw 50c to the pensioners.",103
207,Mr LUSHER,PAIRS,Fift y cents meant something those days. It does not any more.,104
208,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Yes, it meant a lot. That was the increase in one year. Of course, the honourfor able gendeman at that stage most Ukely was at school. That amount of money would have bought him about 5 ice creams. The facts of matter are that this is a despicable action aimed at those people least able least able to afford it and least able to gain the poltiical momentum which is necessary for them to reject what the Government is doing. If the Government took an equivalent amount of in money off some of the people to whom it has just given a very substantial handout by way of the superphosphate bounty, people who do not need it",104
209,Mr LUSHER,PAIRS,You do not understand.,104
210,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"Of course I do not underas it once was. stand. I do not understand, if I may address my remarks through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, how members of the National Country Party can agree to give one man who has no need of the money an amount equivalent to 2000 funeral beneiits and support that move as a great act then say in the Parliament that the Government cannot afford $700,000 this year to maintain funeral benefit. I hope that what the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) said eventuaUy becomes true-that a better, modern benefit replaces this benefit- I do not believe that if the Government removes a benefit now it will replace it at some time in the sweet bye and bye with another benefit. If another benefit was being placed on the record now to replace this benefit we would not be seeking to remove this clause. No other benefit is mooted. The much vaunted indexation of pensions has been talked about for 3 years. Make no mistake about that fact. Finally, I want to say this: After much promisbe ing the last time the Liberal Party and the try Party came out of Opposition into Governgram ment, in their first 5 years in office they managed to reduce the pension rate for married couples from 70 per cent of the basic wage at that time 54 per cent of the basic wage. I have no doubt they will do it again.",104
211,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"We have listened to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), both of whom narrowly scraped home at the last Federal election, trying to present themselves as champions for the cause of the pensioners. The honourable member for Oxley accused the in honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) of being a member of the Sistine Chapel choir. I remind the honourable member Oxley that Michelangelo painted and made things of beauty with a chisel for that chapel. The mess the honourable member for Oxley left be the hind as a result of his 12 months or so as Treasurer is responsible for half the problems we to defend themselves, face today. I believe that if the Labor Party was fair dinkum about its concern over funeral benefits, the 3 years that it was in power it would have increased the $40 benefit to a more realistic figure because of the inflation which took place during those 3 years. Every honourable member knows that today $40, whilst helpful towards the cost of a funeral, is of Utde value in comparison with its value in 1965 when the benefit was introduced. It is not as substantial a contribution Let us consider the social services program. Last year, under the Labor Party, when people below the poverty level were receiving less than $2,000, it cost more than $8,000 to administer and the program for every person below the poverty level. Pensioners or people needing assistance this were getting $ 1 out of every $4 spent on the social welfare program. The system had become so top heavy and over-balanced that the right people were not getting the money. We provide $1.7m for the funeral benefit for pensioners but we end up spending a greater figure simply to administer the scheme. I do not stand here without sympathy or without feeling for people who have to rely on the pension. If any member of the Opposition were to so suggest, I would go so far as to risk being thrown out of this House as a result of using unparliamentary language by calling him a hypocrite, because it would not be true. We have reached the stage where there has to a rationalisation. A few years ago the LiberalCounCountry Party Government introduced a prowhereby on the death of a partner in a marriage the survivor was given 12 weekly payments, which today is the equivalent of $400, to to assist that person to go through that period of grief without concern and to readjust to a different income. That happened about four or five years ago under the Liberal Government. The figure is now $400. I ask: If we have a scheme which is costing twice as much to administer as the benefit that we are giving, is it time that we really had a look at it? I do not advocate the total withdrawal of the scheme because, regrettably, it is an emotional matter. Members of the Opposition could make great pohtics out of it, they could stir up people, and they could suggest that we were trying to put people in a pauper's grave. That is not the intention of this Government. Personally, I would like to see introduced a scheme whereby when a pensioner died a funeral director could make a claim on the Department, and the money could be paid directly to him. If we centralise and minimise the amount of paper work involved, it could reduce the administrative costs. Honourable members opposite sit there and wait for the consideration of clause 7 which deals with the funeral benefit. During this debate they have not referred to any other clauses. They are just waiting to beat the meat, to try to make as much political capital as they possibly can out of this subject. I know that honourable members on this side of the chamber have, in their own Party room, expressed concern at what has been done. They have expressed concern, because if we are going to take something away something must be given back. The members of the Labor Party have sat here for 3 months and have wallowed in the memory of Kerr- I must apologise, of the Governor General, Sir John Kerr. They have stood up in this House every day trying toriphis wife's marriage or past marriage apart. They have been preoccupied with that matter. For the first time they have read the newspapers and have seen that Government supporters in their Party room were expressing a little bit of concern about this matter. So they say: 'Well, this must be a good subject to drag up in the House and try to recover our depleted stocks'. Well, shame on you.",104
212,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a point of order. I hesitated to take the because I thought that you would take it yourself. Whilst I personally do not have respect for present encumbent in the Governor General's office, I believe that the office the reflection made by the honourable member, even if unintended, should not go unattended by you. I suggest that you might give consideration to asking the honourable member to be more explanation. respectful and to redress the indignity that he has done to the office.",105
213,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," The honourable member has made his point of order. not I did not take action on 2 accounts. First of all, although there was a scream for a point of order from the Opposition side, in fact nobody rose. Secondly, the honourable member corrected himself, .very quickly, but I would nevertheless remind him that the correct title surely should be His ExceUency, the Governor General.",105
214,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I did correct myself, as you have correctly pointed out. It is very good to see this division starting in the Opposition side, where one member on that side is prepared to stand up at long last and defend His Excellency the Governor General. It has been a longtimecoming. In conclusion",105
215,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,A point of order. I claim to have been misrepresented.,105
216,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"The honourable member will resume his seat. If he claims to have been misrepresented, he will have an opportunity to take up the matter of a personal explanation after the honourable member has concluded his speech.",105
217,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS,"I did not realise that I had hit such a sensitive nerve in the side of the Opposition. I have said all that I wish to say. I conclude simply by saying that this side of the chamber is not just concerned with what happens after death. We are concerned with ensuring that the life of the pensioner will be made as happy and as pleasant as possible. It is necessary that this Government should get the country back on a sound economic footing and so destroy the inflation which has ripped away at every pension increase that honourable members opposite have given and lauded themselves for having given and which within a few months has been rendered useless. I am absolutely confident that future policies of the Liberal-National Country Party Government will ensure that the pensioners and people who have a greater income will have a far better Ufe than they had point under the Labor Party. When the people spoke on 13 December 1975 the voters just did not kick the honourable members opposite out; they roared 'Out with Labor', so they did not think much of is important, and their performance.",105
218,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Chairman, I wish to make a personal",105
219,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr GILES) Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,106
220,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"I do claim to have been misrepresented, greviously. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) has done me a very grave disservice which could be extremely damaging to me in the Party of which I am a member and in the electorate which I represent.",106
221,The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN,PAIRS,Order ! I suggest that the honourable member explain where he has been personally misrepresented.,106
222,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"If you will allow me and if I have no interruptions 1 will do it as peditiously as is possible. Mr Deputy Chairman, the honourable gendeman called me a royalist and to me that, in the present situation, is extremely offensive. Mr Donald Cameron- I never said that at all.",106
223,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"He called me a royalist and if that was known in my electorate and in the Party that I represent I would be regarded as very much out of character with the spirit of the Labor movement and the spirit of my electorate. I have indeed over the years had a lot of respect for royalty as have many other people. But in view of the political intervention which took place in this country in recent times, I now have very strong tendencies towards republicanism and strongly advocate it. Indeed, I could not be correctly described as a royalist and I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw the allegation that he has made because I regard it as offensive.",106
224,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Order! There is by no such issue before the Chair. I call the honourLegislative able member for Wills.,106
225,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS," Mr Deputy it Chairman, this must be the Liberal Party's and the Australian National Country Party's not proudest hour. We have seen the honourable his member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) wavthis ing his arms and pointing in various directions but not making it quite clear what the directions were. By sound and fury he might have confused the people who were still listening in although customarily I would expect that when they heard him announced they would switch off. They would forget what it was all about. We are disacross cussing here tonight the repeal by the Governpart ment of a section of the Social Services Act gave funeral benefits to the pensioners of Austraha. The benefit was about $40. The sum sort involved this year was perhaps $700,000 but the first flurry of the return to office of the people opposite, they decided that they must show the people of Australia that the time had come to show restraint; to pull in the belt; to reduce expenditure; to get out of the public sector into the private sector; and to do all the other things that are going to save us from destruction. So who do they pick onfirst?The people least able to stand it at the moment of their greatest deprivation; the people who receive funeral benefits. So we heard the honourable member for Griffith. I must say that I did not quite understand what he was saying. I did my best. I was not quite sure whether he was for the proposal or against it. But exI am quite confident that when the vote comes up he is going to vote for the repeal of this section. Mr H u r for d - He v o t e d for the superphosphate bounty.",106
226,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"That is right. As my colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide points out, he voted for the superphosphate bounty. But before we go much further on that line there is a correction to which I think he ought to be subject. He passed some remark about the extraordinary administrative expenses involved in the system. I understand that the appropriation in 1974-75 was $3,800m for social services. The administrative expenses were about $75m- 2 per cent-2 c in every $1.1 would presume that that applies to the administration of this area too. It ought to be possible for the honourable member for Griffith to get his facts straight. Then there was the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). At least I will say this for him. When his Party was under fire, fortified his yean of experience in that august body the Council of Tasmania, he was prepared to stand here and take us all on. He made quite clear though, that he had had sleepless nights about it. He was worried about it. He did really approve, but he is not going to carry disapproval so far as to vote against it here in House. That is the final test. If you vote for this you are voting for one of the most insensitive actions that a government has carried out in a long while. If it were part of the whole package of change in which the social security system was going to be amalgamated with something else, in which people were going to receive benefits the board and this removal of this one was of a package deal, well then we on this side which of the Committee would not be taking any exception to it. But this was pan of a different of deal. It was part of a political deal to try to in get atmospherics in the community-thes e men mean business. The great and powerful leadership, steeped in the traditions of the past of the Melbourne Club and the squattocracy and so on. He would show us what could be done; he will punch the pensioners, and nothing that you say opposite about hypocrisy or cant, about political footballs or anything else can claim the climate of that. That is what it is all about. What a miserable pettifogging action. I do not know how many people are involved; perhaps up to 40 000 in a year. What does it mean to them? When we consider issues of this nature in this place it is enough to take the national content. But you have also to consider the personal content of the other end. And the facts of Ufe are of course that in a country such as this $700,000, a million or so, is chicken feed in the national Budget. But to the people receiving $40, people who are pensioners, people at the time of greatest loss, it is quite an important matter. But also in many of these matters-and I work in a community to which these things are important-ther e is a psychological question that has been raised by the persons opposite. So this evening we reject the charge of hypocrisy and cant. My honourable friend from Oxley (Mr Hayden) changed the standard of life of every pensioner in this country, and he did it in the face of the hottest critical opposition you could encompass, from obstructions from State governments, from obstructions from the other place, from appeals to the High Court in various areas, and all the rest ofit. Every possible obstruction was carried out. We changed the style of life, the standard of living and the quaUty of Ufe of everybody subject to beneiits under this Government. Mr Ruddock-Rubbish.",106
227,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"Rubbish, he says. A little whUe ago the honourable member for Parramatta thought it was a breach of privilege suggest that we should let the people of his electorate know how he votes in this place. It is not rubbish. Get the figures; have a look at the amount of money left in people's hands; take a look at the electoral offices where people come in. As one pensioner came into my own office few weeks ago before the State election in Viccision toria and said: 'Pass this on to the Labor Pany; is $5. We know what the Labor Party did for us.' You have only got to do the arithmetic. Perhaps they do not teach arithmetic any more. You have only got to relate the pension to pounds of butter and pints of milk, to the removal of the means test for people over 70 years old, to see what difference it has made. Unfortunately, no matter what the honourable members opposite may the think or feel, no matter what they might say the Party room, no matter how much they may plead for consideration, the facts are that the pensioners' standard of living is going to go downwards over the next few years. The honourable member for Denison said that the people who were distressed in 1975 are going to be grateful in 1978-gratefu l because in 1978 they will have a chance to throw this graceless lot out of office.",107
228,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS," Mr fair Chairman, I rise to speak on this clause because it is one that has caused me considerable concern.",107
229,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,Sleeples s nights?,107
230,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"Yes, sleepless nights.",107
231,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr GILES) The honourable member will address his remarks to the Chair.,107
232,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"Fine, Mr Chairman.",107
233,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,There is too much humour on the other side. It is a big joke.,107
234,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"It is a very serious matter as far as I am concerned. As a matter of fact I would have walked the floor at night but for the honourable member for Oxley. He baited one of our members and brought this debate to a level of filth as far as I am concerned. It is an issue that in my own electorate has caused those constituents who are pensioners to be concerned about our social welfare objectives and our direction. I too have felt that the withdrawal of this benefit may cast doubts on our overall aims in social welfare poUcy, but I know that the Government faces severe economic problems. I know that some cuts had to be made. I would have preferred to see this benefit remain but I can understand the dUemma in which the Government almost to finds itself. It is under these conditions and these conditions alone that I accept the Government's decision. It is for those reasons that I have tried to explain to my constituents why the Government a took this decision. Although I support the denow I have this to say: I urge the Governit ment in its next review of social welfare benefits to look very closely at the gap that has been left by the withdrawal of this benefit. I hope that the Government will be able to see its way to replace it. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) has said that the Income Security a Review Committee is examining the whole range of benefits with a view not only of rationalising odds and ends that now exist, but also of proin ducing a new, better and more meaningful scheme of income assistance for those who are need. Mr Chairman, these are not just idle words. I come from a working class background and I am proud of it. I have pensioners in my family and I am proud of them. But I have seen them suffer because of the poUcies of the man who sits opposite, who pretends to be their champion. I Immigration and Ethnic have seen members of my family suffer because reply to a question without of the disease called inflauon; I have seen them on 30 March 1976 I promised suffer because of unemployment. Mr Innes-Dr y your eyes.",107
235,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,I will. The deletion of this funeral benefit has caused me concern. I have say that I believe it is only thefirstbite at achievarrangements ing our social welfare objectives.,108
236,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,To make the pensioners poor.,108
237,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"No, it will not make them tragic. poorer. It is a program that will not be reaUsed now or perhaps in the next 6 months, but before this Government's term of office isfinishedthe pensioners of Australia wiU thank us for what we have done. Those are not ordinary words, Mr Chairman. I am convinced that Malcolm Fraser is fair dinkum about pensioners and that at long last pensioners will get a fair go from us instead of being treated Uke poltiical footballs, as the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) and Up his coUeagues opposite are doing tonight. It been a dashed shame. Severaltimeswhen a new member in this House has risen to speak he has been called a oncer by honourable members impossible opposite. Mr Innes-You will be a oncer.",108
238,Mr GOODLUCK,PAIRS,"Fine . I will be proud to be a oncer if within 3 years I can contribute betterment of the lot of pensioners and underprivUeged of Australia. The honourable member for Oxley and his colleagues can throw as much as they Uke at me but the pensioners back home know that I am sincere. They know that I wiU work for them. The Opposition tonight has thrown slush and muck around. It may have hoped to get results but it will not get those results now because I am awake and a lot of sisted. people in Australia are awake also. They know that unlike members of the Labor Party, we on this side stick to our word and we keep our part promises. Mr Chairman, I know that the views that I have put and which. I sofirmlybeUeve in have been heard by the Government and will be conor sidered. I support the Government in what it is trying to do to help the pensioners. I condemn the Labor Party for once again trying to play in poUtics with the pensioners of Australia and the underprivUeged. Progress reported. NA Ministerial Statement",108
239,Mr MACKELLAR,MIGRATION FROM LEBANON,"by leave-In notice in the House the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) that, in the near future, I would be making a submission to the Government on migration from the Lebanon. I to am now in a position to advise the Parliament of the Government is making to process as quickly as possible applications from those Lebanese people who qualify for migration to Australia. The situation in the Lebanon is There is no doubt that the lives of many people are in danger and that there is a considerable number of people eUgible for migration to Australia who are at present unable to move. It was decided on Sunday, 28 March, that the level of risk in retaining an Australian Embassy in Beirut was such that the presence of Australian officers there could no longer be justified. The senior Australian immigration officer remained in Beirut until the Embassy staff was withdrawn. till then he was able to serve a useful purpose has in processing migration applications but under the conditions pertaining in the days immediately preceding last Sunday operations became in addition to the escalating risk to the oflicers in Beirut. Locally engaged staff, except for one or two people who endangered their own Uves, were unable to reach the hotel in which the immigration officer was operating. It to the was virtually impossible for those in the the Lebanese community who may have sought to reach the immigration officer to do so. Before leaving Beirut, staff placed a notice in the Press on 29 March advising appUcants of the closure of the Embassy and that if they were able to make their way to Australian embassies in Cairo, Ankara or Athens, they could still be asIf a formal refugee situation eventuates in Lebanon the Government would certainly give earnest consideration to how it might play its full to help in such a situation. It must be evident to all members of the Parliament and, indeed, to the Lebanese community within Australia that, if a refugee situation should arise, it could well be of a magnitude beyond the capacity of Australia of any one country to handle alone. However, I have been informed this morning that there is a significant movement of Lebanese into Syria. At this stage it is not known what the composition of this movement is and hence whether they would be eUgible for migration to Australia. I have already given instructions that an immigration officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eUgible to come to Australia. The Australian Government does not officially have resident representation in Syria. Migration inquiries are handled for us by the Netherlands Embassy. The Australian officer will work in association with that Embassy during his stay in Syria. There is an Australian High Commission in Cyprus and those people from the Lebanon eligible for migration to Australia can apply there. I now wish to speak of further action proposed to deal with migration of Lebanese, both those within the Lebanon and those who manage to reach other countries. I have already stated that the Australian Government will co-operate in any international efforts to deal with a refugee problem if one arises. As soon as the situation in Beirut stabUises to the point where the Embassy staff can return and operations can begin again, a task force of immigration officers will be sent into Beirut. It will have the necessary facUities to process appUcations for migration to Australia as rapidly as local circumstances permit. This will require the co-operation and avaUabUity of locally engaged staff for interpreting, clerical other support. I pay tribute to the locally engaged staff in Beirut who have endeavoured to maintain a service to potential migrants and others applying to the temporary Embassy at very great personal risk to themselves. Mr Brogan, the Senior Migration Officer who was in charge of the Immigration Office in Beirut, is now in Athens. He has been directed to co-ordinate immigration arrangements for those Lebanese who reach countries outside the Lebanon. This will involve maintaining continuous contact with our missions in nearby countries and an oversight of those countries where there are no Australian missions. In the latter category are Jordan and Syria. There are Austrahan missions in Greece, Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and Egypt. I must emphasise that currendy the normal migration criteria will apply to people from the Lebanon applying in other countries. This means that those eUgible will be the spouses, dependant chUdren and aged and dependant parents of Australian residents. Cases outside these criteria wUI be considered sympathetically on their merits as they arise. Extension of the eligible categories either of migrants or visitors is not foreseen. There are major problems of identification and extreme difficulties of obtaining necessary checks of potential immigrants including health checks. Honourable members will, I am sure, understand the need for careful control of entry to Australia from areas of international dispute. In respect of the persons in the present eligible categories I have mentioned-that is spouses, dependant children and aged and dependant parents-it may be necessary to dispense with checks, including health checks, if conditions do not permit them to be undertaken. Wherever possible, however, these checks will be undertaken. I hope that this statement will clarify both the present position regarding eligibility for migration and indicate the firm intention of the Government to do aU within its power to ease hardship. The situation will be kept under constant review and I can assure the House that I will be maintainmg personal supervision of the arrangements I have outlined.",108
240,Mr INNES,MIGRATION FROM LEBANON," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement.",109
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION FROM LEBANON,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",109
242,Mr INNES,MIGRATION FROM LEBANON,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that the Lebanese community in Australia and expected the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Mackellar) to clarify the position regarding relatives and friends who are living in the Lebanon. The present situation is causing a great deal of grief and distress in our Lebanese community. I do not believe that this statement adequately clarifies the position. There is nothing in it to satisfy the apprehensions of members of the Lebanese community in this country who feel that they are being left in the lurch. The whole statement is a facade. It is designed to lull the Lebanese community in believing that people existing in such tragic circumstances in the Lebanon can look forward to assistance. But something more specific should have been proposed to get people out of that country. The Minister referred to 'arrangements the Government is making to process as quickly as possible applications from those Lebanese people who qualify for migration to Australia'. I stress the word 'qualify'. No procedural change is proposed. The Minister has made it abundantly clear that existing criteria will continue to apply. He said that the situation is tragic. Of course it is tragic! I do not challenge the Minister's feelings but if his feelings are so deep for the individuals concerned I point out that his statement and his answer to a question the other day do nothing to relieve the apprehensions of members of our Lebanese community. The Minister agrees that the situation is not normal. This area has suffered as a result of conflict yet the normal migration criteria will apply. The Minister said: This means that those eligible will be spouses, dependent children and aged and dependent parents of Australian residents. Cases outside these criteria will be considered pathetically on their merits . . . What does that mean? I have details of a case that was submitted to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I should like the Minister to reconcile his statement tonight and the answer he gave the other day with what has happened. An appUcation was made on behalf of a lady, whose breadwinner was shot in Beirut, and 4 chUdren. They sought permission to join a son and nephew in Australia. An officer of the Department notified my office on 9 March that permission had been refused. He refused permission on the ground that there were no special circumstances to consider in this case. I put this to the Minister. If, for instance, a person has lost his father, if a family has lost its home, or if a woman has lost her husband, does he seriously say that that does not come within the ambit of special circumstances? If that is not the issue or if that is not what is spelt out in the statement, then another statement needs to be made dealing with this as a specific matter. WUl the Minister undertake to reverse that decision, and in the future to deal with other appUcations, including appUcations that are there at present, with a Utde more compassion? I hope that I am not boring the MinisterMr Neil-You are boring me.",109
243,Mr INNES,MIGRATION FROM LEBANON,"It might be boring the honourable member who interjects, but it is not boring the people in Lebanon; neither is it boring their relatives in Australia. If that is all the honourable member for St George is going to add up to, he might have in his electorate some Lebanese people who might be taking him to task; and I sincerely hope they do. What does the Minister mean when he refers to 'a formal refugee situation'? It is hypocrisy. The formal refugee situation was a quasi-war refugee situation, and that has not changed. It means that a large ethnic community in this country must wait until this Government finds some magical formula before it is able to assist friends, relatives and countrymen in an extraordinary and extremely tragic situation. I do not think this statement goes anywhere near far enough. It certainly does not clarify the matter. The Minister says in his statement that before the staff of the Embassy left Beirut they put a notification in the Press advising people to go to Athens and other places. I think he refers to Cyprus, Israel, Turkey and in particular Damascus. I wonder whether we have asked the Syrian authorities whether we can carry out that sort of operation in Damascus. We have sent people into other countries in the past and they have run syminto serious trouble with the governments concerned. The Minister ought to clarify whether in fact that has been done; whether we will receive co-operation from the Syrian authorities; and whether that has been tidied up. The Government also is asking these people to go long distances. Is it spelling out exacuy what is meant by that? Are people to be attracted to the various areas to which I have referred, only to find that their applications are refused? Will they be refused because of the strait-jacket nature of the criteria which the Government is using at present and which do not meet the problem and the examples which I have put to the Minister? I believe that that advertisement may do more damage than enough. I put it to the Minister sincerely that the House is entitled to know just what the arrangements are. The people in this country who have relatives there ought to know, and it should not be the type of vague, general statement that has been made here this evening. In summary, Mr Speaker, the fact is that the criteria for entry have not changed. The situation is tragic-ther e is no doubt about that-bu t everything is normal. The criteria are normal. This statement goes no way towards satisfying the apprehensions of the Lebanese people concerned. I think it is a political trick, an attempt by the Government and the Minister to pretend that they are doing something that they really are not doing. I charge the Minister with the responsibUity of clarifying the statement and going to the point of answering the question concerning the example that I gave. The Lebanese people who have relatives in this country and the relatives of those people, who are Uving under tragic circumstances in Lebanon, need a better explanation. They need special circumstances and special criteria to deal with a very serious problem. It is the height of hypocrisy to put out a statement that does not change the existing situation. Given the fact that the Minister accepts that it is a tragic situation, I think there is a deeper responsibility to the Lebanese people here and to their relatives in Lebanon. NA Unemployment in Cobar-Beef Industry: Rural Poverty-Communications in Rural Areas-Mediban k and Weight Reducing Diets Modon (by Mr MACKellar) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (10.30)- Mr ter Speaker, I was very grateful for the interest shown today in the problems of the township of Cobar, following my question to the Minister Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr report Street) concerning the retrenchment 65 employees and the fact that 30 per cent of the work force of that town is now unemployed. very pleased at this interest because Cobar has long and interesting mining and pastoral history. At the turn of the century there were 10 000 people in Cobar and many mining companies and many mines were operating. Cobar at that stage even had its own stock exchange. The first rnining lease was taken out in 1870 and there was a boom in copper niining in that area from that period until 1919 when low copper prices, rising costs and other problems forced most the mines to close down. The last big producer Cobar boom days closed in 1920 when the CSA mine was forced to close due to fire. The second stage of rnining took place in and continued until 1952 when the New been Occidental Gold Mines NL operated 3 mines that area. Then, once again, we saw the close down of the niining operations. The third of the Cobar mine in which I am now interested pubhc. was under the management of Cobar Mines Pty Ltd which took over the old CSA mine in 1962 anThe and began production in June 1965. It employed 450 employees. Many other ore bodies were about located and it was anticipated that several mines achieve would be operating at this period. The present announced mine yields low grade ore, but it most modern plants and modern systems in the of the losses incurred world. This can be borne out by the fact that the agreed that changes had production target for this year was 625 000 tons ations, that mining operations with only 200 people employed. I want to inform the House of some of the present day problems of the town of Cobar. the middle of 1975 the future of the mine was not very rosy. It was a credit to everyone in the concerned that the people were prepared to talk about these things. I took part in many official and non-official talks on this problem. The ister for Minerals and Energy at that time, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr was Connor), was kept informed of the situation and he intimated to the people involved that if Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill was passed there would be some assistance for the Cobar nune. Unfortunately, when there was a challenge to this legislation and it become quite obvious that no assistance would come as a result of that Bill, an arrangement was made for a delegation of shire officials from Cobar representing the mine workers to meet the Minisand the Treasurer. The outcome of this was a notification that the Industries Assistance Commission would be asked to consider the problems for of the copper industry and would be asked to back within 60 days. That was on 17 Sepofa further tember 1975. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated more I am quickly than was expected and, following a another series of discussions, it was decided to revise the scale of operations and 200 employees were retrenched. It was a credit to the company that plenty of warning was given and much consideration was given to employees' relocation assistance and so forth and assistance with their housing. Both the State member and I were invited to join the discussions and we tried tofinda way to assist the situation. The only complaint I of have, Mr Speaker, is that I gained an underof standing during these discussions that operations on this reduced scale would continue until the IAC report was made known. It seems to me that 1932 there was some slip-up here because there has a retrenchment of another 65 employees. It in can be seen from the Minister's answer to my question today that this Industries Assistance stage Commission report has not yet been made breakdown of the M2 conveyor belt and overtime ban because of some argument sick leave brought about this failure to their production target and the company that a further 65 employees were to has one of the mine operatingHowever, be retrenched. it did agree to keep the provided a significant reduction could be made. It was to be made in operwould be mostly on the open stope system, that production would be maintained at 2500 tonnes per day, and that In the additional 65 employees would be retrenched. Fifty per cent of these were staff. It town was agreed that the remaining employees would recognise and accept the need for flexibility in work allocations, meaning that they could be Minshifted from the surface to go underground and to take place in stope preparation and so forth. I speaking to the unionists tonight in Cobar and I am pleased to say that they have reached the agreement on these things, and the mine might be able to keep open on this reduced scale. I hope there will be no further reduction in the work force of the mine and that the Austrahan Government will be able to find a way to give the mine some assistance. I would like to return to the 30 per cent who are already unemployed. Even before any retrenchment on the mine there was an exceptionally high number of unemployed in that town, so much so that the previous Government in a little over 12 months made $621,000 available in Regional Employment and Development scheme grants and in 2 years they got $237,000 from the Grants Commission. Capital grants for education for the high school and Catholic schools amounted to $140,000, and there was also finance for Aboriginal housing. It seems to me that the Government should not wait for the mine but should try to find some way to assist the economy of the town. Unfortunately it appears that this Government is heading in the other direction. Because the natural pipeline goes through that area, over 42 per cent of the roads were damaged. Although the rate income for the year 1974 amounted to only $173,103 the total cost to repair these roads would amount to $799,105. The Shire has written to the Government on several occasions but it cannot get an answer to its claim to have this reimbursed. On top of this, an amount of $28,554 expended by the Council and representing award increases for the number of manweeks involved in the RED scheme is outstanding. One of the conditions of the scheme was that the project in question would be approved provided any variation in wage costs would be automatically added. I ask the Government to give further considerspecialists ation to the economy of the town, because there is a lot of ore around the town and more comquestions panies are ready to move in. Already many tlers, millions of dollars have been paid into the even point. treasuries of the Federal and State governments from this mighty town of Cobar. I ask the tary Government to consider an immediate investigadevelopment tion to try to find some way of keeping that mine of human resources open, because there is no doubt that eventually all provide the necessary we will have a good mine producing in Cobar mation on markets and they and a great national benefit.",110
244,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, over the last few weeks a lot has been said in this House about the situation in the industry, and the rural poverty situation has been the subject of a special report. I would like speak tonight about an area that combines the problems of the beef industry and that of rural poverty. The comparison is all the more striking because this particular area fringes on probably one of the greatest and wealthiest niining areas in Australia. I refer to the Utah Development Company mines at Dysart and Moranbah. In 1967 the Brigalow Land Agreement Act was introduced by the Commonwealth to provide nnanciai assistance to Queensland for area 3 of the Brigalow scheme. The project involved breaking down the larger leases previously existing into smaller living areas. The scheme was evolved through the active encouragement of the Queensland State Government and the Federal Government at a time when the beef industry was affluent and the future appeared bright. Conditions on the ballot blocks ensured a minimal equity by the settlers with the Queensland Land Administration Commission allowing for the block being paid off over a period of years, interest free. Further funds advanced through the Land Administration Commission by the Commonwealth were gas allocated towards improvements and the purchase of breeding cattle at a variable rate of interest, currently at 10.2 per cent, repayable over 20 years from the date of advance. The interest rate at the commencement of the loan in 1971 was only 7 per cent. Before full development could be undertaken in Brigalow area 3, and before the breeding herds could develop saleable cattle the beef market deteriorated badly. Interest rates on loans escalated dramatically and the political climate changed, thereby making unattainable the budgets and nnanciai projections on which the original settlers had been accepted for the scheme. The changed circumstances were unforeseen by governments,financiers,stock and marketing and particularly the settlers themselves. The changed circumstances must pose of future viability for some of the seteven if the beef market improves to a cut Communications represent one of the elementenets upon which economic growth and depend. Roads, transport, mobility and verbal communications input and output inforprovide a link of communication for medical services for people in this area. Communication facilities enable people to live in and be attracted to remote areas. beef The matter of telephone communications is therefore particularly important in the developto ment of this area. Nebo exchange partially taps the top of area 3, and Isaacs River Exchange has suffered from procrastination and deliberate delays by the previous Government. The Dysart exchange, centre of a very prosperous mining area, bypasses some of the adjacent properties. A special arrangement exists for a dam project on the Mackenzie River that may be expanded in the future. In this problem of communications the need is pressing. Accident victims have been known to wait for 6 hours for attention, or days when the country isflooded-The matter can be one of Ufe or death. The present limit of free extension and the expense of Une reticulation prevents the settiers from providmg the necessary funds even when partially subsidised by the Commission. Of aU their social problems this one of communications is the most pressing. The Australian Assistance Plan operated from the Mackay Regional Development Committee has operated beneficiaUy for the social good of these settlers. The people arefirmadvocates for the plan. While not being a problem unique to area beef markets and stabUisation of prices form one problem in relation to which all beef producers are looking to this Government. The Federal loans that were advanced by the 1967 Act in 3, with interest capitalised to 30 June 1975, amounted to $4,018,614. WhUe appreciating the extended terms with no repayment, these initial redemptions will now be made whUe the beef the industry and producers of the area are in an economic trough. Mr MCVeigh-They are real battlers, too.",112
245,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"That is the problem. to To all of this there are answers. reporting on the problems that the settlers of the area consider immediate. I believe that the Government could, by following certain suggestion, which could be adopted by Ministers cerned in these particular areas, assist the settlers to a great extent. I name these recommendations. The Federal Government should continue to tain pursue every avenue to seek out long term world the markets at better than cut-even prices. Interest MACKenzie rates on the loans mentioned on all loans directly or indirectly to the industry mal telephoneacceptable from the Federal Government preferably to the that is, by 2-way 4 per cent presently applying to the rural reconcould be a costing struction loans, these to include the special assistneeds of communications ance to the Queensland Government Development Bank loans. The redemption of the to carry out this work, and grant above loans could be suspended untU the indus1976-77 Budget for the erection of a translator try became more viable. The Federal Government through the Income Tax Act could provide for the income equaUswith ation deposits to allow taxation deductions pomt of purchase and to provide for their taxation at the point of redemption, as recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission in July 1975. These bonds could be made avaUable to aU rural producers. A committee could be formed, perhaps within the framework of the IAC, to take evidence from the meat industry and producers to formulate recommendations to government as to how the industry in all aspects may be best assisted by the Government. Theie could be a return of the petrol price equalisation scheme which was removed by the former Government. Investigation should be undertaken of the needs of local governments in these areas that constitute predominantly depressed grazing industries especially forfinanceto enable them to continue to provide services without excessively rating the property owners. Within Brigalow Area 3 the particular prob3, lem would be that there must be an immediate consideration in the reduction of interest and deferment of redemptions and, perhaps in conjunction with the Queensland State Government, this area Government could provide personnel to determine the immediatefinancialsituation of the settlers and their long term viability, to review completely the whole scheme, and to investigate residency and other conditions of the initial contracts to allow for an earlier sale or a deferment of development. The viabihty of each property must be ascertained and also the amount of further assistance individual settlers will require inject into their properties to make them viI am merely able and profitable. This morning in the course of the grievance debate, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) mentioned particularly the Postal conand Telecommunications commissions. In this area I think there could be real advantages if the commissions or if the Minister could look at ceraspects of these problems including sending an investigation team into the area to report on needs of the settlers at Valkyrie, Isaacs River, River, Dysart and Moranbah. They should be reduced could suggest alternatives where norcommunications cannot be made, radio or radio telephones. There prepared on the minimum with a view to the and also Government malting a special to Telecom provision in the to service the mining towns of Dysart and Moranbah with commercial and national television Utah company assistance, which has at the already been promised. In the general area of post and communications I agree with the honourable member for Paterson when he mentioned this morning that there should be a re-assessment by the Telecommunications Commission in the 1976-77 Budget of rural telepohone charges to reduce the price of a local call to the charge prevailing at the city closest, most frequented or used for business by the settlers. Some latitude could be granted to allow for self-help in the reticulation of private lines to minimise costs. Mr Speaker, I do hope that the Government and its Ministers will take note of the particular problems of these settlers. They are people who have chosen to follow this way of life and to develop a particularly rich area of land and who, through circumstances beyond their control, have fallen upon bad times. Mr MCVeigh-They are the salt of the earth.",113
246,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"They are, too. I beheve that if the Government could assist in the manner in which I have mentioned it would assist not only Brigalow 3 but rural areas throughout Austraha and particularly the beef industry.",114
247,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, several constituents have asked me to raise a matter which concerns a wonder drug diet- a weight reducing method-whic h has involved them in what in common parlance would be called a rip-off. Whilst they are not complaining much about that they are concerned that the costs associated with this treatment are a charge on Medibank. There is a very strong feeling that the Government is not being viligant enough in ensuring that only bona fide charges are made against Medibank and insufficiently vigilant about bringing to heel people of the type I am going to mention. The company concerned is the Obesity and Gerontology Research Clinic at 175 Pitt St., Sydney. That is the head office of this company. It also has 5 clinics in the suburbs of Sydney and, I think, 2 clinics in Melbourne. It now is moving to Adelaide as well. In the first year of its operations this company is said to have had from 3000 to 3500 chents. I think honourable members will acknowledge, after I havefinishedspeaking, that they can be described as victims. I am very concerned that the Government may be harbouring people of this type-peopl e who are battening on the great humane concept of Medibank. This clinic had been advertised extensively on television by the well-known woman's cookery writer, Margret Fulton. It is run by a Dr Thomas Beck and he has convinced thousands of women to take this $ 118 diet course-the wonder drug diet course. The matter to which I am referring was the subject of a very excellent exposure by the Sydney Daily Mirror on the 16 February. People who are interested could gain a lot more detail by reading that newspaper. The doctor's credentials are not recognised in Australia. There are registered doctors co-operating with him in this rip-off despite the possible deregistration that they face. I understand they have been warned to that effect. This wonder diet involves an injection of hormones taken from pregnant women and it is regarded as useless by the experts. The drug is called HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin. Dr Beck regards this as having such great potential that he has actually sought to extract the hormone from the bodies of starving women in Bangladesh. It is such a lucrative business that it does not matter where you get it from. It is used with a daily injection and patients are placed on a 500 calories a day diet. The latter part of the treatment might have merit in itself but the former part seems to be extremely questionable. Leading nutritionists in the Federal Department of Health have criticised the program and called it a gimmick. One expert, Professor W. Jones, a former lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Sydney, said it was unscrupulous. Professor J. Turtle, a professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, said that there have been no studies to estabhsh that the treatment has any benefit whatsoever. Professor Drenick, professor of medicine at the University of California, said that the treatment 'could induce hair loss, dry scaly skin and lowered blood pressure'. He said that the United States Food and Drug Administration had actually required the labelling of HCG to indicate that there is no evidence that it induces weight loss. As I said earher, this matter involves some thousands of people, 3000-odd in the first year, at an average cost of $118.1I have several letters from constituents but I will refer only to one. It says that it appears that the clinic takes all the patients it can get. There is supposed to be a psychological test to determine whether people are capable of responding but the clinic takes people whether or not they undergo that test. In fact it usually signs them up and commences the course. People almost complete the course before they get the results of the entry test. I will read this paragraph from the letter. It says: It also appears that they take all the patients they can get, give them the treatment, if it works they are suitable for it, if not send them back to their doctor. You only have to go to the Medibank office in MirandaThat is a part of my electorateto see how many people go straight from the clinic to their medical refunds, to realise how many people have sponded to the advertising, and this is only one of the in Sydney. This constituent began his letter by saying: I am very disturbed about the methods some doctors using, which may bring Medibank into disrepute, would hate this to happen after all the Labor Party has to bring it into being. It may require adjustments and modifications, but it seems to me that Fraser would soon scrap it as modify it. I have talked to several of these people and they realise that they were taken for aride.One lady told me that after the first injection she was subjected to vomiting, nausea, intestinal pains, tingling of the fingers, deafness and blurred vision. She knows, as I say, that she has been taken for a ride. But what she and a number of other people are now anxious to ensure is that this is not underwritten by the Australian taxpayer, by making it a charge on Medibank. I have already taken up the matter, by way of correspondence, with the Minister. I have listed it as a question on the parhamentary notice paper. I beheve that it is important to get the issue recorded in Hansard so that other people can be informed about the hazards represented by it. Mr Speaker, in the several minutes that remain, and without labouring the point, I would just Uke to refer to the closure of a post office. Now that sounds mundane and very ordinary, because many post offices have been closed in Australia in recent years. But this one has a feature about it which I believe needs mentioning. The Menai post office serves a little community 20 miles from Sydney. It is a place where there will be maybe 70 000 people in the near future. It will be a sort of a satelUte city. In fact the first town houses are already starting to be erected. There has been a post office there for donkeys years, and now the postmistress has resigned. Why has she resigned? It is simply because the agreement with the non-official Postmasters Ascollect sociation and the Government is to the effect that rethis postal officer, be it a postmaster or a postmisclinics tress, is paid $42 for a 5-day week and $2.50 for 2Vi hours work on Saturday. In other words, the Australian Postal Commission is seeking to run are this service on the cheap. I do not doubt that this and I is but only one case where we are just trying to done get too much out of these people. I think it is fair just as to describe the policy as blatantly exploitive and reminiscent of sweated labour in the dark ages. Of course, the regrettable thing is that the members of the public are the unfortunate victims of the endeavour by the Postal Commission to get this service on the cheap. I actually went round this town asking people whether they would like to become the postmaster or the postmistress. They just said to me: 'You must be joking. It is such an absurd proposition'. This is what happens in this instance: The postmistress receives an annual allowance of $2,180 which, as I say, is the equivalent of $42 a week. Then there is accommodation. The allowance for the rent of a very nice office that she provides is $936. There is an allowance of $26 for a supplementary thing- I am not sure what that is. Then there is an allowance of $52 for heating, $39 for cleaning the public telephone cabinets, and $133.70 for Saturday penalty rates. There it is. A very assiduous service is required by the community and a competent sort of a person is required to run the service. That lousy wage is a reflection on this Government. If anybody else tried to engage a person of that sort of calibre for that wage the Government would probably prosecute him. I believe that this matter ought to be looked at, because the case I raise is undoubtedly typical of similar situations in many other parts of Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.59 p.m. The following answers to questions Mr Yates asked the Attorney-General, upon would notice: Is he able to say how many travened to date by the buyer of the Robbins Bendigo gold nugget, and what action does he propose to take on behalf of the Australian people. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: This answer is based on facts supplied by other Departments and by the Reserve Bank. As required by the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations an approval for the export of the nugget was issued by an officer National Resources duly authorised by the Minister for National Resources on S February tion 9 and the consent of the Minister for Business and Conwhat is itatnow. sumer Affairs was obtained on 10 February 1976 pursuant to regulation 4. The Reserve Bank of Australia verified on 4 Feburary 1976 that the arrangements made for payment for the nugget complied with those approved by the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations. The nugget was exported on 12 February 1976. No duty was payable. Section 114(1) (b) of the Customs Act provides that in such chain a case the goods shall be entered for export not later than weighting three days after a Certificate of to the master of the ship, or pilot of the aircraft, in which the The composition goods are to be exponed. In this case the Certificate of Cleartember quarter 1974 ance was granted on 12 February 1976 and the entered for expon on 17 February 1976. Having regard to the fact that all necessary approvals for export had been obtained the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs is of the view, with which I agree, that this is not a case in which proceedings should be brought for non-compliance with secas tion 114(1) (b) of the Customs Act. Mr Yates asked the Minister for Business and vision Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) What is the (a) true value; and (b) weight of the Robbins Bendigo gold nugget for which he has granted an export licence to the United States of America. (2) Will he provide a list of the names of the experts he consulted in the nadonal museums before issuing the licence to export the gold nugget. . Mr HOWARD - The answer to the honourable member's quesdon is as follows: (D (a) The value stated in the application for an export licence was $35,000; (b) 182 ounces troy. (2) Officers of my Department were official of the National Museum of Victoria, Melbourne concerning the nugget. I am informed that the finders had offered the nugget for sale to that NA upon notice were circulated: Gold Nugget offer had stood for a considerable period no sale was effected. The official was advised that any case the Museum (Question No. 1) cared to submit for retention of the nugget in Australia be submitted for my consideration. The Museum did not avail itself of this offer. No representations concerning the disposal of the nugget were received from any other Federal laws have been conmuseum. Consumer Price Index (Question No. 3) Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1355 (Hansard, 5 December 1974, page 4725), what changes have been made to the weighting of the Consumer Price Index since of the Department of December 1968. (2) What was the relative weighting of each of the com1976 pursuant to regulaponents that time, what was it in December 1973, and Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable the Bank under member's quesuon is as follows: (1) The Consumer Price Index has been compiled as a of linked indexes with changes in composition and effected at relatively short intervals of four or five Clearance has been granted yearsat duration. The last two of these changes were effected as December quarter 1968 and at December quarter 1973. of the index was also changed as from Sepas a result of the deletion of the item goods were 'radio and television licences', the weights of the other items. but this change did not alter (2) The weighting pattern of the index is described in the form of percentages contributed to the total index aggregate at the quaner from which a new weighting has been used. The pattern adopted as at December quarter 1968 is shown in Labour Report No. 58, 1973 on pages 33 to 39. The same Gold Nugget Labour Report also shows (on pages 354 to 359) the sub(Question No. 2) sequent pattern which was adopted at December quarter 1973. The weights for all items other than 'radio and telelicences' have not changed since December quaner 1973. Wine: Sugar Content (Question No. 40) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (1) What action is he taking to prevent the importation of wine, which, by Australian standards, has been adulterated by the addition of sugar. (2) Is it a fact that Australian wine, other than sparkling and flavoured wines, is not permitted to contain added sugar.",114
248,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no prohibition of imported wines to which in contact with an sugar has been added. (2) No. However, Australian States prohibit the sale of Museum and although the such wine. Wayside Chapel: Grants Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon nouce: (1) What sums, and for what purposes, were given to the Wayside Chapel, Kings Cross, New South Wales, by (a) direct grants and (b) section 96 grants administered by the Department of Educadon in each of the last five financial years. (2) What will be the details for 1975-76.",116
249,Mr VINER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There is no record of any direct grants by the Department of Education to the Wayside Chapel, Kings Cross, New South Wales, during the last five financial years. (2) No grant is proposed. Mr Wallis asked the Minister for National Resources, upon notice: Are there any plans to exploit Philopson in South Australia; if so, what are those plans.",117
250,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Utah Development Company, ration licences, is committed to a program of examining the feasibility of development of the particularly in relation to power generation. The company reports on a regular basis to the Government of South Australia. As far as I am aware, there are currently no firm exploitation of the reserves. Trade with Arab Countries",117
251,Mr CONNOLLY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Overseas proceeding Trade, upon notice: Is it a fact that the Scarf Memorial Foundation cipal Australian organisation which trades with Arab countries and has been encouraged in its efforts by his Department.",117
252,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable in the past. member's question is as follows: I have noted that, inrecenttelevision interviews, the Leader of the Opposition has alluded Foundation as the principal Australian organisation which trades with Arab countries and the organisation which had, (Question No. 81) in effect, a monopoly of trading relations with the Arab countries. The Leader of the Opposition has also said that this organisauon was the instrument being encouraged by the Depanment of Overseas Trade to foster trade with Arab countries. I think it needs to be made quite clear that the Scarf Memorial Foundation is not the principal Australian organisation which trades with Arab countries nor does the Scarf Memorial Foundation have sole trading rights with Arab countries. Many Australian organisations trade with Arab countries. While the Foundation has been seeking to develop trade with a number of Arab countries, I understand that the Foundation has concentrated most of its efforts on trade with Iraq. Australian expons to Iraq in 1974-75 amounted to $45m, of which wheat accounted for $41m. The Wheat Board makes its own arrangements for sales of wheat to Iraq. Mr Scarf has received assistance from the Department of Overseas Trade and the Trade Commissioner Service in his Coal efforts to develop trade with Arab countries, but he has only been provided with the type of advice and assistance that (Question No. 122) would be afforded to any Australian businessman seeking to develop overseas markets. The Department will continue to assist Mr Scarf in the same way it would assist any other Australian exporter. the coal reserves at Lake School Cadets (Question No. 193) Mr O'Keefe asked the Minister for Defence, which holds the exploupon notice: (1) When will the School Cadet Training Scheme be Lake Phillipson reserves, reintroduced. (2) Will it be on the same lines as previously. (3) When will an official announcement be made as to the plans for date of commencement and details of the Scheme. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (Question No. 186) (1) On 25 January 19761 announced that plans were to be drawn up for a new system of Service Cadets. Planning is still and up until quite recently I have received a large number of quite substantial submissions from interested bodies. These submissions must be closely examined before is the prina new scheme is introduced. (2) The nature of the new scheme will be dependent upon the outcome of the present examination, however it will rely more heavily on voluntary support from the community than (3) An official announcement concerning the new scheme will be made as soon as practicable after the examination is to the Scarf Memorial completed.",117
