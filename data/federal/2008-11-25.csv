2,Ms GILLARD,Unknown,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I rise today one year on from the election of the Rudd Labor government to deliver on a promise Labor made to the Australian people. Today we deliver the creation of a new workplace relations system, one that allows Australia to grasp the promise of the future without forgetting the values that made us who and what we are. Over a century ago at Federation, Australians decided that we would be different to other nations-democratic, yes, with parliamentary institutions, judicial independence and individual rights similar to those of the other great democracies like the United Kingdom and the United States of America, but without their wide social inequalities. And our Australian version of fairness began with industrial relations: - with the concept of the living wage, determined first in the Harvester judgement; - with the idea that people's democratic rights don't cease when they step onto the factory, shop or office floor; - with the recognition of the need for time for family, relaxation and community; and - with an end to divisive industrial conflict. Before the November 2007 election, this set of values-which instil the essence of the Australian genius for fairness and enterprise-was attacked by the values contained in Work Choices. The philosophy that underpinned Work Choices said, essentially: make your own way in the world without the comfort of mateship, without the protections afforded by a compassionate society, against odds deliberately stacked against you-no safety net; no rights at work; no cooperation in the workplace to take the nation forward. More than anything else, the 2007 election was a contest between these two visions of what Australia should be. And in November 2007 the Australian people settled the matter once and for all. They chose to be true to the Australian ideal of a fair go. Their decision cost a Prime Minister not only his government but his seat in the House. They chose to reject Work Choices and all it stood for, and to put in its place the promises Labor made in its policy statement Forward with Fairness. They gave the Rudd government the strongest possible popular mandate for the introduction of this bill. One year on from our election, the Rudd government now delivers in full on these promises. The bill being introduced today is based on the enduring principle of fairness while meeting the needs of the modern age. It balances the interests of employers and employees and balances the granting of rights with the imposition of responsibilities. The bill delivers: - a fair and comprehensive safety net of minimum employment conditions that cannot be stripped away; - a system that has at its heart bargaining in good faith at the enterprise level, this is essential to maximise workplace cooperation, improve productivity and create rising national prosperity; - protections from unfair dismissal for employees; - protection and hope for a better future for the low paid; - a balance between work and family life; and - the right to be represented in the workplace. These rights are guaranteed by the legislabargaining tion and overseen by a new industrial umpire, Fair Work Australia, that will operate with independence and balance. Reflecting the government's commitment to cooperative workplace relations, this bill is the product of an unprecedented degree of consultation with employer and employee representatives and state and territory governments. One century on from Federation, and one year on from the election of the Rudd Labor government, this bill takes the Australian value of the fair go and builds around it a new workplace relations system ready to meet the needs of this nation in the 21st century. It is a good bill for employees, for employers, for families and for the economy. Only Labor could have introduced this bill because only Labor believes that the ideal of fairness should lie at the centre of our national life. This bill is shorter and simpler than Work Choices. It is easier to read and apply and it ments. is set out in six easy-to-follow parts. NA The principal object of the bill recognises Commission. the government's intention to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and proas ductive workplace relations that promotes national economic prosperity and social inclusion for all Australians. This bill guarantees a safety net of fair, all relevant and enforceable minimum terms and conditions for Australian workers that can no longer be undermined by the making of statutory individual employment agreements of any kind, given such agreements can never be part of a fair workplace relations system. The bill aims to achieve productivity and fairness through enterprise-level collective underpinned by the guaranteed safety net, simple good faith bargaining obligations and clear rules governing industrial action. This bill seeks to assist employees to balance their work and family responsibilities by providing for flexible arrangements. This bill ensures freedom of association and recognises that employees have the right to be represented at work by a union. The bill contains protections against discrimination. NA NA The safety net The bill provides for a comprehensive safety net of minimum wages and employment conditions that cannot be stripped away. The safety net is in two parts. The National Employment Standards comprise the 10 legislated employment conditions governing essential conditions such as weekly hours of work, leave, public holidays, notice and redundancy pay and the right to request flexible working arrangeModern awards are currently being developed by the Australian Industrial Relations Modern awards will build on the National Employment Standards and will cover a further 10 subject areas, including: minimum wages, arrangements for when work is performed, overtime and penalty rates, allowances, leave and leave loadings, superannuation and procedures for consultation, dispute resolution and the representation of employees. Individual flexibility arrangements The bill provides that each modern award must include a flexibility term to enable ployers and employees to negotiate an individual flexibility arrangement to meet their needs that may vary the application of specified award terms. The bill provides strict protections to ensure that any such individual agreement is entirely voluntary and that an employee cannot be disadvantaged. Modern awards and employees on high incomes The government recognises that awards have less relevance to employees earning high incomes. Under the bill, an employer and an employee who is guaranteed to earn more than $100,000, indexed, may enter a written guarantee that results in a modern award not applying. The bill includes a number of important protections to ensure employees enter such an arrangement voluntarily. Reviewing modern awards The bill requires Fair Work Australia to undertake four-yearly reviews of modern awards to ensure that they maintain a relevant and fair minimum safety net and continue to be relevant to the needs and expectations of the community. The bill allows adjustments to modern awards between the four-yearly reviews in limited circumstances, such as to deal with changes in the work value of classifications or to deal with pressing new circumstances affecting a particular award. Minimum wages The bill provides for minimum wages in modern awards to be reviewed every year by a specialist minimum wages panel within Fair Work Australia. The minimum wages in modern awards will override any lower rates in an enterprise agreement made under the bill. The bill also requires Fair Work Australia em- to make a national minimum wage order to provide minimum wages for all award-free employees. Special provisions for outworkers The government is aware that outworkers are an acutely at-risk sector of the Australian workforce and require special protections, so the bill ensures that awards may include special provisions dealing with outworkers. I also flag the government's intention to carefully examine the provisions of the bill concerning right of entry to investigate breaches of entitlements to ensure the bill provides an effective compliance regime for at-risk workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The government will seek necessary refinements to the bill concerning this matter through the Senate processes. Equal remuneration The bill strengthens the equal remuneration provisions to include the principle of equal remuneration for work of comparable value. Transfer of business The bill provides for a simpler and fairer scheme to deal with the transfer of employment rights and obligations if there is a ‘transfer of business' and a new employer takes on employees of the old employer. NA The bill provides a new framework for enterprise bargaining which does not use any concept of union or non-union agreements. Instead, an agreement is made when approved by a valid majority of the employees to whom it will apply. A union that acted as bargaining representative during the negotiations may apply to be covered by the agreement. This new framework is premised on good faith bargaining and recognises that most workplaces already bargain in good faith without any intervention. However, where this does not happen, the bill empowers Fair Work Australia to make orders to ensure compliance with the good faith bargaining requirements. Bargaining for single interest employers The principle category of bargaining is for single interest employers at the level of the enterprise. Single interest employers include joint ventures, common enterprises, related bodies corporate and employers specified in a single interest employer authorisation or declaration. A single interest employer authorisation or declaration can be made to bring certain very limited types of employers with a strong commonality of interest (such as franchisees of the same franchisor, ployers who receive substantial public funding) into this stream, but only where those employers seek to be allowed to bargain together. In the single interest bargaining stream, employees have the right to take protected industrial action. Employees may only take protected industrial action where they are genuinely trying to make agreements at the enterprise level. Pattern bargaining is not permitted. Fair Work Australia is empowered to make certain kinds of orders as part of its oversight of the bargaining process. Majority support orders Firstly, the bill provides that where an employer refuses to bargain with its employees an employee bargaining representative can ask Fair Work Australia to determine if there is majority employee support for negoa tiating an enterprise agreement. If so, the employer will be required to bargain collectively with its employees in good faith. Scope orders Secondly, the bill provides that Fair Work Australia may make a scope order if it is satisfied that bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement is not proceeding efficiently or fairly because the group of employees to whom a proposed agreement will apply has not been fairly chosen. Good faith bargaining orders Thirdly, the bill sets out good faith bargaining requirements that a bargaining representative for a proposed enterprise agreement must meet, including: attending, and participating in, meetings at reasonable times; disclosing relevant information; responding to proposals; giving genuine consideration to the proposals of others and giving reasons for responses to those proposals; and refraining from capricious or unfair conduct that undermines freedom of association or collecor em- tive bargaining. The bill specifies that the good faith bargaining requirements do not require a bargaining representative to make concessions during bargaining or to reach agreement on the terms that are to be included in the agreement. Parties are entitled to take a tough stance in negotiations. In the very unusual case where a negotiating party completely ignores good faith bargaining orders, the other party may apply to Fair Work Australia to intervene and to make a workplace determination. This will ensure there is no advantage to be gained by flouting the law. Multi-employer bargaining The bill provides that where employees and employers genuinely wish to bargain on a multi-employer basis they will be free to do so. Protected industrial action and good faith bargaining orders are not available in these circumstances. The bill provides it is unlawful to coerce an employer to make a multi-employer agreement or to discriminate against the employer if they do not make a multi-employer agreement or they have not made such an agreement. Bargaining for the low paid The bill provides a new scheme of bargaining for low-paid employees. There is significant evidence that enterprise bargaining benefits employees, employers and the economy and we want more Australians to benefit from it. Currently, many employees in industries like child care, community work, security and cleaning struggle to bargain effectively with their employers. To facilitate the entry of these types of employees and their employers into enterprise bargaining, the bill provides for a special lowpaid bargaining stream. Protected industrial action is not but Fair Work Australia will have the obligation to facilitate the making of agreements and will play a hands-on role to get the parties bargaining. For example, Fair Work Australia may convene and chair conferences, help to identify productivity improvements to underpin an agreement and generally guide the parties through the negotiating process. The bill provides for the possibility of a workplace determination in the low-paid stream in two circumstances: by agreement or if there is no reasonable prospect of an agreement being made. In the latter case, access to a workplace determination is subject to strict criteria, including that there is no enterprise agreement in place and that the employment conditions of the employees are substantially those set out in the safety net. When making a determination, Fair Work Australia must consider how productivity in the business may be improved and the need to maintain the competitiveness of the employer. Representation in bargaining The bill provides that employees are entitled to have their union represent them in bargaining or can appoint another person, such as a colleague. Employers may also appoint a bargaining representative. The bill also requires employers be required to give written notice to all employees of their right to be represented in the bargaining when the employer initiates bargaining or if a majority support determination, low-paid authorisation or a scope order is made. Agreement content The bill provides that all matters pertaining to the relationship between the employer and its employees, as well as to the relationship between the employer and a union representing those employees will be able to be available, the subject of bargaining. Agreements can also deal with the deduction of wages for any purpose authorised by the employee and contain terms dealing with how the agreement will operate. This means salary sacrifice and payroll deduction arrangements and terms setting out how the parties agree to conduct negotiations for a replacement agreement can now be included in agreements. The bill provides that only terms that are about the relationship between the employer and the employee will be able to be the subject of protected industrial action. For example, employees will not be permitted to take protected industrial action in pursuit of a claim that the employer should make a donation to a charity or should start to manufacture a particular product. Required agreement content The bill provides that, in order to be approved by Fair Work Australia, an enterprise agreement must contain: - a flexibility term that allows individual flexibility arrangements, subject to specified protections; - a dispute settlement process that must involve either Fair Work Australia or other person or body independent of the parties and that provides for the repre- tion. sentation of employees in the process; and - a term providing for consultation with employees about major workplace changes and that provides for the representation of employees in that process. Approval of agreements The bill provides that Fair Work Australia must not approve an agreement that includes terms that are inconsistent with unfair dismissal, right of entry, National Employment Standards and the general protection provisions of the act. Fair Work Australia must also be satisfied that: - the employer and a valid majority of the employees to whom the agreement will apply genuinely agree to the agreement; and - each employee would be better off overall under the agreement in comparison to the relevant modern award. Workplace determinations There are times when, despite their best efforts, parties cannot reach agreement. To assist the parties, the bill enables Fair Work Australia to exercise broad conciliation powers at the request of one of the parties. Provided the parties have bargained in good faith, the bill provides that they will be able to walk away without having a settlement imposed on them. Where the parties agree, the bill provides that Fair Work Australia may also make a binding determination on matters in dispute. In those limited circumstances where protected industrial action is occurring in a bargaining context that has a particularly negative or dangerous impact, the bill provides anscope for Fair Work Australia to resolve the dispute by making a workplace determinaFirstly, the bill incorporates the long standing capacity for a workplace determination to be made where industrial action is threatening (or would threaten) to endanger the life, personal safety or heath or welfare of the population or part of it or to cause significant damage to the economy. Secondly, a new ground in the bill for the making of a workplace determination is where protracted industrial action is causing significant economic harm to the bargaining participants, or such harm is imminent. This provision is intended to apply only to the very small number of disputes where industrial action continues for an extended period, where the employees and the employer suffer greatly and yet the parties are so entrenched in their positions that there is no prospect of a breakthrough in negotiations. NA General protections The bill incorporates the current provisions relating to freedom of association, unlawful termination and other miscellaneous protections into a streamlined and easyto-follow part titled ‘General protections'. In doing so, the bill provides more comprehensive protections for workers in some situations. The bill's general protections ensure that employees remain free to choose to be represented by a union, provide more comprehensive protections for those participating in collective activities such as representing other employees or bargaining. The bill provides sanctions where a person takes adverse action because someone exercises one of these rights. The bill will protect employees who are subject to adverse treatment because they have or seek to exercise a ‘workplace right' such as being entitled to the benefit of an award or agreement or making a complaint or inquiry. Employees with carer's responsibilities will also now be protected from discriminatory treatment. Unfair dismissal Under Work Choices, employees in businesses with up to 100 workers could be dismissed for any reason without rights to challenge the dismissal. This resulted in clear injustices and real feelings of insecurity for workers who realised they could be dismissed at any time for no reason. The bill provides a new scheme of unfair dismissal protections to ensure good employees are protected from being dismissed unfairly, while enabling employers to manage underperforming employees with fairness and with confidence. Employees of a small business will not be able to claim for unfair dismissal until after they have served a qualifying period of 12 months, while for larger businesses, the qualifying period is six months. ‘Operational reasons' will no longer be a defence to a claim of unfair dismissal. However, a dismissal is not unfair if it is for reasons of genuine redundancy. The bill recognises that small businesses do not have the human resources support that larger businesses enjoy. The bill provides for the publication of a simple Small Business Fair Dismissal Code which, if followed, will ensure a dismissal is not found to be unfair. The code requires the giving of a warning, based on a reason that validly relates to the employee's performance or capacity to do the job, and a reasonable opportunity for the employee to improve his or her performance. The code makes it clear the employer has the right to dismiss, without notice, an employee for serious misconduct. The process for Fair Work Australia dealing with unfair dismissal applications will be streamlined and simplified. Industrial action, secret ballots and strike pay The bill provides clear rules to govern industrial action. The bill distinguishes between protected industrial action which may legitimately occur during bargaining and unprotected industrial action taken outside of bargaining. The bill requires employees to approve industrial action through a secret ballot, while streamlining the ballot processes. When protected industrial action occurs, employers must deduct pay for the actual period of time the employee stopped work. If partial work bans are implemented, employers will be able to issue a notice and deduct a proportion of pay, with any disputes resolved by Fair Work Australia. The bill provides that pre-emptive lockouts taken by the employer when the employees have not taken any industrial action will no longer be protected. For unprotected industrial action, such as industrial action during the life of an agreement, the bill provides that employees will face a mandatory minimum deduction of four hours' pay. Right of entry The bill provides a fair and proper balance between the rights of employees and their union to meet in the workplace and the rights of employers to run their businesses without interference. The bill provides a right for members of a union that is eligible to represent their indusCourt trial interests (and potential members of that union) to meet with their union at the workplace during non-working hours for the purpose of holding discussions. No employee can be discriminated against for participating, or declining to participate, in such discussions. The bill provides that the right to enter premises to hold discussions comes with strict obligations, including the holding of a valid right of entry permit, the giving of 24 hours notice to enter and requirements for conduct while on site. Unions will continue to be able to investigate alleged breaches of workplace obligations that affect a member or members of the union. This right is subject to strict requirements. Unions will be able to look at and copy employment records of all employees but only where those records are relevant to the suspected breach being investigated. The bill includes new protections against misuse of information obtained by the union investigating suspected breaches. NA The bill establishes an integrated framework to oversee the new workplace relations system. Fair Work Australia The bill establishes Fair Work Australia to act as a one-stop shop for information, advice and assistance on workplace issues, by merging the functions currently performed across seven government agencies. Fair Work Australia will be independent and will be focused on providing fast and effective assistance for employers and employees. Fair Work Divisions of the courts Fair Work Divisions will be created in the Federal Court and the Federal Magistrate's to hear matters which arise under the new workplace relations laws. The courts will have new and more effective powers to deal with any breaches of the act and entitlements, including the power to make ‘any order they consider appropriate' to remedy a breach as well as injunctions to restrain breaches. A new user-friendly small claims jurisdiction will be provided where the court will not be bound by the rules of evidence and may act in an informal manner. Fair Work Ombudsman The bill establishes the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman, with functions including promoting harmonious and cooperative workplace relations and compliance by providing education, assistance and advice. NA It is intended that the bill will commence on 1 July 2009. However, consistent with election policy commitments, the National Employment Standards and modern awards will commence on 1 January 2010. Separate legislation, the transitional bill, will be introduced in the first half of 2009 to set out transitional and consequential changes to ensure a smooth, simple and fair transition to the new scheme, while providing for certainty. The transitional bill will: - ensure that an employee's take home pay is not reduced as a result of the employee's transition onto a modern award by allowing for Fair Work Australia to make orders to deal with any such matter; - provide that existing agreements will continue to apply until terminated or replaced by a new agreement made under the new bargaining framework; - ensure a fair safety net with the National Employment Standards and minimum wages applying to all employees from 1 January 2010, including those covered by existing agreements; and - allow parties to ‘modernise' enterprise awards so that they can continue to operate in the new system and treat Notional Agreements Preserving State Awards (NAPSAs) derived from state enterprise awards in the same way. NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE PRINA The bill will apply to ‘national system' employers and their employees, relying principally on the corporations power of the Constitution. The government is working with the states and territories to achieve a national workplace relations system for the private sector. The bill will exclude state and territory industrial laws but not in areas such as discrimination, workers compensation and occupational health and safety. NA This bill ensures balance and fairness in Australian workplaces. Work Choices made the mistake of swinging the workplace relations pendulum to the extreme, destroying the employment safety net and stripping away basic industrial rights for employees. With the introduction today of the Fair Work Bill, Work Choices is tantalisingly close to being gone forever, along with the careers of those who tried to foist it, without a mandate and without transparency, on an unwilling Australian people. The world is a lot different to the one in which Australia devised the original conciliation and arbitration system more than 100 years ago. Economic reform, globalisation, new technologies and rising levels of education have rendered the old ways obsolete. But in this new world, Australians voted for a workplace relations system that delivers a fair go, the benefits of mateship at work, a decent safety net and a fair way of striking a bargain. That is what this bill does. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Southcott) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (LUXURY CAR TAX-MINOR AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bowen. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
3,Mr BOWEN,CONCLUSION,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (1.52 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill that I am introducing today makes minor and technical amendments to the A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999, the Taxation Administration Act 1953, and the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Act 2008. These amendments will ensure that amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (Luxury Car Tax) Act passed earlier this year operate as intended. These amendments are intended to clarify the operation of the law. First, they will ensure that luxury car tax refunds are payable to eligible businesses where they actually bear the cost of the luxury car tax regardless of the arrangement used to finance the vehicle. Second, they will ensure that contracts entered into before 7.30 pm Australian eastern standard time on 13 May 2008 are the relevant contracts for determining the luxury car tax rate of 25 per cent, when subsequent financing arrangements are made. And, third, they will put beyond doubt that luxury car tax refunds are paid directly to claimants. In the 2008-09 budget the government took a decision to increase the luxury car tax rate from 25 per cent to 33 per cent with effect from 1 July 2008 as part of the Rudd government's plans to make the taxation system fairer and contribute to a strong fiscal position. It is because we made those hard yards in the budget to build a strong surplus that we now have the flexibility to respond to emerging international circumstances. The increase was passed by the parliament in September with a number of amendments from non-government senators. The technical amendments I am introducing today will clarify the law to ensure that these amendments operate as intended. These amendments are required to provide clarity and certainty to car buyers, finance companies and car dealers and I strongly urge the opposition to support the bill. Full details of this bill are contained explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Southcott) adjourned. FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY NA NA AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
4,Ms MACKLIN,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (1.56 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is to make minor and technical amendments to several acts within the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and related portfolios. In particular, the bill makes minor amendments to the social security law and the family assistance law to improve the operation and effectiveness of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (known as the SSAT). Firstly, the bill will allow the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to give oral reasons on ‘affirmed' social security and family assistance cases-that is, review cases that affirm the decision made by Centrelink. This will bring those jurisdictions more closely into line with that which applies to child support, where the Social Security Appeals Tribunal does have the option of giving reasons orally to the parties. As in the child support sphere, the oral decision arrangements will be subject to the right of the parties to request writin the ten reasons if they prefer. Secondly, amendments will allow Centrelink to make oral submissions to Social Security Appeals Tribunal hearings. At present, Centrelink may make written submissions to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, but not oral submissions. However, again, the child support Social Security Appeals Tribunal arrangements are somewhat different. These allow the Child Support Agency to ask the SSAT for permission to make oral submissions at an SSAT hearing, and also allow the SSAT to order the agency to make oral submissions. We anticipate that this new power to allow or direct oral submissions in social security and family assistance reviews will be used in complex cases where further explanation may clarify a complicated or technical matter and help the SSAT to reach the correct or preferable decision. The facility to allow or direct oral submissions will help to avoid costly and inefficient adjournments. The social security and family assistance Social Security Appeals Tribunal arrangements will gain this flexible and efficient aspect of the child support system of review and appeals through this bill. Thirdly, amendments will allow SSAT members to be appointed for a term of up to five years, in place of the currently allowed term of up to three years. The change will bring the SSAT into line with government policy that appointments of statutory office holders are generally to be made for a period of five years for reasons of stability, efficiency and good governance. The bill also makes technical amendments to several acts, primarily the social security law, to repeal redundant provisions, or referdid ences to redundant payments or repealed provisions, to correct cross-references, to correct misdescribed amendments and address similar matters. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hockey) adjourned.",26
5,The SPEAKER,AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2 pm, business is interrupted under the relevant standing order. NA Banking",27
6,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Given the government has now adopted the coalition's position on an appropriation bill to back the bank wholesale funding guarantee to ensure millions of customers in Australia fully benefit through lower interest rates, fees and charges, will the government now act to fix its bungled deposit guarantee and listen to Australia's leading bankers, who insist the cap must be cut to as low as $100,000 as soon as possible? Mr Tanner-Have you seen the front page of the Fin?",27
7,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am reminded by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that, whilst the Financial Review is important to read every day, it is particularly excellent reading today. I recommend it to members of the House generally. Mr Hockey-You wrote it!",27
8,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney no doubt insults the editor of the Financial Review with that remark. On the question that the Leader of the Opposition raises with me, on 12 October this year the government moved quickly and decisively to ensure confidence in the banking system. We that in an environment where international competitors were moving. The Leader of the Opposition knows if we had not acted our banking system would have been seen as second class internationally. We made that decision on 12 October. We have acted to implement that decision. Every step of the way we have been dealing and consulting with people in the financial services sector and, of course, with our regulatory authorities. The Leader of the Opposition has had several positions-indeed, dozens of positions-since the day on which we acted. Some days he is in favour of the bank guarantee and the actions we took. Some days, in fact, he is so in favour of it that it is his Other days he seeks to undermine confidence in the actions taken by the government and implies that had he been Prime Minister the action would not have been taken. Well, he cannot have it all ways. The government will continue on the course that it has set. Workplace Relations Mrs D'ATH (2.03 pm)-My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister update the House on the importance of a fair workplace relations system, especially for those in low-paid employment?",27
9,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for her contribution in the development of the legislation that is before the House today. Twelve months ago the Australian people spoke out about what type of workplace relations system they wanted. They spoke clearly in favour of the Australian value of fairness and against the divisive, unfair and extreme workplace relations system championed by the Liberal Party-by those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, who voted in favour of it more than a dozen times. Just a short time ago, the Rudd government introduced its Fair Work Bill into the parliament to give legislative embodiment to the value of fairness in workplace relations in this country. The bill brings into this parliament in the form of legislation the policy we took to the Australian people at the last election. That policy is Labor's Forward with Fairness, and it has been endorsed by the Australian people and brought into the parliament today in the form of the Fair Work Bill. The level of consultation on the bill brought into this parliament today is unprecedented. I particularly take this opportunity to thank those stakeholders who have played a crucial role in the government's idea. consultative process. I particularly mention the members of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council's committee on industrial legislation, which includes members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Master Builders. I also mention the work of the Business Advisory Group and the Small Business Working Group, and I thank John Denton of Corrs Chambers Westgarth for his work in chairing the Business Advisory Group. I also thank those members of Labor's caucus who played such an important role in the development of this bill and the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy for his consultation with the small business constituency. At the heart of Forward with Fairness is an enterprise bargaining system and a safety net that working people can rely on that cannot be stripped away. This bill contains a special development in the workplace relations law of this country-that is, a special set of provisions for the low paid. There are around 100,000 adults who are currently earning the federal minimum wage, which is about $543 a week. It is not a lot of money; I think we would all agree with that. Low-paid workers who receive this kind of money work in child care, community work, security and cleaning. We want to facilitate their entry into the world of enterprise bargaining. We want to make sure that there is a special bargaining stream for the low paid. Their bargaining will be able to happen at a multiemployer level, and Fair Work Australia will play a hands-on role in helping the bargaining. In those limited circumstances where despite the best efforts of Fair Work Australia the parties cannot reach agreement, Fair Work Australia will be able to step in and make a workplace determination. This is for special cases and only for low-paid workers, and it occurs where the parties have never had an enterprise agreement and the employers are substantially on the safety net. It is new step forward in fairness in workplace relations. I have noticed that some have sought to mischaracterise this in the public domain. I say to those involved in that mischaracterisation: are they seriously going to argue to the Australian people that low-paid workers substantially reliant on the safety net do not serve a helping hand? The Fair Work Bill is good for employees, employers, families and the economy. It is delivering what Labor promised at the last election and what the Australian people voted for right around this nation. Banking",28
10,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's statement on 23 October that those depositors in managed investment funds adversely affected by the government's bank guarantee go to Centrelink. How many depositors affected by the bank guarantee have inquired about receiving assistance from Centrelink and, of those, how many have actually received any payments?",29
11,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. I did not say that all people in managed investment funds who were experiencing problems should go to Centrelink. What I said was that those that were experiencing hardship may, if there were a reassessment of their position by Centrelink, be eligible for some support-which, of course, was a question that had been asked in the House that week by a member down there, the member for Moncrieff. I made a very logical point that those who are impacted upon by the current state of the economy in terms of their investments may be experiencing hardships and one avenue that was open to them was, of course, to seek a re-evaluation of their situation from Centrelink. We are actually proud of Centrelink on a this side of the House. It does provide a lot of support to a lot of Australians, particularly when they experience difficulty. But that point was not made as a substitute for anything else other than to say that if they had hardship, that was one possibility. The government is attending to the issues when it comes to managed investments. Inde- deed, we work with the regulators, as we have been working with the regulators all of the way through, and our advisers in the Treasury to ensure that all of those people out there that are the subject of an influence from the global financial crisis in the way in which it impacts on their assets are looked after. What we have done through the Treasury and through David Murray is that we have a series of task forces in the Treasury working with the various industry associations. Whether it comes to car finance, whether it comes to mortgage trusts or whether it comes to cash management trusts, these are very serious issues. Of course, what the opposition will not admit and cannot admit-because they do not understand the magnitude of the global financial crisis-is that, when we introduced the deposit guarantee to protect 13 million depositors in this country, they should have supported it. On the day, they promised bipartisan support, and it took about 24 hours before they were junking it in public-24 hours-because they do not understand the seriousness of the situation; they simply do not get the seriousness of the global financial crisis. We on this side of the House are proud that we acted decisively and swiftly to put in place the deposit guarantee and the wholesale term funding guarantee, because it is absolutely essential to the financial stability of this economy-and it remains so. That is why it is so regrettable that we have seen so much short-term point-scoring and politicking from those on the other side of the House, who do not understand the importance of financial stability. We do, and we are working with our regulators in terms of the deposit guarantee and the wholesale funding guarantee to ensure that it produces the maximum results for the Australian people. We will not be diverted by the political point-scoring from those on the other side, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who does not seem to understand the importance of the deposit guarantee. His policy is to put a cap on the deposit guarantee of $100,000. I could not think of anything more destructive than that proposal because that would leave 40 per cent of deposits out of the guarantee-the most liquid deposits in the banking system. He cannot really support our measure because he does not understand the magnitude of the crisis that we are facing and the measures that are required to put stability in the system. Ms Julie Bishop-As the four-page interview will not be found anywhere on the Treasurer's website, I seek leave to tender the transcript of 23 October. Leave not granted. NA",29
12,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of the Namibian parliament.

13,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister detail the government's commitment to providing fairness for working Australians by the abolition of individual statutory agreements? Are there any barriers to providing this fairness?,30
14,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his assistance with the development of the Fair Work Bill, introduced into the parliament today. Labor acted at the start of this year to end the making of Australian workplace agreements. Our new Fair Work Bill has no place for Australian workplace agreements or individual statutory employment agreements of any kind. In fact, when you look at the objects of the act, you will see one of the objects is to have a system without individual statutory employment agreements, and the object indicates that such agreements are not consistent with having a fair and decent workplace relations system. We know that, under Work Choices, Australian workplace agreements were the heart of the rip-offs-the heart of the rip-offs of penalty rates; the heart of the rip-offs of overtime-and the statistics clearly showed it and were available to members of the Liberal Party who now sit on the opposition benches, including the opposition front bench, and the Leader of the Opposition sitting in the leader's chair. He would have known, as he supported Work Choices as a member of the Howard government, that 64 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut annual leave loading, 63 per cent cut penalty rates, 52 per cent cut shift loadings, 51 per cent cut overtime and 46 per cent cut public holiday pay-statistics known to him but, despite that, he supported Work Choices. Now decision day is coming for the Liberal Party. One of the most startling things yesterday about the address to the National Press Club by the Leader of the Opposition is that he declared boldly that if he were Prime Minister of this country he would answer questions-only to find that in the office of Leader of the Opposition he was unable to do so. A very significant question was put to him three times by three different journalists, and that was: what is his position on individual statutory employment agreements? He did not answer it-three times, questions without answers. Well, decision day is coming for the Leader of the Opposition. He will have to decide what he believes on individual statutory employment agreements. Of course, we know if we judge him-as one should-on what he has done that he has come into this parliament day after day as a member of the Howard government and voted for the rip-offs-voted for the individual statutory employment agreements. And we know that across the Liberal Party support for this kind of extremism is strong. On 8 February this year a senior front-bench member of the Liberal Party was quoted in the West Australian newspaper as saying: We are prepared to die in the ditch over individual statutory workplace agreements. And not many weeks ago the deputy Liberal leader said statutory individual contracts ‘must form part of a modern workplace relations system'. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",30
15,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘Of course,' she is saying. She is verifying that individual statutory employment agreements are still Liberal policy. Well, that may be the policy of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but the person we want to answer the question is the Leader of the Opposition. Will he verify that statutory employment agreements are still part of the Liberal Party's policy or will he keep ducking the question? I have got news for him: when it comes to voting on this bill, which we will do in this House of Representatives before parliament rises at the end of the year, he has got a decision to make. And that decision will include making a policy decision on individual statutory employment agreements, because the objects of this act state that such agreements are not compatible with a fair and decent workplace relations system. For a man who says that he wants to answer questions, so far we have heard deafening silence. We are waiting for the answer. But, of course, we know, if he is truthful to what he believes in and what he has voted for before, he will say that he endorses industrial relations extremism-he endorses rip-offs-because in this parliament he already has. Banking",31
16,Mr BRIGGS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to two of my constituents, Mr and Mrs Goldner, who have had their cash management account frozen following the government's announcement of the bank deposit guarantee. Mr and Mrs Goldner had purchased a block of land on Hindmarsh Island and commenced building. They were due to pay the builder but cannot because their account has been frozen. What is the government doing to fix its policy and ensure that the Goldners and the almost 300,000 Australians who have had their funds frozen have access to their money?",31

18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will resume his seat. I would suggest to the member for Indi that others are.,31
19,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mayo for his question. There is certainly a difficult situation for many out there who have investments in the non-deposit-taking institutions. Those are investments that were made by people looking for a higher return and they are investments in funds which are certainly very worthy funds-very worthy investments-but to attribute all of the impact on the non-ADI sector to the bank guarantee is simply wrong and inaccurate. It has certainly been a factor and it has had an influence, but to attribute problems to do with mortgage trusts and all the rest of it solely the bank guarantee is just wrong and inaccurate. I do not know what the member is arguing but, if he is arguing that we should extend the guarantee to all of those nondeposit-taking institutions, that is not something the government can responsibly do. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The Treasurer is asking what the member had asked for. It was: what are you going to do?",31
20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Dickson will resume his seat. The Treasurer is responding to the question.,32
21,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What we are doing about it is that we are working with the various industry organisations to find solutions. There are no instantaneous solutions to investments in the market linked sector. They are not banks. They are not subject to the guarantee. People have made those investments and there are now adverse market outcomes, which we recognise. If you want to attribute all the blame for that to the government, go ahead. But the truth is there is a bigger lem out there which needs to be solved, and this government is working with our regulators-whether it is car finance, cash management trusts or mortgage trusts-on a sectoral basis to find solutions. There have been some practical solutions so far and I hope to see further progress as we go through. But, if those on that side of the House want to pretend there is some magic wand a government can wave and suddenly the whole impact of the global financial crisis is simply washed away in terms of these market linked investments, they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land.

23,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on forecasts for emerging economies and actions taken by governments in recent days to respond to the global financial crisis?,32
24,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. The upheaval in global financial markets is, of course, now impacting not only on developed countries but on developing countries. We have seen this most dramatically in the IMF regional outlook that was produced overnight. As we are aware, the global crisis has already delivered a recession in Europe and Japan, and the IMF is now predicting recessions in the US and the prob- UK. The IMF regional economic outlook released overnight has this to say: With the crisis intensifying in industrial countries, strains have spread to emerging markets. These markets, which for a while had seemed relatively insulated from the crisis, are now reeling as investors fly to safety in a context of deep uncertainty about global growth prospects. So the IMF has downgraded growth in our region to 4.9 per cent over 2009, which is well below the 7.6 per cent growth experienced last year. This is why there is now a growing international consensus that coordinated, decisive and strong action to strengthen growth is absolutely critical in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. The IMF said this overnight: … policymakers in Asia need to be ready to react decisively to maintain financial stability and port growth. This is what the Rudd government has done. It has done it with its $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, it has done it with its guarantees on deposits and it has done it with its wholesale term funding guarantees. Our strategy is expected to boost growth by one-half to one per cent and help to create up to 75,000 additional jobs. Other governments around the world are also moving. Overnight, the UK government announced a fiscal stimulus package of about one per cent of GDP. We certainly welcome the UK government's efforts to support growth. Other governments are moving as well. It is very important that governments around the world move on a coordinated basis. Mr Hockey interjecting",32
25,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But, as the member for North Sydney indicates again, those opposite simply have not got a clue about the magnitude of this crisis, its consequences for this economy or what solutions need to be put in place to deal with it. They simply have no idea of the magnitude of the challenge. But, whatever short-term politics they want to play, we on this side of the House will defend the national interest to strengthen our economy, to assist households and to assist businesses, because we are in the middle of an unprecedented global event and we must do everything within our power, using all the tools of policy, to strengthen our economy, and that is what we are doing. Economy",33
26,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer him to a statement by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation on Lateline last night when he was asked, ‘What does the government mean when it talks about a budget surplus “over the cycle”?' He said: supIt doesn't imply a specific cycle because economic cycles over time vary in the period of time which they relate towhatever that means. Treasurer, exactly what does the government mean when it says it will run a surplus over the economic cycle? Isn't the definition of the budget cycle surpluses under the coalition and deficits under the Labor Party?",33
27,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a pleasure to have the member for North Sydney in the House. It was only yesterday that we had the report from Access Economics reflecting upon the stewardship of the member for North Sydney and the member for Higgins. What it said was that they, in a colourful way, wasted the good years from the commodity boom and they did not do enough to strengthen the economy for when the economy turned down. That was the conclusion of Access Economics. They wasted the fruits of the commodity boom and did not make the necessary investments in infrastructure and education. What they did was to go on a spending spree at the top of the cycle. What the cycle is about is that, in the good times, you save and, when the times turn down, you spend and invest. That is what it is about, and that is what our Economic Security Strategy is about. The world has changed and, because we put in place a strong surplus in the last budget, we had the flexibility to respond to the change in global conditions-and respond we did, with a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. Now we have for the first time, unlike under the coalition, fiscal policy and monetary policy working in tandem. What was happening under the coalition was that they were working in opposite directions. So this government is responding to the global challenges. We are using the surplus that we built in the last budget to strengthen our economy. What the Minister for Finance and Deregulation said when he was talking about a cycle was precisely what we are doing. Workplace Relations",33

31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fan club will settle down.,34
32,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I could thank the member for Robertson for her question and for the good work that she does with the Gosford Chamber of Commerce, where I attended a meeting about a year ago. It was a very good meeting, and she works very well and strongly in representing the interests of small business in her electorate. In Forward with Fairness, the government committed to tearing up Work Choices and introducing a fair, simple and flexible indusThe trial relations system. For small business owners, Work Choices was anything but simple and flexible. For example, the so called fairness test was a red-tape nightmare for small businesses. In fact, there was a backlog about this time a year ago of more than 150,000 agreements awaiting final assessment. Under the government's changes, awards and agreements will have special flexibility clauses enabling small businesses and their employees to tailor working conditions to their personal circumstances, subject appreciated. of course to a proper, decent and effective safety net. The Rudd government is keeping its election commitment to provide basic protection for good employees from being dismissed unfairly while allowing business owners to manage their workforce according to their commercial needs. To enable small business owners to dismiss staff fairly, the government has developed a simple, six-paragraph fair dismissal code. If the employer follows the code then the dismissal will be deemed fair. Of course, genuine redundancies are excluded from the unfair dismissal laws. A number of small business organisations have provided comment on the fair dismissal code and the system that we have put in place. COSBOA, a peak small business organisation, in a press release headed ‘Fair dismissal code acceptance' said: Small business can be pleased with the outcome … The Australian Industry Group said: The Fair Dismissal Code for small businesses will be short and easily applied. So there is a good endorsement. The National Farmers Federation indicated their support with the media release entitled ‘Farmers sign off on Govt's “Fair Dismissal Code”'. It stated: National Farmers' Federation … endorsed the Australian Government's Fair Dismissal Code … as ‘striking a sensible, practical balance for employers and employees'. Here are a couple of others. In a letter to me, the Master Builders said: Master Builders is supportive of the Fair Dismissal provisions because it recognises the particular circumstances that small business faces in the engagement of staff. Your Government's commitment in recognising the needs of small business in relation to employment is very much The Pharmacy Guild of Australia said: On behalf of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. I wish to congratulate you and the Government on the sensible approach taken in finalising the Dismissal Code. They are pretty solid endorsements, but we do not have any such endorsements from the coalition. In fact, the shadow Treasurer, as recently as September, said in a speechwhich is very difficult to find; in fact, impossible to findA government member-Who wrote it?",34
33,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not sure who wrote because we cannot find it. The shadow Treasurer and the deputy Liberal leader said on unfair dismissals that the opposition would resist any move to turn back the clock. It would be very interesting to see if we can get an answer. Maybe it will come from the fourth question from the Leader of the Opposition on what his view is. An article by SmartCompany said of the shadow small business minister: Opposing Labor's plan to remove the unfair dismissal exemption for SMEs will be the first ity for new opposition small business spokesman Steven Ciobo. The article went on to say: Ciobo says any attempt by Labor to cut down the 100 employee threshold for exemption from unfair dismissal laws will receive his ‘absolute and confirmed opposition'. So the truth is that as far as the coalition is concerned Work Choices is not dead; it is just resting, pining for the fjords. The Liberal Party was, is and always will be the party of Work Choices. The Rudd Labor government is the party of a fair, flexible and decent industrial relations system in this country. Economy",35

We are proud of them. The legislation, I think, is in the House, is it not? The legislation is in the House and, when it passes, the funds will be deposited and we can engage in a conversapriortion with the Australian people about how we are going to build the nation and invest in infrastructure, unlike those opposite who did not invest in critical economic infrastructure. They left it all to the states and they did nothing. This weekend, we have a COAG meeting where we are getting together with the state governments for a fundamental reform of federal-state relations. Front and centre of that is infrastructure, which is absolutely critical to this country as we build our wealth creation capacity and make up for the wasted years under Howard and Costello-the wasted years that Access Economics was talking aboutMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance.

43,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on responses to the government's Economic Security Strategy payments?",36
44,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. She certainly has a very real concern for and gives great support to, particularly, the pensioners in her electorate. Last night was a very good night for two million families and four million pensioners, carers, people with a disability and veterans. The Economic Security Strategy bill passed the parliament. From 8 December, in just a very short period of time, single pensioners will receive $1,400 each, pensioner couples will receive $2,100 and families will receive $1,000 for each eligible child. Of course, it is the case that these tralians who have been doing it tough are counting on these payments. I have had some recent calls and letters from pensioners, who have said the following things to me. One, an age pensioner, has written, ‘I can now meet all of my bills and have Christmas dinner for my family for the first time in years.' A disability pensioner rang me the other day in tears. He can now fly to see his son for Christmas and buy him a decent Christmas present. These pensioners and so many other Australians have been doing it tough and we know that they deserve a helping hand. Unfortunately, it seems that not everybody on the other side of the House agrees with this, even though they promised that there would not be any quibbling about these important payments. Despite promising to support them, some of them just cannot manage it. We know that, as usual, Australians should judge the Leader of the Opposition by what he does, not by what he says. But I think he should go and have a look at what the Leader of the National Party in the Senate had to say about this legislation last night. This is what Senator Joyce said in the Senate: … I think I have been consistent-and I speak on behalf of some of my colleagues-in saying that I do not agree with this package. Which colleagues? Which colleagues is he speaking about? Who else on that side of the House does not want these payments to go to pensioners, carers and families? You would have thought that at this point we would have had either the Leader of the Opposition jumping up to speak or even maybe the member for Warringah. He, of course, might have jumped up to defend families and pensioners. Mr Turnbull interjecting",36
45,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, the Leader of the Opposition says that he has not had Ausany opportunity to make any public statement anywhere in the mediaGovernment members-The Press Club!",36
46,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That's right! He was at the Press Club yesterday. He obviously has no idea what his coalition colleagues are doing in the Senate. We understand that there are a few other colleagues who do not agree with these payments. So it is some leadership that he is showing-getting out there and demonstrating what on earth it is that the opposition actually thinks about these payments. They do have a shadow minister over there who, you might have thought, might have defended the interests of pensioners and families. Unfortunately, the member for Warringah thinks that the job he has got is beneath him. When the latest Leader of the Opposition was actually elected by those opposite, the member for Warringah went out into the media and said that he wanted a change of portfolio because he did not think that this portfolio was the main game. That is what he is saying to pensioners and to families. Last night, in yet another insult tralian families and pensioners, the member for Warringah told Laurie Oakes on Channel 9 that he had ‘nothing better to do than turn up for media interviews'. Nothing better to do! He cannot get out there and talk to pensioners and families and stand up for their interests. The member for Warringah has no interest in developing policy, as the Acting Prime MinisterMr Randall- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: how can a personal attack on the member for Warringah be relevant to the question that was asked?",36
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question was to do with the responses to the economic security payments. The minister will relate her remarks to the question.,37
48,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I say this to the member for Warringah: if you are not prepared to stand up for the interests of pensioners and families maybe it is time to get another job. Broadband,37
49,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. I refer the minister to the government's pre-election pledge to begin construction of a national broadband network by the end of this year and the decision to abolish the $2 billion Communications Fund established by the previous coalition government to future-proof rural and regional telecommunications services. Minister, when will the government deliver on its broadband promises to regional households and businesses and what arrangements has the government put in place to deliver emerging technology to rural and regional communities in perpetuity?",37
50,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was hopeful I might get a question in my portfolio of regional to Ausdevelopment, but of course the National Party are not interested-they have vacated that particular field. I am asked about the government's commitment to the national broadband network, and I am happy to answer. The fact is that we are moving on delivering our commitment during the election campaign where we promised to allocate some $4.7 billion to roll out the national broadband network. The shadow minister knows that proposals are due tomorrow, 26 November, and therefore it certainly would not be appropriate to speculate on that process, as the Deputy Prime Minister did not yesterday. Queensland Storms",37
51,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney General update the House on the recent devastating storms in Queensland and the government's response?,37
52,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question and thank him also for his tireless work on behalf of his community and for keeping in touch during the course of last week. While I am at it could I also recognise in particular the work of the member for Brisbane, the member for Flynn and also the member for Ryan, who joined me on a site visit last week. All of them and indeed other members have done tremendous work in support of their local communities. Last week the Prime Minister and I, and indeed Senator Ludwig-who spent the best part of last week assisting, in his endeavours, the community operations-had the opportunity to visit and see first hand the devastation caused by the severe storms in South East Queensland. I am pleased to say that the federal government has been able to assist in a number of respects. We are working very closely with the Bligh government. I commend the work of Premier Bligh, which has been outstanding, along with the work of one of those unsung heroes, Neil Roberts, the Queensland Minister for Emergency Services; he has also done an outstanding job. Under the Commonwealth Government Disaster Response Plan through Emergency Management Australia, I was able to authorise the Queensland government's request to provide 700 defence personnel. They did an outstanding job. I had the opportunity to meet with a number of those personnel. They were instrumental in clearing debris from powerlines, restoring power to infrastructure and to local homes and doing a lot of work securing roofs. I am very pleased to say that, along with the volunteers generally, the ADF in particular were clearly local heroes. They were blessed with donations of cakes, sandwiches and the odd can of beer after their duties. We were also in that context able to provide some 2,800 tarpaulins, and I would like to recognise AusAID for their contribution to that effort. Under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, we have recognised 13 local government areas for the purposes of personal hardship and distress grants. Those grants can be accessed through the Queensland Department of Communities. For the record, the telephone number is 1800173349. Under the Australian government disaster recovery payment, administered through my colleague the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, we are providing one-off payments to individuals affected: $1,000 for adults and $400 for children. The hotline for that grant is 1802266. Today I am pleased to be able to announce that the federal government is providing an additional $500,000 to match the contribution of the Queensland government to the Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal. That will significantly supplement a number of generous contributions from individuals and also corporations. While this has obviously been tremendously devastating and traumatic for the local communities, it has been an excellent example of governments and indeed the community working together. At the place that I visited with the members for Ryan and Brisbane, we saw a community centre where all government agencies had been brought together. The Red Cross was also there, along with insurance companies assisting to process claims. While, in summary, the storms have been devastating, this really is an example of an ability to bounce back, to have resilient communities, and I would certainly commend and congratulate all those involved. Trade: Banana Imports",37
53,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that Biosecurity Australia have endorsed the import risk assessment on bananas that states that there is no substantive risk sufficient to stop Filipino bananas from coming to Australia? Is the Acting Prime Minister also aware that, since Filipino agricultural wages are $4 a day and our award is $17.50 an hour, Biosecurity's decision will therefore result in 6,000 jobs in the banana industry vanishing, 2,000 jobs in northern New South Wales and Far North Queensland backpacker tourism vanishing, and a loss to the Australian economy of $400 million a year? Further, does the Prime Minister believe that anyone would accept that 20 million cartons of bananas will come into Australia but not a single microspore of the Philippine's 23 contagious diseases? Finally, in light of these dangers and the dangers of diseases and pests to our native flora and fauna, which currently occasion all plant material to be confiscated at airports, would the Acting Prime Minister not agree that allowing 300,000 tonnes of plant material in, with at most only 10,000 tonnes being inspected, is a decision that should at least delayed",38

I know that his concern on behalf of local banana growers in his electorate and his part of Queensland is a very sincere one. I absolutely appreciate it is a sincere concern and that is why he has raised the matter in the House today. I can advise the member for Kennedy and the House that Biosecurity Australia has issued a final import risk analysis report on bananas from the Philippines and that is open to appeal until 12 December-that is, open to appeal for 30 days from the day of the decision. I think it is very important to note that the import risk analysis process is transparent, a scientific assessment and independent of government. Mr Katter-No, it's not even remotely any of those things.",39
61,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, it is independent of government. It is reviewed through public consultation and through the scrutiny of an Eminent Scientists Group. We do take in this country a conservative approach to quaranbe tine, as we should, and the import risk analysis proposes that bananas only enter Australia under strict quarantine measures relating to seven groups of pests of quarantine concern. These measures include sourcing bananas from demonstrated low-pest areas, field inspections and auditing by AQIS, disinfection treatments and mandatory preclearance of fruit by AQIS inspectors in the Philippines. In particular, AQIS officers will be involved in inspecting, verifying and auditing systems and processes in the Philippines both before and during the exporting of bananas. There will be a mandatory pre-clearance arrangement, with the presence and involvement of AQIS inspectors in the Philippines, in applying quarantine conditions in the field, including in packing houses. There will also be audit and verification by AQIS of systems and processes used by the Philippines to certify any exports, and Philippines exporters will be responsible for reimbursing the full cost of AQIS inspections. In addition, there will need to be a combination of laboratory and field experiments prior to exports occurring. I understand that this is a matter that deeply concerns the member for Kennedy and I understand he is representing the concerns of his constituents. This is a process independent of government-a transparent process, a process of scientific assessment and a process that involves the scrutiny of the Eminent Scientists Group. The matter is open for appeal until 12 December. Mr Katter- Mr Speaker, I have a followup question.",39
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, I indicate to the member for Kennedy that earlier in the year I made my position known on supplementary questions. The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. I note for the record that when there is a question of one minute 36 seconds I do not really think a supplementary question would be required. Mr Katter- Mr Speaker, there's a fair amount of substance in that question. United Kingdom",40
63,Mr ZAPPIA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask: will the minister report on how Australia is taking forward its security and defence relationship with the United Kingdom?,40
64,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. The bilateral relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom is one of our most significant. It is at the front line of our international relationKofi ships. It is of course a relationship built on history, but in the modern era it is built on people-to-people contact; a couple of centuries of trade and diplomacy; and importantly, and this is underappreciated, very significant links so far as security, strategic and defence interests are concerned. One of the attributes of the relationship which reflects that security, strategic and defence relationship is the Australia-United Kingdom ministerial meeting, or AUKMIN as it is called. Tomorrow I will travel to the United Kingdom to attend the second AUKMIN meeting, together with Minister Fitzgibbon, the Minister for Defence, who will be arriving in the United Kingdom following the meeting of defence ministers at the southern regional command in Afghanistan. The meeting will be attended by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr Miliband, and the Secretary of State for Defence, Mr Hutton. We will examine the array of mutual interests that we have in our significant international interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the significant interest we have so far as non-proliferation is concerned, particularly in the nuclear area, with Iran and North Korea. One of the bilateral matters that I will be taking up with my counterpart, Foreign Secretary Miliband, is of course Australia and the United Kingdom's shared interest in Zimbabwe. The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom have both been at the forefront of international efforts to seek to bring about democracy, the rule of law, and better economic and social circumstances in Zimbabwe. We are increasingly concerned that, a month or so after a compact between Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Mugabe, a government of national unity has not yet been effected. We are very concerned that the so-called elders group of Jimmy Carter, the former President of the United States; Annan, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, and others was effectively excluded from Zimbabwe in recent days. The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is now very acute. Today I have announced that Australia will provide an additional $8 million of immediate humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. Six million dollars of this will be for emergency food assistance through the World Food Program and $2 million will be for non-government organisations for food and sanitation purposes, particularly given the outbreak of cholera that we have seen in recent days. So the relationship that we have with the United Kingdom is one of those relationships that we have at the front line of our international relationships, and that is reflected by not just our interest in the humanitarian and political situation in Zimbabwe but also our security, strategic and defence arrangements internationally. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on indulgence, could I congratulate the minister for continuing this important initiative of the Howard government. I just wonder why the Prime Minister is not there!",40
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, the member for Warringah will resume his seat. Can I say that I really do have under consideration the indulgences that are being granted. I am open to receiving comments from members, but I think you would find that in the past main indulgences have been given to the Leader of the Opposition. I am really considering whether that is the appropriate way of doing things, because that would prevent stunts like the member for Warringah's. Border Security",41
66,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a defence question for the Acting Prime Minister. Acting Prime Minister, what assurances can the government give to the Australian people that Australia's borders will be properly tected from illegal immigrants, illegal fishers and drug runners when the Navy closes down for two months over Christmas?",41
67,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, but can I reassure the member-and anybody else who may be under such a misapprehension-that our defence forces work 365 days a year, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Anybody who has contact with people who work for any arm of our Defence Force, whether it be Army, Navy or Air Force, knows that they are there working hard, working continuously and dedicating their lives to it. On the question of border security, this government obviously believes in strong protection of Australia's borders from whatever threats we may face. Whether that is illegal fishing, whether that is running of drugs or guns or other forms of contraband, or whether that is in relation to illegal movement of people across our borders, of course we take an approach that says, ‘The borders of Australia are to be protected,' and we will always take all reasonable steps to ensure that that occurs. White Ribbon Day",41
68,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Housing and the Minister for the Status of Women. As it is White Ribbon Day today, otherwise known as the International Day for the Elimination the of Violence against Women, will the minister outline what progress has been made in addressing violence against women and improving women's equality since the government was elected one year ago.",41
69,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and thank him and the other members of parliament who spoke from both sides last night on a private member's motion in this place that related to White Ribbon Day. The mempro- ber for Hindmarsh is a White Ribbon Ambassador, as are a number of members of parliament on both sides of the House, including the Prime Minister, who is a very strong advocate on behalf of White Ribbon Day, as are many other members of parliament. One in three Australian women experience domestic or family violence in their lifetime and one in five experience sexual assault in their lifetime. Nearly half a million Australian women suffer violence each year. It is the greatest human rights violation in this country and the greatest human rights violation on the planet in terms of the number of people who are affected. White Ribbon Day is a particularly important day because it is an opportunity for men to show their attitudes towards violence against women. It is an opportunity for Australian men and men around the world to say that they will not be violent but they will also not be silent-they will not condone violence. It is very important to have highprofile supporters of White Ribbon Day. Not only do we have the Prime Minister, state attorneys general led by our Commonwealth Attorney-General and members of parliament on both sides of the House, we have media personalities, footballers and other prominent Australians-all of them standing up and saying: ‘This is not a role model for masculinity that we want to show our sons and our grandsons. We want to show a role for men in the Australian community and in the world community of reducing violence against women.' As Andrew O'Keefe, our White Ribbon Ambassador No. 1, said today, there is a difference between masculinity and machismo-that is, it is possible to be a strong man and a tough man without being a violent man or an aggressive man. I want to congratulate all those men who have stood up and said, ‘Not only will I not be violent but I will not be silent about violence against women.' This government is determined to respond to domestic and family violence and sexual assault and we have moved substantially in this area. We appointed in May an expert council, bringing together some of the best brains in the country when it comes to reducing violence against women. They will be presenting me with a draft national plan in the coming weeks. The government will then respond to the draft national plan and that will be our national plan of action to reduce violence against women. It is worth saying that an Amnesty International petition that was handed to me today included 30,000 signatures calling for a national action plan on violence against women. We have committed to that national action plan. The signatures were of course collected before we had started work on our national action plan. We are delivering on that national action plan. The National Council to Reduce Violence against Women has engaged all across the country with people who have experienced violence; with men who have perpetrated violence; and with experts, judges, police officers and people who work in the refuge system. They have had contact with over 2,000 people and had three expert roundtables. They have done an enormous amount of work. The national plan will support the community to better support victims of violence, to improve our legal system to make sure it is effective in tackling violence and to reduce violence for future generations. We have delivered since coming to office $1 million to the White Ribbon Foundation to support and expand their activities in rural Australia; $2 million to benchmark community attitudes to violence against women so that we can change those attitudes; $500,000 to the Australian Institute of Criminology to undertake more detailed research into domestic homicides so that we can find out where we let down too many Australian women-more than one every week is murdered by an intimate partner; and $500,000 to 22 national and local projects to support victims of domestic or family violence. These projects include Victoria's Domestic Violence Resource Centre's mentoring project for women with a disability, to promote their capacity to lead and facilitate activities that focus on violence prevention for women with disabilities, and the Huon Domestic Violence Service in Tasmania, for radio programs that will particularly target young people and urge them to consider their behaviour. In conclusion, I would like to report to the House that the Attorney-General and I formally moved yesterday for Australia to become a party to the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",41
70,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ratifying of the optional protocol to CEDAW was an election commitment, and, as with a number of the other measures that I have mentioned today, they are election commitments delivered so that we can work together-men and women, parliamentarians and people outside the parliament-to end violence against women.",43
71,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the opposition supports the remarks made by the minister about violence against women. As everyone can see, all members of this House are united in their determination to reduce violence against women. The coalition has been committed to that goal both in government and now in opposition. Trade: Imports",43
72,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the minister aware that, at a public meeting held in Innisfail two years ago, AQIS could not recall a single application that had been rejected by them in the last seven years? A recent media article said not a single application had been agreed to by the Europeans in the last three years. In North Queensland two of our main crops are sugar and mangoes. America has allowed no sugar and no mangoes into the United States. Finally, all other countries scientifically assess and almost invariably say no. What credibility has Australia with AQIS, who invariably say yes-the gang that just cannot say no?",43
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do know that he is very seriously concerned and is representing the concern of his constituents. I indicate though that I do not agree with him on the question of the professionalism and dedication of our AQIS officers. I believe they go about the tasks that we ask them to do with all good skills and with professionalism. I also say to the member for Kennedy: while I do understand how deep his concern is, this import risk analysis has been in development now for a long period of time. The first request from the Philippines came in May 1999. An issues paper was issued on 2 May 2001. A technical information paper followed on 6 May 2002. A draft import risk analysis report was delivered on 1 July 2002. There was a revised draft on 19 February 2004. There was an addendum to the revised draft on 16 June 2004. There was a revised draft again on 1 March 2007. I indicate to members in this House that this has been a long-running process, a process that has been in train under both sides of politics over a number of terms of this parliament. It has resulted in the independently generated scientific assessment that has been reviewed by the Eminent Scientists Group. It is a process used by both sides of parliament to deal with these issues, which I freely admit are difficult issues and are particularly difficult for the growers in the industry sector. What I can say to the member for Kennedy, and what I did indicate to him in my last answer, is that the final import risk analysis report issued by Biosecurity Australia is open to appeal until 12 December and it may be-I am certainly not indicating to the member for Kennedy what particular course of action he should take-that he or people that he is in contact with might want to use that appeal facility.",43
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House. Mr Albanese-I wonder if someone can get the member for MCEwen a pillow?,43
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,43
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat! Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Mr Speaker, you have shown exemplary impartiality in your term as Speaker, and if this is the day for taking people to task for alleged stunts, surely the Leader of the House should be taken to task for what he has just said?",43
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is a fair cop. A stunt is a stunt whichever side it comes from, and I think everybody recognises what was going on there. I do not condone it. I am quite happy to get the ball rolling. I think that people will understand thatOpposition member interjecting",44
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If those words were directed at the stunt, I agree with them. If they were directed at me, I am not very happy about them at all. At a time when there were articles on the weekend talking about how people treat each other, there are lessons for all of us in this. I have to say that I am amazed that we expect the gallery to remain alert. I am not sure, because I have some sympathy from time to time with the gallery not being alert all of the time, about what is going on here. But I simply say to all",44
79,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are constantly asleep!,44
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply say to the member for Banks that, whilst the word ‘gallery' does include those who are behind me-I do not have the opportunity of knowing what they are doing-I was talking about other galleries. I think that it is a bit rich we expect behaviour in the galleries that we are not willing to demonstrate ourselves here. If I was remiss in not immediately dealing with an incident involving the Leader of the House, I will have to take the criticism for that. I attempted to get him to sit down before he said anything, but he wanted to takeMr Randall interjecting",44
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My intention was to try to move this on quickly and not overly embarrass anybody. But the types of comments that are continually made when we have these discussions do none of us any crediteven those who behave exemplarily. I really do think that, if I gave the member for Corangamite the call and we got on with the business that we are here to do, that might suffice at this point in time, without indicating that some of the things that have recently gone on are agreed with. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Leader of the House stood up, received the call and made an allegation against the member for MCEwen. It was a slur and it was inaccurate. If people are allowed to simply approach the microphone, make an inaccurate slur against another member and sit down without any form of punishment, then it is going to be very difficult to maintain decorum on both sides of the House.",44
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply say: I thank the House for its cooperation. It is a very hard thing to be able to discuss this matter, because, as the member for North Sydney is aware, at the same time there was a similar incident. If the member involved had been displaying a lack of alertness, an attendant would have gone up to that member and made them alert-and on this occasion I am not talking about the member questioned by the Leader of the House. This makes it diffiif cult to give definitive rulings. I am just suggesting to you that, if we expect behaviour of people in the gallery without expecting it of people in the House, and then we get precious about things, there are a lot of comments that are made in this place that I can highlight by taking action. If that is what the Manager of Opposition Business wants, I will do it. Mr Hockey-Further to that, Mr Speaker, on this of all days, the Leader of the House stood up and made a statement about the member for MCEwen-today of all days. Mr Speaker, is it appropriate for anyone to stand up in this place, launch an allegation against another member and sit down without even a reprimand from the Speaker?",44
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have indicated to the Manager of Opposition Business that, unlike a lot of members of this House, I admit that from time to time. I make mistakes. Maybe if I had sat the Leader of the House on his tail, warned him, lashed him-whatever you want me to do to him-it may have been better. But I simply say to the Manager of Opposition Business that if he wants the incident that led to this discussed I will interested in how it is handled by those who sit behind me. Child Care",45
84,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. What is the government doing to ensure continuity of childcare services for Australian families following the announcement of ABC Learning going into voluntary administration and the banking syndicate's appointment of a receiver?,45
85,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Receiving regular updates about ABC Learning has been something that members on both sides of the House have been anxious to do because they want to keep their constituents informed as to what is happening. I have updated the House on a number of occasions about the situation with ABC Learning, and I seek to provide some additional advice today. As members of parliament are aware, on Thursday, 6 November ABC Learning moved into voluntary administration, and within a matter of hours a receiver was appointed. I announced very quickly a $22 million funding package to provide certainty for affected parents to ensure that childcare centres remained open till 31 December 2008 to give both the receiver and insolvency practitioners, which we now have embedded and working with the receiver, time to work through this difficult situation so that mums and dads know that their childcare centre would be open and providing care for them. We also immediately moved to create a dedicated information hotline and to ensure that up-to-date information was available on the pages of the mychild.gov.au website. I can inform the House that we have had 800 calls to the dedicated hotline-the number is 1802003-and there have been 92,000 page be very views on the mychild.gov.au website. Since I last had the opportunity to speak to the House about these matters, regrettably another company with commercial links to ABC Learning, CFK Childcare Centres Ltd, has moved into voluntary administration, and a receiver has now also been appointed to that company. The receiver is Ferrier Hodgson, and my department is in close contact with them. CFK centres continue to operate, providing care as usual for the mums and dads who rely on CFK to provide that care. CFK, of course, is predominantly a New South Wales based company. CFK's receiver has not approached the Australian government for financial assistance-I stress that: it has not approached the Australian government for financial assistance-and I think it should be noted that obviously ABC Learning was in a unique situation given its size, its share of the market, its national coverage and the potential social and economic costs that would be created if many centres closed suddenly. Also, since the time. I have had an opportunity to update the House in relation to these matters, people may have seen reported in the media that another company associated with ABC Learning-in this case, 123 Careers, a labour hire company-has also gone into voluntary administration. I want to stress to members of the House and members of the public generally that, whilst we have faced this situation with ABC Learning, and now with companies with commercial ties to ABC Learning, it is important to note that the childcare sector as a whole has been both stable and viable. That is, there are childcare centres around this country-some of them on a for-profit basis, some of them on a not-for-profit basis-that are perfectly stable, viable childcare centres that are here today and will be here in five 10 years time providing care to children. Obviously our highest priority in relation to the ABC Learning situation continues to be to provide continuity of care for the children of mums and dads so that they know that child care is available for them. We will provide as much information as possible to mums and dads as soon as it is available and can be given to them. The government will continue work in that regard. We know the receiver is working very hard indeed. We have expert staff working alongside the receiver. Everybody's aim is to get further information to mums and dads as soon as possible. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",45
86,Ms PLIBERSEK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (3.24 pm)- Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",46
87,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,46
88,Ms PLIBERSEK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,46
89,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,46
90,Ms PLIBERSEK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,In today's Daily Telegraph there is a story entitled ‘No leave for mums. Second Labor minister says national can't afford it.' I said no such thing. NA Main Committee  you able to advise honourable members as to the cause of the closure of the Main Committee? What was the problem? Is it likely that there would be a repetition of the same problem?,46
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. I inform the or House that yesterday there was a failure in the computer system supporting the microphones in the Main Committee. This in turn meant that there was no audio recording available for transcription of the Hansard. When advised there was a problem, the chair initially suspended the committee to allow time to diagnose and fix the problem. When the problem could not be resolved, however, the Main Committee was adjourned. I am advised that the consequence was that a Hansard record could not be prepared of the constituency speeches made by four members: the members for Fremantle, Maranoa, Perth-that is, the Minister for Foreign Affairs-and Cowan. In addition, the private members' business and grievance debate scheduled for yesterday could not be commenced. As an aside, I ask the whips to consider sympathetically the scope for rescheduling the private members' business items. I can advise the House that DPS technical staff worked overnight to rectify the problem and that it has been resolved successfully. Importantly, I am also advised that this problem would not occur in relation to the chamber as there is a backup system in place. This is not the case for the Main Committee as the contingency plan for ICT support provided for relocation into another committee room. Despite the intense pressure on our ICT funding, a backup system will be put in place at the earliest opportunity. Main Committee",46
92,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, could I just ask you a further question on that matter, as I was one of the members who was speaking in the Main Committee. Even though it is known that my view of the Main Committee is that it should not exist, the House established it and what occurs in the Main Committee is of course part of the proceedings of the House. It is not cient, in my view, for the response to be the whips potentially make available extra speaking slots for those members whose contributions to the House have been lost. It seems to me that further effort should be made to restore those contributions. They form part of the record and the proceedings of the House. I think more is required than simply say that (a) there is no backup system and (b) the whips should make efforts. The House should give those members who made contributions the opportunity to present those contributions to the Main Committee or the House in written form to enable some record to be resuscitated.",47
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"First of all, for clarification, I was not suggesting that the whips solve the problems of the four members whose contributions were not recorded. I am happy to take on board those comments that relate to restoring the record of those four contributions. I am happy to investigate that with both DPS and the House of Representatives to see what can be achieved. I am not necessarily having a go at the member for Perth, but I asked a number of questions about whether it was really the member for Perth who was in the Main Committee. I am pleased that he is getting around to understanding the benefit and has now so successfully fought for the contributions made there. I should explain that there was a misunderstanding when the problem arose. It was not fully understood that it was actually a matter of not just the broadcast not going out but also the recording not being made. Everybody involved indicates that they understand that this is a problem for the four constituency statements. There are established precedents that I am happy to refer to in this case. I am not usually happy to have matters tabled or given in electronic form, but if it suffiwould satisfy the four members concerned that and the House I will explore that and get back to the House. Main Committee",47
94,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I was in the chair in the Main Committee when the problem arose. I want to speak in support of what the Minister for Foreign Afto fairs, the member for Perth, has just said. I was made aware that there was a technical problem. We all were hearing noises. I was not aware that the speeches were not being recorded. I was aware that there was a problem with the broadcast. When I became aware that nothing was being recorded I moved to suspend until 7.15 pm.",47
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I am satisfied that everything was handled appropriately and properly. The problem is that, in an age where we are so reliant on technology, the technology has failed us. The matters raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his behalf and also on behalf of his three colleagues need to be looked at further to see what we can recover. NA",47
96,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. I move: That the House take note of the following document: Murray-Darling Basin Commission-Report for 2007-08. Debate (on motion by Mr Hockey) adjourned. NA Broadband,47
97,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wide Bay proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to meet its timetable for the National Broadband Network. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",48
98,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In all of the discussion about the first year of the Rudd government-about the very few things that have actually been achieved in the midst of 168 new reviews and committees of inquiry, all the empty symbolism and the stunts, and the bungled response to the global financial crisis-we have not heard much about how different Australia would be if there were still a coalition government in place. Today we are going to talk about one area where there would have been significant difference in what has been achieved had the coalition remained in office. Had we retained government we would already be unveiling a nationwide fast broadband network. It would already be happening. Many people for the first time would have access to fast broadband speeds and others-in fact, most of Australia-would be looking forward to connecting during 2009 and, shortly after, 100 per cent of Australians would have access to high-speed broadband. No ifs or buts, the network would have been delivered. The contract had been signed and the work had started. How different it is under Labor. Our plan, Australia Connected, was announced in June last year and would have made available fast broadband options to 100 per cent of the population in 2009. It would have used a variety of delivery methods and provided relatively low-cost broadband at speeds of up to 50 megabits per second. Strong broadband provider competition already exists in metropolitan areas. Where it does not exist in rural and regional areas the $958 million OPEL contract would have rolled out a high-speed metro-equivalent network. The coalition's $2 billion Communications Fund, which had already grown to $2.4 billion, would have provided futureproofing for the time when inevitably technology moved ahead of what was available under this network. Fifty megabits a second may not cut the mustard anymore some time in the future. We recognised that the provision of cable would not be economical right across the country, so there was a $2,750 subsidy for satellite and other similar technology that could have served the most remote areas. We were not only making provision to give all Australians access to metropolitan style broadband speeds but ensuring that for future generations there would be funding available so that new technologies would be made available not just in the wealthy areas of the country, not just where there are extensive populations that make that infrastructure economical, but to everyone. The Communications Fund future-proofed Australia. It ensured that there was funding available every year to advance technology in those places where otherwise it may not have been economical. We had a plan in place not only to deliver fast broadband speed immediately but also to ensure that the whole of the country stayed together when it came to introducing new types of technology. That is what might have been. That is what we could have had. Instead, we have today one of the most appalling mishmashes I have ever seen in public policy. The government's deadline for beginning-not concluding-construction of the national broadband network was to be the end of this year. We would have had ours substantially in place by the end of next year. Labor were only going to start at the beginning of this year. They have 36 days to get going. They have 36 days to honour their election promise. They are already six months behind with the calling of tenders. They have 36 days to get to work. ",48
99,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Prime Minister said when he came in that his ministers were going to get Christmas Day off but they were going to have to work all over the Christmas and New Year holidays. Of course, they all had a holiday and went to other places. But the reality is that they are going to have to work very hard over Christmas this year because they have 36 days to start digging the trenches, to start putting up the towers and start doing the work. But, of course, that is nonsense, because the tenders have not even closed. Labor's $4.7 billion national broadband network was their single biggest election pledge in infrastructure-$4.7 billion. It was going to be a communications revolution. And we all know about the associated policies that hang off that promise, such as a computer for every student and Australia being some kind of global financial headquarters. They promised fibre to the node to 98 per cent of the Australian population. Let us not hear any further backslipping on these promises, revising of what was actually said. It is all clearly on the record; it is all clearly in Labor's election manifesto-98 per cent of Australians were to have fibre to the node. Pre-election, Labor much depended upon this network being seen by voters as a building block to Australia's future. Post-election, the nation much depends upon Labor getting this right. But, sadly, Labor's plan was flawed from the start. It was only a stunt, an attempt to trump what was already happening and what was being provided by the coalition. They did not realise that, instead of a mix of technologies, they were going to provide just a single technology: fibre to the node. They thought that it worked for everyone. That of course is fine, and I am sure everybody would love to have fibre to the node. If Labor honour their election promise of 98 per cent of Australians getting fibre to the node and getting it on time, I will be the first to congratulate them-and I will be particularly keen to congratulate them if they can do it for $4.7 billion. Korea, I am told, spent $40 billion to deliver fibre to the node, and that is a little country. But this miraculous government is going to do it for the whole of Australia for just $4.7 billion. Nowhere in Labor's plan to before the election was there anything about a dealing with those areas out of the reach of fibre. There was no mention of satellite services at all. Wireless seemed an afterthought rather than a genuine part of their solution. That $4.7 billion is of course nowhere near enough money to fund the promise that they have made. The speed of Labor's network was going to be just 12 megabytes per second and it was going to cost more than $100 a month. So Labor's plan was slower and much more expensive than what the coalition was already delivering. Labor offered slower speeds, more expensive connections and delivery of their broadband years later. Labor was in fact duplicating today's technology in the cities, where our plan would provide new generation technology across the nation and, in particular, to areas that do not have access at the present time. We all know that Labor said that tenders were going to be concluded within six months of the election, construction would be underway by the end of 2008 and the entire network would be operational by 2013. No part of Labor's plan did anything about the future-proofing of the network. There was nothing there to look after delivery of new technologies-maybe technologies that have not even yet been invented-or to future-proof telecommunications in those areas where the services might otherwise be uneconomic. Indeed, Labor's plan was to steal the money from the Communications Fund, to try and move it across to Building Australia to be spent to prop up flagging state budgets for their infrastructure projects. The money that was promised to people in rural and regional Australia as a part of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra-that was put aside in perpetuity so that the interest would be able every year for technology-has been stolen by this government and moved across to be spent on antiquated technology or on propping up state budgets that cannot be balanced. They have no long-term plan and had no forethought. They were offering Australians yesterday's or today's technology with no thought about what was going to be done in the future. Where are we now with Labor's plan? Tenders are supposed to close tomorrow. Tomorrow we will know whether there are any tenderers at all. We will know what consortia are willing to be involved. But the hopelessly confused manner in which this process has been conducted does not give anyone much faith. It is six months behind schedule and it is a shambles. No-one tendering has any idea what the rules are, what arrangements are going to be in place. How can you possibly tender for a project that will cost $10 billion, $12 billion or $20 billion if you do not know what the rules are? Yet Labor are asking people to go in blindfolded, put their money on the table and then be opened up to some kind of scrutiny as to how it might work. As the shadow minister for communications, Senator Nick Minchin, said just recently, we have: … the ridiculous situation where proponents are expected to lodge their bids, in a difficult and uncertain economic environment, without the Government providing any detail or clarity in relation to regulatory arrangements, including access and pricing. Senator Minchin also said: Self-imposed project deadlines have been broken, the Government's Request for Proposals farce has been widely condemned and there are genuine concerns this process will end in a train wreck. It is unbelievable that … Senator Conroy expects proponents to fly blind into the starters' gate. Today, like many others, I guess, I received a availpackage of information from Telstra which follows on from earlier public statements made by Telstra, the largest telecommunications carrier in our nation. They say that they will not bid if the government leaves open the possibility of functional or structural separation of the successful bidder. I can only take Telstra at their word. They have said it often enough. The government has not responded to their concerns. Whatever you think about structural separation or its merits, why would a potential bidder such as Telstra be prepared to put their money on the line if they did not know what the rules would be? Why should Australia's second largest company have to enter into a bidding process when they do not even know what the ground rules are? Why would TERRiA bid, when they do not have a clue what access other carriers will have to the system or what their role or capacity to participate in the arrangement will be? Why would Axia NetMedia bid? Why would any of those companies be involved when it is quite clear that the government do not know what they doing? They could have no confidence in their competence to actually address this sort of issue. Kevin Day, a former adviser to the ALP on communications, told the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network that this process was ‘fatally flawed'. He said we might have a winner but the business case would rest on regulatory conditions that are not yet determined and that ultimately may be the responsibility of parliament to frame. The better part of next year will be gone before we have any idea who is going to be the successful tenderer. There will have to be negotiations on critical issues like access pricing. There will be dispute settlement mechanisms to deal with. There will be drafting, debating and passing of legislation. There will be partnership arrangements. Labor has taken over a year to bring its industrial relations legislation into the parliament-it arrived only today. This is the heart and core of the very existence of the Labor Party and it took them a year to do that. How many years is it going to take them to complete their tender negotiations for the broadband network-if they get any tenders at all? Both sides of politics went into the last election campaign offering a national broadband network. I think it is fair to say that everyone in the House recognises how important fast and reliable communications are for the majority of Australian consumers and businesses. The internet is a place of information, a place to catch up with family and friends and of invaluable assistance to businesses in the 21st century. For people living in more remote areas of Australia in particular it is a lifeline; for others who are shut in it is their connection with the rest of the world. The coalition in government had an impressive record as we worked with industry to provide the best possible service to the largest number of Australians. According to the Bureau of Statistics there are now more than 7.2 million internet connections in Australia, 78 per cent of which are broadband. But as always there is much more that needs to be done and time does not stand still for anyone. That is why we acted before the election to deliver a fast broadband plan to all Australians. Now all of that has come to a halt. I urge Labor to rethink its plan to scrap the $2 billion Communications Fund. That is essential to keep faith with regional Australians. I urge Labor ministers to think beyond their tiny city electorates, to think of those and people who have no broadband now and to get on with the job of delivering to all Australians this basic form of communication. Australia cannot afford another bungle of the scale that is looming on a national broadband network. What we want down the track is a broadband system that works. It should be there now; Labor must get on with it.",49
100,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (3.47 pm)-I am pleased to speak as a representative of the Australian Labor Party, the political party which holds most regional seats in this parliament. So, when we hear the Leader of the National Party or the Liberal-National Party or whatever they are these days, we know that the confusion that we just heard explains why they are now surrounded by Labor members up and down the Queensland coast. It is because they were out of touch with the needs of people in regional Australia and with the needs of people in the business community. Just this morning I flew to Newcastle accompanied by the member for Newcastle and the member for Hinkler. The member for Hinkler was pleased to accept my invitation to participate in the opening of the Australian Maritime Centre. I was doing a radio interview on 2HD, and the legacy of 12 years of neglect from the Howard government kicked in when the line dropped out. That is what happened when you went around regional Australia-the lines simply dropped out. They dropped out as regularly as voters dropped off voting for the coalition and the National Party. It is pretty clear every time you hear those opposite address this House that the people they are really angry with are the Australian public. They do not accept the verdict of the Australian public Today we introduced proudly the legislation to rip up Work Choices-again, one of the other major reasons why we now sit on this side of the House. Work Choices and the opposition's failure in regional Australia on broadband were two of the main issues. What did we do? We went to the election campaign stating that we would build a national broadband network. We argued that it was an important infrastructure investment for Australia's long-term prosperity and we did it in the context of our position of arguing for nation building. Since the election we have backed up those promises that we made during the campaign with fulfilment. We have established Infrastructure Australia. We have got going on building the nation and part of that is our commitment to provide up to $4.7 billion to facilitate the rollout of national broadband network-the biggest national investment in broadband infrastructure ever made by an Australian government. It is a network that will cover 98 per cent of Australian homes and businesses and deliver a high-speed fibre based network. We have made this a first-order infrastructure priority and we are moving forward quickly and methodically to implement our election commitment whilst ensuring the integrity of the NBN process. The practices of those opposite make it clear that they would not recognise integrity if they tripped over it. Two days in a row we have had questions in this House about the tender process, when the tender closes tomorrow. It would be entirely inappropriate and would subject the government to legal action were we to go into detail as to the tender process, but of course, when you are from the National Party, you do not worry about legal processes, you do not worry about probity and you do not worry about integrity. We have seen that in every one of the programs that they had control over. We certainly saw it with regard to their attitude towards broadband and modern communications. We on this side want to build highways, we want to build railways but we also want to build the new communications highways of the 21st century. Those opposite introduced 18 short-term bandaids during their 12 years in office-that is, 18 different proposals in 12 years-but Australia was still standing by the side of the information superhighway while the rest of the nations in our region sped past. Australia was left behind while our peers around the world started to roll out high-speed fibre based broadband networks. The latest OECD figures for its 30 member countries rank Australia 16th on penetration levels and 10th on the most expensive subscription prices, yet those oppothe site have the audacity to accuse the government of not delivering on broadband infrastructure. Let us be clear: Australia's lack of world-class broadband infrastructure is the result of too many years of bandaid solutions. We had the suggestion by the Leader of the National Party that we were promoting yesterday and today's technology. This is from a mob who wanted to go to wireless technology because they did not quite understand the whole concept of broadband. They just did not get it. They were led by a leader and a leadership team who were stuck in the last century and incapable of moving forward. They were stuck on industrial relations in the century before, the century of the master-servant relationship, but on the challenges of the new century they were simply unable to move forward. Let us have a look at what they proposed while in government. They included: in 2002, a Telecommunications Action Plan for Remote Indigenous Communities; in 2003, a Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme; and, in 2004, a National Broadband Strategy, a National Broadband Strategy Implementation Group, a Coordinated Communications Infrastructure Fund, a Demand Aggregation Brokers Program, a metropolitan broadband black spots program, a Broadband for Health initiative, and a broadband pharmacy program. You would think that maybe they would have completed all their work, but, oh, no-in 2005, they were back in here with more bandaid legislation. In 2005 they had an NBSIG Australian action plan. They then had a Clever Networks program. In 2005 they also had the Broadband Connect subsidy program. They had the Broadband Connect Infrastructure Program, they had the Communications Fund and in 2006 they had the Broadband Blueprint. When we got to 2007 they had OPEL, the fixed wireless broadband product that did not meet the terms of the contract that it had with the Commonwealth. And what about the Australian Broadband Guarantee in 2007? It was the very program that the coalition would not commit funds to in the lead-up to the 2007 election, even though the program was going to run dry in June this year, the very program aimed at improving broadband services to areas where there are no commercial metrocomparable broadband services-to people in places that the member for Wide Bay claims to represent. No amount of pleading from the National Party was going to convince the Liberals that the Australian Broadband Guarantee was worthy of long-term funding, so they simply got done over. And what is their response to years of being done over by the economic rationalists in the Liberal Party? They have joined them. With their tail wagging, they got their little pat on the head. They rolled over and had their tummy tickled by the Liberal Party, and now they are the Liberal-National Party or the National-Liberal Party or something else in Queensland. By contrast, Labor's election commitment was crystal clear, and in this year's budget we announced $270.7 million for the program over four years. Once again, it is Labor funding regional programs, something that the National Party failed to do. If the coalition's record on broadband was not bad enough, I would like to remind the Leader of the National Party about his commitment to regional Australia, because it is astonishing that he is prepared to criticise the government on the biggest injection of funds into broadband this nation has ever seen when he was prepared to deliver a two-tiered solution. There are some new members here who might find it astonishing that there would be a two-tiered solution proposed to broadband, but that is precisely what they proposed. If you lived in an electorate such as mine, you got fibre to the node for the cities but, if you lived in a regional community, you got a different system. You got a weaker system. You got a cheaper solution, a second-class solution. You got a fixed wireless system for the regions. One of their proposals did not take into account that you were fine as long as you lived on a plane-as long as there was not a hill or a building in the way you were fine. Meanwhile, through the NBN and other measures specifically targeting the remaining two per cent of Australians, the government has committed substantial new funding to improve telecommunications services in regional Australia. On top of the $270.7 million allocation to the Australian Broadband Guarantee, a further $400 million has been made available to fund the government's response to the Glasson report. Australia certainly deserves much better than the short-term political opportunism of those opposite. We on this side of the House have stated that we expect that the NBN will facilitate competition through open access arrangements and provide affordable services to consumers. We have gone direct to the market to ask what it can deliver so that proponents have the chance to put forward the regulatory changes necessary to facilitate their proposals. It is up to proponents to demonstrate how best to meet or exceed our objectives within the competitive process. We remain open-minded on the regulatory solutions that can achieve our objectives, and we are certainly not in the business of killing creativity and innovation. When these proposals close tomorrow we will then be in a position to make further comments about the way forward. But we know that broadband infrastructure is absolutely critical to nation building. The opposition are stuck in the past on broadband. For the benefit of those opposite, high-speed broadband is not just about faster internet. Broadband is a critical enabling technology that will change how businesses serve their customers, how government delivers services and how the community interacts. The need to act decisively to remedy Australia's broadband infrastructure problems is well understood by Australian businesses. When I go around the business boardrooms in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and other centres, I am continually reminded by businesses how they were let down by the former government's neglect of this critical area. Indeed, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, has stated that any political party that did not understand the need for the NBN should ‘get themselves into the 21st century'. But, of course, Heather Ridout is now sledged by those oppositeMr Briggs-Absolutely!",51
101,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,‘Absolutely' says the bloke who helped write the Work Choices legislation-the member for Mayo. It is extraordinary. On this side of the House we are getting on with the business of nation building; on that side of the House they are incapable of achieving the gains and direction that we need as a national economy to advance through the challenges of the 21st century.,54
102,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dunkley) (4.02 pm)You have got to love the member for Grayndler-he can stick with a message regardless of the facts. Regardless of the reality all around him, he can still keep punching through those messages. He is sticking with this message because he knows the Australian public have been conned. They have been conned by Labor, who went out and campaigned their little tails off on broadband sound bites without any sound public policy to implement what they were talking about. To get a sense of that, listen to the member for Grayndler. During the election campaign there was promise after promise: fibre to the node, minimum 12 megabyte speeds and 98 per cent coverage. There was even a proposition for a 50-50 equity share, where the government would muscle its way in on the delivery of telecommunications services and then demand a commercial rate for the return. Why would you not just leave it to business to get on with the job? Because Labor needed something that it could hang its shingle off. It did not matter how it got there or what it said in the lead-up to the election, it wanted to make broadband a big issue. Why? You heard the member for Grayndler talking. He attempted a critique of what the coalition government did. The coalition actually made the term ‘digital economy' something that mainstream Australians now understand. The coalition actually supported the evolution of technology and recognised that you need to change and adapt to innovation as it becomes available, and as customer services and expectations improve. Some of the new Labor members might have forgotten that it was the Labor Party running around wanting mandated dial-up speeds. While that was going on the coalition looked to the future and recognised that broadband was the way forward. We have also seen wiggle room on the language-it is now no longer ‘fibre to the node'. Did you hear what the Labor government said? It is now a ‘fibre based network'. Well, hello, we have got that already! The current network is already fibre based. I think there are all bar two exchanges in this vast continent of ours that are not connected by multiple fibre optic connections. We already have a fibre based network. Those cheer squad members of the ALP that just soak up everything the frontbenchers say without even looking at it should look around the capital cities of Australia. If you look around nearly all of the areas that Labor played to, where they hoped to offer higher speed broadband, you will see something called a heat map. That actually shows you what available speeds are there now, in many cases exceeding the 12 megabytes and-not in all cases-already operating on a fibre based network. This is the reality we have now, and this one of these remarkable promises made by the Labor Party: they do absolutely sweet nothing in government in relation to broadband and claim an outcome. That is the kind of spivness we see from the Labor Party, where they create this fiction about a problem that is there. They describe and exploit it in an election context, but when they get to government it is a totally new world. It is a bit like creating a new inflation figure. Do you remember the one where they created a new domestic inflation figure-a benchmark that has hardly been used in this country for decades and now Labor hangs on to that? It is a bit like cooking the growth figures to make it look like the economy is not tanking. We have got a new one: the broadband plans. When the Labor Party said that the coalition had 18 different proposals, no-one really bothered to look at what they really meant. They grab a headline of a strategy and call that one plan, then they say that the elements within that strategy are another plan. They ignore the fact that technology evolves and so do customer expectations of broadband networks. The ultimate irony is that they then hang onto most of what the coalition government did. The minister trots around the country patting himself on the back for clever network initiatives that were actually implemented by the coalition. He was down on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, heralding WiMAX-this wireless technology that he called ‘a dog of a technology'-and taking credit for this dog of a technology that is leading the way in the delivery of reliable, affordable broadband across the globe, particularly in vast areas like our continent, where a mixture of technologies is important. Labor walks away from its promises and now calls them ‘ambitions'. They are ambitions. They are objectives. They are expectations. No, they are weasel words; they are is wriggle room designed to give Labor an opportunity to do a fix-not to deliver what the nation needs, not to do a sober assessment of what would drive our economy forward, not to recognise the opportunities in health service delivery, in education, in e-commerce, in home based businesses, in smart gridsall of the things where a government would describe the performance and the objectives that are being delivered through the technology. No, they have not done that; they have prescribed the technology: 98 per cent fibre to the node. Do you know what that means? It means that, once you get past about 90 per cent of the Australian population, you get into areas where, industry experts tell me, for every one per cent beyond that 90 per cent, it costs a billion dollars. By being hairy chested and prescribing a technological platform, after trash-talking a wireless technology that is leading innovation, the government is building enormous cost into this project without actually describing why the government needs to be involved in the first place. Governments should get involved when markets fail, when the private sector cannot deliver a reasonable level of service at an affordable price. That what OPEL was about. That is exactly what OPEL was about-delivering metro comparable broadband to rural, remote and regional Australia. What I am wondering is whether all the people who live in rural, remote and regional Australia who would have benefited from WiMAX are telling their kids who are starting secondary college this year that, rather than having the benefits of high-speed metro comparable broadband to help them with their studies now, they will probably be enjoying schoolies week, finishing their secondary education, before anything is delivered under the Labor Party plan. That is what is going on in broadband. It is fraud. It is a monumental con. But guess what? The charade will finish and the curtain will open shortly, because the bids need to be delivered tomorrow. And think about the proponents. Imagine their dilemma: a tender document that talks about objectives but does not actually talk about the regulatory environment. Could you imagine in this economic climate going into a bank and saying: ‘Could you lend us $10 billion? We can't tell you what the competitive environment looks like, what our obligations are to others who might want to access the network, what the universal service obligation might look like or what the price controls might be.' Imagine going to a bank and saying, ‘Just trust us; give us the $10 billion.' And when challenged about this what do you get from the minister? He says they are not interested in ‘regulatory totems'. These regulatory reforms are not totems; they are channel markers. They tell proponents where to direct their bids so they do not run aground and make this an extraordinarily expensive con of the Australian public. They let proponents know that we do not want to see upward pressure on the costs of broadband services that some premises, some households, might not want. There are expectations of what is those prices might look like for the consumer, because the biggest contest outside the tender bid is the contest for ‘most neglected status'. ‘Most neglected status' under the NBN is a contest between the national interest and consumer interest, two key objectives that should be part of any government policy, any public policy initiative. But they do not even get a look in, because this is all about electioneering and politicising. It should not be a surprise. For those who have not had a look at The Latham Diaries, this is its critique of the current communications minister, Stephen Conroy. Stephen Conroy-Told me he doesn't have any strong policy interests, and maybe he would like the Communications portfolio, which I gave him. It's a frank admission; machine men aren't interested in policy, only factions and patronage. How accurate is that, when you think about the process that has been put in place? This is a process Robert Mugabe would be pleased to call his own. You get a tender document that is so vague that it has no mandated performance requirements. It has a list of objectives, but they are not ranked and there is no statement about the must-haves, the nice-to-haves and the gee-it-would-bereally-good-ifs-none of that, just a great long list. So proponents have no guidance on the regulatory structure; no clear understanding of what the government actually want, because they are walking away from their election commitment; no opportunity to engage in an open debate, because the process has been gagged; and you wonder why across Australia, wall to wall, industry experts are describing this as shambolic. It is time the Labor government put aside its political interests and its rhetoric and tually focused on the national interest and the interests of consumers, who are very vulnerable in this process-a process that is way overdue and a process that should have seen construction start before the end of this year. Thankfully, the minister has been frank enough to say it is unlikely we will see any work commence before the end of next year. This is fraud. This is a con. (Time expired)",54
103,Mr RIPOLL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Oxley) (4.12 pm)Today's matter of public importance is the height of irresponsibility. The opposition come in here and say that we are hanging onto their policies, yet they oppose the national broadband network in the Senate. It is shameful opportunism from an utterly irresponsible opposition. For 12 years they did nothing about a national broadband network, but for the past 12 months they have done everything they can to prevent a national broadband network. The opposition are nothing more than spoilers on broadbandarrogant, focused on themselves and their own ideology, contrary to the national interest. As usual, the opposition are trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue. This mob have taken to opposition like ducks to water, and they have lifted the art of walking both sides of the street to new heights. They claim that they believe that broadband is important infrastructure for the Australian economy, yet for 12 years they did nothing about it. As usual, you need to look at their actions, rather than what they say, to see what they really believe. For the last 12 months the opposition have done absolutely nothing but try to undermine the government's national broadband network. It is much the same as what they did over the past 12 years: nothing. They did nothing to deal with the serious issue of a national broadband network and Australia's future related acto that network. They have been desperate to obstruct the government's efforts to implement this very important infrastructure project at every possible opportunity. We just heard the member for Dunkley say that governments should only step in when markets fail. Well, in terms of the national broadband network, I would challenge him to show me where the markets have succeeded, particularly when we talk about the bush-rural and regional communities. At every opportunity this opposition has tried to use the parliament to jeopardise the live commercial process that the government has been implementing to select a builder for the national broadband network. It is a proper and considered process in consultation with the community and the sector-a complex process but one that we are determined to see through. They have established stunt Senate inquiries. They have knowingly pursued lines of questioning in Senate estimates that were designed to jeopardise the integrity of the government's process, and they have done that at every single opportunity. Today, in a final desperate ploy, they are again trying to undermine the process just as bids are about to be lodged. Their views and actions are, and continue to be, about destroying the program. The view of the opposition is that if you cannot win it then you must destroy it. Those opposite have been happy to do everything in their power to attempt to jeopardise the government's open and competitive process for rolling out a national broadband network, yet at the same time they claim to support the need for broadband in Australia. But it is only broadband in their image; it is only broadband where they see fit. It is not a truly national broadband network, nor would it deliver. In reality, the opposition, through their tions, never want to see a national broadband network built in Australia. They do not want to see the Rudd government deliver on its election commitment to bring Australia's communications infrastructure into the 21st century. They are spoilers-stamping their feet, banging on the table, preferring to burn the house down rather than let anyone else build it. While the government has taken a long term approach to delivering a major infrastructure project that is critical for Australia's future economic prosperity, those opposite have engaged in nothing more than shortterm political point scoring-12 years of doing nothing and 12 years of doing everything to prevent something being done. What have we seen in any policy work from the opposition when it comes to broadband? Very little, to the point of nothing. They have merely clung desperately to the failed policies of the past Howard government. They will be tested soon on whether they cling to other policies, such as Work Choices, which was clearly rejected by the community. As opposed to the rejection those opposite received, the community ticked off not only on what we are doing in terms of a national broadband network but also on Work Choices. Those opposite had policies that left rural and regional Australia trailing their metropolitan cousins, that left the nation trailing our international competitors and that left Australia 16th in the OECD in broadband penetration and 10th in the OECD on broadband subscription prices. We like to consider ourselves part of a clever country, part of a country that is at the forefront of technology, but the reality is that we have gone backwards in a very fast way over the past decade. The opposition offer the Australian people nothing but very silly political games. The fact that today's MPI has been moved by the Leader of the Nationals demonstrates ac- the hypocrisy of those opposite. The National Party were willing accomplices to the Howard government's neglect of rural and regional telecommunications, not to mention other areas where they failed the bush dismally. In almost 12 long years in government, those opposite introduced 18 failed broadband policies. No matter what screeches we hear from the opposition about whether it was 18 or just 18 line items, whichever way they want to describe it, over 12 years they had 18 attempts at doing something but achieved nothing-no way forward, no movement-and the evidence is fact: we slipped behind while the rest of the world moved forward. Their legacy was a trail of broadband bandaids and pork barrels, something that has become a hallmark, a trademark, of the coalition in government and that will now be the trademark of the coalition in opposition. They viewed rural and regional Australia as nothing more than a political problem that needed to be bought off with short-term political fixes. They were never prepared to do the hard work of implementing a long-term solution for rural and regional telecommunications beyond one election cycle. When the issue of fibre to the node first emerged in Australia, those opposite never even tried to make this important new infrastructure available in the bush. They just disregarded it. They were prepared to sell out rural and regional Australia with a two-tiered system-something first-class for people in the cities and something very much secondclass for people in the bush. For us, that simply was not good enough. They were happy to accept a fibre-to-the-node network that covered, as stated in their own policy, only the ‘capital cities and major regional centres' while leaving the bush to a second-class, fixed wireless system, which could be described as expensive and patchy at best, a wireless system which was later shown not to meet required service coverage as set out in the funding agreement with the Commonwealth. Those supporting this motion should be aware that rural MPs, who understand the communications needs of their constituents, support the government's actions on rural and regional telecommunications. Former senior National Party and Howard government minister Bruce Scott, whom I acknowledge is in the chair, stated that the decision terminate the former government's OPEL contract was ‘sensible'. I agree; it was very sensible. Similarly, former National and now popular Independent Tony Windsor supported the decision, noting that ‘fibre-to-thenode infrastructure is the best option'. And he is right. Support for the decision also came from National MP John Forrest, who was noted as saying, ‘I did not support OPEL getting this contract in the first place.' These views reflect those of the member for Wide Bay's own party colleagues, Senators Nash and Joyce, who, in 2005, released a report on behalf of the National Party think tankthere is something to think about-the Page Research Centre. The report recommended that the then government consider a five-year rollout of fibre-optic cable across nonmetropolitan areas. These members of parliament, while hypocritical, at least understood that the infrastructure needs of rural and regional Australians could not be fobbed off with some short-term political fix. More needed to be done. They knew that a long term approach was needed to deliver worldclass infrastructure to rural and regional Australia. And we agree with them. We support them. And that is what we are doing: we are talking about a real national broadband network. They knew that a long-term approach was needed to deliver world-class infrastructure out in the bush as well as in the cities. It is time those opposite started listening to their colleagues, to the community and to the sector and started to recognise the importance of a national broadband network for Australia, a job that we are prepared to continue with. As part of our election commitment, the Rudd government has committed up to $4.7 billion, will consider regulatory changes to facilitate the rollout of a national broadband network and will work in conjunction with the sector. This will be the biggest national to investment in broadband infrastructure ever made by an Australian government, certainly a lot more in 12 months than was ever delivered in the 12 years of the Howard government. Tomorrow, the government expects to receive proposals from bidders vying for the right to construct the national broadband network. Yet today, we see the future of that being jeopardised by the opposition, because they are not committed to Australia's national interests, to Australia's future, to a real national broadband network. They are only committed to themselves. (Time expired)",57
104,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Broadband communications is the infrastructure of this century. There has been a lot of talk today about this century, last century and the century before. This is the infrastructure that all of Australia requires for century, so I endorse what the current government are attempting to do. I realise they are a little bit behind schedule and I hope that they hurry it along, but the concept of quality, high-speed internet broadband services, particularly to country areas, or fibre to-the-node services, is something that we should all get behind. There has been some discussion about the quality of previous services. There have been advancements made, and I do not think anyone can suggest that the previous government did not do anything. But we do have world-first technologies that can be introduced and country people, in my view, should have equity of access to those services. The only way that that can really be achieved is through fibre-to-thenode delivery. Mr Deputy Speaker, this form of infrastructure, as you would be well aware, is the one thing that negates distance being a disadvantage of living in the country. It actually equalises the equation and in fact puts country people in front of their city cousins in terms of many of the advantages that broadband can deliver, particularly in terms of both national and international business services. If we can achieve equity of access and equity of price right across Australia then we will deliver a means to decentralise some of our cities. We have had a continual movement towards our major cities, not because people particularly want to live there but because of their economies of size and scale, which mean people feel they have to go there to find work. This technology in this century can release us from that equation and from having to pack people into cities. So I think this issue should be looked at in terms of the climate change debate as well and the need for people to move-to have to leave their country communities to go to the big cities for health and educational reasons, for instance. These sorts of infrastructure services this can actually assist not only the business community but also in health, education and many other ways. They actually remove distance as being a disadvantage, as I said, of living in the country. The other issue that has been in the news of late is the bid that is currently taking place in relation to the national broadband network and the antics of Telstra in particular. I publicly encourage Senator Conroy to ignore the bullyboy tactics of some of the Telstra board and the CEO in relation to their demands that the government not implement a structural separation arrangement between the network itself and the providers of the service. I would encourage the minister to ignore them. If they do not put in a bid then so be it, because in terms of getting equity of access to these services there will need to be structural separation. That does not mean Telstra's service delivery of mobile and other services has to be structurally separated; but if this is to be a truly national broadband network where other telcos can actually access the network in a competitive sense then the provider of the network cannot be the major player. We have made that mistake in the past. The provider of the network cannot be the major player and wipe out the competitors. It has been shown time and time again-and the member for Oxley talked about it a moment ago-that competition will not deliver in a lot of country areas. Since the privatisation of Telstra there has been very little activity in terms of mobile towers in country areas, for instance, because they do not have to do it any more. In fact they say, ‘It's not our business to deliver services into these areas that we do not believe are profit making in a four-year capital return cycle.' There are many of these issues out there. In conclusion, I would encourage Senator Conroy not to be bullied by these belligerent people just because they run a private operation now and they have a number of shareholders. Not every Australian is a shareholder in Telstra anymore-but the minister is the representative of all Australians. (Time expired)",59
105,Mr RAGUSE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the comments from the member for New England in terms of his understanding of the needs of his region. I would like to acknowledge that there is a lot of emotion in this particular debate today. We heard the member for Wide Bay talking about Queensland and the lack of infrastructure and a whole range of things. He was a Minister for Transport and Regional Services in a government that was in power for almost 12 years. So what did they do? Let us look at the electorate of Forde, where I come from, a seat that sits behind the Gold Coast-in fact, the member for Moncrieff, sitting over there, is a very proud Gold Coast member. The electorate of Forde at its northern point sits within 40 kilometres of the city of Brisbane. This is an area that you would expect to have a lot of infrastructure in place. I can tell that even now people have problems getting any type of ADSL simply because a lot of that area has dial-up services. That is at the northern end. My electorate stretches at the southern end to probably 120 kilometres out of the city. I can tell you that there are still cables running along the side of the road. In fact some of the junction boxes had been eaten by the cattle that also graze that area. So the reality is that the infrastructure we currently have is poor. We can talk about fibre to the node and a whole range of infrastructure. The member for Dunkley talked about the technology that was provided and put in place by the previous government. Well, I can tell you that it did not exist. Their plan for a two-tiered system in fact just will not work, simply because they do not understand the existing infrastructure, and the existing infrastructure that they are depending on just will not work. As I said, this is in the electorate of Forde, which is so close to Brisbane and so close to the Gold Coast, yet our infrastructure is so poor. Just getting some basic phone services in place would be very much welcomed. In fact, there was emotion from the member for Dunkley. He talked about the ‘spivness' of the Labor government in wanting to roll out a major fibre network-spivness! He said that we were hairy chested and that these were all weasel words that the government is good at putting out there. I tell you, we are serious about what we are doing. In fact, we went to the election with a commitment to provide the national broadband network. We planned it, we said how we would do it and we promised and committed to a level of rollout. Looking at the technology behind that, they say it was the Howard government that really made a lot of inroads. That is not true. Let us go back to the Hawke and Keating you years. Let us go back to the decision to roll out the fibre networks and introduce Optus as a provider to roll out broadband cable. This is something that previous Labor governments understood very well. In fact, not only was it a case of rolling out the infrastructure but it was also an understanding of this country and its move towards technology-and I am now talking about the early nineties. They said: ‘Okay, we can roll out the technology. The world wide web is now being rolled out around the world. How would we as a country be able to tap into that?' Essentially, through the rollout of fibre networks, the role of Optus in its early days was all about the initiative of the Labor government to ensure we had adequate infrastructure, particularly for communications and data. Mr Ciobo-It was a pay TV cable. It wasn't for data-it was a pay TV cable.",61
106,Mr RAGUSE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It even went one step further. It was about content and Creative Nation, if the member from the other side would understand the significance of Creative Nation-a Keating initiative which was about not only building the hard infrastructure but also establishing the content that we needed to put down that particular network. Mr Ciobo-Losing credibility rapidly!",62
107,Mr RAGUSE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Moncrieff might say that. He sits back and talks about the lack of infrastructure they have on the Gold Coast. As a senior member of the previous government, he was in power for nearly 12 years, and the fact that thisMr Ciobo-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I have never said any such thing.",62
108,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is not a point of order.,62
109,Mr RAGUSE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would certainly suggest that there are many words said about the lack of infrastructure on the Gold Coast. But, if the Gold Coast is suffering, so is the seat of Forde. Listen to the rhetoric now espoused by the other side, certainly by the member for Wide Bay in his passionate plea about what we as a government are going to do. He wants to get involved in the process of deciding who we should give the tenders to. The reality is that, if you look at a TV these and watch The Howard Years, I would suggest that, with their lack of understanding of infrastructure and their lack of understanding of the needs, it should probably be called ‘Luddites in power'.",62
110,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The time for the discussion has expired. NA NA FUNDING APPROPRIATION BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,62
111,Mr SWAN,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am introducing a bill to provide a standing appropriation to pay any possible claims made under the Australian government's Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding. The bill will provide international markets with the assurance that Australian institutions are, in their borrowings, supported by an Australian government guarantee, and that payments made under that guarantee will be timely. The global financial crisis continues to wreak havoc on economies around the world. Growth in many of the world's largest economies has slowed substantially, and of course some are already in recession. Australia is not immune from all of this. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook showed the global financial crisis has reduced future surpluses by $40 billion. Dodays mestic economic growth will slow significantly over the coming year. Faced with the most difficult economic conditions since the Great Depression, the Rudd government has kept a strong focus throughout on measures to protect our financial system from the fallout of the crisis. On 12 October, the government took action to stabilise and promote confidence in Australia's financial system by instituting a broadly based deposit and wholesale funding guarantee. In one stroke, the guarantee provided support to banks, credit unions and building societies in the provision of credit to Australian businesses and households, and security and peace of mind to Australian depositors. This guarantee was part of coordinated global action, which is starting to produce real results. In recent weeks, spreads have begun to narrow, and there are tentative signs that markets have started to thaw. Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens noted last week that globally coordinated action-of which our guarantee was a parthas ‘averted … potential systemic collapses that would have had massive repercussions throughout the world.' Since the initial guarantee announcement, the government has been engaged on a daily basis in putting in place all of the detailed arrangements. In recent weeks, we have settled the parameters of the guarantees, including the applicable fees and coverage. Last Friday, we released the deed of guarantee, with the specific detail on the scheme's operation. This deed will take effect from 28 November. We have consulted with regulators and industry to ensure that the guarantees are effective for our industry and to ensure that we take account of new developments as they have arisen. Providing a standing appropriation is part of this process. Let me first go to the detail of the guarantees and how they are being implemented. Deposit and wholesale funding guarantees Deposit guarantee To restate the government's deposit guarantee commitment, from 28 November, the first $1 million deposited with an Australianincorporated bank, a credit union or a building society will be guaranteed free of charge. Large deposits-that is, deposits in excess of $1 million-deposited with an Australianincorporated bank, a building society or a credit union will be eligible for the guarantee, for a fee. In addition, any deposits by Australian residents with a foreign bank branch in Australia will also be eligible for the guarantee, for a fee. These deposit guarantees will apply to accounts including, for example, savings accounts, passbook accounts, cheque accounts, pensioner deeming accounts, term deposits, mortgage offset accounts, farm management deposit accounts, first home saver accounts and retirement savings accounts. Wholesale funding guarantee In addition, from 28 November, shortterm and long-term wholesale funding for Australian-incorporated banks, building societies and credit unions, and short-term funding for foreign bank branches raised from Australian residents, will be eligible for the guarantee, for a fee. The wholesale funding guarantee will apply to selected short-term liabilities with initial maturities of up to 15 months, for example, bank bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and certain debentures. The wholesale funding guarantee will also apply to selected long-term liabilities with terms of maturity of 15 to 60 months, for example, bonds, notes and certain debentures. The wholesale funding guarantee will apply to these instruments whether they are offered domestically or in international markets. It will ensure that Australian institutions are not placed at a disadvantage when seeking funding in international markets, given that many of their international competitors have the benefit of similar government guarantees. The wholesale funding guarantee will also promote financial system stability in Australia and assist banks, building societies and credit unions to continue to access funding at a time of considerable market turbulence. Mr Speaker, the implementation of these arrangements this coming Friday is a substantial step at a time of significant turbulence in financial markets. The Australian people should be aware that the government has very strong realtime monitoring arrangements in place through the Council of Financial Regulators, whom I met with as recently as last Friday. The council will also have contingency plans in place to deal with any problems that may arise in implementation. The government stands ready to refine these arrangements in response to their advice. It is in all our interests that this happen quickly and as smoothly as possible. Implementing the guarantees It is estimated that 99.5 per cent of individual deposits held by Australians are worth $1 million or less. As a result, as of 28 November, virtually all depositors will continue to be protected, free of charge, by the Financial Claims Scheme established in the Banking Act. The Financial Claims Scheme was established by the parliament, when the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Act 2008 was passed just six weeks ago. Since 12 October 2008, the government has been working to implement the guarantee for large deposits, that is, those in excess of $1 million, and the guarantee for wholesale funding. The government's Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding is established by a deed of guarantee and associated scheme rules, which I executed on behalf of the Commonwealth on 20 November and made public the next day. The government decided that the quickest and most effective way to implement these guarantees was to use the Commonwealth's executive power to establish a contractuallybased scheme that is valid and enforceable. This follows international practice-for example the UK and New Zealand have guaranteed their wholesale funding by contract. The government's legal advice confirms that legislation is not required to implement these guarantees. This bill deals with a separate but related issue of an appropriation to cover the very unlikely event of a claim on government under the guarantee. Essentially, there are two options: one opas tion is for the government not to legislate for an appropriation now, given the extremely low probability of a claim under the guarantee. Under this option the government would legislate at the time of the call on the guarantee. The alternative option is that the government legislate for an appropriation now. During the government's consultations, banks raised concerns about doubts in international funding markets that government will be able to pass legislation with sufficient speed in the event of a claim on the guarantee. Put simply, potential investors need to be confident they can get their money quickly if a bank were to default on a loan. If they doubt quick and seamless bipartisan support for an appropriation bill, they will place too great a risk premium on lending to Australian banks. Given the opposition's recent commentary on the bank guarantee, it is now clear that quick and seamless bipartisan support could not be counted on. For our part, the government has decided it is better for us to settle the appropriation argument with the opposition now, rather than have it be an impediment to Australian banks being able to access vital funding on international markets. To reiterate, the government considers it unlikely that claims will need to be paid under the guarantee scheme because Australia's banks, building societies and credit unions remain sound, well capitalised and well regulated. No depositor of an institution supervised by APRA, or before that the RBA, has ever lost any money. Nonetheless, to give certainty to the investors providing funding to Australian banks, building societies and credit unions, and to provide certainty to those with large deposits, the government is seeking the parliament's support to pass this appropriation bill right now. Quick passage of this bill will ensure that, abilities. from 28 November, any claim under the guarantee scheme, however unlikely, will be able to be paid in a timely way. Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding The Australian Government Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding will be administered by the RBA, acting as agent for the Commonwealth. For their part, the Treasury, the RBA and APRA will cooperate closely to ensure the guarantee scheme is administered effectively. Eligible institutions-that is, eligible banks, building societies and credit unionswill need to apply for access to the guarantee scheme. The scheme is voluntary and each eligible institution can determine whether or not it takes part. Each eligible institution can also determine which of their deposits and which of their wholesale funding liabilities are covered by the guarantee scheme. Once eligible institutions have applied for coverage of their large deposits and/or wholesale funding liabilities, and the application has been accepted, these liabilities will be supported by the guarantee. Each eligible institution will be obliged to pay a fee based on the value of large deposits, or wholesale funding, it has covered by the guarantees. The guarantee scheme application process provides a number of important safeguards for the government and also for taxpayers. Transparency and accountability mechanisms To ensure transparency and accountability, the government will publish regular reports on the guarantee scheme's websitewww.guaranteescheme.gov.au-including a statement of publicly issued guaranteed liThe government can also publish on the website the details of participating institutions and the liabilities that are covered. The government will provide six-monthly reports to the parliament on the guarantee scheme's operations, including: - the extent of the liabilities covered by the guarantees; - whether any calls have been made under the guarantees for payment; and - the payments, if any, made by the Commonwealth under the guarantees. Protecting the interests of taxpayers The guarantee scheme protects the interests of taxpayers in three key ways. First, all of the eligible institutions the guarantee scheme are regulated by APRA and must already comply with stringent prudential requirements, accounting and audit rules, and reporting requirements. To have liabilities protected by the guarantee scheme, eligible institutions will need to provide a statement of compliance as a part of the application process or, alternatively, obtain special consent from APRA. Any applications with incorrect compliance statements, or without special consent from APRA, will be rejected. Second, eligible institutions will need to execute a counterindemnity that will require them to reimburse the Commonwealth for any payments made and costs incurred under the guarantee scheme. Eligible institutions will also be required to agree to abide by the scheme rules, which include a requirement that institutions have reports relating to the guarantee audited. The government also has the power to independently audit these institutions and their records. The RBA and APRA will work together in the administration of the guarantee scheme. The agencies already have a memorandum of understanding that sets out a framework for cooperation between them, which covers such matters as information sharing and consultation arrangements for the handling of threats to system stability. Third, the Council of Financial Regulators-comprising Treasury, the RBA, APRA and ASIC-will actively monitor the administration arrangements and will develop any further protocols considered necessary for effective scheme administration. Features of the Bill The bill has two substantive measures. A standing appropriation is established by under the bill to enable claims to be paid in a timely way, in the unlikely event that claims are made under the guarantee scheme. A borrowing power is also provided, should there be insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund when claims are to be paid under the guarantee scheme. The appropriation before the House is not a legal necessity for the commencement of the guarantee. Our legal advice makes that absolutely clear. Nor would it be a commercial necessity, if international markets could be confident that there would be ready bipartisan support in this parliament for an appropriation bill in the very unlikely event that one is required. Australian banks could have been pretty comfortable this support would be forthcoming, based on the Leader of the Opposition's words on the day the guarantee was announced, and I quote: The Opposition welcomes the decisions taken by the Prime Minister today to provide a guarantee for all deposits for Australian deposit taking institutions, banks, credit unions, building societies and so forth. That's a very important step and we will undertake to give the Government every assistance in ensuring that the necessary legislation is passed through the parliament promptly. As we all now know, that support has been withdrawn. That would not matter if it were just a case of the usual rough-and-tumble of politics. But in the midst of a global financial crisis, words are bullets, and the Leader of the Opposition's growing attacks on the guarantee scheme have created the seeds of doubt in the minds of global investors. We simply cannot allow those doubts to fester. It is certainly the case that the Leader of the Opposition has been issuing dark warnings about uncertainty for banks on international funding markets if legislation were not passed. I would just make the point in passing that this is a bit like a cat burglar impending crime spree. In essence, we have decided to bring this legislation forward now, to allow the Leader of the Opposition to take his pot shots at a time when they can cause least damage. This standing appropriation is an important step in our ongoing efforts to protect Australia from a global financial crisis that has already driven some of the world's largest economies into recession. It is part of an ongoing process of the Rudd government working quietly and methodically through the complex issues the nation confronts. This process will continue as global circumstances change. Our promise is that at all times, we will consult broadly, work collaboratively with regulators and with industry, and act in the national interest. I would just like to make one final point. Obviously the consultative approach we have taken to these matters means information can leak out from time to time, including to the opposition. This is inconvenient, but the government will not ever stop consulting on such important matters, whatever the political cost we incur. Of course, the national interest is more important than the political interests of anyone in this House. It is something those opposite would do well to remind themselves of. I urge the parliament to support the guarantee scheme and this bill in the interests of promoting financial system stability, confidence in Australia's banks, building societies and credit unions and in the interests of ensuring the flow of credit to Australian busiwarning of an nesses and households. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Ley) adjourned.

112,Mr MCCLELLAND,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I indicate to the House that the government proposes that amendments (2), (3) and (4) be agreed to and that amendment (1) be disagreed to but that amendments be made in place thereof. I therefore suggest that it might suit the convenience of the House to first consider amendments (2), (3) and (4) and, when those amendments have been disposed of, to then consider amendment (1). I move: That amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 be agreed to. Those amendments amend schedules 2, 4 and 5 of the bill respectively and were proposed by the government in the Senate. A number of these amendments implement recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws-Superannuation) Bill 2008. These amendments will make a number of changes to schedules 2, 4 and 5, including amending references in the bill to ‘product of a relationship', the definition of a child, to instead refer to a child of a person within the meaning of the Family Law Act 1975. It will also use the phrase ‘husband or wife or partner' instead of ‘partner' as well as the phrase ‘marital or couple relationship' instead of ‘couple relationship'. This will ensure that the term ‘marital relationship' is preserved in acts where that term appears. Question agreed to.",75
113,Mr MCCLELLAND,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I move: That amendment No. (1) be disagreed to. Senate amendment (1) amends the bill so that schedules 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the bill have retrospective effect from 1 July 2008. As previously raised by the government during the debate in the Senate, this amendment would give rise to significant legal complications which would require complex transitional and consequential amendments. However, such consequential amendments have not been included in Senate amendment (1). Any retrospective operation of the bill would require provision to be made for the Commonwealth to provide just terms compensation in respect of any acquisition of property brought about by the retrospective application of the amendments to ensure that the bill does not involve any impermissible acquisition of property for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. In addition, Senate amendment (1) would create inconsistencies between commencement of the reforms of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme as well as between the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme. This is because the PSS and the MSBS are governed by trust deeds and trust deeds cannot be amended retrospectively. As a consequence, benefits would not be extended to same-sex partners in the PSS and the MSBS from 1 July 2008 as intended by the amendment. For these reasons, I propose that the House should disagree with Senate amendment (1), but to address the substance of the issues which Senate amendment (1) was intended to address the government has proposed alternative amendments to the bill which are set out in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Question agreed to. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for the bill and proposed amendments announced.",76
114,Mr MCCLELLAND,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"I move: That government amendments Nos 1 to 4 be made in place of Senate amendment No. 1 which was disagreed to: (1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 1, column 1), omit “3”, substitute “4”.

(2) If: (a) a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the lost payments) under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and (b) because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and (c) the person makes an application to sion(s) covered by table item 2. the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the replacement payments) to compensate the person 1 July for the lost payments; 2008 the Finance Minister must make a determination, in accordance with subsection (4), to fully compensate the person. (3) If: (a) a person would have been entitled to one or more payments (the lost payments) under the Superannuation Act 1990 if the first amendment of the Trust Deed under that Act that is made after the commencement of this section had commenced on 1 July 2008; and (b) because that amendment did not commence until after 1 July 2008, the person is not entitled to the payment or payments; and (c) the person makes an application to the Finance Minister for one or more payments (the replacement payments) to compensate the person for the lost payments; the Finance Minister must make a determination, in accordance with subsection (4), to fully compensate the person. (4) A determination by the Finance Minister under this subsection must: (a) be in writing; and (b) set out: (i) the amount and timing of the replacement payments; or (ii) the method of determining the amount and timing of the replacement payments. (5) An application must be in writing in the form approved by the Finance Minister. (6) To avoid doubt, a determination of the Finance Minister that a person is entitled to one or more replacement payments does not affect the entitlements of any other person under an Act amended by Schedule 1, 2, 3 or 5 to this Act, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 or the Superannuation Act 1990. (7) Replacement payments are to be made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly. (8) A determination made under this section is not a legislative instrument. (9) In this section: Finance Minister means the Minister who administers the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The government believes that these amendments to the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth LawsSuperannuation) Bill 2008 address the concerns of the opposition and the Australian Greens by ensuring that any individual who would have been entitled to payment or payments will be compensated fully for any payments lost as a result of the delayed commencement of the bill. They also address the government's concerns regarding Senate amendment (1) because they do not require the bill to have retrospective effect. The government's proposed amendments to the bill will provide a mechanism to allow replacement payments to be made to an individual who has lost a superannuation payment or payments because these reforms did not commence on 1 July 2008. They will also amend the commencement of part 1 of schedule 2 of the bill, which inserts a definition of ‘de facto partner' into the Acts Interpretation Act to commence on royal assent. Also, the amendment will make other amendments to commencement dates for certain schedules to the bill, which the government had previously intended to move in the Senate but which it did not move because they were overtaken by the Senate's approval of the opposition's amendment. I commend the amendments to the House. I thank all those involved, including the shadow minister, for the passage of these provisions. Question agreed to.

115,Mr MCCLELLAND,SCHEDULE B,"I move: That the requested amendments be agreed to. Amendment (1) requested by the Senate will amend the definition of step-parent in section 4(1) of the Family Law Act. The amended definition of step-parent will include a current or former de facto partner of a parent of the child where he or she treats, or while the de facto partner of that parent treated, the child as a member of the family he or she formed with the parent. As a consequence, an amendment will also be made to section 66M(3)(b) of the Family Law Act, which relates to obligations of step-parents to maintain children. The amended provision requires the court to have regard to the length and circumstances of the marriage or relationship of the step-parent with the parent of the stepchild in determining whether the step-parent has a duty to maintain the stepchild. The amendment will also provide that the amendments to the Family Law Act will only affect the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act from 1 July 2009 in line with other changes to the Child Support Scheme. I commend the requested amendment to the House. Amendment (2) requested by the Senate will remove any discrimination against same-sex couples and their families in the Child Support Scheme. In summary, the amendment will, firstly, amend provisions in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 that relate to the concept of parent in order to maintain consistency between that act and the Family Law Act and, secondly, amend the definitions of ‘de facto relationship' and ‘member of a couple' in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 to recognise both sameand opposite-sex de facto relationships and registered relationships within the meaning of section 22B of the Acts Interpretation Act. It will also insert a tracing rule in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. I commend the requested amendment to the House. Question agreed to. NATION-BUILDING FUNDS BILL 2008 Cognate bills: NATION-BUILDING FUNDS (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008 COAG REFORM FUND BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November, on motion by Mr Tanner: That this bill be now read a second time.",88
116,Ms JULIE BISHOP,SCHEDULE B,"I rise this afternoon to speak on three cognate bills: the COAG Reform Fund Bill 2008, the Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 and the Nation-building Funds (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. I turn first to the COAG Reform Fund Bill. The purpose of the COAG Reform Fund is the making of grants of financial assistance to the states and territories. The COAG Reform Fund will channel payments from the three nation-building funds-the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund-and also money from annual or special appropriations to the states and territories. As stated in the COAG Reform Fund Bill, the terms and conditions on which financial assistance is to be granted are to be set out in written agreements between the Commonwealth and states or territories. The COAG Reform Fund is to be established as a special account in accordance with the Financial Management Accountability Act 1997. The Nation-building Funds Bill sets up three separate funds: the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. The bill grants the Treasurer and the finance minister power to credit money from the budget through a special account to the funds. The Future Fund Board of Guardians and the Future Fund Management Agency will manage the investments for all the funds under the Future Fund Act 2006. The building fund will have an initial capital of $12.6 billion$7.5 billion from the Howard government's 2007-08 surplus as calculated at the end of June 2008 plus the proceeds from the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 3) Bill 2008 and the balance of the coalition's Communications Fund. The education fund will have $8.7 billion-$2.5 billion from the Howard government's 2007-08 surplus and the remainder from the coalition government's Higher Education Endowment Fund. The health fund will have $5 billion, to be funded entirely from the Howard government's 2007-08 surplus. The three funds will therefore have a total of $26.3 billion on their inception on 1 January 2009. The government did announce in the 2008 budget that there would be $41 billion in these funds by 1 July 2009. The size of the funds must now be considerably smaller than was originally promised by the government, unless of course the government chooses to go into deficit to meet its commitments regarding the size of these funds. Based on current figures, there will be a shortfall of $14.7 billion due to the government's recent decision to spend half the forecast budget surplus. It is important for all Australians to note that this Labor government has not ever delivered a surplus. All funding that Labor is currently using is the legacy of the coalition, and that legacy includes the paying off of the $96 billion of Labor's debt from the last time Labor was in government. The repayment of that debt and the consequence that the government no longer had to find the $9 billion each year just to pay the interest on Labor's $96 billion debt-that $9 billion that should have been going to infrastructure had to fund the interest payments on Labor's debt-was achieved in full by the coalition in 2006. The Rudd government is in the extremely fortunate position, unlike most other comparable governments around the world, of having no net government debt, thanks to the vision, the prudence and the strong economic management of the coalition when in government. Notwithstanding the fact that the Rudd Labor government inherited a $20 billion surplus on the day it came into office, it is now forecasting a surplus of just $5.4 billion, and there are serious doubts about that forecast. It forecast a surplus of more than $21 billion in the budget, but that forecast is in tatters. The coalition supports the targeted, careful and prudent use of public money for worthwhile nation-building projects. In fact the coalition government invested huge sums in projects to upgrade Australia's transport, communications, education and health infrastructure during its time in office. In addition, the coalition undertook the single most important reform of Commonwealth-state funding relations since Federation when it introduced the GST, with all revenue going to the state governments. The GST has provided state governments with greater long term certainty and independence in their funding base. I would like nothing more than to stand here today and say that these additional funds were invested wisely by state governments. But, regrettably, over recent years these governments were mostly Labor state governments. The fact is that state Labor has not invested that additional revenue wisely. Respected economist Henry Ergas, in his 2007 report titled State of the states, found there was a massive increase in revenue to state and territory governments in 2005-06 compared with 1999-2000 as a result of the GST. However, Dr Ergas found that while most of the $43.4 billion windfall-let me repeat that: the $43.4 billion windfall-was spent on the provision of government services, particularly health, education, law and order, and transport and communications, there was very little improvement in service delivery, and in many cases it went backwards. Dr Ergas found that a very substantial part of the increased funding went to higher wages for public servants and increasing the numbers of public servants-increasing the public sector. Only a very small percentage of that windfall, of that funding to state Labor governments, was invested in the states' infrastructure. That is why the federal coalition has serious concerns about the management of these funds and about ensuring they are not used to prop up incompetent state Labor governments that have failed to invest in their own infrastructure, state Labor governments that have largely squandered the opportunities provided by the GST windfall. For example, the coalition is concerned that the Commonwealth investments may in fact replace previously planned state and territory public works for no net economic gain. State governments may simply take infrastructure projects off their own books and bid for federal funds. Why would we think this? In the recent New South Wales mini-budget, the Rees government listed four infrastructure priority projects that had been submitted to Infrastructure Australia and stated that they: … will only proceed before 2012 if they are substantially funded by the Commonwealth. A week before the mini-budget the intention was that these projects would be 100 per cent funded by the New South Wales state government. Is cooperative federalism under Labor just a code for cover-up federalism? The issue of probity and transparency has been called into question by the revelations in the Sydney Morning Herald that former New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma was told by federal Labor not to apply for funds for the North-West Metro as there were ‘no votes in it for federal Labor'. The Age newspaper reported a rift between the federal Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government over the key issue of ministerial discretion and how funds will be distributed from the Building Australia Fund. Concerns that these moneys could be used as a slush fund were further exacerbated by media reports that the original Building Australia Fund legislation was delayed from introduction into this House by the minister for infrastructure because, according to the reports, it gave him insufficient ministerial discretion over how the money would be allocated. True to the form of New South Wales Labor, the minister for infrastructure wanted more discretion over project approvals, and we know what that means in terms of funding for marginal Labor electorates. Labor code is not very subtle. If ministers in the Rudd Labor government cannot agree on how this legislation will work and on accountability measures to ensure the money is spent wisely, how can the opposition-and the Australian public-be confident that funding will be invested in the national interest rather than in the self-serving interests of the Labor Party? The coalition, when in government, spent more on nation building than any Commonwealth government since Federation, and I predict that the coalition's record for infrastructure funding will exceed that of the Rudd government. For example, the coalition established the Higher Education Endowment Fund with an initial investment of $6 billion in 2007. Our vision was for this fund to be a perpetual growth fund, with further injections of capital from the government and hopefully from state governments and from the private sector to provide a source of growth funding for our universities-in perpetuity, not subject to the vagaries of election cycles. It was part of the coalition's vision vide universities with greater independence through this fund and to support efforts at fostering world-class research and teaching infrastructure. It was to inculcate a culture of philanthropy through an endowment fund for our universities. I was education minister at the time. I had been impressed by the endowment structures held by the great universities of the world, particularly in the United States. I noted the efforts of the United Kingdom government to build on the endowment funds for Oxford and Cambridge. I had the long-term vision that one of our universities would be included in the top 10 universities in the world, supported by public and private sector endowment funds. The Higher Education Endowment Fund preserved the capital with the earnings on the investment allocated each year for worldclass infrastructure and research projects. In contrast, the Rudd government has no understanding of an endowment fund, no understanding of a perpetuity fund. The Rudd government will spend the capital. It will not be an endowment fund for generations to come; it will be spent in the short term. What a lost opportunity of serious proportions should the education fund be spent in its entirety within a few short years! Labor would have you believe that the coalition did not invest in education infrastructure, but this is simply not true. The Howard government provided record funding for school education every year. A record $3 billion in federal funding was provided for new capital works for schools from 2005 to 2008, and this included the hugely successful and popular Investing in Our Schools Program abolished by the Rudd Labor government. As most members would recall, this was a program that provided grants to support the priorities of individual schools in the public and private sectors and gave them the to proindependence to decide what was best for their schools without having the federal government dictate its agenda to them. Schools were able to invest in a range of priority projects, including computers and technology if those were their priority need-and indeed almost $130 million was used for that purpose. The coalition also established a network of Australian technical colleges to provide an incentive for students to study years 11 and 12 while also undertaking technical education and training. Many of the students would have otherwise left school and may have fallen through the cracks and not undertaken further training. The strength of the model was the strong links with local employers and the community. Labor has abolished this program. Commonwealth spending on health more than doubled under the coalition from $20 billion in 1995-96 to $48 billion in 2006-07. The coalition also provided record funding to medical research and research infrastructure during its time in government. Once we had paid off Labor's debt we were able to establish the Higher Education Endowment Fund and we were able to establish a health and medical infrastructure fund with $2.5 billion, the capital to be preserved in perpetuity with earnings from the fund to help build capacity in health and medical research. As Minister for Education, Science and Training at the time. I was delighted that amongst the long list of health and medical research institutions to receive funding under the coalition grants were, for example: $100 million towards the creation of the first ity in the Southern Hemisphere for developing new lifesaving biopharmaceuticals at Princess Alexandra Hospital and the University of Queensland, $100 million towards the construction of two innovative research facilities at the Western Australian Institutes for Health, $55 million for a new 13-storey medical research facility at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, $50 million towards a new world-class facility at Murdoch Children's Research Institute-the list went on and on. Amongst that list I was delighted to be able to announce $50 million in Commonwealth government funding to contribute to the operating costs of the Australian Synchrotron. The Synchrotron is and will be a world-class facility performing leading-edge science. In the area of roads, it was the coalition that established AusLink 1 and AusLink 2, which revolutionised the planning and funding of Australia's national road and rail networks and established a coordinated national approach to transport infrastructure development including national investment priorities. The coalition allocated $15 billion for AusLink from 2004-05 to 2008-09 and an additional $22.2 billion was committed in the 2007-08 budget to AusLink 2 with funding going out to 2013-14-long-term investment, long-term planning. Almost 200 transport projects of national significance were funded by AusLink under the coalition government. In the area of communications, the coalition invested to ensure broadband, mobile phone coverage and other services were upgraded and improved. Billions of dollars were invested to provide improved services, particularly in rural and regional areas where private sector investment lagged behind that taking place in larger cities. The programs were structured to cater to the needs and prifacilorities of regional communities to support their priorities. Turning to the coalition's concerns about these particular bills, the government's bills do not provide a transparent and accountable framework. The funds are unlikely to reach the government's target, given just a few months ago, and have little prospect for growth for the next three years. But the explanatory memorandum states that where specific projects have an ongoing cost component it is intended that such funding would be sourced through other means. Now this could include direct funding from the budget outside the Building Australia Fund or funding by the states or territories in relation to proposals that are brought forward as part of the current reform agenda. But running costs for the states and territories will be particularly high for health, research and education projects, for a start, because of high staffing costs. With state Labor governments increasingly in debt one has to ask: where is the funding going to come from? The splitting of capital costs and ongoing operational and maintenance costs could lead to instances where the whole-of-life costs of an asset are not properly considered when these funds are being invested. A whole-of-life costing approach means that the cost of the project is considered over its lifetime, self-evidently. It includes not just capital but ongoing operational, maintenance, replacement and service costs. We have reason to be concerned about federal Labor's behaviour in this area. A recent example of the failure to undertake a whole-of life approach is Labor's shambolic computers in schools policy, where funds for the installation and maintenance of the computers and training were not allocated. We have seen state governments refusing to stump up with the funding for a federal Labor election promise. Labor's much-vaunted $1.2 billion digital education revolution grossly underfunded the real cost of providing a computer to each student in years 9 to 12. And, given that there are nearly one million students eligible for a computer and that the government has so far provided about 10 per cent in its first year, it does not appear that there is any hope that this election ise will be met in this term of government or anytime soon. Further, there is a recurring problem with this government in that it routinely makes decisions without any serious economic analysis underpinning those decisions-in fact, any analysis at all, as it turns out. The Rudd government has bungled Fuelwatch, the education revolution, the ready-to-drink tax, GROCERYchoice and the bank guarantees, to name a few. And in each instance there was no analysis and no modelling-or, at least, none the government was prepared to make public-and, from the quality of the outcomes, it must have all been back-of-theenvelope stuff. Take Fuelwatch. Labor introduced Fuelwatch without regard to the advice of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance and Deregulation and other departments that Fuelwatch was, at best, pointless and, at worse, harmful. The introduction of the digital education revolution was made without any analysis of the costs of the program to the states or to the schools or parents. The promise of a computer for every year 9 to year 12 student is unachievable for Labor's budget. The increased tax on ready-to-drink beverages ignored research that showed drinkers would turn to relatively cheaper substitutes, including spirits by the bottle or even illegal drugs, and that these substitutes are likely to be more harmful. Likewise, GROCERYchoice was done without any analysis. It has been obvious from the day of its announcement that the consequences of the bank guarantees had not been fully thought through. The consequences might have been unintended but they were certainly foreseeable. Rather, as is typical with the Rudd government, the bank guarantees were from the first all about a political strategy, with no prom- regard for sound economic management. Since the announcement of the bank guarantee policy, the government have been continually playing catch-up to correct a series of unintended but largely foreseeable difficulties arising from their hasty actions. It is for this reason that we will be debating yet another bill later this afternoon, which has been introduced in great haste with little information to provide an appropriations framework for the guarantees. All these government initiatives have been conspicuous by the absence of rigorous analysis and the coalition is concerned that the same poor approach to public policy will occur with the significant amounts of public money in these three funds. The lack of analysis underpinning a range of government decisions, including the recent economic stimulus, raises concerns that the government will choose projects with little regard to their long-term benefits. These recent government decisions, including the decision to spend half the budget surplus in one hit but without any modelling or research, as Treasury admitted in Senate estimates, have had little analysis. There has been nothing public and there is nothing to show that they will achieve the desired result. The Reserve Bank governor said recently: … it is still important for fiscal measures to pass the ‘good policy' test. Poor public policy proposals should not be accepted simply because they are presented as boosting short-term aggregate demand … Putting all these concerns together, the coalition worries that the Rudd government is going down the same path as the failed, incompetent, corrupt New South Wales Labor government: wasting money, with little or no accountability and with an increasing risk of continuing budget deficits. Given the coalition's strong record in infrastructure funding, we support in principle the stated objectives of these bills to recreate funds from the existing coalition funds to provide for valuable infrastructure around Australia. However, to put it bluntly, we do not trust Labor to manage these funds appropriately and, in the interests of safeguarding taxpayer funds and in the interests of good public policy, I foreshadow a number of amendments to the Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 that reflect the following principles. First, we will seek to insert transparency clauses to require the public disclosure of all documentation-for example, evaluation criteria, business cases, cost-benefit analysis and advisory board evaluation against criteria relating to proposed projects. Let me give you an example of why we are insisting on such a transparency clause, why we do not trust Labor on the issue of accountability and transparency. Let me just use the example of the government's emissions trading scheme. The green paper released by the government offends against numerous standards set out in the government's own best practice guidelines. This is a stark reminder that the government does not adhere to best practice guidelines when it comes to cost-benefit analysis and accountability. Second, we will seek to add a requirement that money may only be spent on projects that have been analysed by the Productivity Commission, with those commission reports being made public. Third, we will seek to ensure that the determinations by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer that credit money into the accounts are disallowable instruments. Fourth, we will seek to ensure that money will be spent only on projects that satisfy competitive neutrality guidelines-that is, the public sector cannot undercut private businesses in the provision of services. Fifth, we will seek to ensure that all reports to the finance minister from the advisory boards and the Future Fund board are made public. Sixth, we will seek to insert a clause which requires that all project funding decisions need to ensure that there are financial commitments from all asset owners and stakeholders to meet the whole-of-life asset costs. Seventh, we will seek to prohibit the payment of up-front fees on projects in situations where the federal government puts in its money but the state or the private sector does not. Also, we will seek to maintain the existing Communications Fund as a separate fund for ensuring that there is money available in perpetuity for new and emerging technologies. We will bring forward these amendments in the hope that the government will understand the importance of sound and considered legislation when dealing with significant amounts of public money. While we have seen no evidence in the past year that the government has any regard for sound legislation or good financial management, it is the duty of the opposition to hold the government to account and to ensure that it serves the Australian people responsibly.",88
117,Mr BUTLER,SCHEDULE B,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 and related bills, because they reflect the fact that the Labor Party under Kevin Rudd came to government with a very clear agenda to build the long-term productive capacity of our nation. That is in stark contrast to the previous government, which, in the face of a resources boom that, frankly, none of us had seen before, took the opportunity to simply sit back, put their feet up and suck on a pina colada while the Chinese yuan flowed over them with gay abandon. We take a different view on this side of the House. We take that view against the background of a very long history of nation building. It is true that the immediate economic circumstances have changed dramatically since both the election and the first stage of this program-the introduction of the Infrastructure Australia Bill earlier this year. But it is equally clear that the social and economic imperatives behind this package of bills have not changed. Along with the education revolution and Minister Wong's climate change agenda, the renewal of our social and economic infrastructure is one of the three key pillars of this government's program. All three pillars are critical to building the long-term prosperity of Australia. They come against the background of some 20 warnings by the Reserve Bank of Australia about capacity constraints that have been growing in the economy of this country for many months. When that is raised, those opposite usually scream, ‘Well, table them!' I have not tabled them but I did flick into one folder that was handy which contained 2006 RBA and other economic papers. I looked at then Governor Macfarlane's speech to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration in February 2006. After discussing various global disinflationary forces at play, he said: The issue, over the period ahead, will be whether these latter forcesnamely, those global disinflationary forcesprove sufficient to contain inflation in an omy operating with little spare capacity. Some months later in the RBA statement on monetary policy in May 2006, the Reserve Bank stated: In summary, the economic situation reviewed by the Board has for some time been one in which international conditions have been favourable to growth in Australia, the economy has been operating with limited spare capacity, and underlying inflation has been forecast to increase gradually. In these circumstances, the Board had taken the view that the next move in interest rates was more likely to be up than down, and this was signalled in the Bank's policy statements. For a considerable period of time a number of constraints on our productivity, and hence drivers of higher inflation and higher interest rates, have been readily apparent. The previous government did nothing to address them. The first readily apparent driver of inflation and interest rates over the last few years has been very clear skills and labour shortages. Under the previous government there was no skills agenda. There was a very willing ideological fight between the previous government and various state governments about what type of building should house vocational training-whether it should be a TAFE college or a technical college. There was also a flawed 457 visa scheme, but no overarching, meaningful skills agenda. In contrast, in addition to the education revolution, which has been the subject of significant debate in this chamber over the last couple of days, 630,000 training places have been promised by the new Rudd Labor government and have already started to flow to industries that have been crying out for trained workers. Under the previous government there was a dismal record on workforce participation, in spite of a very significant period of economic growth. Australia remains in the bottom half of OECD tables in key age groups for workforce participation-in particular, econparticipation by women, which has been the cause of significant employment growth over the last couple of decades. We have seen women's participation plateau at about 58 per cent of the available female workforce. That is about 10 per cent lower than the female participation rate in the United Kingdom and Canada and about 15 per cent lower than that in most Scandinavian countries. But, again, we saw no serious policy agenda to deal with that-in stark contrast to the different agendas that our government has. The second significant drag on productivity growth in the long-term prosperity of our country has been in the area of infrastructure. To appreciate the depth of that deficit I would like to talk about the economic context. Since 1991 we have experienced uninterrupted growth in our economy, on the back of the significant economic reforms introduced by the Hawke and Keating governments. Over that time we have moved from about the 17th richest countrymeasured by per capita GDP-to the seventh highest per capita GDP in the world. Over the last several years in particular we have seen our terms of trade dramatically increase with a huge injection to national income and, consequently, a huge increase in Commonwealth government tax receipts. The Business Council of Australia recently estimated windfalls in the last five years of the previous government-that is, income not budgeted for-to be in the order of $87 billion. On any measure, this was a historical opportunity to invest in the nation's long-term prosperity. But instead nothing happened. All members in this House, and probably in the other place as well, have a long list of infrasaid structure gaps and ageing assets in their own electorates. From an electoral perspective, a more scientific analysis than our own perhaps rather parochial analyses of infrastructure in Australia was conducted by Infrastructure Partnerships Australia in a cant report entitled Australia's Infrastructure Priorities: securing our prosperity. In this very detailed report IPA details infrastructure deficits in the areas of ports, roads with the land freight task projected to double by 2020. In the area of energy, ABARE-the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics-estimates that $30 billion to $35 billion of investment would be required in Australia's energy sector by 2020. Importantly to me as a South Australian member of this House, the IPA report also looked at the area of water. In these and other key sectors of the economy, we know that demand is already straining capacity. Forecasts show that demand is going to grow dramatically, and these infrastructure deficits-on ageing assets, by and large-are going to get far more severe. This will happen especially as our international gateways become more globally connected. In the minister for infrastructure's second reading speech on the Infrastructure Australia Bill, he pointed out to the House that international container trade was forecast to triple by 2020 and international air travel was forecast to increase by 160 per cent by 2025. These are increases which will put incredible strain on already strained infrastructure in those international gateways. But in some sectors you do not need to look out to 2020 or 2025 to see the infrastructure deficit already constraining economic growth-for example, if you look at the powerhouse of our national economy over the last few years, the Western Australian resources sector. Don Argus, a very prominent and widely respected businessperson, last month that he was deeply concerned about infrastructure performance over the last decade. An article in the West Australian on 8 September 2008 reported: Don Argus, chairman of BHP Billiton, … last week fleshed out some future infrastructure resignifi- quirements in just a few areas. He said the ramp-up in expected iron ore and coal exports will require the equivalent of eight new 50 million tonne ports by 2015 at an estiand rail, mated cost of $16 billion. If you want to get your head around that, consider that Fremantle Port handles about 29 million tonnes a year. Mr Argus said Australia's infrastructure capital stock to GDP ratio had fallen 10 per cent over the past 12 years (which neatly covers the term of John Howard). To get it back to where it was back in the 1990s would require $103 billion in spending. ‘Australia does need better infrastructure policy to attract the necessary private sector investment,' he said. Estimates of our infrastructure deficit vary a little-the Business Council, for example, recently estimated that the deficit was in the order of $90 billion-but everyone agrees that it is significant. At the end of the previous government's term, Australia ranked about 20th out of 25 OECD countries in terms of its public infrastructure investment-and, to be fair, we are not alone. Countries such as the United States are also labouring under a significant infrastructure deficit. After the bridge collapse in Minneapolis earlier this year, the Economist magazine reported: … the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that $1.6 trillion was needed over five years to bring just the existing infrastructure good repair. Equally, as we are not alone in experiencing a significant infrastructure deficit, this government is not alone in its resolve to address years of neglect. Only in the last couple of days, President-elect Obama has indicated his intention to give the renewal and repair of America's infrastructure the sort of priority the Rudd government have given infrastructure here in our own country. For the interest of the House, the Economist at about the same time reported that emerging economies in the world are predicted to spend in the order of US$22 trillion over the next decade in infrastructure spending. China alone is predicted to spend almost US$10 trillion between now and 2017. Historical comparisons of our infrastructure investment are complicated by two factors: firstly, many public entities that have historically been responsible for driving and spending money on public infrastructure have over the last decade or two been privamid- tised; and, secondly, we have seen the private sector's entry into the public infrastructure market in a very big way, particularly through public-private partnerships, or PPPs. As difficult as those historical comparisons are, if you do adjust for those changes to the way in which the public infrastructure market operates, you can see that our public infrastructure spend as a country is not significantly different from what it was in the late 1980s as a percentage of our GDP. Given the terms of trade and the increase in national income that we have enjoyed over the last several years, that is a very, very poor performance. To be fair, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition belaboured significantly, this is not just the fault of the previous Commonwealth government; the performance of state governments in this area has been highly variable, to put it politely. As a South Austrainto lian member of this House I am lucky that our own state government has had a state infrastructure plan in place for many years, operating under a very talented state infrastructure minister. In South Australia our infrastructure performance has been particularly good where it concerns the connection between goods and ports, a subject. I am particularly interested in as the representative for Port Adelaide. We have seen the Port River Expressway project completed. We have seen the Northern Expressway, which connects our port to various northern product markets, commence and proceed according to schedule. We have seen the bridges over the river open. We have seen the deepening of our harbour to take in the new container ships that ply their trade through the world's oceans. That was well before Melbourne got their act together to start doing theirs. There are many more examples. However, the variability of the states' formance in this area is only more reason for the Commonwealth government to have taken a central role much earlier than has happened. This government will take that role, as is well known now. This government has introduced the first Commonwealth infrastructure minister and the first Commonwealth infrastructure department, and one of this government's earliest acts was to establish Infrastructure Australia under the chairpersonship of Sir Rodney Eddington, with very significant and widely respected board members to oversee the development of a list of national infrastructure priorities. This bill provides for the investment of three funds in the pursuit of those objectives: firstly, the Building Australia Fund through IA; secondly, the Education Investment Fund of about $11 billion, where money may be expended for capital expenditure projects or renewal projects in universities, vocational education and training institutions and various research facilities; and, thirdly, the Health and Hospitals Fund, which at $10 billion will be the single largest investment in health infrastructure ever by an Australian government. I note that the Minister for Health and Ageing recently announced the chair of that advisory board, a very prominent and respected Australian, Mr Bill Ferris. In contrast, again, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's lecture on transparency, the approvals process for the expenditure of money from these funds could not be more different from the previous government's approach to these things. All funds have the same formula for this, so rather than going through three different processes that are essentially the same I will just look at the Building Australia Fund, which is focused on the development of transport and communications infrastructure. This fund is made up of about $7.5 billion from the 2007-08 surperplus, plus proceeds of the T3, or Telstra 3, sale and assets of the Communications Fund, which is to be closed-although I note the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's indication that amendments will be moved in that respect. The government will add to the Building Australia Fund and other funds from future surpluses as is appropriate and as economic circumstances allow. Importantly, the funds will be managed in exactly the same way as the Future Fund was set up to be managed by the previous government. For the Building Australia Fund, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will be required to formulate evaluation criteria to be applied by Infrastructure Australia when, firstly, evaluating projects and, secondly, providing advice to the infrastructure minister and other relevant ministers on the expenditure of funds. The bill provides that Infrastructure Australia is to provide the minister with advice about potential payments from the Building Australia Fund and that the minister is legally obliged to have regard to that advice before recommending any payment from the Building Australia Fund. This rigour, transparency and accountability stand in stark contrast to the approach of the previous government to the expenditure of funds in these areas. I need only draw the attention of the House to the regional rorts projects, which have been the subject of significant debate over the last 12 months and one day in this House. I do not intend to go over those examples-only because time does not permit, not through lack of inclination; I would like nothing better, but time does not permit. Suffice it to say that numerous examples have been presented to this House by the minister for infrastructure, and I think that they are evidence enough of the previous government's poor performance in rigour, transparency and accountability in this area. These bills provide for a visionary, long overdue and vigorous approach to our long term prosperity in three areas of the utmost importance to the long-term growth and skills base of our country: the national economic and social infrastructure, the education sector-leading to the building of a long-term skills and training base in our country-and, just as importantly, the need to put in place a health and hospitals infrastructure that will meet the long-term health demands of a growing and ageing population. These bills together mark an extraordinarily exciting new future for our country, and I commend them strongly to the House.",94
118,Mr HOCKEY,SCHEDULE B,"The Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 establishes three separate financial assets funds: the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. These funds were announced by the Rudd government earlier this year as part of its first budget. The Building Australia Fund will have initial capital of $12.6 billion. Seven and a half billion dollars has come from the Howard government's 200708 surplus, and there are also the proceeds from the third tranche of Telstra, initiated the Howard government and opposed by Labor, which come to $2.7 billion. The balance of the proposed $12.6 billion, which is $2.4 billion, comes out of the Communications Fund, set up and funded by the Howard government. So every dollar of the $12.6 billion in the Building Australia Fund has come from the previous government, even from decisions that were opposed all the way by the other mob, the Labor Party. How ironic it is! The education fund will have $8.7 billion in it on 1 January. Two and a half billion comes from the last coalition surplus and the remainder from the coalition Higher Education Endowment Fund. So every dollar of the $8.7 billion education fund is coming from the previous government. Of course, it all comes from hard working taxpayers-it is all their money-but it is all money that has come from the previous government. The third fund is the health fund, and that will have $5 billion in it. Every dollar of that comes from the last coalition budget as well-the surplus out of 2007-08. So when the funds are set up on 1 January 2009-next year-every single dollar of the $26.3 billion in the funds will have come from the work of the previous government and the blood, sweat and tears of Australian taxpayers. Not one dollar has been delivered by the Rudd government. I asked the Treasurer the question in question time today, and in his own little sneaky way he said, ‘Oh, no; we'll be contributing the money on 1 January.' It is not his money. It is not even the coalition's money. It is taxpayers' money, and it is the proceeds of the mining boom. It is the much maligned proceeds that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer suggest to the Australian people were squandered. If the money was squandered, what is this magic pudding that is going to appear on 1 January of $26.3 billion? If the money was squandered, as the Prime Minisby ter and the Treasurer suggest, where did they get $26.3 billion for 1 January? Where? Labor have not delivered a surplus budget yet. They talk about a surplus budget. They say they have a surplus budget. They have not delivered a surplus budget yet. It is interesting because the money that the government was going to contribute from 1 January next year until July next year was going to take the money in the funds to $41 billion. But that was based on a surplus this year. Currently, they are projecting a $5 billion surplus this year. Pigs might fly! I do not believe that Labor is capable of delivering a surplus budget. We will see. I might be totally wrong. I hope I am wrong. I hope there is a budget surplus this year. I hope the government has the capacity left in the budget to be able to provide for those emergency measures which the global financial crisis will inevitably throw up over the next 12 to 18 months-the emergency measures that will need to be funded by Australian taxpayers to stimulate the economy, to, God forbid, rescue companies or to get industries back on their feet after they have fallen over. God forbid that that should have to happen, but everywhere else in the world that is happening. Yet the government seems to be spending every dollar it has even before it is desperately needed for some of the challenges that are coming like a train down the tunnel. The building funds in total will have a shortfall of nearly $15 billion, and that is the outset. Whatever money they have in them on 1 January next year will be money that was bequeathed by the previous coalition government. I want to get on the record where this money has come from, as it is very important. In 1996, when the coalition were elected and John Howard became Prime Minister and Paul Keating lost, there was $96 billion of Labor debt. The coalition faced the prospect of annual deficits of $10 billion. The coalition were facing paying $8 billion a year out of the budget just to pay the interest-not the principal-on that $96 billion of debt. The first thing we did was make sure that the government did not spend on an annual basis more money than it collected. Mr Billson-Budget black hole.",99
119,Mr HOCKEY,SCHEDULE B,"The Beazley black hole-$10 billion and growing. That was the first thing we did. As with a household budget, we made sure we did not spend more money each year than we were collecting. That was hard. Those are the hard decisions you usually make at the beginning of your term, not that we have seen any from my mate the Prime Minister. There have been no hard decisions yet. The second thing we did was pay off the $96 billion of debt. We are the envy of the world at the moment because we do not have any net government debt. We have this inbuilt structural capacity to respond to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. We can do that only because we as a government do not have any net debt. Guess what? Kicked in the backside with a rainbow, the new government come into office and do not have a structural deficit or a budget that is constantly in deficit; they have a budget with a $20 billion surplus. What do they do? They put it into these funds. I think there is great irony in this. From a at political perspective some would say, ‘I can't believe you left them with all the money.' I care more about Australia than I do about my own political fortune. Thank God we left them with money, because Australia would be in a far worse position today if it were running a deficit, if it had significant national debt and if the government were facing the sort of massive financial distress that so many other governments around the world are facing. If you believe the Prime Minister, the previous coalition government did not spend one dollar on infrastructure. There is some irony in that. In the last five years of the coalition government alone we spent $40 billion on vital economic infrastructure such as roads and rail. It is a bit like in the Monty Python film: ‘What did the Romans ever do for us?' They did not build roads or rail, but the coalition government actually put $40 billion into roads and rail. I am sorry I do not have the quote with me at the moment, but a Labor Premier said the other day that the previous coalition government spent a huge amount of money on infrastructure and capital works. But if you believe the emperorthe Prime Minister-the coalition government did not do anything. In the same breath as he said that the coalition did not do anything for infrastructure, the Prime Minister said he would continue our $23 billion AusLink program, which I am sure even the member for Eden-Monaro would support as AusLink is quite a contributor to roads in regional Australia. We also witnessed a massive expansion of private investment in capital works during the previous term of government. In fact, during 2008-09, this current financial year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that around $100 billion of new private capithe tal expenditure will go into the marketplace. One of the reasons we did not have extreme levels of expenditure on capital works over the last few years was that the Australian economy was arguably already in danger of overheating. There was a massive amount of private equity coming into the marketplace; there were already massive expenditure programs from state governments, who have always had primary responsibility for capital works; and at the same time the federal government, under the coalition, was introducing AusLink and spending enormous amounts of money on other capital works. With the massive amount of private investment in the mining industry and the massive amount of government investment in state infrastructure, together with the massive growth in private-public partnerships, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria-we saw toll roads, the M7, the expansion of the M4, the ill-fated cross-city tunnel, the Lane Cove tunnel, railway projects to airports and a range of other things around the countrythere was a fairly convincing argument that there was no shortage of money going into capital works. So we started to put it into other investments, and one of those was the Communications Fund: $2.4 billion to ensure that the bush was not left behind as new technology was rolled out. The state governments continue to carry most of the burden of public sector infrastructure spending. In New South Wales alone the last Costa budget, earlier this year, promised $57 billion over the next four years in capital works. That massively exceeded what this government is proposing on its own fund-and that is just New South Wales, roughly a third of the national budget. If you take that as a benchmark, the states alone would be spending at least $170 billion on infrastructure over the next four years. So contribution of the Rudd government is very limited. Given that, of the $12.6 billion it is putting into the building fund, $5 billion is for broadband, that means there is only $7.6 billion for this grand nation-building program. And, given that there is no top-up out of the non-existent surplus this year and that at question time today the Treasurer would not commit to putting in further new funds, you have to ask: how far is this $7.6 billion going to go? It would not get you 60 per cent of the canned North West Metro in Sydney. We are talking about $7.6 billion spent over a number of years-and this is somehow going to be a fiscal stimulus, they tell us. Even if you have the most insignificant major infrastructure projects, $7.6 billion is very difficult to spend in one year, so it could be over two years or three years. What is interesting is that the states have long lists of projects that they think the federal government is going to fund out of this $7.6 billion fund. This is going to be the loaves and fishes. This is a commitment of biblical proportions. You are going to get a loaves and fishes story with $7.6 billion in the Building Australia Fund. The Leader of the House, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, is going to be travelling around Australia with his wand and touching projects. He is going to give birth to projects and he is going to say, ‘Let them grow.' He has $7.6 billion for-what?-300 projects. I can't wait to see this! We want greater accountability, of course. We want accountability in these bills. We want accountability for the funding and for the expenditure. I make two important points, and I flag that there will be a number of amendments moved by the coalition in the Senate. One point is this: there is nothing in these funds for ongoing maintenance. We want the government to explain where the money to run these capital works projects is going to come from. If the money goes to build a hospital, the benchmark used by the private sector is that for every dollar spent building a hospital it costs a dollar equivalent to run each year: if you spend $1 billion building a hospital, that hospital usually costs $1 billion a year to run. So the first question is: where is the maintenance money and the operational money associated with all these projects going to come from? Is it going to come from the funds? Is it going to come from state governments? Is it going to come from the private sector? The second point, which is vitally important, is that we want to see that there is a proper transparency. We want to ensure not only that there is transparency about the way the money is spent but that the funding meets the criterion that the Prime Minister himself has set, and that is that the projects are going to improve the productive capacity of the nation. Finally, I would say this: every time the government says that this is a fiscal stimulus I would caution them to be careful. A $7.6 billion spend out of the Building Australia Fund over a number of years is hardly a fiscal stimulus. The most significant stimulatory moment associated with the funds is going to be when they actually operate and they improve the productive capacity of the nation, if they do that. But I would also say this: it is not going to be any of these projects that stimulates the Australian economy if you believe the Prime Minister's own words, uttered on 18 November at the local governments meeting: Infrastructure takes time to build, infrastructure takes time to plan, infrastructure takes time to design and all that hinges on first-class planning. That does not sound like an immediate fiscal stimulation to me. That does not sound like it is going to rocket the Australian economy out of the global financial crisis, all the way with Kev. I do not think it is going to happen because the Prime Minister, by his very own words, says that these projects will take a long time. The interesting thing is that not only will they take a long time but there is not the money that the government were anticipating by the time you take out the $5 billion they spent on broadband and look at the expectations that they have built in relation to health and hospitals. Bear in mind, as I have said before, that for every dollar spent on hospitals you are going to have to spend a dollar each year maintaining and running the capital program. That is a very important point. Probably a significant part of education expenditure would be the same. It is one thing to build a school; it is another thing to put air conditioning in and, as we know, it is another thing to put computers in. Then you have to put teachers in. Then obviously you have the day-today maintenance costs of all that equipment, and the more sophisticated the infrastructure the more demanding the maintenance and the operating costs. I will just say this to the government: we will be moving amendments in the Senate. We would like to see greater transparency and greater accountability and, importantly, we would like to see the money that is going to go towards maintaining and operating the assets that are built. Finally, I make this point: every day the Prime Minister must wake up and say, ‘Thank God for John Howard and the previous government,' because none of the money in these funds would exist if not for the hard work of the previous coalition government, despite the opposition of the Labor Party to all of these measures.",100
120,Dr KELLY,SCHEDULE B,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (6.09 pm)-It is very interesting to low the member for North Sydney and his comments in relation to the lack of planning. There was 12 years of that and a lot of catchup has to be done. It is with great excitement and pride that we on this side of the House welcome the introduction of the aptly titled Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 and the associated bills-in particular, the COAG Reform Fund Bill 2008, which establishes a mechanism for the transfer of moneys to the states and territories. The measures that will be brought into effect by this primary bill will drive this country forward. Not only will they finally address the capacity constraints that have held back our economy for too long but, in the context of the current financial crisis, they will have the added timely benefit of helping to offset the impacts of crisis. These measures will in fact build on the interim $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy that passed through the House during the last sittings and the stimulus to local government spending emerging from the Australian Council of Local Government conference on 18 November to see us through these difficult times. They will also position us to take advantage of the inevitable economic rebound. The government's strategy and nationbuilding agenda is a shot in the arm for the Australian economy in the face of the most substantial economic challenges we have faced since the Great Depression. It is a salurevelation. tary illustration of the increased interdependthat ence of the international economy. For example, who could have imagined that a decision made by the Irish government regarding savings guarantees would have had such a knock-on effect around the world? The International Monetary Fund now expects growth of less than one per cent in six of the world's largest developed economies next year. This will be the slowest growth in developed economies for over a quarter of a fol- century. The Australian government has acted quickly and decisively to ensure that the Australian economy continues to grow through these difficult economic times, and investment in infrastructure projects will be part of this strategy. The essential feature of the Nationbuilding Funds Bill 2008 is the establishment of three key funds: the Building Australia Fund, providing the basis for unclogging the arteries of our national infrastructure and tackling our critical transport, communications, energy and water issues; the Education Investment Fund, to address the skills needs of our economy by investing in higher education infrastructure, vocational education and training infrastructure and the creation or development of research infrastructure; and the the Health and Hospitals Fund, to remedy the urgent needs of our health system through funding for the creation or development of health infrastructure. The bill provides that by 30 June 2009 there shall be not less than $5 billion in the health fund, $7.5 billion in the Building Australia Fund and $2.5 billion in the education fund as the first instalments. All these funds will be supervised by advisory boards and Infrastructure Australia, ensuring good governance and putting an end to the pork barrelling and politicised approach to spending of the Howard government. The need for such action is not a sudden It has been evident for some time the economy was being held back by infrastructure constraints, particularly in export growth. Over the last six years of the Howard government, export volume growth averaged only three per cent. During the prior 20 years of the eighties and nineties export volume growth averaged around seven per cent. The reason for this decline was infrastructure deficiencies. This was pointed out in the Fisher task force report, Australia's export infrastructure, in 2005, and in OECD and International Monetary Fund reports in 2006. What was the Howard government's response? They did nothing. This has been highlighted by the latest Access Economics Budget Monitor, which stated that under the Howard government: As more and more unexpected revenue poured into federal coffers in recent years, budget sions increasingly smacked of less strategic spending. The report records the ‘poor economic management' of the Howard government which: … wasted much of the once-in-a-generation opportunity thrown up by the China boom. Thankfully, we now have a team at the wheel that is prepared to shape events rather than be shaped by them and that will not fiddle while Rome burns. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research have implemented an array of complementary measures to add to our infrastructure efforts. It should be noted that this team has been working tirelessly alongside dedicated public servants to protect the Australian economy. It is very much a question of the men and women meeting the hour, and the Australian people will have cause to be grateful that we have such steady and visionary hands on the levers at present. And it is not just now that these abilities and this prudence have been demonstrated. How many times over a number of years has our Labor leadership drawn attention to the fact that we should have been taking advantage of the good times to make the necessary infrastructure and skills reforms that the country was crying out for? We highlighted the need to remove the capacity constraints on this economy and seize the opportunities and potential of new technology and industries so that we would not fall victim to the so-called Dutch disease relating to overreliance on resource wealth at the expense of a diversified economy. What was the response of the Howard government? ‘She'll be right. The government can continue to lie deciback, fat, dumb and happy. The good times will last forever. What the hell is Labor talking about?' The Howard leadership ridiculed Kevin Rudd for having the temerity to suggest that Western Australia should take the opportunity of the mining boom to diversify and position itself as a provider of international financial services. How typical of their short-termism, their lack of vision and their irresponsible approach to economic management! In so many respects, the Howard government was reminiscent of the administration of US President Calvin Coolidge, who was in office immediately prior to the Great Depression of 1929. The philosophies of Howard and Coolidge were very similar. They had mindless optimism that the market would always look after itself and that the good times would last forever; they ignored infrastructure constraints, thinking this could always be left to the private sector; they expected that prosperity would naturally trickle down to all sectors of society; they provided tax advantages to the wealthy at the expense of investment in infrastructure; they favoured the big end of town over the promotion of competition; and they disregarded the disadvantaged in the community. Coolidge at least had the excuse of not having much in the way of historical precedent to draw on but the Howard government had no such excuse. I have no doubt that in time John Howard will come to be regarded as the Calvin Coolidge of our time. The Howard government will forever be known as having slept on its watch, and so many of that team are still here and still asleep. Fortunately for the United States, the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, taking office at the height of the Great Depression, managed to right the ship, manage the crisis and at the same time achieve massive infrastructure development that serves the United States to this day. Fortunately for Australia, we have the Rudd team, which is similarly addressing the complacency and neglect of the Howard years, steering this country through these troubled times and preparing us for the future. The proof of this is in the presentation of this And what are the critical areas of infrastructure that the Howard government neglected for so long? One glaring example was the need for a National Broadband Network, or NBN, which has been well understood by Labor as the greatest single piece of infrastructure required in our economy and society today. The impact of an NBN will be on a par with the great nation-building projects in our history, such as the Snowy Hydro scheme, which I am proud to have in my electorate, and the Adelaide to Darwin telegraph. The Adelaide to Darwin telegraph, completed in 1872 by a visionary South Australian government, was the spark that ignited the Australian economy. It provided this country with an ability to have close to real-time overseas communications and participate effectively in international trade. The NBN is set to have a similar impact. In a nation such as ours with a huge geography and low relative population we cannot expect private industry to deliver solutions in the same way as has been possible in Singapore or the Netherlands. Like the Snowy and the telegraph, therefore, such critical infrastructure requires a visionary and determined government to provide the impetus and support. It is interesting to note that the Snowy scheme was the product of the Chifley Labor government and that at the time it was not only not appreciated or understood by the Liberal Party but vigorously opposed by its leader, Robert Menzies. It seems that the opposition have learned nothing from history and remain as intellectually bankrupt as they have always been. It was a great pleasure for me to have conducted a number of forums in my electorate on the broadband issue during the course of 2007. Through these forums and my conversations with thousands of constituents I got the message loud and clear as to all the various applications reliable broadbill. band could have for rural and regional Australia. It is critical for the future of our towns, schools, medical support and small and medium enterprises. Broadband can help defeat the tyranny of distance and ensure that our kids get an education the equal of that of any city child. I came across a businessman in Batlow who handles large media files and at present has to load these up in the evening and hope they transfer overnight without the line dropping out. There were farmers around Dalgety who wanted reliable broadband for online sales and to follow the futures market. Greater bandwidth to our schools would enable the operation of virtual classrooms so that the language courses that cannot be given now could be conducted across a number of classrooms in the region using the one teacher from a central location. Our aged care and remote medical facilities could be better supported by telemedicine, with patients being able to be monitored and advised by the best doctors without having to travel over our snow and ice covered roads. And then there are the key transport bottlenecks and opportunities. In my electorate there are many of these that are holding us back. An example is the Princes Highway, which has been neglected as a key coastal economic artery and which has been a serious safety concern. At the town of Bega it is necessary for B-doubles to perform timeconsuming and costly uncoupling and coupling operations on the edges of town, while larger and larger rigs perform an increasingly dangerous dogleg through town. Fortunately, this government is addressing the problem after 30 years of inaction. Then there is the Gocup Road, which is likely to double in heavy traffic with the massive expansion of the Visy pulp mill. There are untapped opportunities for the Moruya airport taking direct flights from New Zealand with some upgrading work to the runway and terminal and huge potential for the port of Eden with some basic breakwater measures. One thing that will hold back any rural and regional town is health services. Over the last 12 years of the Howard government, country Australians suffered from a gradual erosion of services-this on the watch of those who profess to have rural and regional interests at heart. It was no wonder that neglect led to the rise of Pauline Hanson and the gradual disintegration of National Party representation in this place. There are many fine, decent men and women in the National Party who sincerely want the best for our rural and regional communities-people like the member for Riverina, the member for Gippsland and Senator Barnaby Joyce-but they have been seriously betrayed over these last 12 years by the Liberal Party and I believe that they would be fulfilling the true meaning of their charter if they were to leave the opposition benches and join us on this side. Our towns in Eden-Monaro of Tumut, Bombala and Moruya and the Bega Valley are crying out for better health support and they must have it. Health concerns were right up there with Work Choices as a concern of constituents during the campaign last year and we have listened to those concerns. Over the Howard years, the proportion of Commonwealth government support for the health system dropped to 40 per cent, ripping the equivalent of $1 billion out of health services every year. That is utterly scandalous. Now, through the Health and Hospitals Fund, help is on the way. In the public education system I have seen the shameless reliance on demountables that are too hot in summer and too cold in our severe winters of snow and ice. It is a scandal that so many of our schools need extra help to create the basic conditions to support the introduction of information and computer technology. It is time the opposition realised that investing in all of our children's education is important not only to ensure they have happy and prosperous lives but for the benefit of the economy generally. Human capital economists like the University of Chicago's James Heckman have been saying for many years that public spending on education and skills leads to high rates of return on investtheir ment. This is borne out by OECD analysis which estimates that one year of average additional educational attainment for a population adds between three and six per cent to long-term GDP growth. Between 1995 and 2004, public funding of tertiary education increased by an average of 49 per cent across the OECD but declined by four per cent in Australia. This makes Australia the only OECD country where the total level of public funding of tertiary education decreased during that time. Between 1995 and 2004, total funding per tertiary student increased by an average of nine per cent across the OECD but increased here by only one per cent. We have been falling behind and are now below the OECD average for the proportion of graduates in science and agriculture, and way below them in engineering, manufacturing and construction-7.2 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent. In Korea, one of our main regional competitors, the figure is 27.1 per cent. In the last 10 years, research output has grown rapidly in countries like Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, which is now the second biggest investor in research and development in the world. We have not kept pace with this sort of effort and it would have been to our great cost had it not been for the effort government now intends to bring to bear. Because of this government's budgetary measures we had a sound surplus to assist with managing the current crisis and support these infrastructure measures. Had the Howard government been re-elected this surplus would not have been there as they would have had to meet the irresponsible, unfunded promises made during the campaign, carrying on their great tradition of fiscal proflimanipulating gacy and pork barrelling, particularly through Regional Partnerships, while continuing to neglect our key infrastructure investment. That was one of the great challenges I had in my electorate-cleaning up that Regional Partnerships mess, over 50 per cent of the promises of which were unfunded. As the Treasurer has said, we now have a government that is working in synchronisation with the actions and assessments of the regulators, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia, using both fiscal and monetary policy measures to ensure the economy weathers this storm, including investment in infrastructure that will produce significant returns in the long term. What we know is that these extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and decisive action. I meet with many leaders of business and industry as part of my responsibilities in the Defence portfolio and they have applauded the government's efforts while conversely expressing deep disquiet at the irresponsibility of the opposition. They have appreciated the strong, timely, considered and decisive action we have taken to protect the Australian economy and invest in infrastructure. In the short time that the Rudd Labor government has been on the Treasury benches we have already started preparing industry for climate change measures and worked to fix significant infrastructure and skills constraints on the economy. These this challenges were made much harder to tackle because of the coalition's nearly 12 years of inaction under John Howard. While on the coalition, I would ask those opposite to reflect on the attacks against the Treasury and in particular the Treasury secretary-attacks that have been completely unwarranted and unprecedented. In the last sitting week we heard outrageous accusations by the coalition, accusing the Treasury of economic forecasts. This attack shows that the opposition is either incompetent or just out to embarrass hard working public servants for their own political gain. Either way, this is a grievous departure from responsible behaviour at a time when we need to be doing all we can on both sides of this House to promote and instil confidence in our regulators and advisers. This bill is a package of which we on this side have good cause to be intensely proud. It is heartland work for us to ensure that this is a land of prosperity in which all have the opportunity to share, a land prepared for the challenges confronting us. We also intend to do all we can to equip our children to flourish and to make this country one of compassion where no section of Australian society is left behind. Unlike the Howard government, which neglected to act on our capacity constraints, neglected the disadvantaged and demonised many fellow Australians for political gain, this is a government that governs for the future and governs for all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.",103
121,Mr ROBB,SCHEDULE B,"I rise to speak on the Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 and related bills. We are here debating a set of bills that is at least eight months overdue. The fact is that there has not been one decision in 12 months on infrastructure-not one decision. It has been a lost 12 months for Australia at a very critical time. In this critical time there has not been one decision on infrastructure. Labor said they had a plan. We heard it all last year during the campaign. We heard it all this year. They have a plan. It turns out that the plan was to set up a committee to devise a plan-a committee! We have had ministers put in place, we have had departments of infrastructure and we have had committees put in place, but no decisions-no action. Instead of action, all we have heard from those opposite is endless denigration of the former government. We just heard it from the previous speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro10 minutes of his 20 minutes were just denigration of those opposite. There is no contribution-it is all talk and no action. What we have seen, contrary to all the denigration and the misrepresentation that we have heard from the other side already in this debate, is that total infrastructure ing in Australia in constant 2007 dollars rose from $21 billion in 1996 to $56 billion in 2007, an increase from nearly three per cent of GDP to 5.4 per cent of GDP. That is action. That is not talk; that is not committees. That is a significant and massive growth in infrastructure spending as a proportion of GDP over 11½ years. It gives the lie to the Rudd government's pathetic mantra. We have heard it again and again tonight in this chamber. To make that happen, the former government had to fix a few things. In referring to this I would like to scotch this absurd notion peddled by the government that the former government did nothing to set Australia up for the future. Of course the opposite is the case and it is why the Prime Minister can strut his stuff on the world stage and say to the rest of the world, ‘Australia is better placed to deal with the consequences of this financial meltdown.' Why? There is only one reason and it is that the former government spent 11½ years fixing the mess they inherited and then setting us on a course to have the strongest economy in the OECD. Those facts are overlooked time and again. We had to start by fixing Australia's financial infrastructure when we took over in 1996. We paid off $96 billion of government debt. This government would have been confronted with an extra $8½ billion in interest payments this year solely from that debt if the former government had not paid it off$8½ billion a year. That is $100 billion extra out of taxpayers' money to pay interest over the last 12 years. That is $100 billion available to spend on infrastructure and on services to create jobs for Australians, and we have seen a lot of those created. We turned around a culture of running massive deficits under the previous Labor administration and we replaced it with a culture of running spendbudget surpluses. The coalition fixed up other financial infrastructure. It created an independent Reserve Bank, a step which I think has meant a lot to the healthy condition in which Australia finds itself at the moment. The former government introduced rules to govern our financial sector through APRA and ASIC. We fixed up many regulations in the financial area. We got some common sense and some judgement into the nature of rules governing our financial sector. Those rules are now the envy of others in the Western world who have failed to do likewise. We have had major reform of the indirect tax system, which gave states a huge growth tax to fund vital infrastructure and other commitments. Unfortunately, Labor state governments have presided throughout the country and they have not made use of that money. In fact, we have the situation in New South Wales where it is a total embarrassment, a total disgrace. is criminal the way in which they have mismanaged that economy, misused the huge amounts of money that have been made available to that and other state governments around the country who have not taken advantage of that money and not shouldered responsibility for their part of the infrastructure bargain. The former government had to fix up defence infrastructure. It had been massively wound back by the former Labor government. The coalition brought about 47 per cent growth over 12 years from $10.6 billion in 1995-96 to $22 billion in 2007-08. It had been sadly neglected. Infrastructure refers to many areas of the economy. Defence is an area where we have massively increased investment in infrastructure, bringing about 47 per cent growth, which was very necessary. I would have thought the former speaker, the member for Eden-Monaro, of all people would have had some appreciation of the increase in defence spending and the pathetic position that our former government found itself in when it came into office in 1996 in terms of defence spending and infrastructure. Another area of infrastructure that we had to deal with was workplace infrastructure, workforce infrastructure. We brought that into the 21st century. Again, it was a situation which was holding Australia back. The Australian waterfront was modernised. The coalition brought about a 60 per cent improvement in productivity with average crane rates increasing from 17 movements per hour to world's best practice of 27 or 28 movements per hour. We were a joke in the world. We were ridiculed. The Japanese, a major customer, complained endlessly about conditions on our waterfront-the unreliability and the cost. That was massively turned around. It took the former government to take tough decisions not easy decisions, not just talk and no action but tough decisions to It turn that around and create productivity improvements, and to increase the capacity of Australian industry to build, grow and create jobs. We established the ABCC. It led to a massive reduction in working days lost per thousand employees due to industrial action. It plummeted from 37.4 days lost in late 2005 to just 1.7 in mid-2007-a massive improvement. In the construction area, so critical to capitalising on the mining boom of recent years, productivity was increased markedly because of the introduction of the ABCC and the workplace changes, so much so that it resulted in a staggering 1.5 per cent boost to Australia's GDP, or over $5 billion each year. Add that to the $8½ billion a year in interest savings on the debt that was paid off by the previous government and you are talking real money. That is more money in those two initiatives alone than we are seeing in the Building Australia Fund, which the government has talked up and talked up but does not even have the funds in there which would equate with the savings each year that the coalition made from those two initiatives. And of course we introduced much greater flexibility into our workforce through the 12 years of the Howard government. All of this resulted in the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years; a youth participation rate ranked second among OECD countries; a real increase of nearly 22 per cent in wages over and above inflation; $38 billion for infrastructure for our roads and rail system via AusLink 1 and 2; funds available for other necessary transport infrastructure; a $10 billion water infrastructure fund; a $60 billion Future Fund; a $6 billion higher education fund; and $20 billion surpluses. All of that was generated off the back of real reform to infrastructure: financial infrastructure, defence infrastructure, workplace infrastructure and other forms of infrastructure in this economy. The bill that we are debating has enabled the government to establish three separate financial asset funds: the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. The building fund will have $12.6 billion in it, with $7.5 billion coming from the 2007-08 surplus and the remainder from T3 proceeds and the balance of the Communications Fund. The education fund will have $8.7 billion, $2½ billion from the 2007-08 surplus and the remainder from the closed Higher Education Endowment Fund. The health fund will have $5 billion, which is entirely from the surplus of 2007-08. There is a $14.7 billion shortfall on what the government initially predicted. What that means is that not one dollar generated by the Rudd government will be spent from all of these funds that we are talking about and debating. Every dollar allocated to these funds was created by the former Howard-Costello government. Every dollar to be spent was inherited by the Rudd government. They spent two years talking up what they would do with infrastructure, only to populate the funds totally with moneys generated by the former government, yet they do not have a skerrick of embarrassment. You would think they would be embarrassed by that. The prospect of additional funds is doubtful, given the demand on government funds that is coming down the line. Most of the surplus has been spent and we must not see the government starting to put its fingers into other pies around the budget. The AusLink funds must not be reassigned to other projects. Watch this space-watch this government try and financially engineer some changes and do some tricky things. The test of this government will be its ability to put not Howard-Costello government dollars but Rudd government dollars into these funds. That will be the test of this government over the next one, two and three years. How many Rudd government dollars will be generated and put into these funds? That is the test. The coalition has said it would take a very hard nosed approach to evaluating this legislation and any projects which emanate from it. We must satisfy ourselves that the hard earned surplus will be spent wisely and not as a Labor slush fund to bail out failed Labor states. Now that the government has wiped $40 billion off its forward estimates there is much greater emphasis on the need for quality investments. That is very important now that there is probably only $7 billion a year over the next two or three years in the road, rail and ports fund to fund the hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure projects that have come into Infrastructure Australia. It means that the quality of every decision is paramount. To get that we must have transparency and full disclosure of the results of cost-benefit analyses for projects recommended and for those rejected, including all data, assumptions and models used. It also means there must be transparency in PPP contracts. Slush fund concerns are exacerbated because the original legislation was pulled. This legislation was in the House on the blue sheet and it was pulled because, as we understand it, the minister for finance was concerned about the minister for infrastructure requiring greater ministerial discretion. No wonder we are worried about this money being used and abused! We have also seen the Prime Minister and the Treasurer instruct the New South Wales government to abandon the $12 billion North West Metro proposal in Sydney because there were no votes in it for Labor. The government is attempting to circumvent the evaluation process by not even allowing some projects to be submitted to Infrastructure Australia. We do not even get a chance to assess some of these projects. There is grubby politics being played already and we have not even got the funds set up. No wonder we are worried about these funds being spent to bail out failed Labor states and going into some sort of slush fund for the Labor Party. We will look at every project and run a fine tooth comb over it, because we are concerned about the potential for this to be used as a slush fund. We remain concerned that state governments may also simply remove infrastructure projects off their own books and bid for federal funds. The recent New South Wales minibudget maps out a whole lot of projects and says in black and white, ‘We will only proceed before 2012 if these are substantially funded by the Commonwealth.' These are projects that have historically been the overwhelming responsibility of state governments. Now New South Wales is saying: ‘Forget that. None of these projects will go ahead unless they are overwhelmingly funded by the Commonwealth.' This is why we have foreshadowed several amendments. The insertion of transparency clauses to require the public disclosure of all documentation, evaluation criteria, business cases, cost benefit analyses, advisory board evaluation against criteria relating to the projects and reports to the finance and advisory boards. This is critical-and do not tell us that there are commercial-in-confidence issues. This is mandatory in the United States and in Scandinavian countries and it is common practice around the world. People should be able to see the basis on which decisions have been taken. We are also looking for analysis which supports any project to be made public before final decisions are taken by the Rudd government. In their submission to the Senate committee considering these bills, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said they ‘would like to see the funds set up to have the greatest transparency possible'. That is critical. In the amendments that will be put to the Senate, given the significance the government has rightly attached to the need to see strong productivity outcomes from any project, we will propose an amendment requiring that money only be spent on projects that have been analysed by the Productivity Commission and that commission reports be published. The bill also precludes funds for ongoing running or maintenance costs. This is a serious deficiency, one that was corrected in AusLink projects but now has been reversed with these bills. That is why we are proposing a clause which requires that all project funding decisions ensure that there are financial commitments from all asset owners and stakeholders to meet the whole-of-life asset costs. A hospital costing half a billion dollars requires half a billion dollars of revenue each year for expenses. Those costs are ongoing and that hospital cannot function without that money. To make a decision based on the capital costs without looking at the whole-of-life asset costs is just ridiculous and naive, and we have seen that happen already. This government has already got form. We saw it with the case of computers, about the only infrastructure thing they have done this year. They had a billion-dollar project. What they had not thought of were the costs of implementation, maintenance and ongoing costs, which are in the order of something like $2 billion. Schools all around the country have got boxes of computers lined up in corridors because they cannot use them. New South Wales is bailing out of the program. This is naivety. This is lack of experience and understanding. These things have to be dealt with properly. In every case there should be an opportunity to see that the whole-of-life asset costs have been built into the project and that there are guarantees about ongoing funding commitments, otherwise we will have empty coliseums all over this country. That is what we will end up with. There is no recognition in this bill of the problems associated with up-front payments. As a consequence, we will seek an amendment which will prohibit the payment of upfront fees on projects. Over recent years we have seen the ridiculous situation in New South Wales where they have treated infrastructure projects as a revenue source. With the cross-city tunnel, $100 million was required to be paid up front before one sod was turned on the project by the private operators. In that one day another dollar was added to the toll before the project even started. This was seen as a revenue-raising activity. It has compromised many projects. This bill should have a provision which requires the prohibition of the payment of upfront fees for projects. The Rudd government came to office 12 months ago saying they had a strong plan for Australia's infrastructure, yet there has not been one decision in 12 months. They are one-third of the way through their term. This is unacceptable. They are standing here beating their chests about what they have done and what they have not done. This is symptomatic of what we are seeing right across so many government areas. They are all talk and no action. In 12 months there has not been one project. After 12 months we get this bill, which has got serious deficiencies in transparency and in many other aspects. The legislation must be amended to ensure a totally transparent process. We cannot have a situation where hard-earned taxpayers' money becomes a slush fund to bail out failed Labor states-and haven't we got some of those around the country! Anything less than this would be a disaster: we must have transparency; we must have a bill which looks to the wise and sensible management of these hard-earned moneys so that we can put in place infrastructure to see jobs created and people's welfare protected.

122,Mr HAYES,SCHEDULE B,"I enjoyed the contribution from the member for Goldstein. Apart from being a very active swimmer these days, he takes a little bit of licence in his contribution here. The member for Goldstein has been outlining a position he is concerned about, having been a senior member of the Howard government. A hallmark of that government was the regional rorts program, where local infrastructure was treated so abominably. That is what gave us the Beaudesert railway investment and the Tumbi Creek program-things that were wasted. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, all the things that occurred under the regional rorts program were in marginal, coalition-held seats. We do not need people coming down here feigning indignation and giving excuses as to why they did not do it. The fact is that they did do various things. The hallmark of their administration when it came to infrastructure was to look at where we would put our money, and it had nothing to do with the forward planning of infrastructure, nothing to do with building communities but everything to do with trying to secure coalition seats. The Australian Labor Party is a party that has always been about nation building. It is worthwhile acknowledging that Labor governments in the past have laid down the foundation of what we are now progressing here today. The post-war recovery period was led by the Chifley government with, for instance, the Snowy Mountains scheme in 1949. Throughout the seventies the Whitlam government provided practical infrastructure solutions to fixing our nation's hospitals. In the mid-eighties through to the nineties the Hawke and Keating governments opened our economy up and made us more competitive. Keating's Better Cities program introduced a broad-ranging strategy of reform that included innovative housing programs and a renewed focus on urban consolidations. That was the hallmark of what Labor achieved in office and that is what we are doing here today. That is in vast contrast to the previous Howard administration, which wasted the opportunities provided by former Labor governments. They consistently failed to invest in nation-building programs. For too long our nation's budgets were constructed short-sightedly, focusing on the next election and ignoring the big challenges facing the nation's future. The previous government squandered the proceeds of the mining and resources boom and failed to invest properly in the future of this country. The Howard government wasted 11½ years of its time in office. It did squander a lot of the investment in our long-term needs and, quite frankly, the country is poorer for it. It is thing to go out there under a regional rorts program and try to win office through things such as Tumbi Creek or the Beaudesert railway, which never actually functioned. These were opportunities but this is where this government was going, looking solely at election outcomes and not at the big ticket items, which are the nation's future. These bills before the House today certainly reiterate Labor's commitment to being a party dedicated to nation building. It gives me some pleasure to be able to come in and support these measures here today because they are very pertinent to where I come from in south-west Sydney, and I will return to that aspect a little later on. I support these three bills: the Nation-building Funds Bill 2008, the Nation-building Funds (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 and the COAG Reform Fund Bill 2008. The Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 is part of this package of three bills giving effect to three financial asset funds that were announced in the 2008-09 budget and now play a decisive part in the government's Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of this global financial crisis. On 14 October the Prime Minister, along with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, announced that this government would be fast-tracking the nation's building agenda to help shield Australia from the global financial crisis and will accelerate the implementation of the government's three nation-building funds. The Commonwealth has also decided that it will bring forward its interim report on infrastructure in order to accelerate the government's nation-building agenda. As a consequence the national infrastructure priority list will be crucial in determining the prosperity of the nation by identifying those priorities that we have now and into the future. It will be the one basis for determining the funding allocations from the Building Australia Fund. The government will establish three funds to meet its commitment to Australia's future by investing in critical areas of infrastructure such as transport and communication, education and health. The nation-building fund will finance capital investment in critical infrastructure in transport and communications such as road, rail, urban transport, port facilities and broadband. The Education Investment Fund will finance capital investment in higher education, vocational education and training, as well as various research institutions. The Health and Hospitals Fund will finance capital investment in health infrastructure, such as the renewal and refurbishment of many of our hospitals, medical technology equipment, major medical research facilities and various projects. The Nation-building Funds (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 deals with consequential matters relating to the establishment of these funds, including amendments required to the Future Fund Act 2006 and Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 and the repeal of the Higher Education Endowment Fund Act 2007. Importantly, these two bills facilitate acceleration to allow for interim arrangements to begin as early as possible. The third bill before us today is the COAG Reform Fund Bill. This will establish the COAG Reform Fund for the purposes of disbursing funds to the states and territories and will also be used to disburse funding provided for in future budgets for areas of specific reform. Where the Building Australia Fund, the Health and Hospitals Fund or the Education Investment Fund is used to finance projects by the states the moneys will be channelled from the nation-building fund to the state or territory via the COAG Reform Fund. The terms and conditions of the financial assistance to be granted will be set out in a series of agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Through the Council of Australian Governments, the Rudd government has delivered on its promise to end the blame game and modernise the federation, to build the productive capacity of the economy and to deliver better services to all Australians. This is vastly different to ‘regional rorts'. As I stated earlier, this is a government of nation builders and is committed to this. These bills before the House are the beginning of a new era of investing in Australia's future. Unlike the previous government, who found it easier to avoid leadership responsibilities and blame the states than to get on with the job, we are getting on with the job. They failed to invest in the nation's future; we are investing in the nation's future. This government has no intention of simply hoarding a surplus for the sake of having a surplus; this government is committed to investing in Australia, and more importantly investing in Australians. That is what the surplus is there for. We are working to build a better future for everybody. We understand that this money is not ours-unlike the member for Goldstein, who lectured us about this a few moments ago. This money belongs to the Australian people and we have an obligation to invest in them and to strengthen their futures, and that is precisely what we are doing through these pieces of legislation. This year the government will contribute a total of $12.6 billion to the Building Australia Fund for transport, communications, energy and water, and infrastructure, including proceeds from the T3 sale and the balance of the Communications Fund; a total of $8.7 billion to the Education Investment Fund for education infrastructure, including the balance of the Higher Education Endowment Fund; and $5 billion to the Health and Hospitals Fund, for health related infrastructure. These funds are not slush funds; these funds are there for the implementation of various worthwhile projects as they are identified. These proposals will always be subject to rigorous and independent evaluation by advisory bodies. Unlike the way we saw funds administered under the previous administration, the bodies that we have set up, particularly in relation to Infrastructure Australia, have leading business people on their boards, from the CEO down. Quite frankly, this demonstrates the level of independence as well as the serious rigour that these projects will be subject to in assessment. This is about transparency. More than just that, this is about making every effort to ensure that what we, as the Commonwealth, invest in is, in real terms, investing in the future of Australians. Fast-tracking the nation-building agenda will help secure economic activity in the short term, but in the long term it is going to develop the financial and economic potential and the future of this nation, and that is what we are seeking to achieve. These funds are part of the government's nation-building agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis and will help meet Australia's critical long-term infrastructure needs. Importantly, they will help strengthen the national economy and support Australian households during this time of global financial crisis. Australia has substantial gaps in infrastructure that must be addressed if we are to continue to improve our productivity as well as our living standards, and there cannot be any argument about this. I would challenge anyone on the other side to argue against that. There are a couple of members from Queensland sitting at the table at the moment, and they will know about our mining industries up there. Those over in the west, where I have spent some time, particularly in Port Hedland, know the importance to the nation's financial infrastructure of port faciliThat ties, and the same goes for rail-not the Bo Derek rail lineMr Hartsuyker-Beaudesert!",112
123,Mr HAYES,SCHEDULE B,"Beaudesert, sorry. I am obliged to the member for Cowper. I will correct the Hansard. But we are talking about significant rail infrastructure that, unlike that rail line, adds to our economic well-being and the ability of this country to produce and export. That is the economic growth that we need to be very much cognisant of as we look at infrastructure developments within this country. We need to ensure that we have proper, functioning port structures and heavy rail structures so that our producers, particularly in relation to minerals and resources, are able to compete on the world stage. With the growing pressures on commodity prices that we are now seeing, it is going to be absolutely critical for us as a nation exporting minerals and energy to have the most efficient lines of transportation to facilitate greater productivity as we go about exporting to the world from those areas where we have natural resources. This government is using all its assets to identify the long-term infrastructure needs of this country, as I indicated earlier. I drew attention to the composition of the board of Infrastructure Australia. That is certainly a significant part of it. Residents in my electorate of Werriwa, out in the south-west of Sydney, know the significance of investing in infrastructure. It was very, very big leading up to the last election. It was very big because there was only one party that consistently throughout the election period promised infrastructure development for the south-west of Sydney, and that was the Labor Party. The Labor Party came out and said that they would do something that had been asked for time and time again-the expansion of the F5. It is a $140 million project. was something so critical, and it clearly falls well within AusLink 2. All those years that I was on the opposition benches, I asked questions of ministers about when they would do something for the south-west of Sydney. They did nothing. It was not until after Kevin Rudd made the announcement about investing in a $140 million project out in the south-west of Sydney that the then roads minister said, ‘Well, we'll do the same.' He took until two or three days later to come out and say that. That just shows the disdain of the then government for infrastructure development in the south-west of Sydney. Granted, it is a Labor electorate and has been for quite a period of time-and I am sure Gough Whitlam will see that it will stay a Labor electorate. But that just shows the contrast between the approaches: we could look at the area either as a marginal seat or we could look at what was going to be needed for the development of the area. Over the next 20 years, Sydney is reportedly going to have a population in excess of five million people, I understand. Much of that growth between now and then-as a matter of fact, 20 per cent-will be found in the south-west of Sydney. The south-west of Sydney-Liverpool, Campbelltown, Leppington, Rossmore, Camden and all those areas-is very much the growth corridor of Sydney. It is where we are establishing our employment lands. It is why we would have a dedicated freight line which would be a more effective and efficient inland port. We are bringing container terminals through our intermodal terminals and, as a consequence, we are now establishing businesses along that rail and road corridor-new manufacturing and advanced engineering. They are jobs for the people I represent out there. We have a university which is now producing graphic designers and engineers, and just last week the Deputy Prime Minister opened a medical school. We will have our doctors being trained and, more importantly, our medical technology developments occurring out there. These are things that we invest in now to achieve for the future. These are things that we must be dedicated to. Where we sit now, 12 months since the election, is in marked contrast. We are following through with our commitment to invest in this nation's future, to develop these areas of opportunity, to give those people and those young families in the south-west the opportunity to have jobs in these employment lands that are being established. This is of very significant proportions, and quite frankly it is something that does take a government with nation-building abilities to construct. In the limited time. I have left, I would simply like to once again draw attention to how critical last week's meeting with the nation's mayors was. I hosted three local councils down here: Camden, Campbelltown and Liverpool. Those three councils were fortunate to get about $3.3 million to put into areas of their own local infrastructure priorities. In terms of the wider perspective, of the $300 million and looking to the future(Time expired)",115
124,Mr TRUSS,SCHEDULE B,"For the past year we have been bombarded with claims, often completely fanciful, about what the Nationbuilding Funds Bill 2008 and its cognate bills will actually do. In particular, the Building Australia Fund has been put forward as the saviour for a countless number of infrastructure projects, particularly road and rail, around the country. The states have seen it as the saving grace for their budgets. Those with ambitious ideas around the community have seen it as a way in which funding might be provided. The federal government has fed this speculation by leading everybody to believe that their projects will be on the list to be funded. Indeed, the Prime Minister, in quite an extraordinary feat of dexterity, has listed infrastructure expenditure in two of his plans, two of his wars, over the last few months. When Labor was worried about inflation, we had his four-point plan to beat inflation and, lo and behold, a $70 billion expenditure program on infrastructure was part of the plan. Now when the problem is a recession, an infrastructure plan is part of the solution to beating unemployment-the war on unemployment. So we have the same cure for two opposite diseases. Originally, Labor was telling us inflation was out of control-it had almost doubled during its term in office-and so we needed to spend money on infrastructure. And then, when the problem is not inflation but is in fact a recession, we have the same cure: it is going to spend more money on infrastructure. I am all for spending money on infrastructure. I think we do need to keep building our country and making it strong. It is important that we use our resources when they are available to help secure the basic lifelinesroads, rail and infrastructure-for the future. But the reality is that an infrastructure program was never going to confront inflation. In fact it was quite likely to feed it. The government's economic illogicality was only matched by the fact that when it was trying to beat the recession a little later, it proposed exactly the same solution. The facts are that under the previous government there was a very substantial increase in expenditure on infrastructure. When we came to office, 2.9 per cent of GDP was spent on infrastructure. When we left office, that figure had grown to 5.4 per cent. So the members opposite cannot be lecturing this side of the House about who are the nation builders. We virtually doubled the GDP proportion that was spent on infrastructure. We are the government that commenced AusLink. We are the people who built major railway networks and supported the construction of other vital infrastructure projects. In fact, in spite of the rhetoric that you are hearing from Labor tonight, and over recent times, even with the money that is being allocated in the building fund, Labor will spend quite a deal less on roads and rail between now and 2014 than the previous government would have spent. Labor is actually cutting expenditure on infrastructure. It is hard to believe that when you listen to all of the rhetoric about how it is building things and how new projects are going to come online and that the Building Australia Fund is going to be the cure for all evils. It is ally going to cut funding. The road and rail sector in particular has a great deal to be concerned about with regard to the attitude of this government. The Building Australia Fund, for instance, is only going to provide $7 billion over three years for roads and rail. That is about one-third of what we provided in the last AusLink program-a quarter of what we would have provided under the next AusLink program. Labor is continuing AusLink, although it is providing it with a little less money. The funds available under this Building Australia program very much need to be kept in perspective. The other issue that is of particular significance is that there is $7 billion available over three years for road and rail, but, from what we can ascertain, the requests for funding under the Building Australia Fund for roads and rail are around $400 billion. So we have $7 billion to be shared amongst $400 billion worth of requests. It is hardly going to leave a lot of happy people around the countryside. They have been led to believe that there are going to be projects all over the place, but of the $400 billion being asked for in road and rail-there is more being asked for, for other things-only about $7 billion is going to be available over three years. As previous speakers have said, another very important point to note is that if there had not been a coalition government for the last 11 years, there would be no money available for Building Australia. Every single dollar comes from the current surplus, which was inherited from the previous government, and the money that had been put aside in future funds by the previous government. Had Labor been in office, we would have had deficits, not surpluses, at this time of the year. There would have been no money put aside. So when Labor talks about what it is going to spend under the building fund, let actume make it absolutely clear: it is not spending money that it has raised, it is not spending money that has somehow or other been miraculously invented; it is spending the money that it inherited from the previous government. And so all of those building projects, all of the railways, all of the roads are in fact funded by the legacy left by the previous coalition government. There is supposed to be $26.3 billion available for these three funds on 1 January next year and $41 billion by 30 June next year, but, of course, the missing $14 billion that has to be found next year is to come out of the budget surplus. What surplus? It has already dissipated to something like $5 billion, and most people believe that Labor is heading for a deficit. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation will not use the word, but most people believe there will be no money left-there will be nothing to put into the Building Australia Fund to deliver on the promises that Labor members are making today. I want to look also at some of the other elements of the processes that Labor is putting in place for the Building Australia Fund. The government said that the decision making process will be ‘above politics', with well-credentialed Australians put on the board of Infrastructure Australia, tasked to find the right projects to be funded in the right places at the right time. The government stated in the May budget that an infrastructure priority list would be considered by COAG, which we can only take to mean that the states and territories were to have some say over which projects would get the final nod. The sacred nature of these funds does not end there. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government solemnly declared on 4 June: Public investment in infrastructure will no longer have regard to political cycles or electoral boundaries. That is a bit rich coming from the member for the Fort Street High School, but nonetheless he says it will no longer have any regard to political cycles or electoral boundaries. The political cycle part of that is a bit interesting. Here we are, one year into the term of the government, and they have done no road building and no rail building whatsoever. They have in fact prevented some projects which were virtually about to start, like the F3 to Branxton project. That is not happening. It could have been started by now, but Labor stalled all of that. The reality is that there have been no new projects that were not already in the pipeline announced and funded by the current government. We are now going to have this windfall of funding, which will be announced over the next six months or so. A little bit of planning will then go on and-lo and behold!-at about the time that the next election is due to be called, we will have all these sod-turning ceremonies and the start of all those projects. Yet we are being asked to believe that this has got nothing to do with the electoral cycle? Don't make us blush! I cannot understand how the minister for infrastructure can even say such a thing and keep a straight face. This is deliberately designed to meet the electoral cycle, but the government will pretend that the projects just happened to be about to start at that crucial time. They have nothing in mind other than to try and save the bacon of Labor members, who have failed to deliver anything during their term in office. These all are lofty words, and there may be some kind of a magic pudding of funds to fund almost anything that Australians might desire, but in reality we all know that they are slush funds. They are not totally above politics; they are slush funds to try to bail out Labor state governments and local members with pet projects. Let us look also at how the rhetoric has failed to match the action. In today's Age, we can see how far Labor have strayed from the original promises that they made about these funds. To paraphrase the Victorian government, it has been agitating for weeks to get some answers from the Commonwealth so that it can make infrastructure plans of its own. It would like a seat at the table as the federal government promised it would have in the budget. On budget night we were told that the states would have a role in the tion of these projects. But a spokesman for the minister for infrastructure cut the Victorimembers as short. He said: ‘This is not a COAG decision. It will be determined by the federal government.' The federal government is going to make the decision about which projects are going to be funded. If that is not enough, the budget statement declaration that the priority list would be considered by COAG seems to have gone out the window. The Infrastructure Australia board also will not have a say. We were told that all of these things were going to be decided by the board of Infrastructure Australia. We heard the previous speaker and other speakers commenting about how all these eminent businesspeople are going to be put on this board so that all the decisions would be above reproach. But Infrastructure Australia is not making the decision; COAG is not making the decision; the government and the minister are making the decision. And you are asking us to believe that it is not a slush fund! In addition to that, somebody apparently did not tell the Treasurer, because he said today that, in fact, infrastructure is going to be right at the centre of the COAG meeting in December. You cannot have it both ways. It is not on the agenda, according to the Prime Minister; the Treasurer says it is going to be right at the heart and centre. There has been enormous confusion about the priorities. Originally, Labor said that the priorities were to be set by Infrastructure Australia. They said that COAG would have a say. But now it is clear the government is going make the decision. Projects were going to be assessed independently, we were told. However, all of the ALP election promises are exempt from the independent assessment process. Labor has virtually promised the whole fund already to people. Members have selec- been out there making promises, such as their Better Regions program. Only Labor and Labor candidates could apply. The applications are closed-no more applications are going to be entered into-and they are all going to be funded. No independent assessment will take place. Some of these projects had specifically been rejected for funding through the proper departmental processes. Labor promised them during the election campaign. They are immune from independent assessment and they are all going to be funded. We just heard the member for Werriwa talk about a project in his electorate, which he says is ‘going to be funded'-it is going to be funded; it is a Labor election promise. Where is Infrastructure Australia's role in assessing whether that project is worthy? What is the worth of all those independent businessmen if their advice is not going to be taken? In addition to that, you have to assume that all ALP election promises are meritorious and worthy and rank above everything else. That is what you are asking us to believe. Dr Kelly interjecting",116
125,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHEDULE B,Order!,119
126,Mr TRUSS,SCHEDULE B,"It is a slush fund, and Labor have decided which projects are going to be funded. They have announced most of them. They are immune from the process and we are being asked to believe that there is some kind of credibility about what is going on. The advisory panels have been sidelined. MPs have been listing projects all night that are going to be funded. Where is the independence in the process if these members have already got the wink and the nod that their funding is going to be all right?",119
127,Unknown,SCHEDULE B,Opposition members interjecting,120
128,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,SCHEDULE B,Order! The level of conversation is too high.,120
129,Mr TRUSS,SCHEDULE B,"This cannot be a slush fund, and we are going to move some amendments to the legislation. If the government does not accept those amendments it will be a further clear demonstration that this is a slush fund aimed at bailing out moribund state Labor governments and involving processes to artificially milk money into the system so that they can pretend that they are spending it. If Labor do not want this program to be labelled as a rort scheme, they should accept those amendments to bring some honesty and accountability into the program. Victoria, of course, had good reason to be concerned about what was going to happen with the allocation of the funds. They asked for $10 billion, but it seems they will only get the crumbs from the table. The Victorian Premier had obviously read Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald, where the Prime Minister stated that, no matter how economically incompetent the New South Wales government is, it would be helped big time when money from these funds is doled out. It is supposed to be independent, but the Prime Minister is telling New South Wales that they can get funding for some of their projects. That is hardly surprising, I suppose, because the Prime Minister is pretty dependent upon the New South Wales Right for the numbers for his leadership. Of course, the wife of his lieutenant, the minister for infrastructure, is the New South Wales Deputy Premier, so I hope that there is going to be appropriate arms-length distance between the decisions made about New South Wales. It is worth looking at the New South Wales submission for money for the Building Australia Fund in some detail. We only have to rely on the media reports because, in reality, the state government has declined to reveal its full submission. We have heard that there is $41 billion planned from the three funds, although a lot of that is not available. As the surplus created by the former coalition government spirals downward into the whirlpool of Labor's looming budget deficit, only $26.3 billion is left, with $12.6 billion for the Building Australia Fund. But New South Wales alone has asked for $40 billion. It is not going to go round. At the top of the list is $4 billion for an eight-kilometre rail line running through Labor seats in Sydney's inner west. All the projects on the top rung of Labor's priority list-$20 billion worth-are in Labor electorates. The regions in New South Wales miss out, as they always did. In Queensland the Bligh Labor government's top 13 priority projects for Building Australia funding are all south of the Sunshine Coast. It is obvious when you read the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on 7 October that some projects are going to miss out. One is the $12 billion North West Metro rail line from the city to Rouse Hill, despite the fact that it has been promised on eight separate occasions by the state Labor government. However, the New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma and bureaucrats in February were told not to bother putting the North West Metro on the New South Wales wish list, because there were no votes for federal Labor in it. And we are being asked to believe that this fund is above political cycles and electoral boundaries! The state and territory governments alone have put forward $235 billion worth of requests for funding from the Building Australia Fund and there is about $450 billion worth of projects altogether. Many of $450 million worth of projects are undoubtedly important and deserve funding. They have not been built in some cases because the private sector did not have the cash to build them or because other projects were given priority. You cannot do it all at once and the task will never be completed; we will always need more money for infrastructure. You do need to plan and build a national networksomething which the previous government had done. We were involved in an extensive program of planning with the states to develop AusLink, and therefore for the first time we had a priority, a long-term planning arrangement for the road and rail systems of our country. Finally, I want to talk a little bit about Communications Fund. This bill axes the Communications Fund. I spoke about it earlier today in the debate on the matter of public importance and I asked the minister a question during question time, which he refused to answer. I asked: what plans does the government have in mind to do the work that the Communications Fund was established to do? It was set up specifically to meet the future technology needs of people who live in regional areas. It was a fund in perpetuity. Two billion dollars was provided out of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra. It was there permanently to be able to provide funding to upgrade telecommunications infrastructure in the future. This money is being stolen to go into this group of Labor slush funds and there is no alternative in place. I call on the minister in his summing up to tell us what plans Labor has for modernising telecommunications, not just this year and next year, not just a response to the Glasson review, but what are we going to do in 10 and 20 years time? Where is the funding available to guarantee to country people that they will not be left behind? Labor's broadband scheme looks like falling in a heap and may deliver little or nothing to regional areas. What is going to be available for country people to catch up with the technology? You have stolen the money. You have stolen the money that was promised to regional areas. That money was committed in legislation which I understood Labor supported. Now you have taken that money away. We will move amendments to preserve the Communications Fund. Those will be vital amendments for the future of regional Australia. I call on the government to accept those amendments in the spirit of developing legislation that is fair and decent. We must have a continuing Communications Fund to ensure that this vital infrastructure is provided in perpetuity for the people who would the otherwise miss out as a result of these funds being commandeered for other uses.

131,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,SCHEDULE B,"It is a little sad when you listen to the contributions coming from those opposite, particularly the last contribution, from the Leader of the National Party. It is a bit like listening to an old episode of The Muppet Show. You have the cranky old men sitting in the corner talking about the golden age that was there before and how it was all wonderful in their time, that it was just a terrific time then. This is one of the problems we have with the opposition: they are obsessed with the past. The Australian public, on 24 November last year, actually voted for the future. One of the key reasons was that they voted for a party that was actually going to be a nation-building party, not a party obsessed with the past or obsessed with regional rorts and those sorts of things but a party that was going to build Australia and make sure we could unlock the capacity constraints of the economy that were affecting inflation. It is a pretty simple and basic nomic message-one that the Reserve Bank tried to give to the opposition 20 times when they were in government: that capacity constraints were a problem and were causing inflation. But it is also fairly basic economics that, if you provide stimulus to the economy in terms of putting in more money, you create more jobs and growth. I think the Leader of the National Party needs to brush up on his schoolboy economics. He obviously did not attend those classes. It is little wonder that they have problems in relation to glorifying the past and were going on as to how wonderful it was. We have a Leader of the Opposition who would claim credit for the sun coming up every morning; he seems to claim credit for everything else that can possibly happen. Of course, we know that by the time the sun has set in the evening he has changed his mind in terms of policy position at least once or twice, so it is understandable that the opposition feel they are locked in the past and not quite sure where they are going with the leader that they have. It is also the height of hypocrisy for the leader of the National Party-the party that is responsible for regional rorts-to talk about this fund being a slush fund. I can remember last year one coalition member boasting about a regional grant of around $1.7 million. It was not a member of the Nationals and it was not a seat in the regions of outer metropolitan Sydney; in fact, the $1.7 million that I am talking about went to Bondi. Yes, Bondi is where that $1.7 million went. It was one of the biggest regional rorts that there was. I suppose Bondi might be a prime location for the agricultural practice of latte harvesting! For the opposition to lecture us about slush funds is the absolute height of hypocrisy. The purpose of these bills is to establish the Building Australia Fund, the Education eco- Investment Fund and the Health and Hospital Fund which will finance improvements in critical economic infrastructure, transport, communications, higher education, vocational education and training, research and health. The funds are also part of the government's Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of the global financial crisis. The Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 establishes the Building Australia Fund to finance capital investments in critical economic infrastructure as well as in transport and communications such as road, rail, urban transport, port facilities and broadband. The Education Investment Fund is to finance capital investments in higher education, vocational education and training and research institutions. The Health and Hospital Fund is to finance capital investments in health infrastructure. These bills will fast-track the nationbuilding agenda, securing economic activity in the short-term and expanding growth potential in the medium to long term. The funds, part of the Economic Security Strategy, will help strengthen the national economy and support Australian households during the global financial crisis. All stakeholders agree Australia has substantial gaps in infrastructure that must be addressed if we are to continue to improve productivity and living standards. No-one opposite has suggested that there are not major and substantial infrastructure gaps that need to be addressed. While the implementation of the funds and the assessment of spending proposals are being accelerated, the proposals will still be subject, however, to rigorous evaluation. The funds are part of the nation-building agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis. The Prime Minister and the government have taken decisive and early action to protect the Australian economy from the global financial crisis, which started in the United States and has affected every other continent across the world. Globally, more than 25 banks have failed or been bailed out, the US and Europe are on the verge of recession and growth in China is slowing down. This Australian economy is sound but is not immune from the global slowdown and the real possibility of a global recession and the flow-on effects that would have for Australia. There are no easy solutions or quick fixes to the global financial crisis. This is going to be a long, drawn-out crisis which will have a real impact on Australia leading to slow economic growth and increased unemployment. That is why our Prime Minister has taken decisive and early action to protect the economy and all Australians from this crisis. The Rudd government has injected $10.4 billion as part of the Economic Security Strategy to stimulate economic activity and to protect vulnerable groups in our society, especially pensioners, carers, disabled people and low-income families. On the Central Coast we have worked out that families, carers and pensioners will receive $122 million. That is $122 million coming into our local area aimed at working families, carers and pensioners. It is also a shot in the arm for local business. I will little indulgent here and say that on this casion I would like to repeat my call to those on the Central Coast: if they are going to spend the money then spend it on the Central Coast and make sure the money stays there and helps our local economy grow. Retail is the second-largest industry on the Central Coast providing the majority of jobs and we need to make sure that those local jobs are protected and our unique Central Coast lifestyle is protected. This economic package helps to do that, particularly if people buy locally. Fast-tracking the nation-building agenda can secure economic activity in the shortterm and expand growth potential in the medium to long-term. Spending proposals will be subject to rigorous evaluation by independent advisory bodies. Spending from the funds will depend on the macroeconomic conditions. This will include advice from the Loan Council. These funds will help meet Australia's critical long-term infrastructure needs and will assist in addressing Australia's immediate challenges in response to the global financial crisis. The government is using a number of sources to identify the long-term infrastructure needs of Australia, including the work being undertaken by Infrastructure Australia. Where funds are used to finance projects with the states, they will be channelled through a new Council of Australian Governments Reform Fund. The funds are part of the government's nationbuilding agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis. The government has announced the funds are to be established from 1 January 2009. Infrastructure is a large part of this government's agenda. In my electorate of Dobell there have already been major infrastructure commitments and real money going into the local infrastructure needs of the Central Coast-in particular, $80.3 million for what be a is known as the ‘missing link pipeline' beoc- tween the Mangrove Creek and Mardi dams. This is a vital bit of infrastructure that should have been built years ago. We have on the Central Coast two dams: a large storage dam that is outside the catchment area and a small dam near the coast, which is where all the rain falls. In the height of the drought the Central Coast had its water supply fall as low as 12 per cent. We were close to running out of water. But the Rudd government came along and said, ‘This is infrastructure that should have been built years ago; we are committing to this infrastructure to link these two dams so that water can be pumped from the area where the rain falls to the large storit age dam in the hinterlands.' The prognosis for the Central Coast water supply following this commitment is tremendous. It is estimated that if we have average rainfall then, five years after the pipeline is completed, the water supply levels on the Central Coast will be up to 80 per cent. That is up from around 12 to 13 per cent at the height of the drought up to 80 per cent, securing the water supply of the Central Coast. There has also been work done on what the water supply would be if we were in drought conditions, as we have been. In those circumstances, this bit of vital infrastructure would still make such an improvement that the water supply in five years would go to 55 per cent. Again, it is a great improvement on the 12 or 13 per cent that we fell to at the height of the drought. If those on the other side say that this is a waste of money or a slush fund then I would like them to come along and say that to the people of the Central Coast. We had level 4 water restrictions. People could not water their gardens or wash their cars. They were worried about whether the water was actually going to run out. The Labor Party, the Rudd government, made this investment in vital local infrastructure on the Central Coast, and to call this a slush fund and to imply that this is bad spending is the height of arrogance and something that would absolutely cause people on the Central Coast to be very, very angry, because on the Central Coast we have had an example of a regional rort. We had the former government take a decision based on political expediency rather than building infrastructure. That was the infamous dredging of the creek Tumbi Umbi. In the end, we had a Senate inquiry about this. There was no process at all involved in the money$1.3 million, from recollection-that went for the dredging of Tumbi Creek. Of course, took so long for the money to actually flow through and the dredging to be able to start that in the meantime we actually had some rain, which washed out the creek, and there was no need for the dredging to take place. So those on the other side who want to talk about rorts and slush funds just need to come to the Central Coast and look at what the Rudd government has promised in relation to the Mangrove to Mardi pipeline-real infrastructure having a real effect on our water supply-and compare that to a couple of years ago and the Tumbi Creek dredging fiasco of the former government. The contrast is stark. Another bit of vital infrastructure in relation to health that was promised at the last election for my electorate is the super GP clinic. It is worth mentioning that again today because this is real infrastructure that affects the way in which people live. In my electorate we have had a great influx of new people who have moved to the Central Coast, largely from Western Sydney. But what we have not had is infrastructure. We have not had planning, because the former government was not concerned about that at all. Consequently, one of the areas in which we have had a deficit in what has been provided is health. It is with some great pride that we can talk about the super GP clinic that has been promised here and this bit of legislation that we are talking about today and the money that it is putting into health. In the whole of my electorate we are down to just over 80 doctors. We had a situation last year-and it has slightly improved this year-where there was one medical doctor for every 1,900 patients. Most of the doctors on the Central Coast have their books closed so if you are not already a patient there you are not going to get seen to. But a Rudd government promise to put a super GP clinic there is going to make a small but effective change in making medical services available to people on the Central Coast. There are areas of new growth on the Central Coast with over 16,000 people and no GP clinics whatsoever, and this government promised in the last election that they would make sure that they were putting proper infrastructure into these areas. On top of this investment the federal government announced last Tuesday the $300 million local infrastructure fund. It was a historic meeting between the national government and over 400 of the nation's mayors and shire presidents. In my area we have two councils. We have the Wyong Shire Council and the Gosford shire council. Together those two councils took away over $300 million-sorry, $3 million. They would have been very happy with $300 million but they are also very happy with the $3 million that they were able to take away. I would like to share with the House a couple of quotes from the Mayor of Wyong, Bob Graham. And, before talking about the quotes from Mayor Graham, I should point out that the last time the New South Wales government was a Liberal coalition government Mr Graham actually sat on the coalition side in parliament as a member of that government. He was happy to say about the federal government's local council infrastructure funds: I was straight on the phone to the other councilstanding lors to get them fired up about what it could be spent on. It's fantastic news for Wyong shire. We have a series of community projects we are keen to get on with involving a number of faciliper ties which the council will discuss. He knew straight away that the infrastructure issues that they had not been able to deal with for so long were now going to get done-the sporting fields and facilities would get lights. All those sorts of projects that for too long they had not been able to do they were going to be able to bring forward, not only building local infrastructure but providing local jobs on the Central Coast. Mayor Graham also made some comments about Mr Rudd's energy and his memory. He said: He was quite au fait with our area and we talked about growth and transport. He also spoke about the energy with which Mr Rudd went about the day and the commitments that he gave local councils for their local infrastructure. This is not some Labor Party hack. This is not some Labor mayor who was there. This is a person who sat in the last New South Wales Liberal government as a member of the Liberal Party. He, like everyone in my area, can immediately see the difference between the Rudd government in its commitment to nation building, its commitment to local infrastructure, and the previous government's pathetic efforts in its nation-building projects. Quite frankly, what the former government did was sit and fiddle while the money came in, frittering it away on regional partnership rorts like the creek at Tumbi Umbi rather than looking at unlocking capacity constraints in the economy and at building infrastructure projects that are nation building and that are going to have long-lasting effects for this country. Mayor Graham has an intimate underof the problems that the Central Coast faces in terms of infrastructure neglect. Through years of work he really understands the coast, its people and their aspirations for the area. He also pointed out to the local pathat the infrastructure funds came on top of an additional $2.37 million funding that the Wyong council will be receiving in the second quarterly investment of the financial assistance scheme. It is very important that we have a government that understands that, if Australia is to succeed and prosper in an increasingly competitive global economy, reforming the way we govern is essential. We must make sure that investments in terms of infrastructure are made at both the national level and also at the local level. We need to bring forward these infrastructure investments so that they continue to stimulate the economy and we must make sure that the vital projects continue to be fulfilled. The Howard government had an election cycle strategy in the decisions that they made when they had their hands on the wheel. Their Regional Partnership rorts were about votes that they thought they could get in the area, not about nation building. We now have a government of nation builders. For too long the Central Coast felt it was ignored in terms of infrastructure development. We felt like we were the poor cousins of Sydney. ",121

NA NA FUNDING APPROPRIATION BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed.",126
133,Ms JULIE BISHOP,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"I rise to speak on the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008. It is a long overdue bill. It has taken six weeks for this government to concede that the opposition had correctly called for legislation to be introduced into this parliament to support the government's bank guarantee of large deposits and wholesale term funding. It has been increasingly clear over those six weeks that the government's bank guarantee policies were panicked and poorly thought through economic policy. When introducing this legislation the Treasurer resorted to the now familiar political spin to paper over the cracks of this poorly designed policy. The Treasurer is so insecure that he cannot simply admit that the government made a mistake, that they should have listened to the words of the Leader of the Opposition, taken his advice and just fixed the problems they had created. In the second reading speech this afternoon the Treasurer made the extraordinary claim that the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for the ‘growing seeds of doubt in the minds of global investors'. What an absolute nonsense. That reveals the depth to which this incompetent government will stoop to blame anyone for their own probThe Prime Minister's inherent inability to admit to error-it is in his DNA-has started to infect others within this arrogant government. It is a sign of his inexperience that the Treasurer has been dragged kicking and screaming to introduce proper legislation to provide a standing appropriation for this policy. Yet when introducing the legislation to the House he maintained that his original policy design was flawless and somehow it was the Leader of the Opposition who was responsible for the growing seeds of doubt in the minds of global investors. The Treasurer apparently wants us to believe that if no-one had raised any concerns about the shortcomings of his original position, the Australian financial and banking sector-indeed, the world financial markets-would have just turned a blind eye to the fact that the government was introducing a guarantee on wholesale term funding without having a standing appropriation to back it up. It would fail the fundamental test of an unconditional, irrevocable and timely guarantee. The Treasurer is living in a fool's paradise if he thinks the highly skilled people working in large international banks and people working in the Australian banking sector would not have noticed the fact that the guarantee on wholesale term funding was not backed by legislation that provided a standing appropriation. He thought he would get away with it. So if the guarantee were ever called upon and, say, parliament were not sitting, there would be no standing appropriation and the guarantee could not be met. It was a fundamental error. The Treasurer admitted in his second reading speech that, since the initial guarantee announcement, ‘the government has been engaged on a daily basis in putting in place all of the detailed arrangements'. I bet they have. They have certainly been engaged because they have been trying to play catch-up with the negative consequences of their initial hasty announcements. The Treasurer confirmed in his second reading speech: During the government's consultations banks raised concerns about doubts in international funding markets that government will be able to pass legislation with sufficient speed in the event of a claim on the guarantee. Put simply, potential investors need to be confident that they can get their money quickly if a bank were to default on a loan. This was basic. A guarantee that is not unconditional, irrevocable and timely is not worth the paper it is written on. The government should have known it. They did not need the international funding markets to tell them this. The Treasurer also said: In one stroke, the guarantee provided support to banks, credit unions and building societies in the provision of credit to Australian businesses and households, and security and peace of mind to Australian depositors. In reality, it did nothing of the kind. In reality, it was one stroke of hastily cobbled together and poorly considered policy with serious consequences. When the Prime Minister was asked on 10 October what guarantee he would give Australians that their bank deposits would be protected, the Australian public was subjected to a roller-coaster ride of poor decision making that subsequently needed to be corrected and defined every step of the way. Now the government loves to claim that it was somehow acting ahead of the curve. The reality is that it was the opposition who was taking into account the global financial events and developing sound policy to provide stability and confidence. On 10 October the Leader of the Opposition and I held a press conference, and we called on the government to do a number of things including introducing a limited deposit guarantee of $100,000 or more. We also called on the government to delay its flawed ETS scheme and to put more funding into the residential mortgage-backed securities market. That press conference was reported upon, so the following morning the Prime Minister woke to headlines that the opposition had the Australian public to help us weather the global financial storm. Indeed, the opposition had a plan for protecting the savings, the deposits, of Australians. So began the government's political and media games. The resulting policy of this government was not driven by sound financial or economic considerations but by politics. By 12 October, on the Sunday morning, Australians were treated to photographs of their Prime Minister sitting around the cabinet table on the weekend",126
134,Ms JULIE BISHOP,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"No, they were not rolled up; they were pushed up. He was fighting what he has termed the ‘rolling national security crisis'. Later that day, the Prime Minister emerged from his bunker to announce an unlimited deposit guarantee. In doing so, he went further than any comparable country. If you take into account the United States and the United Kingdom, where there were serious problems and serious flaws in their banking sector, where their governments were recapitalising and purchasing troubled assets and where nationalisation plans were afoot in their banking sector, the United States had a deposit guarantee of about $100,000 and they were thinking of putting it to $250,000, and the United Kingdom were thinking of introducing a deposit scheme of about  %XW RK QR ZH would not do what comparable countries were doing, because that is what the opposition had suggested. So the government went further than any other comparable government and announced an unlimited bank guarantee for deposits. In doing so-and this is a very important point-he told the Australian public and the opposition that he was acting on the advice of the regulators and specifically acting on the advice of the Reserve Bank governor. We soon found out plans for about that porky, didn't we? That afternoon the opposition provided its support, given that the Prime Minister had stated that the regulators had advised on, indeed had recommended, this specific proposal. We of course had called for a more considered scheme on the Friday and took it as read that the Reserve Bank governor had given direct and explicit advice to the government to extend our proposal into an unlimited deposit guarantee scheme. After all, this was one of the most significant monetary policy decisions made by an Australian government in a generation. The Reserve Bank governor is the person in this country responsible for monetary policy. He is the person responsible for the stability of the financial markets. He is the person to whom the government should have turned for explicit and direct advice on this deposit scheme. The next day the Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister proposing a bipartisan approach to maintaining business and consumer confidence in response to the global financial crisis. This expression of bipartisanship was rebuffed by the Prime Minister, and it should be clear that bipartisanship-of course, always rebuffed by the government-does not mean that the opposition forgoes its obligation to the Australian people to provide critical assessment of government policies, particularly when there is so little detail provided surrounding this hastily put together policy. It was therefore vital that the coalition ask questions in parliament about what the obligations of the taxpayer were going to be and what obligations, if any, the banks would have in exchange for the guarantee. What has been most disturbing about this is that the government has been unable, or perhaps unwilling, to answer even the most basic questions on this guarantee. The opposition was alarmed to find very little detail available from the government-just a press release, and that had scant detail. On 14 October-and this was very revealing-the finance minister told ABC's Lateline that the government had been working on the detail of its bank guarantee policy for over a week and that the weekend meeting was merely to finalise the details. I will come back to that porky in a moment. Despite this, little information had been made publicly available. So it was that the bill came to parliament on 15 October, and I made it clear in my speech then that the three bills providing for the guarantee had not been subject to normal scrutiny. There was no regulatory impact statement of the cost, benefits and risks of the policy. This is the government that said it would adhere to best practice, but there was no regulatory impact statement of the cost, benefits and risks of the policy to the government, to the financial sector, to business and to the Australian public. In particular, I noted that the bills might have effects on those financial institutions that were excluded from their coverage. I raised that in my second reading contribution. The coalition supported the bill but, noted at the time, we were doing so while having to trust the government. I had assumed that the Prime Minister was telling the truth when he said he had acted on the express advice and specific recommendation of the Reserve Bank governor. On 21 October we found how that trust had been abused. We learned that within a few days the Reserve Bank governor was so concerned that he put his concerns in writing and said that there should be a cap-‘the lower, the better'. That is what the Reserve Bank governor said and the Prime Minister wants us to believe that he changed his mind overnight. No, they never asked the Reserve Bank governor for his views. When we finally saw the Reserve Bank governor's letter-only because it turned up on the front page of the Australian, not because the government produced it-we read that he said he wanted a cap on this unlimited guarantee, ‘the lower, the better'. We finally discovered that the Reserve Bank governor was not directly consulted. He was not even invited to the cabinet meeting-he was not there in person and he was not at the end of the telephone. They could ring up the Treasurer in Washington-they could get him on the phone-fat lot of good that would have done. But they could not get the Reserve Bank governor on the phone, let alone in person. He was not directly consulted. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, ‘It was akin to the Prime Minister declaring war and not consulting the generals.' On 22 October, during the Senate estimates process, Australia learned that the decision to increase the deposit guarantee to an unlimited amount was entirely a political decision in response to the opposition's call for a $100,000 scheme. I quote from the Senate estimates Hansard: as I Senator COONAN-When did you first have a conversation with any senior member of the government about the possibility of extending the proposal for a $20,000 capped guarantee to one that is unlimited in amount? The Secretary of the Treasury, Dr Henry, said: … I suspect it would have been the day the Leader of the Opposition first suggested that the $20,000 capped figure may not be adequate. So there it is. This was not a response to the global financial crisis; this was a response to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition had suggested a higher figure than the government, and the government was being outsmarted. That is what this was all about. Once the government had announced this guarantee, and with the lack of policy detail underpinning it, there was immediate confusion and distortion in the markets. The government was on the back foot. The Treasurer was unable to answer my questions about the fee structure in question time and he was unable to say whether the triple B rated banks would have access at the same rate and on the same conditions as double A and triple A rated institutions. We saw the extraordinary dislocation in the financial markets-extraordinary not because it was unforeseeable; it was foreseeable all rightwhere money in cash management trusts and debentures issued by finance companies moved to institutions that were covered by the bank guarantee. One sector of the financial markets was covered and another sector was not. In other words, the Prime Minster was saying, ‘These institutions are guaranteed and therefore they are protected and safe,' and, by implication, ‘Those institutions are not guaranteed and so not protected and safe.' There was so much confusion-for example, about whether superannuation was covered. The government was unable to release a comprehensive list of institutions and accounts covered. I am sure members opposite received, as did members on our side, many calls and communications from constituents asking what institutions and accounts were covered. To this day, the list is only a sample list. Australians who want to know whether their funds are guaranteed or not remain unable to obtain in writing an assurance that their funds are covered. The lack of detail is appalling and this added to the uncertainty in the market. By 24 October came the first of a series changes by the government to the guarantee scheme, as they desperately tried to patch up the inconsistencies and mistakes that were becoming increasingly evident. The government announced some details of the deposit and wholesale funding guarantees. At first the Treasurer indicated that the government would impose a cap with a compulsory fee, and there was a very comical question time where the Treasurer announced a compulsory fee on deposits and then realised that he had announced a new tax. The next day they scrambled around and decided that a threshold of perhaps $1 million would be introduced on deposit guarantees and that a fee would be charged for guarantees on deposits over $1 million. They tried to cover up the fact that he said it was a compulsory fee, and therefore a tax, and tried to suggest it was voluntary. Then the government introduced a graduated fee structure for wholesale funding guarantees. The government finally sorted out the anomaly with foreign bank branches. The foreign bank branches, as the shadow minister at the table would know, are authorised deposit-taking institutions deed.",128
135,Ms JULIE BISHOP,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"that are regulated by APRA. Yet they were excluded from the guarantee, which was extended to authorised deposit-taking institutions regulated by APRA. That was an appalling mistake, an appalling oversight, and funds flowed out of foreign bank branches into those banks covered by the guarantee. Then of course there was hardship caused to depositors in nonguaranteed institutions and funds, as those institutions froze them to maintain the integrity of their funds in case of a run on the funds. The Treasurer told the Australian public, who had their funds frozen, that if they had a problem getting access to their savings they should go to Centrelink. They were his of words. He tried to weasel out of them today in question time",130
136,Ms JULIE BISHOP,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"That is what he said. We have got a copy of the transcript. They did not want the transcript tabled, because of course that transcript does not appear on his website. The government then came up with another madcap idea and decided that they would tell those institutions that were not guaranteed that they should inquire of APRA how to become a bank-how to become a bank, a building society or a credit union. What kind of public policy is that? And then, finally, the government requested that ASIC provide advice on how to assist hardship cases where redemptions from funds had been frozen. There were so many adverse consequences of that hasty announcement made on 12 October. Consistently, the Leader of the Opposition called on the government to implement a cap on the unlimited bank deposit guarantee. Our recommendation on 10 October was that it should be at least $100,000. If that advice had been followed, the government would not have found itself in the mess that it people would not have had their funds frozen and the dislocation in the markets would not have occurred. We said the cap should be set at a level that the Reserve Bank recommended. We know that the Reserve Bank says ‘the lower, the better' and we know that the senior executives in the major banks have suggested $100,000-the CEO of Westpac has suggested around $100,000. The Leader of the Opposition also pointed out that the Treasurer's plans to establish this compulsory guarantee fee for deposits over the cap-in other words, the tax-should be abandoned, and we pointed out that a tax would impose additional, heavy and unnecessary costs on banks. The Leader of the Opposition also pointed out that guarantees of any deposits over the cap should be optional but subject to a fee. Eventually, the government came around to that thinking and made it voluntary. Specifically, the Leader of the Opposition informed the government, as he has on so many occasions over the last six weeks, that the wholesale term funding guarantee should be the subject of legislation, because the government was putting the Commonwealth and thus taxpayers on the hook for, potentially, hundreds of billions of dollars of contingent liabilities-without any legislation. That is an affront to our parliamentary democracy. Senator Sherry, I believe, said in a speech on 30 October that the deposits covered by the unlimited guarantee amounted to about $800 billion and that the wholesale fundraising amounted to about $1.2 trillion-in total, about $2 trillion. Yet, in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Treasurer was not able to put any figure at all on that. He was not able to quantify, in any form whatsoever, the contingent liability of these guarantees. Senator Sherry was able to do it; he said it was about $2 trillion. Now, couldn't has, the government have worked out a contingent liability, to put a figure into the MidYear Economic and Fiscal Outlook? Mr Bradbury-It's remote and unquantifiable.",130
137,Ms JULIE BISHOP,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"Well, Senator Sherry was able to put a figure on it. As the Leader of the Opposition noted, even if the government believed it had a legal argument to enable it to give a guarantee without legislation, it knows it could never honour that guarantee without an appropriation bill being passed by the parliament, and yet week after week we had every excuse as to why the government did not have to put in an appropriation bill. We set out what the legislation should include. More information was provided on the administration of the guarantee scheme, but there is still very little to give the markets, to give the financial sector, to give the banking sector and, more importantly, to give the Australian public any confidence in this government's policies. As for acting ahead of the curve, again, on 13 November, the government said they would not introduce legislation. The government indicated through the acting Treasurer and the Attorney-General, in response to specific questions from the Leader of the Opposition, that the government did not intend to introduce legislation. That is what the government said on 13 November. On 17 November, the Leader of the Opposition again called on the government to immediately present legislation to authorise the vision of wholesale term funding guarantees to Australian banks. He warned, quite properly, that without legislation the guarantees would not be effective commercially or practically and he asked that the legislation be circulated so that the opposition could comment on it. On 21 November, the Leader of the Opposition again repeated his call for the government to present legislation to provide for an appropriation to give effect to the wholesale term funding guarantee and to wind back the unlimited bank deposit guarantee. By that time the banks were sending the clearest message to the government that it must fix its bungled wholesale term funding and bank deposit guarantees. It was six weeks ago that the coalition called on the government to introduce this legislation. Confronted with the real impact of its panicked and poorly thought through decisions, the government refused to acknowledge or immediately rectify its mistakes. What is wrong with the government just saying, ‘The Leader of the Opposition is right, actually; we do need an appropriation bill-otherwise the guarantee will not be “unconditional, irrevocable and timely”, in the words of Standard and Poor's'? Why could the government not bring itself to admit that it got wrong and that in fact what the opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition, had been calling for was appropriate and responsible advice? Because the Labor government's bank guarantee has been all about politics. There was no focus on sound economic management and no focus on appropriate public policy. Over one weekend, in a series of long-distance calls between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-calls that did not include the Reserve Bank governorthis government produced a flawed bank guarantee policy. They did not bother talking directly to the Reserve Bank governor before unveiling it. They did not bother to take acpro- count of the Reserve Bank governor's advice before it was put in writing and made public. Since the announcement of the bank guarantee policy, the government has been forced to announce a series of changes to paper over the cracks of this ill-considered policy. If the government had simply adopted the policies of the coalition and announced that, in accordance with other comparable countries, there would be a limit on the government guarantee, and if the government had just accepted the coalition's advice that they needed an appropriation bill to give effect to the wholesale term funding policy, ordinary Australian investors and our financial markets would have been spared the six weeks of uncertainty and instability caused by the government's ill-considered policy. We support this long-overdue bill. We called for it six weeks ago. We cannot help but point out that, had the government accepted the opposition's offer to work in a bipartisan manner in response to the challenges presented by the global financial crisis, the problems the government has experienced and the hardship and dislocation that has been caused to the Australian public, the banking sector and the financial markets in this country would not have occurred. We it would not have seen funds frozen in these accounts to the extent that they have been. We would not have seen the massive dislocation in the financial sector as depositors moved money from one umbrella to another, not sure whether their institution was covered by the guarantee, not sure whether their account was covered by the guarantee, and all the time hearing the Prime Minister's words: ‘These funds are guaranteed; therefore these funds are protected; therefore these funds are safe.' By implication, the rest were not. Had the government just taken up our offer to work with them in a bipartisan fashion, had the government listened to the suggestion that an appropriations bill was needed six weeks ago, none of this would have been necessary. But what is becoming a hallmark of this government is that it refuses to acknowledge its errors. It refuses to acknowledge that the opposition has a legitimate role in good public policy development in this country. The Deputy Prime Minister told us that we should get out of the way. The Treasurer said that we were completely irrelevant-the same Treasurer who has been resisting for six weeks the call to introduce an appropriations bill to give effect to the wholesale term funding guarantee. Today the Treasurer eventually caved into the common sense being put forward by the opposition and introduced this bill. What a waste of time, all because of the arrogance and the incapacity of this government to admit its mistakes.",131
138,Mr BRADBURY,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"I rise to support the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008. I will turn my attention shortly to the elements of the bill as I would like to speak on some of the specifics that are proposed within it. I would like to begin by commenting on some of the remarks made by the shadow Treasurer in her contribution to the House. I think one of the interesting things about the opposition throughout this debate has been the complete lack of consistency in their position. We can go back to 12 October, the day on which the very significant package was announced by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister took strong and decisive action in delivering a package of measures that were designed to achieve a couple of things: firstly, to deliver greater certainty and stability into the financial markets but also to ensure greater liquidity. One of those measures was to ensure that there would be greater investment by the Australian Office of Financial Management in residential mortgage backed securities. I heard what the shadow Treasurer said and I have heard the Leader of the Opposition on numerous occasions claim credit for being the architect of this plan to buy up residential mortgage backed securities to provide greater liquidity to the institutions that fall outside the ADI net. I want to put on record that the comments that the Leader of the Opposition refers back to and the comments that he cites to suggest that he was the one that put this on the agenda were in an interview with Laurie Oakes on 22 September. I want to read the passage that provides the genesis of the so-called contribution that the Leader of the Opposition made to this particular debate. He said: We know that it has been very, much harder for banks, particularly the second-tier banks and financial institutions, to refinance mortgages and that's one of the reasons why the cost of mortgages has gone up, why interest rates have gone up. Now, in other markets, the government, particularly in the US, the government is taking a role, proposing to buy back, buy some of these securities, in effect to provide additional liquidity to take the pressure off mums and dads. That is what the Leader of the Opposition relies upon to say that he was the one that gave the government the idea of directing the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest in residential mortgage backed securities. I have got to tell you that that is not what they are doing in the United States. They are buying up bad mortgages. There is no suggestion from anyone in this place, at least now-there was on this occasion by the Leader of the Opposition-that we would be looking to take on the mortgage liabilities of individuals in respect of bad mortgages. That has never been what this discussion has been about. Providing greater liquidity through the residential mortgage backed security market is not about providing greater liquidity to mortgages but about providing greater liquidity in that marketplace so that the nonADI institutions are able to access the sary funds that they need in order to continue to lend within our residential mortgage market. I am horrified to think that the Leader the Opposition, who relies upon this passage to say that he was setting the agenda, was in fact mistakenly comparing the goings-on in this jurisdiction with the troubled assets lief program in the United States, which is something of a fundamentally different character. So let it be noted, when they say that he was the architect of this idea, that he was wrong. I will move on to the other elements of the package that was announced on 12 October, because of course the bill before us is part the implementation strategy of those announcements. Apart from investing in more RMBS there was also a commitment to deliver an unlimited guarantee in respect of deposits. Of course this parliament has passed legislation in relation to the Financial Claims Scheme to protect deposits up to $1 million held by Australian incorporated authorised deposit-taking institutions. That has been secured. Of course that leaves open the issue of those deposits above $1 million, and that moves on to the third element of the package of measures that was announced on 12 October-the third element being providing a guarantee in relation to wholesale term funding. Of course this bill is about implementing that particular announcement. The bill before us is only part of the overall guarantee scheme. It is important to recognise that. The guarantee scheme and its implementation has been ongoing for some months. In large part it will be implemented through contractual arrangements between the executive, the Commonwealth through the executive, and the institutions that are bad involved. Indeed that is not unremarkable; that is the way in which guarantees have been implemented in countries such as the neces- UK and New Zealand. What is before the House on this occasion is a bill that provides a standing appropriation so that, in the event of that there is a call on that guarantee, the executive has the capacity to immediately respond by providing funds-by drawing down on funds from the consolidated revere- nue fund. The bill also provides a borrowing power in the event that funds held in the consolidated revenue fund are insufficient to meet any obligations arising under the guarantee. It is a part-and it has become a more significant part-of the implementation of the guarantee scheme. It has become more of significant because of the role and the contribution of the opposition in this debate. Let us clearly understand what has occurred here. On day dot, on October 12, the opposition came forward and said: ‘We will support this package. We will move heaven and earth to ensure the passage of this legislation. We won't quibble.' Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition. But we have seen nothing but quibbling ever since. Amidst all of the sniping, all of the political games and the political point-scoring that has occurred on the part of the opposition, the only thing that has been achieved is the injection of greater uncertainty into the marketplace. These measures are designed to achieve nothing other than the delivery of certainty into the marketplace but those efforts are being undermined by those on the other side, who are determined to score political points day after day-often with no real impact in terms of the overall architecture of any of the schemes that are in place but in order to take those pot shots. But in doing so let them understand that they are merely contributing to an undermining of the confidence that these measures are designed to instil. It was interesting to see an article in the Herald Sun back on 8 October where Terry MCCrann said: OK, I'll take Malcolm Turnbull at his word. The Opposition Leader really is an idiot and doesn't understand how financial markets work. The article goes on to say: There's a bigger worry than Turnbull just making an idiot of himself. Again, he apparently doesn't understand that we are living in extremely dangerous times. Terry MCCrann understands that we live in dangerous times. When you live in dangerous times you need security, safety and stability not the unpredictability, the uncertainty and the fear-mongering that has occurred from the Leader of the Opposition and those on the other side. At a time of a global economic security crisis we need steady hands behind the wheel. Unfortunately all we have had are these political pot shots from the Leader of the Opposition, throwing more fuel onto the fire of uncertainty that has been ravaging the international financial markets. These are not the actions of a person capable of leading this country at a time of need; instead the Leader of the Opposition would be much better served by contributing in the bipartisan way that he keeps promising, and genuinely trying to achieve bipartisan outcomes. I note that in the Australian Financial Review this morning there were a number of remarks in one of the articles by Laura Tingle. One of the comments contained within the article was: The government has been resisting introducing the legislationthat is the legislation we are now talking aboutand the banks have supported this positionbecause it will make the job of eventually unwinding the guarantee more difficult and it may delay the finalisation of the guarantee before it begins operation on Friday. So what we have there is contrary to what the shadow Treasurer just told us. She said that there were absolutely no reasons why anyone would contemplate introducing the guarantee scheme in relation to wholesale funding and large deposits without introducing legislation. Well, there we have it. Not only was the government intending to do it, the government was in concert with the key stakeholders, who saw that the most expeditious, quickest and fastest way of introducing this scheme was through the executive action of the government entering into contractual arrangements with the respective institutions. Of course that has occurred. A deed of guarantee has been entered into on an interim basis and it is publicly available for those who are interested. These are the contractual arrangements that deliver the guarantee. That will continue to be the case but we will be providing, as a result of the passage of this bill, a standing appropriation and a borrowing power in relation to any future need to call upon the guarantee-however unlikely and remote that might be. That also raises the issue of the remoteness of the likelihood of ever having to call on the guarantee. Clearly that was one of the reasons why there was no intention to introduce legislation to accompany the administrative arrangements that were already in place. I mentioned earlier the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has been lacking in his contribution to this debate by merely hyping up the uncertainty that has surrounded the current global financial crisis. I make the point that, around the time that the guarantee was introduced in relation to deposits, the Leader of the Opposition was contributing to stirring up uncertainty within the marketplace. If I can return to the Financial Review article from this morning, I note that there were some comments there that tapped into the disquiet within the banking sector and in particular amongst key stakeholders within the financial services sector. The article reads: Banking sources have been uneasy about earlier comments made by Mr Turnbull about the deposit guarantee, believing his push for a $100,000 limit also helped undermine confidence among larger depositors in the lead-up to the tober 12 announcement of the unlimited guarantee being put in place. Clearly sources within the industry understand that these are dangerous times. These are uncertain times and the very triggerhappy approach of the Leader of the Opposition in coming forward and taking pot shots left, right and centre is only adding to that uncertainty. If the Leader of the Opposition is fair dinkum and genuine about his commitment to bipartisanship, he will appreciate the need to temper his comments and to ensure that he is not contributing to this uncertainty.  vice!",133
139,Mr BRADBURY,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"He would do well to take the member for Aston's comments to heart and take my advice on this matter. Can I say in relation to the threshold of $1 million that, if you listened to the shadow Treasurer, you would come to the view that this is part of a one-off decision taken by the government without any reference to the advice of the key regulators. I refute entirely the suggestion that the government acted without the total support of the key regulators or that it did not act upon their recommendations. The Governor of the Reserve Bank is a member of the Council of Financial Regulators and, acting upon the advice of the Council of Financial Regulators, the government made its announcement on 12 October. I draw the attention of the House to a further announcement made by the Treasurer on 24 October, when the Treasurer enunciated the reasons for the slight shift in the approach towards the $1 million threshold. The Treasurer said: Today the Prime Minister and I received advice from the Council of Financial Regulatorsand of course we know that on the Council of Financial Regulators we have the Reserve OcBank Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Chairman of APRA and the Chairman of ASIC-all the key regulators. So acting upon that advice: … the Government has decided that a threshold of $1 million be implemented, over which a fee will be charged to receive the benefits of the deposit guarantee. Importantly, it goes on to say: This fee will ensure the deposit and wholesale funding guarantees apply in a consistent manner for larger investments, for which deposits and securities are interchangeable. In particular, it will ensure that the deposit guarantee does not provide disincentives for market participants to operate in short-term money markets. So, clearly there is a very reasonable justification here for the threshold. Acting upon the advice of the Council of Financial Regulators, the government has recognised that we do not want to be making investments in the short-term money markets unattractive. We do not want to be providing disincentives in that particular area of the market by providing an unlimited guarantee beyond the $1 million without that guarantee having at its core at least the requirement for a fee to be charged in return for that guarantee and that that fee be levied in a comparable way to the way in which it would apply to deposits at that level. So clearly what we have here is sensible, reasonable policy based on the advice of the regulators-contrary to what those on the other side say. In relation to the scope of the guarantee, want to turn my attention to its coverage, because of course the government has already implemented the Financial Claims Scheme, which has protected deposits held by authorised deposit-taking institutionsAustralian incorporated ADIs-up to the value of $1 million. This guarantee scheme will, for a fee, protect deposits above $1 lion. It will also protect all deposits with Australian branches of foreign banks, once again for a fee. It will also protect wholesale funding for Australian incorporated ADIsand that is both short-term and long-term wholesale funding-and will provide a guarantee in respect of short-term funding for foreign bank branches where funds are raised from Australian residents. In terms of how ‘short-term' and ‘long term' are classified, short-term are those li- doned it. abilities with initial maturities of up to 15 months and might include such instruments as bank bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and certain debentures. In relation to longer-term liabilities, we are talking about liabilities with terms of maturity of 15 to 60 months, which would include bonds, notes and certain debentures. This guarantee will apply to these instruments whether they are offered domestically or in international markets. It is important to acknowledge that. When all these measures are taken into account, what we see is a package of measures designed to restore certainty and confidence to our financial markets. Since the announcement of the government back on 12 October, we have already seen some improvements in the unclogging of the arteries of the international financial system. We are starting to see more interbank lending at more competitive rates. We are seeing a narrowing of spreads. All of these factors have resulted from the decisive action that the government took in making its announceI ments on 12 October. The challenge for those on the other side is: do they support these measures? Ms Ley interjecting",136
140,Mr BRADBURY,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"I hear the member opposite suggest that they do support the measures, and we welcome their support. But, for people who support the measures, milthere is a lot of criticism and a lot of naysaying going on on that side. I ask two questions of the speakers to come. Firstly, what is the opposition's position in relation to the $100,000 cap? Do they still retain that position, or do they support the view of their leader-at least on one occasion-when he said they have now abandoned it? Listening to the shadow Treasurer, all I hear is a continued adherence to that policy even though the Leader of the Opposition has since abanThey carp and they argue about the unintended consequences of providing the guarantee and the impact it has been having on those institutions that fall outside of the ADI net. I ask them a simple question: are they proposing that we extend the guarantee to those institutions? Because if you listen to the shadow Treasurer, it almost sounds as though that is the only conclusion you can draw from the argument she is putting. Are the opposition seriously suggesting that we should extend the coverage of this guarantee to managed funds and other investment funds that are not regulated in the same fashion as the authorised deposit-taking institutions that are currently proposed to be the beneficiaries of this scheme? The member for Aston has gone quiet on that one, but I am sure that we will be enlightened by subsequent speakers in this debate, because if they are not prepared to put up- (Time expired)",137
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired, so he should go quiet. I would ask the honourable member to resume his seat and I thank him for his contribution.  start by saying that I think it is always interesting to hear a new member to this House carrying on about how they perceive the other side of the House. I was just chatting with my honourable colleague at the table, the member for Denison, who has been here three times as long as I have. I recommend to the member for Lindsay that maybe in the forthcoming Christmas-New Year period-I hope that he will have the opportunity to relax with his family-if he has any time, he might care to order just a few videos of his party during 13 years in opposition. He referred to the opposition playing politics and political point-scoring. I would just say to the new member for Lindsay-he has only been here for one year-that I really recommend that he does a bit of research about his own side of politics before he starts firing some pot shots at us. I have been here for 7½ years, and every day for 7½ years I have heard nothing but the Australian Labor Party playing politics with everything possibly known to man. So I think it is interesting to hear new members, in their naivety, try to present themselves in a way that makes them holier than thou.",138
142,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"I would gently remind the honourable member to return to the bill.  Speaker. We are here to talk about the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008. Looking at the explanatory memorandum, which I picked up off the table tonight, it is interesting to see on page 3 that the announcements were made on 12 October and the date of the effect of this bill is 28 November, and here we are today on 25 November introducing the bill. You really do have to ask yourself the question: what on earth has this government has been doing since 12 October to make an announcement on 12 October and introduce legislation into the House some six weeks later? Of course we know the answer to that question. The answer is they have been trying to sort out the absolute mess that they created with their announcement on 12 October. It is difficult to try to construct a phrase which in an adequate way sums up the absolute mess that this government has created through its announcement on 12 October. I have thought about various descriptions, but it is difficult to come up with a description that totally reflects the dislocation that this government's announcement has made in the Australian financial system. I guess the best way is to refer to some remarks from the Leader of the Opposition. He has made the point very strongly, and correctly in my view, that we are yet to see a leader of a developed nation throughout the world actually make things worse, by their response to the global financial crisis, other than Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister of our country. He has managed to earn this distinction for himself because through his policy responses he has made things worse in our country rather than better. I think that does define him in the true and proper way that he deserves to be defined. This bill goes to providing a guarantee scheme for large deposits in the wholesale funding issue. This is a proposal that the opposition requested of the government six weeks ago-weeks and weeks and weeks ago. And for weeks and weeks and weeks we have been hearing from the government that they would not legislate, that there was no need to legislate and that everything would be fine. So what we have seen today from the Treasurer is probably one of the biggest backflips in Australian parliamentary history. I notice that no government speakers so far have mentioned this, but Mr Deputy Speaker, you being the very astute person that I know you are, will recall that it was around the middle of this year that the government said that it would introduce a guarantee to cover deposits up to $20,000. We have just heard the member for Lindsay criticising our position for stating that there might be a deposit limit of $100,000, but it was the government that proposed a policy initially of $20,000. On 10 October that week we called on the government to increase that guarantee to a minimum of $100,000. We did that because we were hearing first hand the reports of deposits being moved from second-tier ADIs et cetera into the so-called big four banks. So it was that on 12 October, just two days later, the Prime Minister announced the introduction of an uncapped guarantee for all deposits of Australian banks, building societies and credit unions and the subsidiaries of foreign banks and for wholesale term funding. It has gone down in Australian political history, of course, that the Prime Minister did that without even talking directly with the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you would agree with me that it is incredible to think that the Prime Minister of Australia could actually make this decision without consulting directly the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.",138
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"I would like to remind the honourable member for Aston that as Deputy Speaker. I have no views.  Mr Deputy Speaker, for that. I appreciate that point very much. But it is also fascinating when one takes a second to reflect on the fact that, since all of this fiasco began in the ernment in and around this announcementand it may shock you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I know it shocked many people in Australiathe Prime Minister of Australia is yet to come into this chamber and actually address the parliament in relation to the global financial crisis or anything to do with the government's policies. The Prime Minister is yet to actually come in, stand up at the dispatch box and speak to the parliament about the global financial crisis and any policy response of the government. Mr Bidgood-Ten billion dollars response!  that the Prime Minister of this country is not prepared to come into the chamberMr Bidgood-You haven't been listening!",139
144,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"The honourable member for Aston will just wait while I remind the honourable member for Dawson that he ought to contain himself.  for Dawson is yet another new member and I appreciate that he has not been here to see the behaviour of his side of politics over a long period of time. It is amazing to think that we cannot get the Prime Minister to come into this chamber. I think I know what might be some sort of an incentive for the Prime Minister to come in here. If we were to relocate this chamber overseas, the Prime Minister would come in very swiftly. He would be very happy to address the parliament. I think the problem with this chamber is that it is in Australia. Because it is in Australia, the Prime Minister does not feel obliged to speak to the parliament at all, but if we were to transport the parliament to some foreign country I think you would find the Prime govMinister would be delighted to address the parliament-because, as we know, the Prime Minister very much likes to address foreign entities wherever possible. I think the problem that we have is that our chamber is actually in Australia. It is fascinating to reflect that point. Since the government announced its policy in relation to this guarantee scheme, we have, as I mentioned earlier, been for weeks and weeks hearing from the government that there is no need to legislate-that everything will be okay. Yet, of course, we see this legislation before us today. What has also been fascinating to watch throughout this process is the way in which this government has sought to cut people out of the debate. We read various media reports about how the government has consulted with the big four banks, but I know for a fact, based on my consultation with the industry, that the government has not been consulting with a broad cross-section in the financial services community at all. As a matter of fact, it has deliberately cut out key players in the financial services industry. That is a major concern. It is a concern because as a result of this government's policy there has been a huge dislocation in the Australian financial services sector. The investments of around 300,000 Australians have been frozen as a result of this government's policy. Government members may think that that is acceptable. Government members may think that introducing a policy to have 300,000 Australians' investments frozen-Australians who need security and certainty about their investments-is appropriate. I think it is exceptionally inappropriate. Those Australians have been locked out of their savings. Senior Australian business leaders have stated that the government's policy needs to change. Gail Kelly, the CEO of Westpac, has said publicly that the government's policy needs to change. Consumer confidence is now at an all-time low. Business confidence is at an alltime low. Inflation is at a 13-year high. We heard about the Prime Minister's decon laration of war on almost anything. It is fascinating to think about the Prime Minister's war on inflation, which he declared in January this year in Perth. The member for Dawson might remember that five-point plan to fight inflation. It is interesting that, ever since the Prime Minister announced his war on inflation, inflation has increased every quarter. Mr Bidgood-Interest rates have gone down!  tion of war on inflation and yet every quarter inflation has gone up. So I am not sure how the war on inflation is going, Member for Dawson. Three hundred thousand Australians have had their investments frozen. Senior Australian business leaders have called on the government's policy to change. Consumer confidence and business confidence are at an all-time low. Inflation is at a 13year high. Unemployment is now forecast to rise, and the government saysMr Bidgood-Interest rates have gone down two per cent!",139
145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"Order! The honourable member for Dawson will cease interjecting.  Speaker. Unemployment is now forecast to rise and the government would have us believe that all of this is within their plan. This is despite their war on almost everything that opens and shuts. The coalition welcomes this very longoverdue piece of legislation. This is the piece of legislation that we asked the government to introduce. We asked the government to do this weeks and weeks ago. For weeks the government berated us in the parliament and told the Australian people that it was not needed, that it was not required and that they had everything in hand, and yet today we see this piece of legislation tabled in the parliament. We support this legislation. It is long overdue and it is another sign that this government really does not understand what they are doing in relation to the global financial crisis, which of course is of great concern to the people of Australia.",140
146,Mr CLARE,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"It is good to see the opposition welcoming this legislation, the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008. We hope they welcome with the same gusto the legislation that we have introduced today to abolish Work Choices once and forever. Work Choices might be the most appalling legislation ever to be introduced into this parliament. We are very keen to see the back of it and we are keen for the opposition's support so that the working people of Australia know that when they enter their workplace they are entitled to fair wages and conditions that will not be stripped away because of laws that are passed by this House. I support this bill because it gives legislaper tive force to the government's guarantee scheme for large deposits and wholesale funding and provides a standing authorisation to pay any claims that are made under that scheme. As the Treasurer pointed out in his second reading speech, this legislation is not required to establish the wholesale guarantee. That is established by a deed of guarantee that was signed by the Treasurer last week. But the banking industry has asked for the standing authorisation to avoid the need to pass special legislation in the event that the guarantee is ever called upon. Our banks borrow a lot of money from overseas and the lenders want certainty that they can get access to their money quickly. Without this, they would presumably place a higher premium on the money that they lend to Australian banks. The government has opted for this approach to make sure that our banks are not disadvantaged in competing for credit in world financial markets. It gives you a picture of just how interconnected the world now is. If there is one thing that the financial crisis has shown us it is how interconnected the world is. The seeds of this problem were sown on Wall Street in the United States. Toxic loans that were created by merchant bankers in the United States have poisoned world financial markets and economies all around the world. The world is now on the brink of a global recession, all because of the toxic loans that were originated by merchant bankers on Wall Street. Major economies around the world are now either in recession or on the brink of recession. Parts of Europe and Japan are already in recession. The US and the UK are about to plunge into recession. Australia is better placed than most. A quick comparison between what is happening here in Australia and what you see in the United States: we are expecting our economy to continue to grow, in the order of about two cent, whereas the United States economy is on the cusp of recession. We are expecting to stay in surplus; in the United States you now see a deficit in the order of about $1.4 trillion. Another point that needs to be made about the American economy is that you will see unemployment there rise to around 7.5 per cent next year. We are in a better position than most for four good reasons: the first is our fiscal position; the second is our banksand we will talk more about that in this debate, I am sure, but they are amongst the strongest in the world-the third is our prudential system, which is the envy of the world; and the fourth is the strength of our biggest trading partner, China, where the economy is expected to grow by about eight per cent this year. First, the surplus. The surplus has come about because of a lot of hard work by governments of both political persuasionsLabor and Liberal-over the last 20 years. Credit has to go to the Howard government but it also goes to the Hawke and Keating governments. This is an important point to make. Things like floating the dollar and introducing compulsory superannuation and competition policy are all recognised by independent economists as being responsible for the last 15 years of economic growth. This all aids our ability to inject $10 billion into the economy to help fuel and stimulate the economy and help ensure that the economy continues to grow. Second, we have strong banks in good working order. It is a bit unusual in the current environment. It bit unusual when we hear about another bank hitting the wall every day. Thirty banks have hit the wall or have had to be bailed out by their governments in the last few months. Compare that to Australia where our big four banks are amongst only 20 banks worldwide that have a AA credit rating. They are well capitalised and well regulated. The legislation that we are talking about tonight is all about keeping it that way and keeping them strong. The third point is about the regulatory framework in which we operate: the prudential system. We have one of the strongest regulatory frameworks in the world. Bodies like APRA, ASIC, Treasury and the RBA are responsible for the good position we find ourselves in. These are the people who have helped ensure that Australia is in a better position than most other economies to deal with this crisis. These are the same people that the opposition have been attackingpeople like Ken Henry, Secretary of the Treasury, and Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank. The opposition have been alleging over the last few weeks that our financial regulators and our Treasury officials have done nothing less than cook the books. They have said that they fudged the figures in MYEFO. One backbencher said that the Reserve Bank increased interest rates for political reasons. They effectively said that these organisations-the Reserve Bank and the Treasury, our two great and important regulators-have allowed themselves to be manipulated by the government. Remember what the member for Goldstein said at the doors only a couple of weeks ago: he talked about the ‘smell of manipulation'. What he was effectively saying was that Treasury had allowed itself to be manipulated for political ends. I think that when the history of this crisis is written it will applaud the actions of is a Treasury, the actions of the Reserve Bank and the actions of the other regulators that have held us in good stead. That is already what the banking industry is saying and that is what regulators around the world are saying about Australia's regulators and regulatory system. It is their good work that has helped shield us from the full impact of the global financial crisis, by putting together the $10 billion Economic Security Strategy, the bank deposit guarantee scheme and the guarantees that we are discussing here tonight on wholesale term funding. The fourth reason Australia finds itself in a better position than most is the strength of our biggest trading partner-China. China is a life jacket in choppy seas. It is a powerhouse economy. It is also our largest trading partner and our second largest export market. Against the backdrop of the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression we are going to see the Chinese economy continue to grow. Like every country's economy, China's economy is expected to slow, but it will still grow at a rate of around eight per cent this year. That is what will help underpin our own growth. We should keep in mind that we trade more with Asia than with Europe and the United States combined. I was in Beijing a couple of weeks ago as part of a parliamentary delegation and I saw first hand the Chinese steely determination to make sure that their economy continues to grow by seven or eight per cent per annum. That sort of growth will mean that the Chinese economy will double in the next 10 years and quadruple in the next 20. The proof of this determination is the massive stimulus package that the Chinese government announced only a few weeks ago-four trillion yuan or A$857 billion. That is about 15 per cent of Chinese GDP. It just goes to show the determination of the Chinese government to make sure its economy continues to grow over the next year, the next decade and the next two decades. It will create the largest economy in the world and it will ensure that the Australian economy remains strong in these difficult and turbulent times. It is good news for Australia and it is good news for the world. All of these factors-the surplus, our banks, our regulatory system and the strength of our major trading partner, China-are very important. They give us the capacity to weather this storm. None of these mean we will get off scot-free. Things are about to get a lot tougher. The global financial crisis has already stripped $40 billion from the forward estimates. Treasury forecasts, Reserve Bank forecasts and IMF forecasts all show that the economy is going to slow next year and unemployment will rise. That is why the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates for the third time in succession, now totalling two per cent in the last three months. The total impact of that is significant. A two per cent in interest rates means a lot of money in the wallets and purses of mums and dads. For a $250,000 home loan, in the order of an extra $300 a month will no longer be in the hands of the banks. All of that money counts. These forecasts are also the reason the government is using the surplus to inject an extra $10 billion into the economy. It is stimulating demand to make sure that the economy continues to grow and that we protect Australian jobs. I am glad to see that that package was passed by the Senate last night. In a little over two weeks it will start arriving in the pockets, the wallets and the purses of the people who need it most-pensioners, young families and first home buyers. It will benefit some 60,000 people in the electorate of Blaxland. It will have a big impact in Blaxland. It is integral to the role that this government plays-that any responsible government must play-in making sure the economy continues to grow and Australian jobs are protected. When governments around the world began guaranteeing deposits and wholesale lending it became necessary for this government to give similar guarantees. That is why the government announced the deposit and the wholesale guarantee schemes on 12 October. Our banks, unlike others around the world, are not about to go under. These guarantees provide certainty and confidence to those who are going to rely on them. That is what this debate and this crisis are really all about-confidence. That is what explains the plunge in share prices and the paralysis in financial markets. Confidence is now what we have to restore. Our banks are among the strongest in the world but they do rely on foreign lenders for a lot of their credit. When markets went into meltdown and countries around the world announced similar guarantees, it became imcut portant to act quickly to make sure that our banks were not placed at a disadvantage, to make sure that our banks remain competitive. If we did not guarantee the bank deposits and wholesale funding, our banks would find it more difficult to borrow than banks which had these guarantees. This helps them borrow and get access to cheaper capital, and this means lower interest rates. I will give you an example of the benefit we have already seen. Soon after the deposit guarantee was announced, the ANZ and other banks cut interest rates by a further 0.2 per cent. A cut in interest rates by banks of 0.2 per cent has another big effect: it means more money in the purses and the wallets of the people we represent-something like an extra $40 a month. They were able to do that only because of the guarantee we provided on deposits. The ANZ and other banks said that they were able to do this because of policy measures here and overseas. We legislated for the Financial Claims Scheme six weeks ago-long after it was recommended to the former government by the HIH commission. This bill gives legislative backing to the guarantee scheme for larger deposits and wholesale funding. It also establishes a standing appropriation in the unlikely event that this scheme would ever need to be called upon. As I mentioned earlier, this is what banks were asking for. This is what they said was necessary to make sure that potential lenders do not charge a premium for the risk of any claim on the guarantee being subject to a special appropriation bill. That is why this bill has been introduced and why it should receive quick passage-to restore confidence in financial markets and to give our banks access to credit at competitive rates. I note in passing that page 1 of today's Australian Financial Review talks about this legislation: the need for it and the need for the quick passage of it. The article also quoted the Leader of the Opposition, saying: Mr Turnbull argued yesterday that the wholesale funding guarantee should be legislated partly because “if the commonwealth is to take on contingent liabilities running into hundreds of billions of dollars there should be a parliamentary debate … Well, fair enough, but where is he? If this debate is so important, if the Leader of the Opposition believes that this is the most important bill to come before the parliament this year and it is worthy of a parliamentary debate, I would expect to see the Leader of the Opposition participate in this debate. Instead, what we find is that the shadow Treasurer is leading for the opposition on what is supposed to be a very important bill. I think it shines an important light on what the Leader of the Opposition is all about here. It is about politics rather than the policy. Judge the man not by what he says but by what he does. Whilst he says that the legislation is important, he has not come in here to make the point. If this legislation were as important to him as he says it is then he would have participated in this debate. But he has chosen not to. He has chosen to use this issue for political point scoring-to send a press release out, to give a quote to the Australian the Financial Review, but not to come in here and do what he is telling everybody else it is important to do, and that is to debate this in the parliament. The government has taken bold and deliberate action on a number of fronts: the $10 billion economic security strategy, the $6 billion car plan, the $300 million to local government for community infrastructure that was announced last week, the deposit guarantee and now the wholesale guarantee. Taken together they represent coordinated action by government and by our regulators to protect the Australian economy and to make sure that we can do what we need to do to get through this financial storm, to keep the economy growing at a time when other economies around the world are going into recession, to protect deposits, to keep banks working and to make it easier for them to borrow, to get money into the hands of people who need it and to protect Australian jobs at a time when people are losing their jobs all around the world. That is our responsibility and that is what this bill is all about. I commend the bill to the House. Mr Bidgood interjecting",141
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"The honourable member for Dawson will contain himself, as I previously requested him to do.",145
148,Mr ROBERT,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"Isn't it interesting that we find ourselves in the House at this time debating this bill, the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008? It was only a few sparse weeks ago that the Leader of the Opposition called upon the government to introduce an appropriation bill for wholesale funding on the premise that Standard & Poor's and other rating agencies would only provide AAA rating to wholesale guarantees if the redemption could occur in a timely manner. Clearly, without an appropriation bill, timeliness was not possible. If the parliament were on recess, away on a six-week break, either parliament would be recalled or a redemption as in the government guarantee on wholesale funding would take the length of time of the break plus time for parliament to pass an appropriation bill and for it to receive royal assent. You would think that a government, once informed of this, would simply say thank you and get on with the job. But, unfortunately, one nervous little Treasurer thought it best to assault, attack, rebuke and fire away, denouncing the opposition's call. Yet here we are. One should, I suppose, give credit to the government for realising the error of its ways and for coming back into the House to do the sensible, the right and the appropriate thing-to pass an appropriation bill so that in the event of the wholesale guarantee being required it can indeed be paid in a timely manner. But the question needs to be asked: what has forced the government's hand? The government has shown through a series and a multiplicity of errors that its pride gets in the way of it coming back to correct the errors it has made. Could it be that the egregious nature of the error of not passing an appropriations bill simply meant that the wholesale guarantee would not achieve a AAA rating and the government had no choice? It is interesting to reflect that this government is the only government on the planet that has actually made things worse through its handling of the financial crisis. Let us think about that for a second. The whole range of countries affected by what has been going on has passed legislation, has passed bank guarantees and has made thoughtful and prudent steps. Clearly the crisis we are in is something that governments have not faced to the degree in which it has occurred for a long time. Because of that, caution has been the order of the day with most governments. They have trodden warily, they have thought carefully, they have legislated prudently. But not this government. This government has not trodden carefully. It has not embraced economic modelling. It has not sought advice. It has not got all regulators in the one room at the one time. When the dollar was floating, at least the Hawke and Keating government at the time had the good sense to have the Reserve Bank governor next to them, amongst other officials. But not this government. And because of the haste with which they have jumped into this, they are the only government-not only in the developed world but on the planet-whose decision making has made things worse. This began very early on in the government. It began with them taking the Treasury bench, when the government felt it necessary to expose the apparent dreadfulness, the dire consequences, of the HowardCostello years and sought to inflate and exaggerate an inflationary issue. Indeed, when inflation reached three per cent the Treasurer, a day before the Reserve Bank raised interest rates, rolled out that famous comment, ‘The inflation genie is out of the bottle,' followed by the Prime Minister, who spoke of the ‘inflation monster wrecking the economy'. At a time when other comparable OECD countries were ensuring fiscal policy that reduced interest rates and were increasing spending, seeing the dark, looming clouds on the horizon, what was this government doing? They were talking up inflation by imagining a wrecking monster and an almighty genie carving its way through. They increased taxes. The rest of the world was cutting taxes. This government increased taxes by over $19 billion over the forward estimates and they cut spending. They did exactly the opposite of what other, sensible governments were doing. To make matters worse they even cut spending to critical economic institutions such as the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, APRA, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They cut spending to organisations that are now so sorely needed. Then on Tuesday, 14 October Prime Minister Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan announced a package of spending measures totalling $10.4 billion, $9.65 billion to be spent in the 2008-09 financial year. Half of the forecast budget surplus has been spent. We-we now know foolishly-took this government on trust, we took it on good faith, perhaps no more. We thought that perhaps they would do the proper modelling. We supported the bill because we thought no government would be so reckless as to commit $10.4 billion without seeking appropriate advice, without regulatory statements, without impact statements and without proper economic modelling to ensure that the desired stimulus outcome was indeed what would occur. You can imagine our surprise. You can imagine the nation's surprise when it was revealed that nothing of this sort was done. There was persistent questioning in the House as the opposition sought to fulfil its role and appropriately question the legislation. There was no response from the government at all. It is not hard to see how this government is clearly out of its depth. That squandering in the shallows continued when the Rudd government announced midyear that it would introduce the government guarantee of up to $20,000. On 10 October, as the coalition observed what other comparable nations were doing, we called on the Rudd government to increase that guarantee to $100,000 in response to reports of deposits being moved from second-tier banks, building societies and credit unions into the four big banks. Other nations moved to increase their bank guarantees-the Brits to  WKH French to just over 200,000 comparable dollars, the Americans to over US$200,000 and other nations to sensible levels somewhere between A$100,000 and A$200,000. But not to be outdone, what did our Prime Minister do? He announced an uncapped guarantee for all deposits in Australian banks, building societies and credit unions and for Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks and for wholesale term funding. He said he had sought the advice of our financial regulators. However, we later found out that the Prime Minister had in fact not received any direct advice from the responsible regulator, which is responsible for the stability of banking system, the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He had not been directly consulted. The Prime Minister actually rolled out to say, ‘When we had made the decision, we turned to Secretary Henry to say'-almost as an afterthought‘is this also the view of the other regulators?' Apparently, Secretary Henry indicated it was. One of the most momentous decisions to be made and the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the head of APRA were not even in the room. What was the impact of the decision? At the end of the day you cannot hide behind facts. You cannot hide behind the truth and the reality of what actually happened. The decision created turmoil within the Australian financial system. Thousands of Australians, in fact almost 270,000 Australians, have had billions of dollars of savings in cash and property management funds frozen in investment funds. I was at a veterans dinner last Saturday night and sat next to Ms Kay Wilson, who explained how she and her husband, a veteran, have had their money frozen because 13 out of the 20 top cash and property management accounts were receiving such a run on their redemptions to the four banks that they closed redemptions for up to six months because people were moving money into the uncapped guarantee area. Major providers of credit to car retailers have withdrawn from the Australian market due to problems assessing commercial funding. Some estimates, and the numbers would appear horrific, have 20 to 40 per cent of car dealerships closing by Christmas-if that is to be believed-because of the inability to access funding because most cars in car yards are leased. The chief executive of the Motor Trades Association of New South Wales is the person who rolled out the figure of 40 per cent of car dealers going to the wall along with 30,000 jobs. The Westpac CEO, Gail Kelly, has called on the government to place a cap of $100,000 on the deposit guarantee. That is not what the government did-they gave an unlimited guarantee that completely skewed the financial markets. Then under pressure the Treasurer-that nervous Treasurer we have-in perhaps a moment of some weakness or perhaps indecision but clearly not having a grasp of his brief, rolled out that there will be a deposit tax. ‘Compulsory,' he said walking up to the dispatch box, ‘it will be compulsory.' If it is compulsory, it is a tax. The next day, of course, under pressure he repealed that and said, ‘No, it may not be compulsory.' The following day, Friday, he rolled out, ‘It will be voluntary, except for those with over $1 million. If they want it, they're going to have it and, yes, they'll have to pay an amount of money for it.' This is our Treasurer. This is the person at the helm of our fiscal financial system in whom we are supposed to have faith. The decision created absolute turmoil within the financial market. The coalition has been calling on the government for more than a month to release current economic forecasts. By way of history, we know that when the HowardCostello government came in in 1996 the finances from the previous Labor government were in an embarrassing shambles. The then finance minister Kim Beazley said that the budget was actually in surplus and balanced, but it turned out that it was over $10 billion in deficit. It was a shameful omission by the former Labor government. When we came in we found the books in such an abhorrent position that to ensure that no Australian government ever faced that degree of dishonesty and that degree of sham the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill, which required a Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, a MYEFO, was put in place. Treasurer Swan finally released the information on the day of the United States election. This is a Treasurer who stood up before the election saying that they would bring transparency into the system. He had the information for a number of weeks but he chose the day of one of the most momentous US elections to deliver it in order to hide it from the Australian peopleto hide the evidence of the economic bungling of what this Treasurer had done for the country. The MYEFO revealed that there had been a dramatic turnaround in the figures that this government inherited when it came to office in November. It inherited a first class economy, the envy of the world, an economy that had zero Commonwealth debt, an economy that had superannuation taken care of in the form of the Future Fund. The economic indicators had been heading all the right way. Indeed, unemployment had dropped in February to something like 3.97 per cent. But the economic mismanagement of the Rudd government, including Treasurer Swan, since coming to office has severely hampered where we sit. Consumer confidence has dropped to the lowest level since recordings were kept. Confidence is about expectancy. It is about expectation. It is about how consumers and small business expect the future to be. When the readings were showing consumer confidence at an all-time low in the very first half of the year, the great clouds of the economic crisis-what we now know as the KC-had not quite crested and broken. Consumer confidence was responding to the lack of confidence being exhibited by the government. MYEFO showed that the $22 billion surplus would now be little more than $5 billion, and many commentators are saying that the government may already be in a deficit position. This week Access Economics has indicated that the next two financial year budgets, just on committed spending alone, will already be in deficit. It took the previous Howard-Costello government 11½ years to get us out of the quagmire that the previous Labor government subjected us to and to pay off the appalling debt that they had driven the nation into, and it would appear that in just 12 short months the Rudd Labor government are putting the nation back into deficit again. The rhetoric from the government is indicating that they are going to use the global financial crisis as an excuse for incompetence and mismanagement every step of the way. Their rhetoric is indicating that they are preparing a nation for a deficit budget position. If the economy is growing at two per cent as MYEFO has indicated, which is surprising because Prime Minister Rudd indicated that growth will have a two in front of it-and Treasury for the first time in recorded history actually changed the way they looked at what growth will be by looking at a lower interest rate rather than at the interest rate which prevailed at the time MYEFO was done-that is a perfectly respectable growth rate. A nation should be proud of two per cent growth. If we have a two per cent growth, there is no need for any deficit budgeting. The opposition will not provide a leave pass for a poorly managed and incompetent government, headed by a very nervous Treasurer, to plunge the nation into deficit. The government will blame the global financial crisis for everything. They will blame it for every bungle that comes along, however incompetent. Yet this opposition will not allow the government to get away with that. A two per cent growth is respectable; there is no requirement for deficit. What is required is for the government to stop making horrendous mistakes. Errors will be made and the nation understands that. This nation will always give credit to a bloke who stands up and says, ‘Do you know what? I made a mistake but I'm going to correct it.' The average Aussie will give a bloke a chance, but they will not give a chance to an institution, an organisation or a government that tries to bluster and bungle its way through. The government are the only government on the planet that have bungled their response so much that things have been made worse in the nation because of it. I will give credit to the government for at least, after a month of our calling for it, coming into this House and putting forward an appropriation bill to allow for the wholesale funding guarantee. At least they listened. It would have been nice if they had said thank you, but perhaps that is a little too much to expect. The government are on notice that, however they pander to their union mates and colleagues, they cannot blame all of their incompetent decisions-their incompetent practices, their incompetent legislation, their job-destroying fair work legislation and the outcomes of that, which, industrially, will plunge us back 10 years-on the global financial crisis. This opposition will continue to keep them accountable. It will continue to open up and show the nation the mistakes and the mismanagement. We will not be bullied and blustered by the front-bench, and we will hold the government accountable.",145
149,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"It is always interesting when you follow the member for Fadden. His grasp of reality and fantasy often gets confused. In fact, I recall a speech he made earlier in this place when he said that the Leader of the Opposition had predicted the global financial crisis some 12 months before it started. At that stage the now opposition was in government and of course the notion that that had happened was totally fanciful. I speak in support of the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008. Over the past 18 months there has been significant upheaval in global financial markets. The government is acting responsibly, decisively and quickly to shelter the Australian economy from the full impact of the global financial crisis. The damage that the credit crisis has caused to the global financial system is considerable. Governments around the world have taken unprecedented steps to guarantee their banks and other financial institutions to ensure stability. Unlike the opposition, this government is about providing financial system stability, confidence in our banks, building societies and credit unions and helping to ensure the flow of credit to businesses and households. On 12 October this year the government took action to stabilise and promote confidence in Australia's financial system by instituting a broadly based deposit and wholesale funding guarantee. This guarantee is part of a coordinated global action. If the government had sat on its hands at this time and done nothing, the consequences for the Australian financial system on the global level could have been dire, and our banks could have been seen as below par compared to their international counterparts covered by government guarantees. This guarantee gave 13 million Australians certainty over their deposits. During an address to the TransTasman Business Circle on 21 October 2008, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Stevens, supported the government's decision and stated: This will ensure that Australian institutions, some of which are among the highest rated of the world's banks, are able to retain adequate access to term funding in an environment where banks of other countries are able, in effect, to use the rating of their governments when borrowing. Steps in these directions, in the context of what other countries were doing, were sensible and the Reserve Bank supported them. This is something that the member for Fadden completely ignored in his-I hasten to say-contribution to this debate. Additionally, the governor stated that action like this: … averted … potential systemic collapses that would have had massive repercussions throughout the world. Over the month of October, the now opposition leader, who likes to portray himself as a man of authority on the economy, had no less than seven different positions on the government's bank deposit guarantees. That is right-seven positions in that period of time. It is worth spending a little bit of time to look at his seven positions. Responding to the bank deposit guarantee at a media conference on 10 October, the member for Wentworth said: Now there are very powerful reasons for having one in this climate and we believe that $20,000 inadequate in this climate and … we recommend it be increased to not less than $100,000. That was his first position. Two days laterit only took two days-he said, ‘We welcome this measure, we support it and we will give the Prime Minister every assistance.' That was after the Prime Minister had announced our position. So there was a second position. Then on 22 October, on The 7.30 Report, he was apparently not personally in favour of the guarantee and said: Well, plainly because I advocated a $100,000 limit, I obviously wasn't personally in favour of an unlimited guarantee… The position changed a little later on the same program-we did not actually even have to wait another day. On the same program he said: But let me say this: the policy that was announced on the 12th of October was a failure… This was position No. 4 from the Leader of the Opposition. Then, again, in the same interview, he took another position, No. 5, that he was not going to form a view until he had received advice from the Reserve Bank. He said: What I want to see is the advice, unfiltered, the Reserve Bank of Australia. I want to see what Glenn Stevens proposes, and then we will form our view in response. In the space of that interview he had three separate positions. But it did not end there. Two days later on 24 October, the Leader of the Opposition said: Our initial recommendation was that it should be at least $100,000 and if that recommendation had been taken up we would not be in the Rudd/Swan created mess we are today. But given where we are today the cap should be set at the level the Reserve Bank recommends; This was position No. 6. Three days later the opposition leader criticised the government is for following the RBA's advice-position No. 7. Now the unlimited bank deposit guarantee was a very big policy blunder. So he had said, ‘Let's wait for the Reserve Bank's advice; let's get it.' Then when it came in, he said it was wrong. This was the seventh position from the so-called self-proclaimed expert on the Australian economy, the opposition leader. Mr Turnbull's actions have been a real threat to the stability of our banking system. This is one of the reasons we have acted responsibly again today. The Australian community and their banks could have been more comfortable if the opposition leader had stuck to his initial pledge of support. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition's growing attacks on the guarantee scheme sowed the seeds of doubt in the minds of the global investors. This shows again that the Leader of the Opposition fails to understand that the national interest is more important than his narrow political interests, and more important than his love of the sound of his own voice. We have, in the Leader of the Opposition, a person who likes to take credit for everything. You would expect him to take credit for the sun coming up from in the morning. But one thing is clear: by the time the sun sets at night we know that his position will have changed again. Today, we are introducing a standing appropriation to pay any possible claims made under the government's guarantee scheme for large deposits and wholesale funding. We have stuck to our position-unlike those on the other side, who might have yet another position tonight or tomorrow, or next week. Who actually knows when they will next change their minds? This bill will provide international markets with the assurance that Australian institutions are supported by a government guarantee, and that any payments will be made in a timely way. This assurance is something that the opposition has been trying to erode with its willy-nilly changing of positions. The bill will guarantee financial system stability, confidence in our banks, building societies and credit unions and will help ensure the flow of credit to businesses and households. The bill has two measures: a standing appropriation to enable claims to be paid in a timely way, in the unlikely event that claims are made of the scheme; and a borrowing power. The appropriation is not a legal necessity according to our legal advice, nor would it be a commercial necessity if international markets could be confident that there would be bipartisan support for an appropriation in the very unlikely event that one were needed. The government response to the global financial situation is to strengthen our economy and protect Australians by guaranteeing Australian depositors and wholesale funding, ensuring that the Australian market remains globally competitive. Since the initial guarantee announcement, the government has been engaged on a daily basis in putting in place the detailed arrangements. We have consulted with regulators and the industry to manage new developments as they have arisen, providing a standing appropriation is a part of this process. It is part ing efforts to work quietly and methodically through the complex issues the nation confronts, and this will continue as global circumstances change. Obviously the consultative approach we have taken to these matters means information can leak out from time to time, including to the opposition. Our promise is that at all times we will keep consulting broadly, work collaboratively with regulators and with industry, and act in the national interest. This government has introduced a number of strategies for tackling this difficult global financial environment, such as the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, to strengthen the Australian economy and support Australian households during the global financial crisis. During a speech in November to the Australia-Japan Economic Outlook Conference 2008, Malcolm Edey, the RBA assistant governor, stated: The fiscal package announced by the Government in October will provide a near-term stimulus of a bit under 1 per cent of GDP. He said the package was one of the factors that would: … help to cushion the effects of the much more difficult global environment in which we now find ourselves. That is what the regulators are saying in relation to the government's actions. Australia is not immune to these developments, but we are in a much better position to weather the storm than many other countries. The International Monetary Fund, in its October 2008 World Economic Outlook, commented: … sound fiscal positions provide scope for allowing automatic stabilizers to operate in full and for judicious use of discretionary stimulus if the outlook deteriorates further. It is crucial during these uncertain global economic times that monetary policy and fiscal policy work together to shelter the Australian economy from the full impact of of our ongothe global economic crisis. The economic stimulus package will have a positive impact in my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast this Christmas time. In Dobell alone, 43,000 people will benefit directly from the government's package. On the Central Coast, more than $120 million will be injected into the local economy this December. I know this is partisan, but what I encourage locals on the Central Coast to do, if they are spending their money, is to spend it locally and support the local businesses on the Central Coast. This will help our area weather the storms, the financial typhoons, that have swept the world, bringing with them financial upheaval. This is very important for an electorate like Dobell where the biggest employer is the retail sector and unemployment is already at 7½ per cent. So money that is spent locally on the Central Coast is very important to keeping jobs there. That is what part of this Economic Security Strategy is about: making sure that we continue to have growth and making sure that we create jobs and keep jobs. It is a global financial crisis that no-one foresaw the extent of. This is an unprecedented crisis which is still reverberating around the financial markets of the world. Governments around the world, including this government, responded with unparalleled steps to bolster financial stability domestically and globally. Such responses followed the upheaval in the United States caused by the collapse in the subprime market in that country. In 2003 the US economy was doing very well: jobs were readily available, productivity grew steadily, inflation was low and interest rates dropped to record lows that had not been seen in 40 years. With an increased household income, consumers purchased houses which in turn stimulated the housing construction industry, and house prices increased in value. With low interest rates and a booming economy, mortgage brokers, believing that housing prices would always increase in value, provided housing loans on behalf of banks and other lenders to customers who would not normally be granted a home loan. The RBA noted in its March 2007 Financial stability review: … sub-prime loans … are typically loans made to borrowers with impaired credit histories, which might include one or more payment defaults, a previous loan foreclosure, or bankruptcy. Because of their higher risk of default, sub-prime borrowers are charged higher interest rates than prime borrowers. The RBA also noted: There has been rapid growth in US sub-prime lending since 2003, with these loans accounting for around one fifth of mortgage originations in 2006 and an estimated 15 per cent of all outstanding mortgages. It is reassuring to know that this government has taken the steps to buffer the impacts of the global financial crisis. Our May budget forecast that problems abroad would slow the Australian economy and have an impact on employment. The government took the tough decisions in the budget to build a strong surplus to act as a buffer in an economic slowdown. This is now providing the flexibility to respond to deterioration in the Australian economy. Additional liquidity has been injected into the Australian economy by both the Australian government through the Australian Office of Financial Management. The AOFM will be investing $8 billion worth of residential mortgage backed securities over the next three years. Some speakers from the opposition have claimed, again, that the Leader of the Opposition came up with this idea, but he did not. In fact, what the Leader of the Opposition suggested in his interview with Laurie Oakes was that we adopt the position that the US government did and buy bad mortgages. That is a very, very different proposition from what this government did, and it is something that I do not think anyone with any economic credibility would suggest should happen-that we take on bad mortgages. What this government has done is inject $8 billion worth of liquidity into the market, and that is something that all parties have been supporting. In such extraordinary times, decisive action is essential, and that is what this government has done. Now monetary and fiscal policies are working in tandem to help Australia confront the uncertain economic conditions. Both Australia's financial system and mortgage market are relatively strong and healthy in comparison with other countries. The International Monetary Fund noted: … house prices fell in the first half of 2008 at an annual rate of 5 percent to 12 percent in Canada, Denmark, Spain, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom … Australia is one of the few countries that have continued to see a modest increase in house prices. The International Monetary Fund's country report on Australia highlighted the strength of this country's banking system, stating: Australian banks have weathered the global financial turmoil reasonably well. The four large banks that account for two thirds of bank assets continued to report strong profits through early 2008, together with adequate capital. In addition, Australia's four largest banks have been given a credit rating of AA by credit rating agency Standard and Poor's. Those four banks are four of only 18 such banks in the world, and the Reserve Bank of Australia noted that ‘of the world's largest 100 banks, only a handful have higher ratings'; and that ‘no Australian owned bank has had its rating downgraded since the onset of the credit turmoil'. The strong credit rating has enabled the banks to access both domestic and international capital markets. Compared with the US and UK, Australia's mortgage market continues to function. The market is also relatively concentrated in comparison with some other countries. The Treasury noted that, ‘Australia's five largest banks account for the majority of market share.' The entire banking sector has consolidated to some extent since 2000 with ‘the number of building societies falling from 19 to 13 between March 2000 and March 2007, and the number of credit unions from 218 to 137 over the same period'. Both the banking and non-banking sectors have made prudent decisions about international investments and home loans. Both sectors have had a relatively small exposure to US subprime assets and were therefore not as vulnerable as other countries to the credit crisis, particularly in Europe. The RBA noted in its September 2008 Financial stability review: US exposures account for less than 10 per cent of the total foreign claims of Australian-owned banks, and typically do not arise through lending to the US household sector. While some banks have reported that they have exposures to the US sub-prime market through holdings of financial instruments, these remain small when compared to the size of these banks' balance sheets. The guarantee scheme will apply from 28 November 2008. In the unlikely event that claims must be met under the guarantee scheme, those claims can only be paid out of funds appropriated by the parliament. This bill provides a standing appropriation for the guarantee scheme, which the government proposes to have in place by 28 November 2008. This will ensure the timely payment of claims, providing certainty for Australian and international investors in wholesale funding instruments provided by authorised deposit-taking institutions, including banks, building societies and credit unions, and providing certainty in relation to large deposits with ADIs. In addition, the bill provides a borrowing power to enable funds to be borrowed to pay claims under the guarantee scheme if there are insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the time those claims are to be paid. On 12 October 2008, the government announced a guarantee for deposits with all Australian-incorporated ADIs for a period of three years. The government also announced a guarantee on wholesale funding for all Australianincorporated ADIs, on application, for a fee. This government has taken swift and decisive action to ensure that Australian financial institutions are protected. It has taken decisive action to ensure that our economy remains as strong as it possibly can. The Rudd government has taken decisive action to provide a stimulus to the economy to make sure that jobs will continue to be there and that we can continue to have growth. The bill before us today is part of that scheme. This an important bill and I commend it to the House.",149
150,Mr LAMING,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"Bowman) (9.48 pm)Drawing this debate on the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008 back to the general community and their expectations of what we should be debating tonight, most of what we have seen in what has now become termed as the global financial crisis has been viewed by Australians through a television screen. Many of course are shocked by what they have seen but just as many of them are uncertain, not only about what faces us in the next 12 months to five years but about what a responsible and beneficent government should be doing to protect where possible and, where it is not possible, to adapt to some of those external shocks that may face Australia. What they also expect from us in parliament is a bipartisan approach to what is certainly one of the great economic challenges of the past decades. Their expectations would be that we have a strong banking system, a pillar of four large and highly regarded AA rated banks. They would expect that the opposition, along with the government, would be consulting with the major players. What has become clear over the course of the last month or two is that that actually has not occurred on the government side. Much of the debate tonight about the merits and the pros and cons of an unlimited banking guarantee is probably quite esoteric to most in the community. I guess the overriding sense I have found is that the government is exceedingly sensitive to any form of dialogue on this issue. Very early in their term, when, in November last year, the first offers of bipartisanship were cast across the dispatch box, you would have hoped it might have been the first of a number of offers to follow. But when it really came to the crunch and there is was some hope that there could be some bipartisan approach, that was not only ruled out but energetically resisted by the government. If every one of their moves were without mistake and without uncertainty, the Australian public would respect the government for that. But that has been far from the case. I think the opposition has done an exceptional job-not in a negative way, not in a pointscoring way-to highlight not only the deficiencies of a policy that has been very much put together on the run but also the reluctance of those opposite to incorporate the views of the opposition and, as we have learned here in debates at question time, the reluctance of senior members of government to talk in a constructive way with the very regulators that they are quite happy to roll out and quote when required. That became very obvious to us in the past four weeks. Let us remember a little bit of the context. It was 10 October when the Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer called upon the Rudd government to take three immediate decisions-to increase the proposed government backed deposit guarantee scheme to cover deposits up to, in this case, a minimum of around $100,000; to increase the investment into AAA rated residential mortgage backed securities through the Australian Office of Financial Management; and to announce that there would not be an introduction of an emissions trading scheme prior to 2011. The coalition at that time was committing to working cooperatively with the government to expedite the passage of any legislation that was required for the deposit guarantee. But, almost in contrast to that, what we saw was an approach by the government that seemed more about a political strategy-not only appearing to be decisive and committed without any doubt whatsoever but also giving a sense that they had to do something that was bigger, brasher, bolder and more confident and visionary than anything that had been proposed in a common sense way by the opposition. We woke up on 12 October to photographs of the Prime Minister again rolling up his sleeves, as he has oft tended to do, and, probably in a series of phone calls with the Treasurer, he concocted the unlimited banking guarantee. One would have thought that it is not a terribly hard thing to do to speak the nation's major regulators. Many of them are exceptionally experienced over the long term-they have seen a number of crises before and ridden the Australian economy through them. I would have hoped that, prior to finalising that policy, that intimate communication would have taken place. No matter how hard the opposition have tried, we are yet to clearly understand whether there was that communication directly between the Prime Minister and the Reserve Bank of Australia. That should not be a hard question to ask or a difficult answer to provide. One wonders just what level of communication there was, if any at all. It has been an answer that has been almost impossible to divine. The haste to finalise the policy should be contrasted with the lethargy in actually bringing this legislation to this chamber. The government was in haste to roll it out. One senses again that that 24-hour headline cycle was driving the Prime Minister more than any great concern for a functional, well thought through deposit guarantee scheme. When this deposit guarantee was announced, the Prime Minister told Australians and the opposition that he had had the advice of the Australian regulators. I think ordinary Australians would think of the Reserve Bank as being a fairly critical player in Australia's banking regulators. As I have said, we are not confident that the Prime Minister has done that. The answer has never been provided. On the other hand, any bipartisan approach has been firmly rebuffed-and it is worth examining why that would be. When it comes to the economic dogma of the last decade or two, economics has matured significantly over the last two decades. There do remain different schools of thought, but I am very confident that in this country we have exceptional advice. One would expect that there would only be perhaps some nuancing between the views of the two sides to of the chamber-I would not say that there are massive ideological fault lines that run between the two sides of this chamber on how to deal with the global financial crisis. For that reason you would think that the offer of bipartisanship would not be a difficult one to take up. It would not be terribly hard to extend the hand of friendship and actually think through all of the implications of an unlimited bank guarantee. Let us be mindful that Australia and New Zealand were two of the developed economies that did not have any form of guarantee until this debate of the last few weeks, so we have been relatively slow to come to the table with those policies-and that is for very good reason: there are as many pros as there are cons to a banking guarantee. But in the current times we have seen most developed economies moving not only to put such a scheme in place but also to increase them where required. A great reason for that is not only to avoid contagion but also to remove of course the distortions that may exist between different economies and the financial flows that can be aggravated as a result. After rebuffing the offer of bipartisanship what we then saw was a very precious determination on the part of the Prime Minister to go it alone. You might think: ‘Well, there must be significant political gain for an indiand vidual to make such a decision-to attempt to look not only decisive but also as if he is acting completely without the assistance of the minnows of the political system, those on the other side of the chamber.' Well, as I have said, if the government were making faultless decisions then that would be fine, but that is far from the case. As these inconsistencies and these inadequacies have been pointed out we have seen a rushed effortevery time something salient or pertinent to the debate has been suggested there has been a rushed mopping up of what has been left undecided. The government have rushed out a quick press release and then of course suggested that this was always going to happen. If we look at the history, we can actually see that that was far from the case. In many cases there was very little intention to move to address some of the concerns until they were effectively staring the government in the face-until the concerns were sitting, like the elephant in the room, as a completely unaddressed fault line that ran through the government's plan, with no move to correct it. Of course it is very difficult, once the regulators have been rolled out and used in pic facts to make it appear that the Prime Minister is shoulder to shoulder with the regulators and that their embrace is warm, to then expect those same regulators to be defending the inconsistencies and the inadequacies of our Prime Minister's hastily cobbled together plan. So of course when this policy was announced it did what had been suggested by the Leader of the Oppositionit created confusion and distortion in the markets. There was a lack of policy detail, and there can of course be some understanding that economic times were moving fast and that you cannot expect to have a finished product. But the government was determined to do it alone, to do it without the best advice to do it without the assistance of the opposition. So for that reason the scrutiny must be on the Prime Minister for the results. The government was unable to answer questions about the fee structure. Those of us who sat through the almost-agonising Senate estimates with Treasury could see that there was great pressure on the regulators to support the Prime Minister at a time when it must have been exceptionally difficult to do so, but they managed to do so. There was no detail on the fee structure and no detail on the fee levels. There was no detail on whether BBB rated banks would have the same access at the same rate and under the same conditions as AA and AAA rated institutions. So what did we see? Precisely what had been predicted-an attempt to move cash management trusts into government backed assets and debentures issued by financial companies, and confusion over whether or not superannuation was in fact covered. The government at that time was completely unable to release a comprehensive list of institutions or accounts that were covered. This only came at a much later date. It was at that time, again, that the Leader of the Opposition called upon a workable cap for the free bank deposit guarantee. We made initial recommendations, and of course those were ignored. That was part of the early debate. Mr Swan's plan to establish a compulsory guarantee fee for deposits over the cap was effectively a tax. We put it to this place and to the Australian people that that should be abandoned. The tax would only serve to impose additional heavy and unnecessary costs on banks at a time when they could least afford them, and it may also put upward pressure on interest rates, as banks would naturally seek to recover additional costs from their customers. Guarantees on any deposits over the cap, as we had put to the government, should be optional and subject to a fee. The fee should be at a commercial level that does not encourage risky behaviour or moral hazard by banks. The Reserve Bank had recommended a scale of fees in its letter to Dr Henry in mid-October, and once again the government had a chance to accept some of that advice from the regulators that they have so often claimed to stand shoulder to shoulder with. The wholesale term funding guarantee would eventually be subject to legislation. Putting the Commonwealth and thus the taxpayers on the hook with potentially billions of dollars that, if these obligations could not be met through consolidated revenue, would have to be borrowed was a significant ask. It should be noted that, even if the government believes it has a legal argument to enable it to give a guarantee without legislation, it knows that it would be very difficult to honour that guarantee without an appropriation bill at least being passed through parliament. So the legislation needs to state that the of the guarantee will be set on a commercial basis and, once again, on the advice of the Reserve Bank. Once this policy had been proposed, what we saw was a rush to patch it up. I have to say that over the last few weeks that has been a most unseemly exercise. Probably the only forgiving element for the government is that the average Australian who is watching what is happening, predominantly through a television screen, knows that the economy has been in good hands for over a decade, and I think they are hoping that the economy does remain in good hands. The last thing that any Australian would want is for there to be, over the next year or following years, dire economic consequences from the actions of this government over the last two or three months. That would be the most painful lesson to subject an economy to, and of course no-one wants that to happen. That is the very reason why there is an offer of bipartisan assistance, the offer to make sure that suggestions that are put from this side of the House are meaningfully taken up rather than summarily dismissed and then secretly added to the explanatory memorandum at a later date. It was on 13 November that the government indicated through the Acting Treasurer, in response to questions from the Leader of the Opposition, that they did not intend to introduce legislation. On 17 November 2008 the Leader of the Opposition again called on the government to immediately present legislation to authorise the provision of wholesale term funding guarantees to Australian banks. Then, again on 17 November, he warned that without legislation the guarantees would not be effective, commercially or practically. Four days later, on 21 November, the Leader of the Opposition repeated the call to the government to present legislation to provide price for an appropriation to give effect to the wholesale term funding guarantee and to wind back the unlimited element of the guarantee. By this time, the banks were delivering a very clear message to the government that it had to fix its bungled wholesale term funding and bank deposit guarantees. Well, we are still waiting. It has taken six weeks for the government to finally concede that legislation needs to be introduced to parliament to support this entire process. It has become clear that the government's bank guarantee policy was panicked and bungled rather than decisive. Six weeks ago the legislation was called for. It did not come. When confronted with the harsh reality and the real impact of this panicked and poorly thought through policy, the government has even now refused to acknowledge those mistakes. The government's bank guarantee has predominantly, I think we have now come to realise, been about a political strategy. The nature of an unlimited bank guarantee was one that surely no-one could possibly surpass-the ‘big pictureness' of it all. The fact that Ireland had done it for its six banks a few weeks earlier led the government to think, ‘Well, if they could do it, let's have go.' So what was announced was an unlimited guarantee, and it was quite obvious that in the mind of the government at the time there was no real understanding of what that implied. There was no real understanding of why, if it was such a fantastic idea, it had never been done before, save for Ireland. That should have been a warning bell that perhaps there are some significant cons to an unlimited banking guarantee. But those questions were not able to be answered at the time. Clearly, had there been reasonable discussion with our regulators, you would expect at least those answers to be there. We have research from the OECD, easily available on the internet, to show the fairly detailed work that had been done on reserve bank guarantees. It had not even been looked at, we sensed, at the time that this announcement was made, and I think that is to the loss of this country. That will be to the loss of many people. I know many of them may seem faceless. They may be people who have large sums of money banked and who, for one reason or another, cannot access them. It can seem like that is a long way away, but they are Australians like anyone else, many of whom are planning for their futures and many of whom have been considerably inconvenienced, if not put at financial threat, as a result of what many now realise was a very hasty decision. The government could simply have adopted the policy put forward by the opposition on 10 October. This is not about bignoting ourselves. It is not about saying we are better financial managers. It is about putting up a decent idea and hoping that the government would adopt it. It is not a hard thing, as the speaker on my side who preceded me said, to simply say: ‘You know what? The policy could have been slightly better. We had to move fast. We acknowledge these things require tweaking and ima proving and, yes, we will do it.' But making these improvements has been an almost agonising process. So what have we seen? Australian investors and our financial markets have been subject to six weeks of completely unnecessary uncertainty. It is one thing to try and cobble together comments by the Leader of the Opposition and say that he has had more positions than the Kama Sutra, but when you look at these comments they are effectively expressing an overall willingness to support the general trend of a bank guarantee but an uncertainty, a lack of confidence, in the way the Prime Minister has handled it. There was an unwillingness to give a blanket guarantee of support, of course remembering that the opposition has a basic right in any strong democracy to question the policies of the government. I do not think I need to say much more than that. What we do know is that when we look at pros and cons of these bank guarantees, many countries have faced the very same questions Australia has. Financial uncertainty will always lead to the revival of deposit and safety schemes, and we have seen it no better exemplified than in the last few months. These kinds of insurance that we are debating tonight are now appearing in virtually every OECD economy and in the countries where they existed before, in many cases, they have been ramped up. We know that the US has some of the highest amounts covered, and it has now raised it to US$250,000; Norway is higher at $375,000; Italy is just over $150,000; and Canada and Mexico are around US$100,000. I think it was perfectly reasonable to have that debate in this chamber about amounts in that range. As I have commonly said, it is useful to be at the front of the pack, but you do not always have to be the one way out in front, for the obvious sons-as any long distance runner would know when they get lost on the marathon track. We know that there are advantages in moving quickly and decisively in creating fiscal stability. Few would disagree with that. But we also know that there are considerable downsides to having a guarantee-in this case we believe that the upsides obviously exceed the downsides-as well as significant concerns about an unlimited guarantee. We have been wrestling with and grasping at those concerns over the last six weeks. It has been six weeks of agony for the financial markets, six weeks of agony for small investors, and had the Prime Minister been a little more humble in his approach, that six weeks of pain could have been avoided.",154
151,Mr GRAY,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (10.08 pm)-I am fascinated, in speaking in favour of this bill, the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008, because I have listened intently to the observations of the opposition. In the concluding moments of the member for Bowman's speech, I became convinced he is actually a showman, not the member for Bowman. To speak of an attitude by the opposition, because they believe somehow that the Prime Minister was being a little overbearing in the way in which the government pursued the urgency and the need to create certainty in our economy, is a little surprising. We find ourselves here today supporting a bill-on both sides of our parliament-which provides a standing appropriation for the guarantee scheme, and it will be in place by 28 November 2008. In the unlikely event that claims are made under the scheme, this bill will ensure timely payment of those claims. This provides certainty for Australian and international investors in wholesale funding instruments provided by authorised deposit-taking institutionsrea- ADIs-such as banks, building societies and credit unions. It also provides certainty in relation to large deposits-that is, over $1 million-with ADIs. The bill also creates a borrowing power that enables claims to be paid under the guarantee scheme if there are insufficient funds in the consolidated revenue fund at the time those claims need to be paid. The guarantee scheme is in place because we have increasing uncertainty regarding the stability of international financial markets. The government committed to swift and decisive action in support of the Australian economy and Australian families. On 12 October 2008, the Prime Minister announced that the government will guarantee deposits in Australian owned banks, locally incorporated subsidiaries of foreign banks, credit unions and building societies for a period of three years. The deposit guarantee means that the first $1 million deposited with an Australian incorporated bank, credit union or building society will be guaranteed free of charge. Large deposits in excess of $1 million deposited with an Australian incorporated bank, building society or credit union can pay a fee to be eligible for the guarantee. The government has also made the same commitment to support short-term and long term wholesale funding for Australian incorporated banks, building societies and credit unions and short-term funding for foreign bank branches. This ensures that vital Australian institutions are given the best possible chance when competing in international markets. This is particularly important given that many international competitors have the benefit of similar government guarantees. The Australian government guarantee scheme for large deposits and wholesale funding will be administered by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Treasury, the Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will cooperate closely to ensure the guarantee scheme is administered effectively. To access the guarantee scheme, eligible institutions will need to apply. The scheme is entirely voluntary and it is up to institutions to determine which of their deposits and which of their wholesale funding liabilities need to be covered by the government scheme. To ensure public and business confidence, the government will ensure the scheme is administered with full transparency and full accountability. In this light, the government will publish regular reports on the guarantee scheme's website. The government will also provide six-month reports to the parliament on the guarantee scheme's operation. Over the past month we have heard many comments from those opposite. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke at length on her claims that the government botched this policy-did that in this place tonight. If indeed it is botched, I find it very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition initially provided support for the scheme and those opposite will continue to support it, as they should. On 13 October 2008, the Leader of the Opposition stated: The Opposition welcomes the decision taken by the Prime Minister today to provide a guarantee for all deposits in Australian … institutions, banks, credit unions, building societies and so forth. It was a positive statement to make. Over the course of the last five weeks, we have all seen the Leader of the Opposition and various shadow ministers dancing around that commitment-at times working as hard as they possibly could to undermine public confidence in our banking system. You might well wonder why members opposite would want to do that. I know in my electorate of Brand, people have asked me that question: why would it be that the Leader of the Opposition, who one would think knows so much about the banking system, would be working so hard to create the maximum level of uncertainty? The answer to that is actually quite obvious: it is because he does know about the banking system that he is working so hard to create uncertainty. In the newspapers today we see significant and insightful commentary that comes to us from a number of outlets about the position taken by the Leader of the Opposition. In an editorial in one of the nation's most significant newspapers, the Courier-Mail, we see: Political capital is hard to earn. And right now Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull risks burning through this scarce commodity faster than the US banking system is burning cash. The editorial is, of course, about the position of the opposition leader with regard to the banking guarantee. The editorial is, of course, an insightful comment on the way in which the Leader of the Opposition seeks to do no more than build his own political position at the expense of the stability and certainty in the Australian banking system. Why is that the case? It was indeed the Leader of the Opposition who spent his time over the last few weeks gallivanting around the countryside telling everyone that we must actually have this bill-that we must have an act to create an appropriation to support the guarantee-because he knew that if he did he would create uncertainty amongst banks. He knew, because of his background and his knowledge of risk registers, the way in which banks understand risk and the way in which risk is transmitted around the world, that if he did that he could get a bit of a win-at least in banking terms. Today's newspapers suggest a completely different and thoughtful response from the media in Australia. The Financial Review states: The Big Four banks have told Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull his attacks on the bank deposit guarantee have been unhelpful and have urged him to back speedy passage of legislation to ensure funding for the guarantee. … banking sources say senior executives of the Big Four contacted Mr Turnbull on Friday and yesterday to express concern that his attacks on the government's handling of the guarantee were undermining the finalisation of the measures and its eventual effectiveness. What an indictment of the Leader of the Opposition. What a condemnation of a man who would argue that his principal qualification to be in this place at this time as Leader of the Opposition is his knowledge of the banking system. For the nation's premier financial newspaper to be so damning-and so precisely damning-of the opposition leader's tactics, actions and words is indeed a revelation. The article continued: One source said that “the basic point made to Malcolm was that he might be scoring a lot of political hits on the government but they have been entirely counterproductive from our point of view”. What is ‘our point of view'? ‘Our point of view' is the stability and integrity of our national banking system. The article went on to say: … Mr Turnbull has been the increasing pressure on the government over the guarantee and recently released private advice from ratings Standard & Poor's, which said that a government guarantee must be “unconditional, irrevocable, and timely” to attract the AAA rating, saying the advice showed a standing appropriation was essential. There we have it: the Leader of the Opposition took a rating advice from a ratings agency and carried it around the countryside, arguing that this guarantee should be in place. He argued that it was rushed and that it was bungled-arguments that were only ever designed to prop up a political position and not designed to create certainty in our banking system. The editorial in today's Courier-Mail went on to say: The bank guarantee was not about popular politicsand it is not. The banking guarantee is a tough piece of legislation. It takes character and courage to draft legislation like this. It takes understanding of our banking system. It takes an understanding of what is happening around the world in banking systems. You have to stare in the face of 30 banks around the world that are in trouble or have gone. You have to know what it is like to be in Washington and New York, as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been in recent days, talking with people who are creating policy and dealing with this crisis, not on a day-today basis but on a minute-to-minute basis. The editorial in the Courier-Mail says: The bank guarantee was not about popular politics, it was all about restoring confidence in a time of crisis. And quickly. And at the time the initial decision was made it had the full support of the Reserve Bank and the Treasury. As indeed has every single action taken by this government, by the Prime Minister, by the Treasurer and by the cabinet. I commend this bill to the House as an outstanding piece of legislation designed to agency support our banking system at a time of need.",159
152,Mr SWAN,DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE,"in reply-I would like to thank all members who have taken part in the debate on the Guarantee Scheme for Large Deposits and Wholesale Funding Appropriation Bill 2008 this evening. It is an important debate because we are witnessing turmoil, in global financial markets, of historical proportions. These conditions have prompted unprecedented actions from governments right around the world. Throughout this global financial crisis, the Rudd government has responded to volatile market conditions swiftly, calmly and methodically. To that end, on 12 October we put in place a broad based deposit and wholesale funding guarantee. Of course, these guarantees are part of the coordinated global action. They are designed to promote financial system stability and to ensure the continued flow of credit right throughout our economy. The guarantees are designed to assist Australian banks, credit unions and building societies to continue to access funding in domestic and international credit markets. Again tonight we have heard those opposite call into question the support for these measures from our regulators, despite the unequivocal public comments by the regulators to the contrary. I find it quite extraordishort-term nary and quite damaging for those opposite to call into question our regulators at a time of global financial market turbulence. It is an unfortunate continuation of the attack on the integrity of our regulators that was launched some weeks ago by the opposition. This attack, I think, is rooted in the frustration this government's policy is built on the sound advice of regulators and not on the latest whim of the opposition. These guarantees were put in place on the advice of the Council of Financial Regulators. We know that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia were of one mind in recommending the action taken by the government. In fact, the governor has said: Steps in these directions, in the context of what other countries were doing, were sensible and the RBA supported them. In fact, Reserve Bank Governor Stevens noted only last week that globally coordinated action of which our guarantee was part ‘averted potential systemic collapses that would have had massive repercussions throughout the world'. Of course, in just the last hour the OECD has had this to say about guarantees: Guaranteeing deposits in bank lending have contributed to directly tackling the crisis of confidence that reached epic proportions in early October 2008, when the complete breakdown of credit markets was threatened, with potentially dire consequences for the real economy. Our action has eased spreads in money markets. The guarantee has helped banks pass on lower interest rates to businesses and families. This bill will introduce a standing appropriation with associated borrowing power, which will allow the government to pay any possible claims made under the scheme. It has been made necessary by the short-term political attacks of the opposition, and those political attacks have created doubt amongst international investors of the bipartisan support for this measure. That is why this bill is necessary. This bill will provide international markets with the assurance that Australian institutions are supported by a government guarantee and that, in the that unlikely event that any claim were made, payments under the scheme would be timely. It is an important measure, the next in the process of responding calmly and decisively to these unprecedented global conditions. Undoubtedly, in the weeks ahead further adjustments may be necessary. Whilst I welcome the opposition's support for this bill tonight, I note that they continue to oppose the comprehensive guarantee on bank deposits. We have had a lot of schoolboy and schoolgirl debating tonight. There has not been a lot of substance. For example, the opposition continues to call for a cap of $100,000 to be applied to the guarantee. I want to assure the House and the Australian people that in these uncertain times we will not be moving away from the comprehensive scheme by introducing a cap of $100,000. This would leave 40 per cent of the most liquid deposits outside the guaranteemoney that could be moved quickly and could potentially destabilise our system. This is not a risk the government is willing to take when facing the most difficult times in global financial markets since the Great Depression. This bill is an important step taken by the Rudd government to secure the Australian economy from the ravages of the global economic crisis-a crisis which has already sent some of the world's largest economies into recession. Having a standing appropriation is not legally necessary for our guarantee to take effect, but the opposition leader continues to use the Rudd government's response to the financial crisis as some political football-further proof that he puts his own political interests ahead of the national Nothing could be more important now than bipartisan support for this guarantee. The Leader of the Opposition has judged that to not be in his interests. He insists on starting spot fires, raising baseless doubts and provoking uncertainty. In those circumstances, the very least you would have expected this evening is that the Leader of the Opposition would have had the gumption to come into this House and defend his actions, yet he has not even bothered to turn up. It is something he spoke about at length yesterday at the Press Club but he could not actually come into the House today to talk about it. The opposition leader's approach has not escaped the notice of the community, as the member for Brand said before, or other institutions that depend on leaders bolstering trust in the system, not tearing it down for political gain. Deposit-taking institutions have expressed their disappointment with the Leader of the Opposition, and so too has the community that has been a significant beneficiary of stability in our banking system and deposittaking institutions. Under normal circumstances the Leader of the Opposition's campaign, his ongoing efforts to talk down our economy and to talk initiatives in this place, would have little impact, but these are not normal circumstances. We are confronting the worse global conditions since the Great Depression. We must all put our commitment to protecting our financial system beyond a shadow of doubt and beyond immediate partisan interest. That is what this bill allows us to do. I urge the opposition to desist with their short-term political tactics, get behind the national interest and get behind these measures which mean so much to households and businesses in this economy.

154,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,I move: That the House do now adjourn. Drugs,163
155,Mrs VALE,ADJOURNMENT,"Today, for many for young people across Australia, illicit drug use is a deadly problem. While we are all well aware of the devastation that drugs can cause individuals, their families and our community, many including myself fear that their use has become endemic. We must send young Australians the clear message that illegal drug use is deadly and dangerous and that it endangers their future careers and their future happiness. We must also offer our young people a positive direction and educate them appropriately about the real dangers of drug use and especially inform them of the nature of addiction. There is a story in yesterday's Daily Telegraph about teenage students being given access to a brochure called A User's Guide to Speed while attending a New South Wales state government promoted antidrug and alcohol program. That is not helpful. The brochure includes tips like, ‘If you don't already have a reliable dealer, try to find one and stick with them' and, further, ‘When you're using a new batch of speed, only try a little first-you can always use the rest later if you need to.' This is a shocking demonstration of how a completely misguided harmminimisation approach by the Labor government in New South Wales is failing our young people and their families. This is not the first case in New South Wales. Former New South Wales Labor health minister, Reba Meagher, ordered the pulping of another controversial brochure in June this year. Six months later, Reba Meagher is gone but that very same brochure is still in circulation, along with this new material already mentioned. The person who found this material and brought it to the attention of the public through the media is the highly respected drug campaigner, Darren Marton. Darren is the founder of the No-Way Campaign and will be coming to Parliament House tomorrow to encourage the federal government to commit to the war on drugs. He will also be meeting with Senator Cormann, shadow parliamentary secretary for health administration; the member for Mackellar, who chaired a House of Representatives inquiry into illicit drugs last year; and the member for Riverina, who chaired a parliamentary inquiry into drug abuse a few years ago. Darren Marton is no ordinary antidrugs campaigner. He is well placed to comment on substance abuse, having succumbed at an early age to the addiction of illicit drugs, which gradually ruined his promising career in the sports of rugby league and water polo. As a rising young sports star, Darren began smoking cannabis in high school but, as so often happens, progressed to heavier drugs and by his early 20s was addicted to heroin. After experiencing a living hell over the next 20 years, which included stints in jail and psychiatric wards, Darren finally experienced the terrors of crystal methamphetamine, more commonly known as ice. Howat ever, in 2004, after a great personal struggle, enduring loneliness and great unhappiness in his life, Darren found an inner strength and managed to turn his life around. He then vowed to use his own life experience to share with young people the dangers he personally found were the consequences of illicit drug use. I was privileged to attend the launch of Darren Marton's No-Way Campaign at the Cronulla Sharks about three years ago and heard him give a deep and moving account of the impact of drugs on his life. Darren was a gifted young athlete who had the world at his feet. He was champion at shot-put, water polo and butterfly. He played junior representative football with the Cronulla Sharks in New South Wales and accepted a scholarship with the Sharks at the age of 16. Before that he had been a state rep player and, over a period of nine years, had captained his junior rugby league football team, the Gymea Gorillas, to a record nine premierships, all before losing it to drugs. However, Darren will say that he lost more to drugs than just his bright future in sport; he lost his self-esteem, his self-confidence and his opportunity for a good education and the promise of a brilliant career. Worst of all, he almost lost his mother and father. I would like to pay tribute to the work Darren is doing, to his courage and determination in giving up drugs and to his commitment to creating a confronting and powerful campaign to warn our precious young Australians of the deadly dangers of drug use. Darren Marton should not be alone in his efforts to encourage young people to fulfil their dreams. We all have a duty to educate our young people about the ramifications of illicit drug use. Just like we would not allow our children to play in the traffic, we should be prepared to take a zero tolerance approach to this insipid curse that wrecks the lives of so many young Australians. I look forward to welcoming Darren Marton of the No-Way Campaign to Parliament House tomorrow. Australian National Academy of Music",163
156,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"The Australian National Academy of Music is located in Bank Street, South Melbourne, in my electorate. It is part of the arts precinct in Southbank and South Melbourne that employs many people and brings such cultural vitality to the area I represent. Many of its staff and some of its students are my constituents. I respect the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I know he has had a difficult job grappling with the future of the Australian National Academy of Music, but I make no secret of the fact that I regret the minister's decision to end funding for the academy as of the end of this year. I have discussed this issue with the minister and with the director of the academy. It is still my view that it is in the interests of academy's students and in the interests of the future of classical music performance in Australia for the academy to remain in existence and in its present premises. Achieving that objective is my aim. The current proposal is that the academy's functions be transferred to a new body, the that Australian Institute of Music Performance, located at the University of Melbourne. There are no physical premises ready at the university to receive the academy's students at the start of 2009. I understand that the university intends building a new performance facility at the conservatorium, but that will certainly not be ready next year, so the academy's current students will at best have to be in makeshift premises next year, to the detriment of their training. The minister has said that transitional arrangements will be made for ANAM students in 2009. I am sure he means this, but I still think that there is a risk that students who have already been accepted by the academy for 2009 and have planned their lives around that assumption may find themselves with no place to perform. Some have indicated that they will go overseas. This would be a tragedy for Australia. The second issue is that the function of a university is to grant degrees and to educate students to the level required to gain a degree. The Australian National Academy of Music is not an educational institution in that sense. Many of its students are already graduates in music. Its function is not to grant degrees; it is to train elite musical performers and to bring them to a level at which they can perform with the best musicians in the world. Moving them to Melbourne university, an institution with different objectives, and placing them in an undergraduate environment, with all its competing pressures and distractions, will also be to their the detriment. The minister has said that ANAM students will be able to undertake non-degree based performance training at the university. That may be the intention, but I am not persuaded that this will be an adequate substitute for the training they are currently getting at the dedicated facilities at the academy in South Melbourne. Since the minister announced his decision, I have seen the academy's development strategy of December 2006 and the report on the academy's future by Jonathan Mills. Both these reports recommended that the academy be retained as an independent institution and that its funding be increased to enable it to meet its responsibilities more effectively. Mr Mills recommended that the academy's funding be increased from its current $2.5 million a year to about $6.5 million or $7 million. I note that we spend $15 million a year training elite sports men and women at the Australian Institute of Sport. Achieving excellence in the arts is every bit as importantand many would say it is more importantas achieving excellence in sport. I hope the minister will take note of the concerns expressed by the students and staff of the academy and of the respected members of the arts community-concerns that I, as the academy's local member, have given voice to tonight-and reconsider his decision. I stand ready to work with the minister for the benefit of the ANAM staff and, most importantly, its current and prospective students. We cannot say to our greatest future classical music talent: you were once elite and now you are on the street. Maranoa Electorate: Surat Coal Basin",165
157,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to talk about the Surat coal basin, which lies largely in my electorate of Maranoa and floats up into the edge of the electorate of Flynn. I want to talk about a forum that was held in my electorate last week in the town of Dalby, that was organised by the Deputy Premier, Paul Lucas. I think that in a large part the Deputy Premier was responding not only to the calls of organisations such as AgForce and to those of local mayors but also to the forum that I held and had invited the Deputy Premier and Minister Wilson to in July this year. Some of the concerns that landholders have in relation to the development of the coal seam methane gas and the coal industry-the mining exploration for coal in the Surat coal basin-are the issues of access to their land and, if there are resources below the soil, how those resources will be accessed. Quite apart from that, there are large environmental issues that many landholders are still concerned about. The Deputy Premier, Paul Lucas, did come to the forum. He addressed the meeting, as did the local mayor. He was welcomed in a very cordial manner, as were all the attendees at the forum, many of whom were perhaps not invited but turned up because of the real concern in our community with regard to the access arrangements to the coal seam methane and the resources below the soil, mainly coal. The Deputy Premier did announce some changes that he would bring forward in relation to the access arrangements, including a code of practice. This is long overdue, but it will certainly make a difference in relation to negotiations between mining and gas companies and the landholders. Up until the last month it has in many ways been a bit ‘Rafferty's rules'. There has been angst in the community. There has been a lot of anger expressed to my office and to me, and at meetings that have been organised by AgForce and other community groups there has also been real anger. It did appear to me that a lot of the companies felt that they had a divine right to go onto people's land and that they had primacy over the title deed holders. Whilst they might have a right to the mining of the resources below the soil, they certainly need to do a lot more in public relations and dealing with people's property, particularly in relation to access arrangements when people are trying to conduct a business on that land and also in relation to any possible compensation that those landholders could gain from a negotiated outcome between the coal seam methane gas company and the landholder. So I look forward to seeing the results of that code of practice and I hope it will go a long way towards easing some of the confusion and anger that has been in the community. The day before the forum I attended the Queensland Gas and Sunshine Gas installation just south of Chinchilla, which is now being taken over by British Gas. It is interesting. The CEO of British Gas was out here to meet with the workers and to look at the plans for the development of that coal seam methane gas south of Chinchilla. Their proposal is to prove up enough gas, take it to Gladstone and convert it to LNG for export. That is going to be a terribly important resource for the whole nation. It is interesting that British Gas are now a capitalised company on the publicly listed stock exchange in London and are actually worth more than BHP. That will give you some idea of this global company that has come into my electorate and has made a friendly takeover of Queensland Gas and Sunshine Gas. One of the important aspects of the coal seam methane operation at that installation just south of Chinchilla is that the people who work in that industry are local people. They are people who live in the towns of Wallumbilla, Surat, Chinchilla, Miles and Roma. They are not fly in, fly out, so some of the wealth that is coming from below the soil is, through those wages and salaries, being felt and a benefit is coming to our local communities. I do not have time tonight, but I will return to talk about global food security and the issue of prime agricultural land. (Time expired) Norfolk Island and Tasmania",166
158,Mr ADAMS,ADJOURNMENT,"I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, and the committee recently had a visit to Norfolk Island on a familiarisation trip and also to speak to many groups there. I had been there before, in fact earlier in the year, to research some of my relatives who passed through there, both as convicts and as free men and women. A fact that is not totally known in this country is that many people who were on Norfolk Island, for fair or foul reasons, eventually settled in Tasmania. Two spots in particular were New Norfolk in the south of Tasmania, in the great electorate of Lyons and the entrance to the Derwent Valley, and Norfolk Plains, which is where I currently live. I grew up in the towns of Longford, including Cressy, Westbury and Perth. These places were named because of the people coming from Norfolk Island and not from the county of Norfolk in England. If you compare the two islands, you find there are quite a few similarities, although Norfolk Island is much smaller. The architecture from the past must have come out of the same design book and no doubt the same architect from the Colonial Office. Norfolk Island's Kingston, or the KAVHA area, might have been lifted straight from Port Arthur, or vice versa. The families in Tasmania also share many links with Norfolk Island, and they can be found in the graves at Kingston, in the literature and also at the museum. So this year, when New Norfolk was celebrating its bicentenary as a town, the First Fleeters invited members of the Norfolk Island equivalent group, and they delighted in exchanging histories and family stories while visiting the many sites that are associated with those early days. To commemorate the occasion as well, I organised to present two Norfolk Island pines-those majestic, distinctive trees that grace the skyline wherever you look in Norfolk Island-to the Derwent Valley council last Sunday, along with a Norfolk Island flag. The mayor, Tony Nicholson, accepted the young trees and put them in the care of the Derwent Valley Garden Club to look after until they are big enough to plant out in a short while. It was a great occasion and many of the locals dressed in period costume. Croquet was being played on the council office's lawn when I arrived and I also inspected a magnificent display of spring and early summer flowers by the garden club. There were also displays of furniture and gadgets from the past. There were some wonderful women practising the fine art of making lace in the great town of New Norfolk in the electorate of Lyons. The children had also been busy making fans and other fantasy garden items. It has been a great year for New Norfolk with events happening every month to commemorate various aspects of the bicentenary. I have been able to be part of a couple, which tive has been a very pleasurable experience. I would just like to congratulate New Norfolk, the mayor and the councillors along with the whole of the town for their efforts throughout this year in their bicentenary with their links to Norfolk Island. Salvation Army: Braver, Stronger, Wiser Program",167
159,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Salvation Army's Braver, Stronger, Wiser program that was launched throughout Australia on Thursday of last week to help deal with depression in rural Australia. Figures show depression now affects one million adults in Australia each year and costs in excess of $600 million annually. The Salvation Army project will see 500,000 DVDs about how to manage and tackle depression being distributed free of charge across Australia and the project is directly targeting depression in rural Australia. The Salvation Army's Lieutenant Colonel James Condon said: It's deeply alarming to see what is happening in the bush right now. Depression is a very real issue in regional Australia. We are targeting depression head on with this project because it is vital rural Australia gets a hand with this issue. Some communities are feeling abandoned and isolated. We have to create a situation where people start to realise depression can be a ‘normal experience' and that if it's happening to you, you are not crazy … you can lead a fulfilling existence. Lieutenant Colonel Raymond Finger added: We want to put tools in the hands of rural Australians so if someone feels suicidal they can save someone else's life - or their own. Many rural Australians suffer from isolation because they lack services and GP's can be very thin on the ground. Psychological professionals in some areas may be almost non-existent. This Braver, Stronger, Wiser project is a Salvation Army initiato celebrate the spirit of the bush and all that makes regional Australia so remarkable. It has the full support of beyondblue: the national depression initiative and their key clinical advisor Professor Michael Baigent is a major part of this project. Depression in rural Australia is a very real and ever increasing problem. It is becoming by far one of the biggest health problems affecting many rural families, not only in my electorate of Hume but right across the country. Depression can be directly attributed to the effects of one of the worse droughts that Australia has seen. My wife, Gloria, has witnessed first hand that the toll that depression can take on rural families. As many of you in this place may be aware, for a number of years now Gloria and a band of very devoted and generous people have been involved in preparing and distributing packages of donated nonperishable foods, toys for children and other essential items that, more than often, these hard working families have gone without as a result of the drought. Both Gloria and I have also been in attendance at a number of drought related gatherings throughout the electorate. These are meetings such as Look after our Mates in Crookwell that saw in excess of 600 people come together to share one another's company and experiences that the effects of the drought have heaped on them. Similarly, a recent Drought Breaker, Family Maker event, again in Crookwell at the showground, saw over 1,000 drought affected people in attendance, again, to gain strength from each other in coping with the ongoing and relentless drought that has gripped rural Australia. At this event, totally unexpectedly, the community made a presentation to both Gloria and me for our support and assistance to drought affected rural families over the years. Having said that, I find it troubling and hypocritical that a New South Wales state parliamentary National Party MLC, who recently criticised me in the Legislative Council and who now resides in metropolitan Sydney, and a National Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, who recently moved out of her electorate, have shown their apathy and indifference by not being present at any of these functions or meetings that have been organised to assist rural families cope with the effects of the worse drought in a hundred years, even though these politicians purport to represent and understand the needs of these struggling rural families. In conclusion, may I again congratulate not only the Salvation Army for the introduction of this very welcome initiative but also those other major organisations that are working in conjunction with the Salvation Army, including beyondblue, the Rural Doctors Association, licensed rural postal agencies, rural Landcare offices, rural ABC radio stations and rural Westpac branches for the work that they are doing in assisting with the implementation of the Braver, Stronger, Wiser project. Last but not least I congratulate those wonderful individuals who have stood up, talked about their own experiences and helped others in need. 60th Anniversary of the Signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights",168
160,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Banks) (10.50 pm)Next month on 10 December we will recognise the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This document was born from the horrors of the Second World War with the intention of ensuring that such events could not be repeated. This remarkable document, while not legally binding, encapsulated for the first time exactly what those human rights are. At the same time it was described by the General Assembly of the United Nations as ‘a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations'. Forty-eight states voted in favour of the declaration, none against, with eight abstentions. In a statement following the voting the President of the General Assembly pointed out that adoption of the declaration was a remarkable achievement, a step forward in the great evolutionary process. It was the first occasion on which the organised community of nations had made a declaration of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The declaration consists of a preamble and 30 articles setting forth the human rights and fundamental freedoms to which all men and women everywhere in the world are entitled without any discrimination. Article 1, which lays down the philosophy on which the declaration is based, reads: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. The 30 articles cover six different categories: political rights, such as the right to vote and to participate in government; civil rights, such as the right to freedom of opinion and expression; equality rights, such as the right to be free from discrimination; economic rights, such as the right to fair wages and safe working conditions; social rights, such as the right to education and to adequate health care; and cultural rights, such as the right to speak your native language. Since 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been the fundamental source of motivation for international efforts to promote and protect human rights and the associated fundamental freedoms. It has set the direction for all subsequent efforts in the field of human rights; it has provided the basic philosophy for many legally binding international instruments designed to protect the rights and freedoms which it proclaims; and it has become the universal definition of human dignity and values. After 1949, the declaration formed the foundation for the binding statements of rights: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Australia ratified the ICCPR in 1980 subject to certain reservations. Article 2(2) requires Australia to take all necessary legislative and other measures to give effect to the rights in the convention. Australia has also ratified the first optional protocol to the ICCPR. This means the United Nations Human Rights Committee can hear complaints from individuals who allege that the Australian government has violated their rights under the ICCPR. However, the findings of the Human Rights Committee are not enforceable. In Australia we have seen achievements in our own human rights since 1948 through the abolition of the death penalty, military conscription, corporal punishment of children and the White Australia policy. On the other hand, it is important to remind ourselves of those whose rights are still being violated. In acknowledging the upcoming anniversary of the declaration, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a video presentation to launch the anniversary on 10 December 2007 that the declaration remained as relevant today as it was on the day it was adopted. But the fundamental freedoms enshrined in it were still not a reality for everyone. On 19 November this year, a documentary was shown on SBS called A Well-Founded Fear, produced by the Edmund Rice Centre. Over the past six years the Edmund Rice Centre has conducted a systematic study into Australia's treatment of rejected asylum seekers. Staff from the Edmund Rice Centre conducted interviews in 22 countries with over 250 people who were rejected as asylum seekers from Australia. The documentary outlines the reports of death, disappearance, imprisonment and torture of those whose lives have been spent in hiding, privation and despair. These are the people Australia removed after disallowing their claims for protection on refugee or humanitarian grounds. The documentary is based on the study by the Edmund Rice Centre, Deported to Danger. It is imperative that on this anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, those rights do not remain on paper. The declaration lays down universal rights that all of the world's people should be able to achieve. (Time expired) Dandenong Ranges",169
161,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) (10.55 pm)Tonight I wish to tell a story about sadness, about hope, about victory and about despair. The sadness relates to the Dandenong Ranges, and one of my favourite subjects, as the Speaker would know, is the invasion of weeds. I will go back to my days at Ferny Creek Primary School when a good Samaritan went through all the schools in the areafrom Ferny Creek to Olinda to Mount Dandenong to Sassafras. The sad thing is that, with the best of intentions, the good Samaritan gave all the children, including me, a fantastic creeping plant to take home. That plant was called wandering trad and it was planted out through the entire hills. The ness comes about because it has actually spread through all the creeks, and it has been one of those weeds that have clogged up the creeks and stopped the platypuses-for example, in Clematis Creek-from moving around. The other sad thing about the Dandenong Ranges is that, with the best of intentions, another plant called ivy was introduced. Ivy climbs up the mountain ash and strangles it, and it climbs all over the fern trees and causes great damage and destruction throughout the Dandenong Ranges. One of the aspects we are greatly concerned about is that of climate change and how trees like the mountain ash and the fern trees will survive when basically being strangled to death by ivy. There are also other local weeds that cause great damage, such as onion weed, which is throughout the hills, especially side the roads. Last year the former environment minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visited the electorate and met with all the local environmental groups and listened intensively to what was being said. The local environmentalist gave a first hand account of the destruction that weeds are causing in the Dandenong Ranges. The minister got to hear first hand how local groups, such as the Friends of Clematis Creek of which I am a member, the Sherbrooke Weed Society-all these different groups-are doing an amazing job. There are groups like the Friends of Olinda Creek, the Friends of Sassafras Creek-the friends of various groups throughout the hills-and they have been doing an amazing job over a long period of time. I have always said that the problem with the weeds I am mentioning is that they are regarded as environmental weeds; therefore, federal funding was not being received for their abolition because they were not regarded as agricultural weeds. sadFor example, the state Labor government in Victoria had not listed a number of these weeds as environmental weeds, so the situation was not addressed. We had this fantastic announcement by the former environment minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for a $450,000 biological control for wandering trad. This was a great victory, and it gave great hope to all those volunteers that, finally, there may be a biological control determined over a number of years under the guidance of the CSIRO and Melbourne university, who were going to do the research. After three years of hard work and lobbying the minister-and again I congratulate former Minister Turnbull-we had funding to tackle this weed. Sadly, when Peter Garrett became Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts he removed that funding and caused great harm and tragedy be- to the local environment. We had one more victory. During the election campaign I announced a $3 million grant to the Shire of Yarra Ranges to tackle all the weeds throughout the Dandenong Ranges. Sadly, again, Minister Garrett-who was still in the shadow position at that time-came to the electorate and refused to match that funding. To this very day we want to see the Rudd government match our commitment to weed funding. (Time expired)",171

The government is if we are going to be in a position to offer that I have talked about. People may have lived and may desire to stay there in their later years. I also want to raise the point that others, bution, have raised in relation to the assessment ments to aged-care providers retrospective. I assessment of whether a person needs low-level resident in low care and then is required to provide sessment that they need high care is then backed for the provider to be given retrospectively the ests of financial viability and the quality of dress this issue going forward.

This is obviously a huge issue for relatively low socio-economic status. The survey cost for new facilities was $176,000 per bed, estimated cost of less than $85,000 My comments are not intended to blame or attack of highlighting the fact that we are facing services in our nation. For my part, I have written constituents. The issue of the conditional concern for providers in my electorate.

That does not reflect on the standard of staff is still outstanding. But there is an expecthe future to meet the demands and the needs of will also be an issue. It is hard to see away about returns of 1.1 per cent per year. I would like to make in this regard in relation to regional or remote subsidies in the future. I fear may be financially unviable in the future.
