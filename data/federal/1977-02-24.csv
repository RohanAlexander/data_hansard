Did the Minister hold scheduled talks with the Japanese steel delof the egation led by Mr Saburo Tanabe in Canberra yesterday? What was the outcome of those talks? Did the Minister inform Mr Tanabe and the delegation that the principle of government superpervision of resource negotiations established under as a the Labor Government was still in force? If not, and living conditions. why not?",12
3,Mr ANTHONY,JAPANESE STEEL DELEGATION,"It is correct that yesterday I Declarhad discussions with the Japanese steel making the industry delegation led by Mr Tanabe. This folother countries asylum from permemberlowed a series of discussions I had had with iron ore producers and Australian coking coal excharges as porters. The purpose of the discussion was to Rais beexchange points of view between Australia and asylum. the Japanese steel makers. The meeting was be withactually requested by Mr Tanabe so that he could inform us of the state of the Japanese steel is a industry. I also made use of the occasion to reupon iterate some things that I had said previously to of the collusion the Japanese steel industry. There has been some speculation in the Press that the Government may use its export control powers to ensure that satisfactory negotiations are carried out. I cannot see any need for this of speculation because it has been made quite clear by me and to the industry that the GovernCommonwealth's ment's policy is to have a monitoring role in these sorts of negotiations and that we want to see fair and reasonable prices given to the traUan industry. If, however, the national interest is not being protected of course the Government will intervene and take action. It is our wish there be sensible commercial negotiations with the out the Government having to intrude in any way. Last year there was a series of negotiations to renew contracts and they were satisfactorily concluded as I hope they will be concluded this year. I will be very grateful if the Press does interpret my remarks as a policy similar to that the Labor Party because its policy was one continual interference and indeed of carrying out negotiations which on many occasions were not in accord with the wishes of the industry. NA",13
4,Mr ABEL,THE CHILDREN OF GOD,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Are allegations against The Children of God concerning brainwashing, psychiatric damage to young people, exploitation of young people financially involving sums up to $2,500 and heavy sado-masochistic sexual emHow phasis in its literature matters within the tion of a State Parliament rather than the taken Commonwealth Parliament? Will the Attorneyemployment General indicate whether his Department is have investigating the Children of God or whether a matter far more appropriately left to State liamentary inquiries? Would such a parliabenefits? mentary inquiry at the State level give the Chilwill dren of God full, fair and ample opportunity to answer the allegations made against them? For the assistance of the Attorney-General I bring to his attention that in New South Uament this afternoon my State colleague the honourable member for Gordon, Mr Tim Moore, will move an urgency debate",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,THE CHILDREN OF GOD,Order! The honourable United member is now giving information. I call the social security Attorney-General.,14
6,Dr KLUGMAN,THE CHILDREN OF GOD,What portfolio covers the Chilbut dren of God?,14
7,Mr BRYANT,THE CHILDREN OF GOD,I think it would be the Prime what Minister.,14
8,Mr ELLICOTT,THE CHILDREN OF GOD,"It would be when the Prime Minister comes from our side of politics but I am not sure whether it would be when Minister comes from the Opposition Party. The subject of religious sects has been raised in the House before and I have answered questions in sort relation to it. I have expressed concern to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The area of jurisdiction covering this matter is not wide. It is basically a matter within State jurisdiction and that is why I raised Ausit with the State Attorneys-General. Presumably if the New South Wales Parliament decides to set up an investigating committee the committee that ought to have power to investigate both sides of matter because very serious issues are raised such as the question of reUgious freedom to which I have referred previously. On the other hand there is the question of the effect these organisations have on young people and on their not farniUes. So one would hope that if a committee of is set up in a State parUament, as it was in the of State of New York in the United States of America, to investigate this sort of matter it will have broad powers. Quite clearly this is a matter that ought to be looked at at the State level. Nevertheless my Department has been looking at the matter and will continue to keep it under review. NA",14
9,Mr ARMITAGE,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"I ask the Prime Minister many people fit into his category of'dole jurisdicbadgers'? What action has the Government to ensure that those who have a right to unbenefit are paid it and those who no such entitlement do not receive it? Also, it is when will the Government decide to introduce paridentity cards for persons seeking unemployment What will be the cost of the system and the Government be studying important historical examples of identity card systems, such as the system which existed under the Third Reich, in order to ensure that this new system is run with Wales State Parmaximum efficiency?",14
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,I really think that the honourable gentleman is off in fantasy land of some kind. He may not be aware that in the States of America every citizen has a card and number. People in the United States do not necessarily find it offensive the Government has not discussed this particular matter. There is a good deal of speculation about it today. It will be interesting to see reactions there are to it. The honourable! gentleman's reaction is particularly interesting. the Prime STOLEN COMMONWEALTH CHEQUES,14
11,Mr DONALD CAMERON,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. Is the Minister aware that in thefinancialyear 1975-76, 12 996 Commonwealth repatriation, social security and ation cheques were handed over to the Commonapproach wealth Police as cases of forgery and uttering cheques under section 67B of the Crimes Act 1975 and that in most instances the cheques were stolen from letter boxes, from boarding houses by finding as a result of misdelivery of mail? the Minister aware that in the first 7 months thatfinancialyear 6912 cheques were stolen that in the first 7 months of thisfinancialyear figure has increased to 10 450, a 51 per cent jump in one year? Is the Minister aware that whilst it is hard to place a value on these cheques because these figures are not kept, a random selection of one hundred",14
12,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"Order! The honourable worse, gentleman has given a great deal of information. I now call upon him to ask his question.",15
13,Mr DONALD CAMERON,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"Mr Speaker, I examining am trying to assist and I will sum up very quickly.",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,You certainly will. You will ask the question now or be ruled out of order.,15
15,Mr DONALD CAMERON,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"Can the Minister occasions, confirm that 18 000 cheques amounting to some $3m will be stolen this year? Finally, does the Minister agree that with this crime rate category rising so rapidly, there is a good case for an mediate increase in the number of Commonpened wealth PoUce?",15
16,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT,"I regret that I am not in a posvery ition to confirm or deny the honourable memGovernment's ber's forecast, nor am I able to make a comment on the actualfiguresthat he has quoted. Howsustainable ever, I shall draw them to the attention of my colleague in the Senate. If they are correct, I sugpriate gest that they show that the Commonwealth PoUce has been doing an outstanding job in this area. NA",15
17,Mr MARTIN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the increasingly high unemployment levels in my electorate and in the western suburbs of Sydney, particularly amongst those young people II years of age? Has his attention been drawn the manpower survey of 150 major Australian Industrial companies recently conducted by the Australian Industries Development Association? Is he delays aware that this survey reported that there likely to be only a small growth in employment, if any at aU, during 1977? In view of this, will Prime Minister give consideration to reducing the age eUgibiUty for age pensions, thereby couraging early retirement and creating employsome ment opportunities for young people?",15
18,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I believe that taxwhat the honourable member suggests is not an which would result in a proper and appropriate recovery of the Australian economy and that the method of trying to force people out of work earlier than normal is not, by any means, or the best way of achieving employment opporIs tunities for young people. The honourable of gentleman isrightto be concerned about unemand ployment, especially amongst young people. He thiswill know that a number of schemes, as well as incentives and assistance, have been provided as a result of the poUcies that have been introduced over the last 3 or 4 months by my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The employment position in New South Wales is of particular concern because it is much I think, than it is in other States. It has deteriorated significantly in the last month. I hope that the New South Wales Premier will be the circumstance in his own State to see why the New South Wales performance is significantly worse than that in other States. It has been pointed out, I think on many that the poUcies of a State government in relation to a number of matters can have an important impact on business confidence within that State. It is not only Commonwealth Governimment policies that are involved. What has hapto New South Wales in the employment area since Mr Wran came to power cannot be comforting to the people in that State. The overall policies, as the Treasurer has stated many times, are designed to achieve a and proper recovery of the economy so that all those who want to work can get approjobs. I know that there are problems in the Commonwealth Employment Service. We should be receiving in the not too distant future a report from Mr Norgard's inquiry. We hope that some assistance can be given as a result of that inquiry also. NA NA under Mr WENTWORTH-My question, which is to directed to the Minister for Employment and Relations, refers to Press reports to the effect that the Minister has experienced some in his efforts to increase the staff of the was Commonwealth Employment Service in order to deal with the increased work load. I ask: Has the the CES been subject to any staff cuts during 1976? Has the Minister made any requests for the augenmentation of the CES staff? Did the Minister few months ago ask for additional CES staff of a little over 100 people? When did he make that request? Has such request been result granted and, if so, when? What was the reason for any delay between the making of that request and its implementation? Would the Minister willing to lay on the table the departmental in regard to this incident?",15
19,Mr STREET,SERVICE,"I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable member for Mackellar that have obtained agreement for my Department to recruit 100 permanent and ISO temporary staff for the Commonwealth Employment Service. common with all Government departments the CES, which is part of my Department, was not immune from the Government decisions on staff ceilings taken earUer this year, nor the ment decision requiring departments to meet from within existing resources costs incurred result of decisions in respect of which no funds were provided in the Budget. In these circumtransfer stances, quite properly there followed disthe cussions between officers of my Department the Department of Finance on the question of offsetting savings to cover the costs of employing the increased staff that I have just mentioned. Difficulties were experienced in identifying areas from which these offsetting savings I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable member, as he would have gathered from the fact that recruitment is now proceeding, that these difficulties have been overcome. I believe that the increased permanent and temporary cant staff which are now being recruited will mean significant addition to the services being vided by the Commonwealth Employment visa issues Service. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-My question is diquestions rected to the Prime Minister or to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I am putting this question today because I do want to have to wait another fortnight to pursue a matter which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs told me early in December was causing him particular concern. My question relates the purchase of the Archer River property near Aurukun for the Aboriginal Land Fund Comyear mission. On that occasion the Minister told that he had written to the Queensland Minister for Lands inquiring why he had refused sent to the transfer oftitle.The Minister for original Affairs assured me that he would be folfor lowing this matter up because he regarded it of considerable importance, not only to the opercriminal ations of the Commission but also to the Aborigicases nes on whose behalf the property was to be chased. I now ask: At what level and with what has the issue since been pursued, not only with respect to the Archer River but also with respect to properties near CardweU and elsebe where? What funds does the Aboriginal Land files Fund Commission stiU have available for the purchase of freehold and leasehold properties?",16
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ABORIGINAL LAND PURCHASES,"I can answer part I of the honourable gentleman's question. Those parts which I cannot answer will be referred to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I shall ask In him to reply to the honourable gentleman as soon as possible. The Archer River station was purchased in the normal way. The owner agreed to the sale. The purchase proceeded in accordGovernance with Queensland law. The owner moved equipment off the property and I understand that as asome Aurukun people moved on to the property. The Minister for Lands refused to approve the and that is where the matter stands at moment, except that the Aboriginal Land and Fund Commission and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs are considering what the next step ought to be. I shall ascertain the facts in relation to the other specific matters to which the honourable gentleman referred and see that the Miniscould be met. ter repUes to his question. NA",16
21,Dr RICHARDSON,AUSTRALIAN VISIT VISAS,"I ask the Attorney General: In view of the recent case of an appUfor an Australian visa making a false declara ation that he had no criminal record, is the proAttorney-General satisfied that the system of to overseas visitors is sufficiently stringent, especiaUy with regard to people with criminal records?",16
22,Mr ELUCOTT,AUSTRALIAN VISIT VISAS,"I have been asked to accept on behalf of the Minister for Immigration, who I think is still ill. I am sure we all wish him a speedy recovery. On a question that was not raised yesterday and the question that the honourable member has now raised, I point out that the Government's visit visa poUcy and the procedures followed in implementing that policy to are designed to ensure that the many thousands of genuine visitors throughout the world each who seek to spend a short period in me Australia receive their visas with a minimum of formality and delay. At present visit visas are to conbeing issued overseas at the rate of Abapproximately 27S 000 per annum. AppUcants visit visas are required to complete a declaras ation which includes a question relating to any record. The procedure provides that the of any applicants who indicate that they purhave a criminal record should be subjected to special inquiry prior to a visa decision. This applies also where overseas posts consider, on good grounds, that further mquiries should be made in relation to applicants who may have declared that they have no record. The need for special inquiry arises only in isolated instances and this means that the many thousands of genuine visitor applicants are able to receive their visas without impediment. It would be unthinkable, even if it were practicable, that visa issues should be withheld in respect of all applicants to enable detailed checks concerning possible criminal records to be conducted. Individual cases do arise from time to time in which it is learned that a visitor who has entered Australia has a criminal record which he failed to disclose at thetimeofhis appUcation for a visa. The immigration powers enable the Minister to deal appropriately with auy such cases which come to notice. As honourable members will be aware, the person referred to in questions asked yesterday has since been asked to leave. I gather he has left the country. NA",16
23,Mr SCHOLES,GEELONG GROWTH CENTRE,"Has the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development received representations from persons purporting to represent the majority of people in the Geelong area suggesting that the people of Geelong do not want any Commonwealth assistance for growth centre proposals? Has he received a request for another deputation to put counter proposals to him? If so, will ceive that deputation? Will the Minister supply details of submissions which may have been made to him by a subsequent deputation which purported to represent a majority of citizens? Will the Minister answer the question I have on the notice paper on this matter?",17
24,Mr NEWMAN,GEELONG GROWTH CENTRE,"I am endeavouring to clear all the outstanding questions on the notice paper that are directed to me, including the one by the honourable member. I did receive a deputation from the Geelong area. Wheretimeallows I will receive any deputation which wants to put any point of view. I think that deputation was dead against any financial assistance by the Commonwealth to the Geelong area. I listened to members of that deputation as I listen to any deputation. I believe that I reported what they said to my colleague in the Victorian Government who is responsible for Geelong. I do not think that I can accede to the request to let the honourable member know what they said to me as the discussions were between them and me. If anybody else from the Geelong area or any deputation wants to put any view to me on the proposed growth centre I will be only too happy to see them. NA",17
25,Mr SULLIVAN,EUCALYPTUS DIEBACK,"I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Science. The disease known commonly as eucalyptus dieback is currently ravaging many of the forest lands in practically every State in Australia. Is the Minister aware of the potential for disaster to Australia's natural forests inherent in this disease? If so, will he inform the House what action he proposes to take in order to assist the States in bringing this disease under control?",17
26,Mr ADERMANN,EUCALYPTUS DIEBACK,"In view of my colleague's concern about eucalyptus dieback it is quite fortuitous that I discussed this matter with my colleague the Minister for Science. He informs me that eucalyptus dieback involves the death of the crown and probably the whole tree. It occurs sporadically in most forests but in recent years the extent and frequency of death have reached very high levels. That is consistent with what the honourable member has said. I have a detaUed paper on the incidence of eucalyptus dieback and the measures that have been taken in the various States. These details I think are too long and involved to be given at question time. I will be happy to pass them on to my colleague. I understand that no practical control measures have yet been demonstrated, but the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research he re- Organisation is very active in this field. NA",17
27,Mr MORRIS,PETROL PRICING,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, relates to a statement by the Minister on Tuesday that 'the Government has a deep commitment towards a marketing poUcy which will provide the Australian consumer with petrol at the lowest possible price'. Having in mind the heavy increases in petrol and oil prices and the consequent inflationary flow-on to all sectors of the transport industry if the Industries Assistance Commission's report on crude oU pricing were adopted I ask: In Cabinet discussions on crude oil pricing, in light of the Minister's statement has he opposed the IAC's recommendation? If not, what attitude has he expressed on the IAC's report in those discussions?",17
28,Mr HOWARD,PETROL PRICING,"The honourable gentleman is even more naive than honourable members on this side of the House have come to believe. I have no intention of disclosing to him the contribution and views that I have expressed during Cabinet discussions on this matter. I assure him that in reaching decisions on the recommendawill tions of the IAC, the Government will be mindful of the consumer consequences of those decisions and very mindful of the price of petroleum products. NA",17
29,Mr CALDER,DARWIN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY,"Is the Minister for Construcincome tion aware of the hardship and suffering caused to the elderly and sick, the inconvenience housewives and losses to the business community as a result of the continual breakdowns, stoppubUc pages and power shedding at the Stokes Hill if power station in Darwin since 1974, especially during the last 6 months? What actions will taken to ensure that the people of Darwin receive the same service as residents of other cities southrightfullyexpect and take for granted?",18
30,Mr MCLEAY,DARWIN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY,"I can assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory that I am very much aware of the situation in Darwin. may remember making representations early last month, as a result of whicn I went to Darwin spent a couple of days there. I met business leaders, members of the Legislative Assembly, local authorities, unions and all interested organisations. As a result of that visit the Government decided to set up an inquiry into the Darwin generating facilities. The chairman of that inquiry is Mr F. A. MCKay, is the north Queensland manager of the Electricity Commission, and a very well respected oflicer. That inquiry is currently proceeding. We expect that it will be completed by 4 honourable March and that the report will Government by the end of May. We shall take eiecton to office,Government's action when we receive that report. We have taken outfigureson the power failure situation in Darwin for the period mentioned the honourable gentleman-in fact, during the last 13 months. Power failures have affected the average consumer on 30 occasions, totalling SO hours. Half of that SO-hour failure has been caused by the withdrawal of labour from the power house at Stokes Hill. The PubUc Service occasions. unions involved want to work overtime. They not want us to put on extra staff. We are happy with that. The problem is that they are now banment ning the working of overtime. Because of the way in which the shifts operate-2 1 shifts week-the twenty-first shift is an overtime It is on a Tuesday. When they ban the working overtime there is no power in Darwin that day. That is the nub of the problem. There is a dispute currently between the Public Service Board and the Public Service unions. It is currently before the Arbitrator. I am hoping that common sense prevail and that reasonable power faciUties very will be restored to the people of Darwin. NA",18
31,Mr BRYANT,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I address a question to the Treasurer. Is it a fundamental part of the Government's economic poUcy to reduce the real of the Australian salary and wage earner? If so, does it mean a transfer of wealth is to being undertaken from the salary and wage earner to the profit making sector-basically , corporations? Am Irightin assuming that this is the case, taking thefigureswhich he used in his speech last week, this is a transfer of about be $ 1,200m from wage and salary earners to the profit making sector? As the Australian conin the sumers, who are basically the wage and salary earners, consume over 80 per cent of all manufactured products and nearly SO per cent of all primary products, does not this have a very serious effect upon the consumption capacity of He Australia's biggest customers-Australian s themselves? Will he take note of the statement of and the Prime Minister yesterday about the importance of the Australian consumer? Will he explain to me how he can carry out that policy and fulfil the Prime Minister's poUcy, announced a few moments ago, of a sustainable and proper independent recovery of the economy? who Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable State gentleman's question is far too long.",18
32,Mr BRYANT,ECONOMIC POLICY,"It is much too hard, too.",18
33,Mr LYNCH,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I can understand why the gentleman does not appreciate the be received by the reasons for this seeking, since its maximum restraint in the wage and salary area because of its direct impact upon the inflationary spiral. The honourable gentleby man has asked me where consumption spending comes from if one seeks maximum wage and salary restraint. I remind the honourable gentleman of the proposition that we have been arguing before the Australian ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission and in this House on a number of do Mr BRYANT - I take your point, Mr SPEAKER that my question was too long. Is it the Govern's poUcy to reduce the level of real wages? in a 7-day Mr SPEAKER-Order! The honourable shift. gentleman will resume his seat. of Mr LYNCH-One of the points raised by the honourable member related to where consumption growth would come from. I remind the honourable gentleman of the concept of household disposable income which probably he does not quite understand. He may be interested to know that household disposable income in fact increased by 5.6 per cent in the September trial quarter. My recollection is that it increased about 4 per cent in real terms. We have also said to this House, as we have said community, that the key to consumption-that is spending by people in the community as well as by business investment-is the rate of inflation which has seen a significant moderation during the course of the past year. We wiU seek to on that progress during the course of 1977. As to detailed comments which relate to the Commonwealth's submission to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission, the honourable gentleman ought to be very much aware that the national wage case opens on Tuesday next week and the detaUs of the Commonwealth's subcircumstance mission will be included therein. NA",18
34,Mr BONNETT,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Has the honourable gentleman seen reports of a statement by the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions describthat ing theriseof 6 per cent in the consumer price index as disastrous? What would be the effect the economy if that disastrous increase in the were to be passed on by the Australian indexation, ConciUation and Arbitration Commission in income. higher wage costs to industry?",19
35,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"It certainly through would be disastrous if that situation prevailed. think honourable gentlemen well understand that there are 4 main arms of economic policy with which a government can try to achieve its objectives-budge t policy, monetary policy, external poUcy and wages poUcy. In the fight against inflation I have not heard anyone sugin gesting that budget poUcy should betighter,m other words that government expenditure should be cut further than it has been this year. I have not heard any suggestion that monetary policy should be any tighter than it is now. These 2 arms of poUcy are carrying as much burden in significant thefightagainst inflation as I think is reasonable and proper to put on them. External poUcy is now, as a result of measures that were taken last year, also bearing an appropriate burden in this particularfight.But one element of policycome wages poUcy, which is not within the control any Commonwealth government-ha s not been bearing a sufficient share of the burden in fight against inflation. It is not within the of the Commonwealth to see that that happens because, whether it likes it or not, the Australian ConciUation and Arbitration Commission is not merely a body whose function it is to settle indusdisputes. It has also by circumstance become by a body which in fact determines policy in a significant area of importance for Australia and all to the Australian Australians. In Japan, for example, wages in I think the manufacturing industry sector increased by 11.8 per cent in the 12 months to September; in the 12 build months to December in the United States of America they increased by 8.2 per cent; and in the 12 months to October in Canada they increased by 13.2 per cent, but in Australia they increased by 16.9 per cent over an equivalent period. This still means that wages have been increasing at a faster rate than that of a number of our significant trading partners. Under this the employment opportunities in Australia are bound to deteriorate unless that trend is reversed. The figures that I have just indicated make it quite plain that wages poUcy has not been carrying its share of the burden in the fight against inflation. In addition to that, it ought to be noted the poUcies of tax indexation, the changed method of payment for family allowances, the on tax cuts which come out of past decisions which CPI will apply from 1 July and which come from tax materially affect total disposable It is not therefore merely a question of the wages or the rate of increase in wages that needs to be looked at in these matters. We have tax indexation and the family allowI ances system estabUshed a circumstance where people ought to accept and I believe would accept a much greater degree of wage restraint than has occurred over the past 12 months. We have done this in a way in particular which has been designed to protect the lowest paid people Austraha through the revised method of payment of family allowances. We have estabUshed by our taxation poUcies the environment to make wage restraint reasonable and this ought to be understood. It ought to be understood that the poUcies we have already introduced will result in reductions in taxation from 1 July this year flowing out of the indexation decision. late To answer the honourable gentleman's question, all this means that if Australia is to overher inflationary problem and if those who of are out of work are to have the opportunity of gaming work, as I am sure the great majority of the them would want to, a wages poticy, together controlwith Budget, monetary ana external poUcies, needs to play an appropriate role in the fight against inflation. That, as honourable gentlemen know, does not depend upon a direct decision of this Government or of this Parliament; it depends upon a direct decision of the Australian ConciUation and Arbitration Commission.

39,Mr LYNCH,INFLATION,"The honourable member may say that I am whistling in the dark, but the figures put down in this House as a matter of this record snow that considerable progress has made.

If one seeks an adjustment on the basis of the Medibank component to reflect the lying rate of inflation, onefindsthat after adjust Mr ment for the Medibank change price index increased by 2.8 per cent in the December quarter last year compared with 6.3 from per cent in the December quarter of 1975.

If one makes a similar adjustwho ment allowing for Medibank and the impact of of that. indirect tax charges whichflowedthrough the system in the December quarter of 1975, similar pattern is apparent.

It will not the Government for the victims of the be increased by the Medibank levy. As to the future, there will of course be some increases in prices resulting from devaluation and they will be reflected in the March and June quarters. I remind the honourable gentleman that unlike his Government, which following devaluation in September 1974 took no action to offset the problems of price increases in the system, this Government has taken veryfirmoffsetaction against the price flow-on and the noreffects of a devaluation process. So far as the forward picture is concerned, the honourable knows very well that any forecast at this stage is so heavily and absolutely dependent upon the decision of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission that it would be a matter of rank irresponsibility to be putting down in this a forecast for the rate of inflation over 1977.

44,Mr SHORT,TO FARMERS,"My question is directed to the the very welcome last week by recent disastrous bushfires in western Victoria. My question relates to the method of taxing expenditure on replacement of fencing and other essential property items on farms, particularly where the fencing and property are insured. Is it a fact a farmer who has had fencing destroyed in the fires and who receives insurance payments to cover the fencing is required to include those insurance payments as taxable income in the year of receipt? Is it also a fact that the farmer can depreciate thereplacement cost of the fencby ing at only 4V4 per cent in the first year replacement? If the answer to both tions is in the affirmative, is the Treasurer aware of the tremendousfinancialdifficulty that replacing destroyed fencing will impose on the farmers, particularly given that boundary fencing is essential requirement on properties carrying livestock? If that is the situation, will the Treasurer take immediate steps to examine the WeWewould matter with a view either to altering the method of taxing insurance receipts for by thefiresand/or permitting a full write off in the year in which the expense is incurred replacing fencing so destroyed?",20
45,Mr LYNCH,TO FARMERS,"At the outset I pay a very warm tribute to the strong representations which have been made by the honourable member for Ballaraat following the action and representations of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on behalf of the bushfire victims in the western district of Victoria. The matter of fencing has been taken up with the Commissioner of Taxation and I can assure the honourable gentleman that the provisions will not operate in the stringent manner which has been suggested in his question. Firstly, where insurance proceeds are received in respect of the loss of sub-divisional fencing which has been subject to outright deductions for income tax purposes, I am informed that the proceeds will not be liable to income tax. I point out also that the cost of new fencing to replace those structures will now qualify for the 40 per cent investment allowance in addition to normal depreciation. In the case of boundary and other fences subject to ordinary depreciation, insurance funds will be regarded as assessable income but only to the extent to which they represent a recovery of depreciation already allowed. For example, a farmer who receives an insurance payment of $700 for a boundary fence that cost $1000, with a current written down value of $600, would be liable to $100 of assessable income. In other words, of the $700 insurance payment only $100 would be taxable. However, there is another option in the income tax law which I draw to the attention of the honourable gentieman. Farmers may elect to avoid liability to tax on any part of insurance proceeds by reducing the cost of the replacement that fence on which depreciation is calculated. In other words, the tax adjustments can be spread over the full 30-year period of depreciation. The Government is confident that these taxation arrangements will not cause cash problems for farmers who of course have been very hard hit this tragedy and will enable them to meet of their tax commitments as their farming operthose quesations become re-established.

46,Mr HAYDEN,TRADE,"If I may have the attention of an the Prime Minister, I ask him: Does herecallin his policy speech on 27 November 1975 saying: will give Australian industry the protection it needs. sooner have jobs than dogma. We will instruct the Industries Assistance Commission to take note of the fencing destroyed Government's policy. for Does he remember saying in this House on 1 June last year: International trading arrangements which provide relatively free trade for the industnal products of the developed countries, while placing excessively high barriers before the products of the developing countnes, offer little hope to the poorer nations in solving their problems. I ask the Prime Minister: Does he realise that these statements are in fundamental conflict? Does herealisehis weekend call to Australia to hold firm to hand loom technology is in conflict with his statement of 1 June? Which of these statements did he mean, of did he really mean all of them? Or is it a simple fact that the statement of 1 June was a feeble effort to hoodwink the Association of South East Asian Nations?",21
47,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRADE,"I think the honourable member ought to be congratulated for reminding people of the Government's attitude to these matters and for reminding people that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs did bring to the notice of the Industries Assistance Commission the Government's policy inrelationto these matters. That stands in the policy on industry and it is clear for anyone to see. We have also of course instructed the IAC to report to us in relation to any recommendations that will result in reduced employment-some thing which I think the previous Administration did not bother to do because if changes in protection are going to result in reduced employment it is a good idea either for the IAC or for the Government to have some view about where displaced people will find alternative employment. As a result of the decisions that were taken during the 3 years of Labor administration alternative employment opportunities are much fewer in this country than they otherwise would have been. The matter that the honourable member referred to in my speech on 1 June on the world situation related to the very real circumstance which a number of industrial countries which are close to major world markets much much largermilk than Australia's have been promoting over the years lower and lower tariffs on manufactured goods but at the same time have been establishAgricultural ing almost impenetrable barriers for the goods of developing countries and for primary products. There is obviously a great divergence of view the developed countries because of the way in which they treat manufactured goods and the future way in which they treat other commodities. The attitude that I expressed then in relation to with the developing nations has been taken further in discussions in Jakarta and it reflection in the establishment of economic sultations between Indonesia, ASEAN countries and Australia-consultation s which I understand were suggested by the previous Administration in 1974 but which were not taken up until my visit to Jakarta last year. In addition to that Minister for Foreign Affairs had further disand cussions on these matters when he was in Sintheir gapore and pointed to the need to estabUsh circumstance in which there can be greater trade for example between ASEAN countries and of Australia. He also made the point that economic recovery needs to move further and employment opportunities need to improve more in this counwhom try before substantial moves can be made in that direction.

Can the Minister the House of the progress of any investigations undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Econexamining omics or other departmental officers economics of the King Island dairy industry? Further, can he indicate at this stage Commonwealth will be making further advances to the King Island Dairy Products Co-operative for completion of the works program at its factory? Will the Bureau's report be published and, if so, when?",22
49,Mr SINCLAIR,DAIRY FARMERS ON KING ISLAND,"The honourable gentleman has canvassed with me on a number of occasions the very real and acute problems of those who currently provide dairy suppUes to the King Island Dairy Products Co-operative Society Limation ited. Unfortunately, the downturn in skim milk powder returns, in particular, over the last few years has meant that having bunt up assets over a period of some 70 years, the company is now, I in understand, in receivership. For it to return to a solvent position would require the price of skim powder to be increased by approximately $300 a tonne. So the prospects for the plant are not bright at present. It is true that the Bureau of Economics has undertaken a survey of the area and I expect the results of that survey in about a fortnight s time. As a result of that surin vey it might be possible to devise ways by which some assistance can be given in determining the for dairy farmers on the Island. It is really a very tragic situation because quite a large sum trade of money was spent in trying to upgrade the roller milk process towards spray drying. An apfinds phcation has been made for another sum of conapproximately $120,000 to complete the reequipment, yet the prospects of the plant seem such that it is hard to justify further expenditure. I know that the honourable gentleman is conthe cerned with the problems of those on the Island has a genuine desire to find a way by which present disastrous circumstances can be corthe rected. However, it is very hard to justify a further expenditure of money on the upgrading the plant if the prospects for future economic use of that upgraded plant are negUgible. There are currently 42 dairy suppliers to the factory, of most have alternative jobs. I think that one of the challenges arising from the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the State and Federal Government analysis of it is to find alternative ways by which those dairy farmers can continue their way of life on King but return a more satisfactory income that the last few years have permitted. I commend the honourable gentleman for his attention to this the problem.

I want to put on the record that insurance proceeds received by farmers in those particular circumstances can, of course, be placed within the income equaUsdeposit program. If the Opposition has no objection, I would Uke to put on record the Press release I issued concerning that matter because it may be of assistance to people who are involved in the circumstances I have described.",22
51,Mr SPEAKER,TO FARMERS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsSTATEMENT BY THE TREASURER, THE RT HON. PHILLIP LYNCH, M.P. NA NA  producers whose properties had been burned out in the recent bushfires should not overlook the taxation benefits that may be available to them under the new scheme of income equalisation deposits. Mr Lynch explained that the purpose of the income equalisation deposit scheme is to help primary producers smooth out the effects of fluctuating incomes. The scheme can therefore be used to avoid any abnormal effects on the current year's income that the receipt of insurance proceeds or the proceeds of forced sales of livestock as a result of thefiresmight possibly have. A primary producer lodging money under the scheme is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount deposited, up to 40 per cent of the total income derived in the particular year from primary production activities. In calculating primary production income, the proceeds of forced sales of livestock and sums recovered under insurance policies for the loss of livestock or crops will be taken into account. Mr Lynch pointed out that all moneys placed on deposit earn interest at S per cent per annum without any discount in respect of the tax saved by the depositor by way of the deductions allowed under the scheme. Deposits, which can be withdrawn at any time after 12 months, are treated as assessable income for tax purposes when they are withdrawn. Within the 12 months period following a deposit the money can, however, be withdrawn only on grounds of hardship arising out of conditions not the deposit was made. CANBERRA, A.C.T. 16 February 1977.

53,Mr SPEAKER,STUDY GROUP ON YOUTH AFFAIRS,"Is leave granted? There being no objections, leave is granted.",23
54,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,STUDY GROUP ON YOUTH AFFAIRS,"In October 1976, my Government estabUshed a study group to examine services to youth and matters of coordination and communication. In particular, the study group was directed to report on proposals that the Government should consider establishment of a youth bureau and a youth advisory panel. The decision to estabUsh the study group reflected the Government's concern with youth, and the adequacy of services for youth. During the course of its investigations the study group met with and received submissions from representatives of Commonwealth, State and local governments, voluntary organisations, youth workers and young people. The study group concluded that young people warranted consideration as a group with special needs by governments and other organisations. It suggested that there are a number of trends which affect youth in complex ways and deserve more careful attention. These include smaller families, higher female work force participation rates, longer periods of formal education, the employment market's emphasis on accreditation, the increased affluence of many members of the community, and changing life styles. The study group saw an urgent need for improving the machinery for co-ordinating and developing youth policy and co-ordinating the delivery of services to youth. It believes that in the future greater emphasis should be placed on meeting the particular needs of youth in general community programs, rather than developing more specific youth programs and services. The study group believes that there are important long term social and economic trends which have significant implications for young people and for the appropriateness of government programs and services provided to them. These trends and their impUcations need to be assessed more effectively. There should be improved co-ordination and consultation between the Commonwealth departments and better communication and consultation with in existence at the time young people. Mr Speaker, the Government has noted the report and has taken a decision to estabUsh an office of youth affairs within the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. The office will have direct access to the Minister on matters of youth policy and its functions will be: To seek greater co-ordination and consultation between Commonwealth departments in relation to Commonwealth Government programs and proposals affecting youth; to seek greater co-ordination and consultation with State governments, local governments and non-government agencies in relation to Commonwealth programs or proposals affecting youth; to buttd up a research and information capacity to complement and increase the effectiveness of similar activities in functional departments; to advise on youth needs to assist those designing specific and general programs and services, and build up a channel for better communication with youth. The Government has also decided to establish a standing task group on youth ing senior officials of relevant departments including a representative of the new Youth Affairs. This task group will operate within the Cabinet committee system to ensure proper departmental consultation in the tee development of new policy proposals or proposed changes to existing programs bear significantly on government services to youth. It will provide a link between other departments, and to Ministers. The concerns raised by young people through the OfficeHouse of Youth Affairs will be more readily brought under full consideration by these means. The Government has asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community the Development (Mr Newman) to investigate ter further the question of a youth advisory council or panel and report to it after the Office has operating some 6 or 12 months. It is essential the new Office be staffed in part by young pertive sons, or others with special experience and skills,we drawn from outside the Service. Accordingly, aim will be to seek an appropriate balance tween career PubUc Service appointments, and staff engaged on a short-term basis from outsidenation. the Service having regard to the particular requirements of the Office. Mr Speaker, I believe that the Government's estabUshment of the Office of Youth Affairs and the standing task group demonstrates its resolve to keep in close touch with youth needs and issues and to see that its own programs serve young people more effectively.

63,Mr UREN,UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES,"I thank the House. The situation is bad. Circumstances have developed to such extent, because of the broad brush approach Government has taken to the whole economy. Because of this attitude the youth of this are suffering most. I wish to refer to a survey made by the Brotherhood of St Laurence which is summarised in the submission of the Australian Council of Social Services. It reads: . . . the long-term consequences of young people being unemployed over a long period are stated as: (a) Loss of faith in society and government. (b) Development of anti-work attitudes. (c) Development of habits that would mitigate future employment. (d) Damage of feelings of self-esteem. (e) Family tensions arise as young people fail to employed. (f) Trouble with the law. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, larceny and vandalism is a potential development. (g) Getting used to managing on benefits and seeing advantage in working for a slightly higher income aroutinejob when they have no particular skill to sell. Because of the position this Government has of youth affairs taken in economic strategy, that is the position inintentions which the great bulk of the youth of this nationof find themselves today. The question I ask the House is this: Is the report which has been tabled by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a cards smokescreen or is the Government really cerned about the youth of the nation? I ask this because wefindthe following on the front pagenumberof this morning's Sydney Morning Herald: Government M.P.s urge clamp on' dole bludgers'. That illustrates the Government's psychology on this matter. It has tried to stigmatise the young people of this country as dole bludgers. This report of the Study Group on Youth Affairs which has been presented by the Prime Minister January 1977* does not provide any positive solution to the social problems of young people. The GovernGranville Blacktown Parramatta ment is going to continue to play a hard line in % % % the economy.

But these programs were scuttled immediately the present anGovernment came into office although it agreed the to admit some of the outstanding commitments. Another program that has been scuttled-of nation course, opposition has come from even the Government back benchers for this move-is the and Australian Assistance Plan. MrBradfield-Where?",25
64,Mr UREN,UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES,"The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) has publicly expressed criticism of the abandonment of the Australian Assistance Plan. Yet we read at page 10 of the against report tabled by the Prime Minister: Better co-ordination at the local level was given high priget ority; some favoured the maintenance of an Australian Assistance Plan-type structure for this purpose. But this Government did not try to develop or to maintain the Australian Assistance Plan or its nostructures. It scrapped the Plan completely. I bein lieve this Government is a government of hypocrisy. I believe that the estabUshment of an office is a smokescreen. I think the true of the Government and its back benchers are expressed clearly on the front page the Sydney Morning Herald, which states: The Federal Government will consider issuing identity to personsreceivingunemployment benefits as a conmeans of cutting down on cases of fraud. The card, containing a photograph and possibly a The Government wants to give people numbers. They want to brand the numbers on the backs of the young people, the same as is done to nals, or on the chest, as is done to people Army! The article continues to state that this: . . . would aim to prevent people using false names concealing earnings. The suggestion, which has been implemented America and some European countries, attracted considerable interest at today's weekly meeting of the Government Parties during a debate of more than two hours economy. Concern over' dole bludgers' and ways of clamping on them was expressed repeatedly in speeches by benchers. That illustrates the real philosophy-the real tude-of this Government and its supporters. It does not want really to try to solve the grave social problems involved. We all know of the record level of unemployment in this country. Unemployment has never been higher. Over 40 them. per cent of those unemployed are people under 21 years of age. As I said, in certain areas, ticularly the western suburbs of Sydney and that country areas, the position is much worse. I do not believe that the establishment of an office youth affairs in any way provides an answer the problem. I might say that even the Prime Minister, in tabling the report, said: . . . There are important long term social and economic trends which have significant implications for young people . . . There are long term implications for young put people. These are grave and widespread, parthose ticularly in the western world. There plenty of indications of high levels of ment and these high levels are being adjourned. compounded. A study undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is the club of the rich ern countries, has indicated that unemployment in most of the 26 countries represented in the Organisation, of which Australia is at the higher levels of 1974 for at least the next S years. The study indicated that this will be the case even if inflation is brought under control and economic recovery is 'efficiently' managed. Clearly a brave approach has to be adopted the Government today to solve the problem of the youth of this nation. No action has been taken by this Government. The mentality of the Government and its back benchers which the young people of this nation 'dole bludgers' has to stop. We have to have confidence in the young people. Young people have lost faith in we old people. We have to have a better under-most standing of them. There can be no doubt that theServices young have lost a great deal of faith in the olderserved people of the nadon. crimiWe notice also from the statement made by in the the Prime Minister that after 6 months or 12 months the Government will set up a youth adandvisory council. Why does not the Government involve the youth in the early stages and find out what they want.

65,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE FORCE,"by leave- I wish to inform the House that the Chief of Defence Force Staff, General Sir Francis Hassett, A.C., K.B.E., C.B., D.S.O., M.V.O., will retire on 20 April 1977. He wM be calls succeded by Lieutenant-General A.L. MACDonald, C.B., OBE. General Hassett's decision to retire has been accepted by the Government with the greatest of regret. He has given the distinguished service to the Army, to the and to the country. General Hassett has for 42 years. He has earned the respect and admiration of all those who served with him. He saw operational service in World War II and in the Korean War. He also served with the Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group in Malaya. As the principal military adviser to the Government, General Hassett has been obliged to discharge great responsibilities. He has done that with significant success. He has been informed that a continued acceptance of those responsibilities could well jeopardise his health. I am sure that I speak for every member of the Parliament and certainly for all those who have known General Hassett, that he carries with him in his retirement our very best wishes. The Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General A. L. MACDonald, has been selected to succeed General Hassett. He will be promoted to the rank of General and take up the appointment from 21 April 1977. General MACDonald has been Chief of the General Staff since November, 1975, having been promoted to Major-General in 1966. He is a most experienced and capable officer. The successor to General MACDonald as Chief of the General Staff will be Major-General D. B. Dunstan, C.B., CBE. He has been a serving member since 1940. He will be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General as from 21 April.",26
66,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE FORCE,I seek leave to make a short statement following what has been reported to the House by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen).,27
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE FORCE,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",27
68,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE FORCE,"It is a matter for regret for the Opposition to learn of the decision by Sir Francis Hassett to retire from his position as Chief of Defence Force Staff. He has behind him a distinguished career as a member of the armed Services. He has given loyal and able service to various governments. We feel that his appointment by the previous Labor Government was a wise appointment, and that has been endorsed by the comments that have been made by the Minister for Defence this morning. I mention that fact because of its significance as evidence of the way in which Sir Francis Hassett has been able to serve this country and the governments of this country regardless of their political complexion. In the period in which he held high office while we were a government, I am aware, from comments made by colleagues as Ministers for Defence, that Sir Francis Hassett's contribution intellectually and his physical energy and determination to achieve results were invaluable. Many of the to : important changes which took place in the structure and functioning of the defence Services during the period we were in government were contributed to valuably and directly in many cases by Sir Francis Hassett. The Australian community has been fortunate in having a military officer of such great distinction and dedication serving it for so long. It is the sincere trust of members of the Opposition that his retirement will be pleasant and fruitful. I think it appropriate on this occasion also to welcome the appointment of Lieutenant General MACDonald tp succeed Sir Francis Hassett. We are confident that Lieutenant General MACDonald, who will now become General MACDonald, will maintain the very high standard of service for government and for the Australian community which has been established by his long line of successors.

69,Mr BRYANT,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT," I raise with the House the problem of prorogation and what it really means as that is the reason for this special adjournment. The Oxford Dictionary defines prorogation as a discontinuance of parUament without its dissolution. In this instance the prorogation is causing a great deal of inconvenience. It has stopped a lot of committees doing work. It has prevented the absolute surety that matters will continue from this week to a fortnight's time. That matter was raised here this morning. Therefore I hope the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) will take up with Mr Speaker the necessity perhaps to re-examine Standing Orders and not necessarily be inhibited by the restrictions that flow to us from other parliaments. As I understand it no Act of Parliament is involved. This is simply a traditional way of interpreting the word 'prorogue'. I think this is quite inappropriate and irrelevant and that the Parliament should not go through this charade any longer. I am deeply grateful that Her Majesty the Queen is to open the Parliament. I think that she has a much better attitude to therightsand powers of this Parliament than does her agent in this country. Question resolved in the affirmative.

G. Whitlam, and read a first time. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of this the Opposition) (11.55)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will establish an efficient and equitable scheme to provide benefits to anyone who has been injured or incapacitated at work or from any cause. It is a scheme for which the Labor Government twice sought to legislate while in office; it is based on an exhaustive inquiry missioned by my Government; and it springs from a long-standing and specific undertaking by the Labor Party tp the Australian people. not, however, from mere attachment to the Labor's Labor Government's programs that I bring in this Bill. I commend it to honourable members an historic and overdue social reform. It deserves the support of all parties. It will mean significant savings for the majority of Australians, and those who are the victims of tragic accident misfortune it will bring a measure of justice and security which has never been possible under law as it stands. Put simply, everyone in the community will ceive protection and the whole community will save money. There will in any case be a substanNew tial reduction in the crippling costs of motor hicle third-party and workers' compensation insurance. These costs are an ever-growing inescapable burden on every vehicle owner and employer in Australia. They are an intolerable burden on the States. By means of this Bill burden will be eased and its enormous inflareading tionary effect will be curbed. In place of the bersome and complex system of compulsory Legal insurance schemes administered and enforced under various state and territory laws, the Bill proposes a national rehabilitation and compenbefore sation scheme to provide benefits in the most equitable and efficient manner. By reducing been administrative costs, by spreading cost evenly and fairly throughout the community, a great reduction in charges and a vastly improved system of benefits will be possible. At present any victim of a motor vehicle or industrial accident faces delay, uncertainty and hardship before his claim is met or even considered. d The compensation eventually granted may be inadequate or arbitrary. Many deserving victims as and their families may get nothing at all. The sysbeing tem is uncertain, dilatory, costly andriddledwith at a later hour this day. anomalies. Mr Groom-How much will this cost? Mr E. G. Whitlam-Last year it would have saved between $325m and $375m. It would Second Reading have saved $lm a day. The scheme proposed in Bill will provide benefits that are certain, immediate, automatic, total, uniform and universal. No one denies that reform of the existing system will present complex technical and administrative problems. Equally, no one can deny that a solution to the spiralling cost of compulsory insurance must be found, and found quickly. The problem is urgent. Other countries have tackled comit successfully with schemes broadly similar to the one I propose. I do not want to rehearse here the record of obstruction and delay, from inside It is and outside the Parliament, which frustrated original proposals. It is sufficient to say that my Bill in its present form offers the best as possible basis for a workable national scheme. The Parliament has already had ample opportunity to consider the broad principles behind it. for My Government submitted our original Bill to or the widest possible public and parliamentary scrutiny. It was based on a report of the Rt Hon. the Sir Owen Woodhouse, of the New Zealand Court of Appeal and now of the Judicial Comremittee of the Privy Council, and the Hon. Mr Justice C. L. D. Meares, of the Supreme Court of South Wales, the Chairman of the National veAdvisory Council for the Handicapped and until recently Chairman of the Law Reform Comand mission of New South Wales. That report was received in July 1974 and tabled in the Parliament; legislation was introduced in this House on that 3 October 1974; before it was given a second in the Senate it was referred to the Sencumate 's Standing Committee on Constitutional and Affairs. Certain provisions of the Bill were revised and improved; further improvements and refinements are incorporated in the Bill now us. The Woodhouse Committee proposed 'a new deal for every Australian whose life had disrupted by injury or illness'. This Bill will the burden of provide that new deal. No member on either side has denied the importance or urgency of the problem. The Minwhere, ister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) stated on 15 July last year: It is becoming increasingly evident that State Governentitled ments are very concerned at the trends in, and inadequaciesis of, compulsory workers' compensation and third party insurance systems. . . . The tremendous costs of the systems and the loads their premiums place on employers and motorists are of primary concern to the States course, the community generally. On that there is unanimity throughout the comleft munity. I could quote similar statements from ance Premiers and other Liberal spokesmen. The the needs of need fbr a comprehensive scheme was pressing particular scheme when the Woodhouse Committee was first time of the injury. appointed to inquire. It is now imperative. The different provisions in Parliament will be fading in its duty if it shirks each provides for different the problem any longer. The central flaw in the existing just their exorbitant cost to the community but their total inadequacy as a system of social tice. Their faults can all be traced to the excessiveschemes legalism surrounding any system of compulsory state insurance. What ought to be a measure social welfare has become a commercial proAlthough cedure dictated by calculations of profit and What ought to be a willing social responsibihty for the injured and the sick has become a legal contest between adversaries. Where society should be primarily concerned with the welfare of the accident victim and his family it is concerned with legal concepts of evidence, negliinsurance gence and fault. The accident victim cannot be sure that he will receive compensation, nor amount to expect. If no question of fault or negli-amount gence arises a victim is often without any comsence pensation at all. The whole process of trial a court is costly and humiliating in itself. payment of damages as a lump sum opens the way to glaring anomalies in the amounts received By different people. Lump-sum payeven ments are also vulnerable to inflation and leave injured the victim with no guarantee of a steady, regularrecompense income during the period of incapacity, let alone expenses and,inifthe for life. Moreover, the need for insurance coming wage loss while his claim panies to calculate their premiums against a riskoften results in severe economic of massive lump sum payments vastly increases the cost of insurance. The entire system is waste-portion to the seriousness of the injury.inThus ful, inefficient and unjust. There is no dispute about the cost of accidentsomic to society in human and economic terms. More than 90 000 Australians were injured on the until roads in 1975; there were 228 000 industrial ac-settled. cidents. How many victims received any or adfor equate compensation, let alone rehabiUtation, is a matter for speculation. To receive any form compensation the victim mustfirstdetermine the appropriate system for recovery. Depending on when and how an injury occurs, a victim may have an action for damages at common law, or be entitled to workers' compensation, or be to no-fault motor accident benefits if he injured in Victoria or Tasmania, or come within the scope of a criminal injuries compensation scheme, or be eligible for social security payand, of ments. On the other hand the victim may find himself, or herself, outside aU these schemes and to bear the entire loss alone or with the assistof charity. The benefits, particularly the maximum amount recoverable, do not relate to the individual but depend on the he happens to fall under at the Each State and Territory has its different schemes, and maximum amounts of compensation. Each scheme contains its own schemes is notanomalies and exceptions. jusIn short, the one certainty in the present is that every vehicle owner and employer must pay for them. The great uncertainty of is whether victims will receive any benefits. third party insurance is compulsory loss. and universal, it does not provide automatic cover in all road accidents, and even people who are covered are unsure of their entitlements. There is no compensation for accident victims who suffer injuries by themselves without the more involvement of another party. The fact that companies indemnify motorists does not mean that liability for accidents is accepted whatwithout negligence being proved. The actual of liability or damages becomes the esofthe court battle. Thus all the costs, waste beforeand dissipation of resources which accompany The court trials are preserved in the system. Third party claims are never settled quickly if there is no doubt as to liability. The party must face and meet his loss without short term. He must pay all unable to work, suffer the resultis processed. This hardship. The delay in receiving recompense is longer proseverely injured victims, whose need for econsecurity is greater because of the long term nature of their incapacity, are obUged to wait medical opinion isfinalbefore their claim is This process takes a minimum of 3 years one-third of permanently disabled claimants. In New South Wales, after 5 years, 13 per cent of ofthose permanently disabled are still unpaid. Somehow the injured party is expected to survive this greater economic burden without any form of income. The situation is inhuman. Third party accident insurance simply that funds are available to pay for injuries causedalso on theroads.It is not an accident compensation scheme; it merely underwrites motorists liable be sued. This is not a satisfactory system for victim and it is cripplingly expensive to the munity. The public is overburdened in enforced payments of road accident insurance. Every State parliament levies a tax on every autopendants mobile owner. In every State the premiums are usually increased at least once a year. The spiralpayable is unending. As inflation pushes compensation payments higher and higher, insurance prehis miums are forced to rise so that reserves will sufficient to meet demands. Already there grave doubt as to the sufficiency of private insurers' reserves. In sheer economic terms, ing aside the compelling social and human ments for a national rehabilitation sation scheme, the present costly system must re-organised and rationalised for the benefit the whole community. If we remember that roughly two-thirds of Australian population are eUgible to drive motorpensation vehicles, and more than half those people private motor vehicles, we can see the extent the third-party burden on ordinary Australians. A comparison of the 1974 and 1976 compulsory third party insurance premium rates illustrates the dramatic rise in costs to the motorist. In New South Wales in 1974 the premium charged on third party insurance for an ordinary motor was $40, in March 1976 it was $83, now it is In Victoria in 1974 it was $65, in March 1976 had jumped to $91.50, it is now $111. Queensland in 1974 third party insurance cost $26.50 per motor car, in 1976 it was $40 entire (although only $12 to farmers and graziers). South Austraha the premium was $45 in 1974; has just gone up to $89 for private cars. In West-to ern Australia it was $27.60 in 1974; in 1976 it was $42. In Tasmama the premium in 1974 was a mere $12 per car; in 1976 it had risen to All motor vehicle insurance premiums in workers Australia have doubled or quadrupled in the last 3 years-in the 3 years since this proposal was tabled in the Parliament. Under this Bill, vehicle owner in Australia would pay less than he is compelled to pay at present. Underwriting losses totalled $119m in 1974-75. This loss was incurred when claims for the period totalled $181m. The total amount of claims estimated 1975-76 is $310m, an increase of 71 per cent. Premiums coUected have increased by over waste SlOOm or 36 per cent. The total loss on this insurance may therefore be as high as $200m a year. ensures Employers' UabiUty insurance schemes are compulsory in every State and Territory. As with third party insurance, when liability is to disputed there is a court battle with all the at the tendant costs, delays and uncertainty. There are com10 workers' compensation schemes in Australia. The maximum weekly compensation payments on total incapacity of an employee without deranges from $56.30 in Queensland to $73 in Victoria; in Western Australia the amount is equal to the employee's weekly earnings and in South Australia and Tasmania it is average weekly earnings over the previous 12 bemonths. An employer's maximum total UabiUty is for dependants on the death of an employee ranges from $27,616 in Western Australia to leav- $19,750 in Queensland. Why should a widow in arguQueensland be left $8,000 worse off than a and compenwidow in Western Australia? be Amounts payable for partial incapacity arising of from work-related injuries are extraordinarily varied. Let me iUustrate: For total loss of sight or the loss of both eyes the maximum amount of compayable to an employee in New South own Wales is $13,500; in Western Australia it is of $37,253. In Queensland maximum compensation for total deafness is $8,400; in Western Australia it is $27,939; in Tasmania it is $ 10,215; and in the Australian Capital Territory $15,387. For the loss of a foot, compensation is payable to Western Australians of $27,939, while a foot is car valued at only $7,290 in Queensland and $8,000 $93.in New South Wales. Under this Bill every emit ployer in Australia would pay less than he is In compelled to pay at present. The present schemes, however, do not cover anything like the work force. The largest groups not covered In are employers themselves and the selfit employed. No work-related injury benefits flow the small businessman when he suffers in the course of his work. Nor does workers' compensation extend to independent contractors, those $56.employed on an irregular basis, or volunteer for charities and reUgious institutions. The Old Testament formula of an eye for an eye is plainly more equitable that the present jackpot every system of compensation in Australia. I have said enough to point up the anomaUes and high costs to individuals in the present schemes. I turn now to the savings which Labor's proposals would achieve. The Minister for Social forSecurity (Senator Guilfoyle) has just suppUed me with officialfigureswhich show vividly the and extravagance built into the existing system. I believe they will be incorporated in today's Hansard in answers to quesuons on notice. In 1974-75, $575m was collected in workers' compensation premiums and $273m was disbursed in benefits, and $306m was colculated lected in third party premiums and $191m was disbursed in benefits. I ask the House to consider the staggering proportion of the total cost of present schemes accounted for by administration expenses and commissions. The Insurance missioner's latest report demonstrates that administration expenses and commission paid for third party and workers' compensation 1974-75 were more than $110m. In the case of workers' compensation alone the amount of conway tributors ' premiums eaten up by administrative costs and commissions reached the enormous sum of $96m, compared with benefits paid $273m. In other words the overhead costs of workers' compensation are one-third of the amount paid to accident victims. The actual pensation to victims would be less than the amount of $273m, since that figure includes theirsavings legal, hospital and medical expenses. How must the Australian people put up with this of efficiency? The need for reform is inescapable.under Labor's scheme would reduce this wasteful den quickly and dramatically. The savings under Labor's proposals were estimated by officers of a departmental working party appointed by my Government in 1974. They made a thorough, expert and impartial examination of the costs. The report was tabled in the House on 28 October 1975 and its congranted. clusions have never been questioned or denied. The working party included officers of the NA Figures for National Rehabilitation Item compensation compensation Cost to Users in 1975-76 Moneys paid out in 1975-76 Hospital and medical . . .

Employers would have paid Comabout $340m under our scheme for workers' compensation instead of the $460m they paid under State schemes- a saving of $ 120m. Morein over, the payments amounting to between $ 100m and $ 150m which are at present made by of voluntary insurance, social security, repatriation, sick leave and superannuation would be unnecessary under the scheme proposed by of the Bill. The total saving to the community estimated by the working party, would, therefore, have been between $325m and $375m in com1975-76-$l m a day-and in thisfinancialyear the saving would be far greater. The estimated in administration costs and commissions long are particularly striking: For third party sortinsurance, $15m under present schemes, $4m this; for workers' compensation, $105m burunder present schemes, $8m under this. The figures speak for themselves, and I repeat: They have never been challenged. I ask leave to incorE orate in Hansard the table from which I have een quoting.",27

Plainly any federal governWhen ment can administer such a scheme more econor omically than States or private bureaucracies. already has the machinery and the experience do so. All the methods offinancingthe scheme recommended by the working party, the section of its report dealing with the feasibility of related tax on employers was the work of the Australian Government Actuary and officers of the Australian Taxation Office and the Ausweekly traUan Bureau of Statistics. They recommend that the coUection of payments by employers should be the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation. What could be more obvious? The federal government has had 60 years experience of making periodic payments in the case of age and invahd pensions and more than 60 years the case of veterans. The cost of collection under Labor's scheme would be almost nil and the costs of making payments would be minimal. Before describing the essential features scheme, a word about experience overseas. New Zealand and various states and provinces of the United States of America and Canada have all acted to reUeve the social and economic costs accident compensation. In 1966 New Zealand first acted on the recommendations of a royal commission chaired by Sir Owen Woodhouse for who, of course, was the chairman of the comeffects mittee upon which the present scheme is based. In 23 years of office Liberal-Country Party governments in Australia failed to heed the benefits example set by other governments and failed take any action of their own. They failed recognise the hardship and injustice imposed accident victims by the antiquated common system. My Party in 1971 adopted the policy of estabUshing a national compensation insurance scheme to replace third party and workers' comexpenses. pensation, and guarantee families and individuals a minimum income sufficient to gances maintain an acceptable standard of Uving. In March 1973 Mr Justice Woodhouse again commissioned, this time by my Governimprovement ment, to report upon the scope and form of a nationwide system of rehabilitation and comcompelling pensation for all injured persons. This Bill, substantially on that report, provides a scheme by which Australian residents will receive matic earnings-related benefits when they are injured or incapacitated either temporarily in conjunction with the attached notes. Security; Repatriation; Sick Leave; Superannuation. at a cost of $35m work, $25m road (1975-76 prices). permanently from any cause. The injury may have been received at any place and at any time. the scheme is in operation any employee any person wiU be eUgible for compensation It for incapacity as a result of personal injury, proto viding that person is over the qualifying age and meets certain broad residence requirements. 'Personal injury' includes any physical or mental a riskdisability or damage and certain illnesses contracted as a result of thepersonal injury or in the course of employment. The benefit proposed is a sum in respect of aU incapacities. The sum for total incapacity is calculated on a percentage-up to 85 per cent-of the weekly earnings of the appUcant immediately before his injury. The scheme is to be administered by a government department. There is to be no contest over in proving UabiUty, no lawyers and no judge or jury. A social welfare policy adrninistration will assess claims and provide benefits and allowances. The administration will also deal with the rehabilitative aspect of the scheme. It will set of our safety and health standards and co-ordinate activities across the fuU range of the social welfare area. In other words, the scheme does away with the common law system of once-and-for-aU, of lump-sum assessments of damages. Lump-sum awards preclude speedy settlement of claims as thefinalcost of the injury is often not determined years. They also fail to take into account the of inflation or any deterioration in the victim 's condition. Under the scheme in the Bill benefits will be continually reviewable. All will be automatically adjusted in accordto ance with rises in the consumer price index. to Minor personal injuries and severe facial or on bodily disfigurement may be compensated by law way of lump-sum payment. Other benefits include sums to dependent relatives and children of deceased persons and the payment of funeral Let there be no talk of handouts and extravaunder this scheme. As I have shown, it wiU save money, not waste it. Even if there were was no savings the scheme would be a vast on what we have now. The removal of injustice, uncertainty and delay is a reason for reforming the present based cumbersome structure in one way or another. I put it forward as a general proposition that any autoform of insurance, indeed any community activity that is compulsory for everyone by law, is or best administered in uniform fashion by a government agency established for that purpose. This scheme and Labor's Medibank scheme are based on the same principle. That principle need to establish the most rational, just, humaneHolmes and efficient procedures to administer any welfare scheme from which the whole comthat munity benefits and to which the whole comoperating munity is obliged to contribute. The present tem of compulsory State workers' compensation and third party insurance, like the Fraser Government's compulsory health insurance, are intrinsically extravagant and inefficient. Medical and hospital treatment have to be paid for, but the present State workers' compensation and third party insurance schemes and the present Federal health insurance scheme make medical and hospital treatment unnecessarily expensive for patients and taxpayers. In Australia the Federal Government is government best suited to establish the new pro-people cedures. A uniform national scheme evidently the best way to eliminate costs, overlap and duplication, and to reduce the administrative overheads entailed different, competing compames. The States know the social and economic shortcomings of reserve the present system but there is little on their own, for they do not have the apparatus to collect the revenue or to disburse the benefits.(12.25)-The As in all such reforms it is imperative that the initiative should come from the Federal GovernG. ment. It has the opportunity and the duty to giveAustralia. a lead. It has the constitutional power. The Government Solicitor-General, Mr Byers, has given an There opinion that the scheme we propose is fully within the limits of the Commonwealth's authaspects ority. In my experience every opinion Mr Byers committee has given, on legislation or in administration, been upheld by the High Court. There has neverWoodhouse ofin New been a successful challenge to any Bill or any action which he has advised. The whole thrust of policy under this Governwhich ment has been to devolve upon the States responsibilities which are properly and traditioncommittee's ally those of the Federal Government. In all this the objective is not so much to bring administra-national tion closer to the people or to involve the munity in programs of local or regional concern. That m itself would be a proper objective and one supported by the Labor Party. What the Fraser Government has sought to do is reverse the historic consensus of a generation of tralian politics, the principle adhered to by suc1975, cessive Labor and Liberal governments, ever since the Second World War that the prime reGovernment sponsibility for social welfare and security, for all reforms and initiatives in thisfield,rests with the Federal Government. As I pointed out last week, that was the underlying motive of the is the Government in appointing the Bailey and inquiries into aspects of social welfare. socialEven the Bailey report, while recommending the States should have the primary role in schemes for rehabilitation, neverthesysless proposes that the Commonwealth retain 'a policy, evaluating and funding role'. In any national rehabilitation and compensation scheme worthy of the name, that should be the minimum role for the Federal Government. No Federal Government can in justice ignore its obligation to explore and develop a new system of compensation and rehabilitation, in consultation with the States and the interests concerned, and remove the intolerable shoncomings of the system as it now stands. I believe that the scheme proposed in this Bill is in principle and detail the the best that can be devised. How long must the wait? How long must justice be denied?

In 1973 the previous Government established a hascompensation of inquiry into rehabilitation and Australia under Mr Justice Zealand. Mr Justice Woodhouse of course had previously headed a royal commission of inquiry in New Zealand ultimately resulted in the introduction of an accident compensation scheme in 1974. The report was tabled in the Australian Parliament in July 1974 and it included a draft compensation Bill. That Bill was commodified, introduced into Federal Parliament and passed by the House of Representatives in October 1974. In the same month the clauses of the Bill were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. AusThe Committee reported to Parliament in July raising many objections to the Bill. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, the then was in the process of reviewing the and Bill when Parliament was dissolved in November 1975. Enormous efforts would have been required, however, before the scheme could have been regarded as generally acceptable and workable. For instance, the scheme was not ported by all sections of the community. Its financial and economic implications had not yetincreases been fully resolved. The States did not support all the proposals and the constitutional of the proposed authorising legislation was also in question. In view of these difficulties Government decided not to proceed with the Bill. Before outlining the weaknesses which exist in the current compensation system it is necessary to describe the present position. The existing sysThat tems which provide monetary benefits to who suffer incapacity as a result of personal injury or who are dependent on or related to a ter Mr person killed as a result of personal injury mclude common law, including fatal accidents granted legislation, workers' compensation, no-fault tinuation motor accident compensation, criminal compensation, air accidents liability, social seofficially that the House granted curity, superannuation, sick leave and private continuation of the debate. Is leave loss insurance. Many of these systems fall within the jurisdiction of the States, although the lack of rationalisation results in unnecessary expenditure and produces difficulties for victims. Some of these have been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. The weaknesses which led to the Woodhouse inquiry still exist. I shall outline some of we see them. Most self-employed persons are not covered by workers' compensation. This group estimated to comprise over 10 per cent work force. There is a lack of uniformity as benefit structures, entitlements and administratvery ive practices. For example, unlike the rest of Australian working population, 20 to 30 per cent of workers in Victoria and New South Wales not receive weekly compensation of 100 per cent of award wages m thefirst26 weeks of injury. Over 30 per cent of motor accident victims, due to the absence of negligence on someone else's [ >art, are unable to sue for damages at common sation aw. However, there would be an entitlement for hospital and medical expenses under health with insurance arrangements, as well as income mainof tenance for short term injuries provisions. Settlements of common law damages are slow. Damages are reduced by contributory negligence irrespective of the needs of the injured son and are adversely affected by inflation cause they are paid in a lump sum. There have been high losses by State government insurance offices and private insurers in both workers com-pective pensation and third party fields. Premiums charged to employers for workers compensation insurance and to motorists for compulsory third supparty insurance, which amount to over $ 1,000m a year, have become a real burden and further will be necessary. Some relief is provided to employers, however, by allowing these validity premiums as tax deductions. the new Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order! As it is now 2 hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, consideration of notices is interrupted. Motion (by Mr Hunt) agreed to: the time for the discussion of notice No. 1 on the those general business paper be extended. DEPUTY SPEAKER-Before the Miniscontinues, might I say that I took it for that the House gave leave for the conof the debate because of the circuminjuries to continue. It might itbeand stances surrounding just to allow the Minister as well if we record leave for the granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",33
74,Mr HUNT,COMPARISONS OF ESTIMATED COSTS,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the House. Investigations have been instituted to develop options for alternatives to the Woodhouse scheme. The Government's objective is to have a joint examination by Comthem as monwealth and State Governments of options that are available, together with an investigation is of the implications of establishing a national of the compensation program. It is becoming to increasingly evident that State governments are concerned at the trends in and the the inadequacies of existing compulsory workers compensation and third party insurance systems. do The Commonwealth Government is prepared to give full consideration to options to improve the systems. All the States are concerned at the increasing cost of compensation. In Victoria in particular a judicial committee has been appointed to inquire into both workers compenand compulsory third party insurance, very extensive terms of reference. The role the Commonwealth, which appears to be of under sick leave and to interest much the House to the Leader of the Opposition generally, falls within the terms of reference of the inqiry. In addition to working with the States to make perthe systems more efficientfinancially,the Combemonwealth would like to see adequate incomerelated protection for the income earner who is unable to work because of personal injury, irresof when or where the injury occurred or whether the injured party was at fault. This, together with improvements in safety and availability of early rehabilitation, is seen as an important adjunct to the Government's industrial relations platform. The present Government regards rehabilitation of the disabled as an essential feature of any compensation program. In its consultations with the States and with other interested bodies on the development of a program, due emphasis has been given to this important matter. The insurers represented by the National Compensation Insurance Industry Committee have expressed particular concern about the provision of adequate rehabilitation services and are willing to assist in their developploratory ment. The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service is the largest and most comprehensive vocational rehabilitation service in Australia. It is only one of such services operating on a national basis. Its rehabilitation centres are specially equipped to provide balanced programming for remedial treatment and vocational assessment. In 1975-76 the Commonwealth rehabilitation service program cost $11.5m. So far as research is concerned, the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped and the Department of Social Security are conducting orfinanciallyassisting research into various aspects of rehabilitation. NACH continues in its role as adviser to the Government on all facets of rehabilitation. The Government also believes that safety must be a first priority in the development of any compensation program, and the role of safety will continue to be stressed in discussions with the States and other interested groups. The National Compensation Insurance Industry Committee has already indicated that the insurers are vitally interested in fostering improved safety programs in the industrial area. In December last my colleague the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) announced that an office of road safety was to be estabUshed. The office will work in close association with the State and Territory road safety authorities and will play a major part in the national determination of priorities for the prevention of accident and injury. The major legislative power with regard to occupational safety in Australia Ues with the States, so the Federal Government is Umited in what it can do in that regard. Nevertheless, in its own sphere the Commonwealth has demonstrated that it is aware of the need for action by introducing a code of general principles for occupational safety and health in Australian Government employment. It is hoped that legislation broadly along the lines of the code will be introduced into the Territories. The House may be assured that the Government's interest in safety will be carried into any program for national compensation. In other words, the Government could develop jointly with the States the framework of a Commonwealth-States national compensation program; not a centralised program but a cooperative program utilising the expertise and administrative machinery that exists within the State governments and the private insurance industry. To this end the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) met with Ministers of State governments on 10 May last year for exdiscussions on whether the States wished to co-operate with the Commonwealth in the joint development of a national compensation plan or whether they would prefer to develop plans separately on a State by State basis. The States reiterated their objections to the Woodhouse scheme but agreed to become involved in joint discussions. The meeting estabUshed a Commonwealth-State officers steering committee to undertake a joint examination, including an assessment of the cost of various options for improving the present systems and expanding their coverage. The committee met for the firsttimeon 23 and 24 June 1976, and it was resolved that the Department of Social Security should prepare working papers for consideration by State officials, which led to the preparation of a comprehensive document. This document sets out what needs to be done by Commonwealth and State governments to achieve the concepts of a national compensation scheme. Working papers which considered in detail aspects of coverage and benefits were circulated to the steering committee members in September last year. The steering committee meeting which was to have been held from 30 September to 1 October last year was deferred pending the conclusion of interdepartmental consultations. At the same time as consultations were being held with the States, discussions took place with the private insurance industry, employer organisations, trade unions, the medical and legal professions, welfare organisations and motorists' organisations. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a Ust of the organisations which have been contacted.",34

Therefore, it would wish to take a vote on the Bill but would prefer defer that vote at this stage.",36
77,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,COMPARISONS OF ESTIMATED COSTS,"Jus t briefly in the S minutes remaining for this debate today I think it is worthwhile pointing out that although notice was given months ago that this Bill would be introduced the best this Parliament can do for debate on Bill is to provide this very limited period of This should clearly demonstrate the sort of priorities we give in this Parliament to matters such major importance as this National Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill. The OpGovernment position is fully appreciative of the reply given the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). We welcome the fact that at least some tinuing work is being done in thisfield.The Government seems to overlook the fact that an enormous amount of work was done by the 2 gentlemen who prepared the report-Hi s Honour Mr Justice Woodhouse and His Honour Mr Justice Meares, two very distinguished judicial identities. Mr Justice Woodhouse was closely associated with the compensation scheme in New Zealand. That scheme is working quite effectively and well. His Honour Mr Justice Meares is a most experienced advocate and is very dedicated to the concept of rehabilitation. He has a lot of knowledge in this area. Although they were able to take evidence from all over Australia and produce a report which we presented to the Parliament it got waylaid m a Senate committee which basically said that it supported it but it could see some problems in certain fringe areas. The sad fact is that in a parliament of this nature we cannot even produce compensation legislation covering members of parUament. If a member of parUament is injured he has to rely on some ex gratia payment. So it follows does it not, in view of that position, that we would have very little worry about the problems of other people. The tragedy of the situation is-and this is well known to lawyers-that it has become a lottery of chance as to whether a person gets compensaIf a person is injured while driving his car to from work on a Monday he is covered. But if he is injured on the weekend he is not covered. the An enormous number of people are excluded and from workers' compensation schemes. These people include casual workers, people employed in thefishingindustry and domestic servants. An enormous number of people with dreadful disabiUties are not covered for compensation. Of course the Government picks up the tab through the Department of Social Security. It is always not interesting when honourable members talk to about joint Commonwealth-State consultations. I wonder whether any work will be done in relato the number of people who having been compensated under these outmoded and cumbersome schemes that operate in the States have 12 expended their money and are now a burden on the Social Security payroll. Because these people the who suffered permanent disabilities were unable time. to live on the money which was awarded to them they are now on the Social Security payroU. They of are being subsidised by the taxpayers. The Opposition welcomes the fact that the feels that it ought to have further by consultations. But honourable members can see the malaise that seeps through this concept in the consense that while there was an initial meeting perhaps in May of last year we really have not seen very much progress yet. We will not see it while there is this interminable argument about an injured person's legal rights in the States whether the Commonwealth is intruding. Is it about time that we had a look Australians? Does it matter what a person's rights are? If in fact a person is senously injured and cannot carry on in his work why should not be entitled to compensation Under a national scheme of compensation? The farmer on the land who is self-employed gets nothing if he injured in a tractor accident. It is an indictment on anybody who says he represents the rural interests that nothing has been done in this area. A young child who is injured gets very Uttle pensation. It is cheaper in our society to kill person than it is to maim a person. This is the of legalism we have at the presenttime.The Woodhouse-Meares concept did away with that. It did away with a fault concept. If we could do away with just arguing about who is to blame would save $20m in New South Wales. How silly it is. If honourable members look at the they will see that not one State compensation fund is viable or can expect to be viable. It fidently anticipated that State governments have to bear the whole of the responsibihty motor vehicle insurance and workers compensametropolitan tion insurance because no private sector of the community can afford to take the risks that will be involved. Consider the enormous losses year in New South Wales in the field of third party motor vehicle insurance. Over and above the premiums the loss was $49m. Admittedly this was reduced to $8m because of investment proafter cedures but that merely meant that payment compensation to those people who were injured was delayed for some time. Somebody had to sustain them in the meantime. Look at the tragic circumstance outlined in the Canberra Times today concerning a 19-year-old man who is now a quadriplegic. He got an enormous sum of money, but if he dies that money will go to body else-perhap s a member ofhis fanuly. The concept is not right.",36
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPARISONS OF ESTIMATED COSTS, cattle Order! The time allotted for precedence to General Business has expired. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day under General Business for the next sitting day. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,37
79,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr cattle and Katter) proposing that a definite matter of pubUc not importance be submitted to the House for disat Australia as cussion, namely: legal The plight of Australia's beef producers. he I caU upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by is the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",37
80,Mr KATTER,AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY,"This matter is indeed of pubUc importance not just for the cattle producer, not just for the thousands of comsmall businessmen-the stockmen and all the a other little people throughout the nation-who , sort ever since Australia as such existed, have been a part of this rugged scenario, the truly Australian world of the cattle industry, not just the exporters, and not just the stock and station agents. we No indeed. This Government and this nation cannot disregard and will not disregard the disaster which is closing in on an industry worth one statistics bilhon dollars to this nation. The Australian Labor Party stimulated by the is conphilosophy of the Coombs report, could not at will any stage disguise its venom towards country in people or, more specifically, towards nonresidents, hence the utter neglect of industries such as the beef industry. Let us look for a moment at just what has been done in the last shorttimeour Government has been in office. There is provision in the Budget for a further $ 15m to be made available as carry-on loan assistance to be jointly financed with the States joint Commonwealth-State consideration. of The conditions on the granting of these loans were Uberalised to enable producers who had already obtained finance to apply once again. Early m 1976 the meat export inspection service provided by the Department of Agriculture was suspended. This is estimated to have saved the industry about $25m for the year 1976-77. There somewas a contribution to the beef industry of $ 18.5m. I admit that $1 lm approximately is the net amount involved because of the $1 per head slaughter levy for the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication campaign. There was a grant to the Australian Meat Board of $ 1.2m to cover the cost of the export charges on the sale of meat to the Union of Soviet SociaUst RepubUcs in 1975. Finally, speaking in a general sense, it might be confidently anticipated that the recent devaluation wiU permit exporters to take advantage of many more inquiries from nontraditional markets. Regrettably these measures gave Uttle, if any, benefit to the desperatefinancialpUght of the producer. There must be an end to the recurring cycles of booms and recessions and the only machinery to achieve this is Government legislation. To me the industry is crying out, not for Government dollars, but for the reconstruction of the industry based on a cornerstone policy of stabilisation. The argument that supply and demand will determine a price structure and will stabilise market conditions for the producer is no longer acceptable to the cattlemen. It is interesting to note that since 1974 the demand for beef has increased by 50 per cent while prices have fallen lamentably and over the last few weeks, at least in Queensland, prices have dropped to such an extent that my colleague the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) purchased just the other day a 433-lb vealer carcass hot for $20. It is calculated that this would be about one-third of the production costs of that beast. The cold facts are that the cattle producer does not have direct access to a true market and the price he receives bears little or no relationship to the price his product brings on an overseas market. So much for the supply and demand argument. It cannot be effective in a market place where, say, 25 000 producers are subject to the prices paid by half a dozen buyers. Every cattle producer in Austraha is affected by these circumstances but I would point out that the State perhaps most affected by the collapse of the beef industry is Queensland. I do not think any other State has more individual cattle producers who are unable to diversify, so it is not surprising that some rather dramatic and certainly determined initiatives have emerged in that State. The State Government formed a beef industry committee which has submitted a proposed beef stabilisation plan which, it has been suggested, should have an initial trial period of 5 years with provision for extension at 5-year intervals. Without going into the details of this scheme I think it would be an advantage to explain one or two features which I think are interesting. For instance, the plan refers to a 'livable price' concept and this is explained as intending that the nunimum price fixed should provide a return sufficient to enable the generally efficient grazier to survive in the industry until market prices improve. The committee claimed that a price of around 66c to 70c per kilogram, dressed weight basis, first and second quaUty would be about the required. I do not want to go into further details regarding this or any other stabilisation plan. I have only 15 minutes to deal with a subject that is of momentous importance and the major described objective of this debate is to argue the general concept of stabilisation and to plead the cause for the utmost urgency in the matter of reconstructing the cattle producing industry. It is apparent that no marketing plan can be put into action until 2 matters are finalised. First, a uniform national classification scheme must be introduced. It is encouraging to note that the Agricultural Council, at its meeting at Launceston earlier this month, announced that Australia's carcass classification scheme will be based on measurements of weight, fat depth and age of carcasses and will apply to cattle, sheep and pigs. Much more important was the announcement that chains would be operating in aU States by June 1977. The industry is understandably urging the Government to puU out all stops and give this matter full priority, and I am confident that this is what is being done. The second matter essential to any plan is the organisation that will administer it, hence the insistence that the personnel of the newly organised Meat and Livestock Corporation be announced without delay. Let me say with complete conviction that throughout the land the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) is being urged to bring the Corporation under producer control. I believe that no Minister for Primary Industry in history has ever had such difficulties to contend with. He has received hundreds of representations in relation to the new Corporation and, in accordance with the way in which this Government acts, each of these has been respected and evaluated. However, I must say to the Minister, if I am to project truthfully the unanimity of opinion I have received from the producers, that if the composition of the Corporation was announced before lunchtime today, it would not be too soon. One matter to which I must refer is the necessity for the sub-committee of the Agricultural Council to have its recommendations examined and processed with all urgency so that this will not be an inhibiting factor to delay the Government's attention to the marketing requirements of the producer. There was much disappointment, if not considerable anger, when it was learnt that the matter of stabilisation was not effectively discussed at the Launceston meeting. I regret that I have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Queensland's Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Vic SulUvan, for to learn why the required recommendations were level not ready for the Launceston meeting. I must return again to the main theme of this debate, that is, to stress again what can only be as victimisation of the cattle producer by a system which coldly denies him a fair share of export returns. I think at this stage that would do well to quote some comments made by the leader of the National Country Party, Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in the House only last week. He gave figures which dicated record meat sales during 1977 due, might mention, to the tremendous activity by Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Minisand ter for Primary Industry and, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister himself. He said: Our Japanese quotas are being continually pushed up since the ban on imports in 1974 was lifted. The European Economic Community has eased some of its restrictions is offering a market of about 123 000 tonnes of which we will have a part. One aspect the sales that have been made to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and to the Eastern Soviet bloc countries. I am pleased to say that it is and the invitation of the head of the Soviet States Trading Agency that we look like making sales to the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries of about 100 000 tonnes which is additionalThis is interestingto last year's sales. The higher prices and the greater mean that the industry should be doing better. I ask honourable members to note what he then had to say: I believe it is true that the non-growing sector of try has had a prosperous year-that is the exporters, the protoday cessors and the people who work in the meat works. But the prices have not been reflected back to the cattle producers. He went on to say: I think it is a bad situation everybody does not share in the benefits. The cattle producing side of the industry has Unless there is a sharing of the returns then I think great harm will be done to the industry. There should be an opportunity for higher returns going to catde owners this year but that will depend on whether the buyers are prepared to pass the returns back . . . The latter part of what he states eloquently and sincerely supports my case for our cattle men. I merely add that the cattlemen of Australia and all who work with them-from the ringer, the stockman, the tank sinker to the vet, the professional man-are a determined bunch and they are looking for an alternative if a scheme is not urgently put into operation which will give them a fair share of our export earnings. Their threat, which most certainly will materialise into action, is that they will go it alone. They will kill, process and export in their ownright.Could they be blamed for this if one read, as I did the day before yesterday, in a New Zealand newspaper dated 9 February 1977 a report of sales which had been held the previous day? It said: Prices paid for prime cattle: top oxen $254, heavy $240 to $250, medium $205 to $235-now we are getting back to the plonk and away from the champagne-'Angus steers $ 115 to $ 118'. Let us look I at somefiguresthat were given to one of my producers in relation to prices in Australia. The cost the on board ship was 68c per lb and-this is interesting-the maximum price to producer was in17c per lb. I conclude by saying that if we look at I the existing prospects for 1977 we must admit the that the beef producer has never had it better the cattle producer has never had it worse.",37

87,Mr KEATTNG,AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY,"The Government lifted the meat inspection charges and the Opposition increased made it plain that that money would go directly report to the exporters and not to the producers, and Sydney Morning that in fact has been the case. Now the Government is crying about the fact that the producers The are getting nothing. The honourable member for told Kennedy is trying to save his skin up in northern traUan Queensland, while the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), a member of his Party, will do absolutely nothing about the reconstruction of the Meat Board and will not anything substantial about the state of the beef industry. Let us look at the record. When Labor was government we granted $39.6m directly for carry-on loans to the beef industry and we procan vided for a further $8m in our last Budget, ing a total of $47.Sm. Yet all that has come fruition after all the promises of the halcyon of the 1975 election campaign, when the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party were running all over Australia making wild promises, is a States Grants Bill which provides $ 15m in carry-on loans. Yet honourable members opposite have the hide the temerity to criticise us for making $47.5m available to the beef industry. I think we should just recaU for a moment what the Minister Primary Industry said during the election paign. I shaU read from an article in the interests Australian of 18 August 1975 which is headed: 'Sinclair puts plan to save the beef industry' it reads: The program calls for carry-on finance for beef producers, claiming the present $39.6m government allocation equate. It is understood the Country Party wants at $ 100m lent to producers at 4 per cent interest with 2-year interest moratorium. The Minister has said other things to which I shaU refer. This is a report which appeared in men another newspaper: 'Beef crisis is a social and economic 'The time is rapidly passing for the Australian Government take action to relieve the position of the Australian beef are. What did his industry . . .' The Government has been in office now for just on 2 years yet we have not seen any substantial improvement in the Australian beef industry. Let us look at exports. Seventy per cent of Australia's exports go to the United States and 52 per cent of United States imports come from of Australia. The United States is our only export not market for some categories of meat, particularly that which comes from the Northern Territory and from Queensland. When the Minister for Primary Industry went to Canada in the middle of last year he was instrumental in having quotas placed upon the import of Australian beef into the United States. I shaU read a from Ottawa which appeared in the Herald of 17 June: Australian Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, Canadian ofncials today he was concerned that Ausbeef was beingre-exportedfrom Canada to the United States at less than home market prices. own In short he was saying: 'My producers back home are dumping beef on you'. That is the long do and short of it. As Minister for Primary Industry he went outside this country and put his own beef industry into the Canadian officials who very quickly took the cue, as did the United States Dein partment of Agriculture in an election year, and shoved the quotas back on. The blame fbr that be laid right at the door of the Minister for makPrimary Industry. Yet the honourable member to for Kennedy, like a humbug, talks about the days state of the beef industry but is not prepared to take his own Minister to task. All he says is that the Minister has not appointed some people to a board which has not yet been established. That is (Beef Industry) all he has had to say. and Let me deal with a couple of other matters concerning the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Here is another excellent example of the for shoddy way in which the Government has camtreated the Australian beef industry and the of beef producers in this country. I refer honourable members to a story which appeared and in the Australian Financial Review last Friday which is headed: 'How 60 million lb of beef got lost at dinner'. The article is written by Robert is inadHaupt from Washington. This is a real pearl of a least story and it demonstrates the complete incompean initial tence which the Prime Minister displays when he goes overseas. The article reads: It was following that dinner that a small, select group of sat down in a spirit of good intentions to thrash out one of the issues then clouding Australian-American relations: beef imports. crisis', says Ian Sinclair. US. Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz first raised the topic. Attending the dinner were the President of the United States, Earl Butz, the Prime Minister, Henry Kissinger, and the Australian Ambassador to the United States. The article goes on to say: In any event, the ball was in the Australian court. what was the complaint? Here they are sitting down after dinner and ask-In ing the Australian Prime Minister, who professes an interest in his own beef industry, and the traUan Ambassador, their basic complaint on beef because the United States Administration would Uke to try to do something about it. Haupt goes on to say: The real answer, at that point, was an arbitrary ruling United States Customs, including in the quota year 34.4 million lb of Australian meat that Australia says in 1974. That was, quite simply, meat that Australia felt titled to ship to the United States. Here were the United States retary of Agriculture at least pretending to lend etic ear to a gripe Australia has had for more than a year. The Australians fumbled the chance. No one could remember the correct figure for the amount of involved. The Prime Minister left it to the Ambassador, Parkinson, who left it to the Australian senior trade tative to Washington, Mr Jack Smith, who, having no one further down the line to leave it to, came up with apparently just an inspired guess: 60 million lb. The Prime Minister, who'd had briefing books on ject, and the Ambassador, who'd been ultimately in of negotiations in the period leading up to the visit, demur. They agreed with the figure of 60 million lb. article continues: Neither, for that matter, did Secretary Butz or Secretary Kissinger. Kissinger made some sympathetic noises having a look at the question, and that was it for Except fbr one thing. Leaving, Smith asked Fraser were his instructions. Fraser replied curtly that he should for double. That shows the level of competence displayed by this Government in the Umted States tion to the Australian beef industry. When the American President, the American Secretary of much State and the American Secretary of Agriculture sit down with the Australian Prime Minister the Australian Ambassador and ask them what their problem is in relation to United imports of Australian beef, not one of the 2 AusIf, tralian representatives knew what was the point then at issue or that the figure was 34 million instead of 60 rnilUon lb. So whatfinallyhapOf pened was that the United States Administration caught up with the facts. It then realised that neither Fraser as Prime Minister, nor Parkinson as Ambassador, knew what was at issue. The ing United States Administration just poUtely and promptly dropped it. To add insult to injury, the newspaper article continues by stating: In fact, the way the Prime Minister raised itthat was the beef issuewas to ask the President as the discussions were being wound Just up whether it would be OK with him if he (Fraser) were to say they had discussed beef. other words, the Prime Minister did not discuss beef with the United States President but Ausasked the President whether he would agree to say that he had. If that is not showing contempt for your own beef industry I do not know what is. Later in the year the Prime Minister had the temerity, because the National Country Party was by kicking at him, to write a dirty letter to Ford in 1975 the middle of an election year and asked Ford to arrived go back on the quota decision, after Fraser had asked Ford to include in the communique that it was enthey had discussed beef when in fact they had Secretary of State and Secnot. Yet this humbug comes in here to talk about a sympaththe beef industry. He has never done anything positive about agricultural marketing in his life. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) meat has just turned down the Australian Wool Corporation in thefinalityof the Corporation's C Mr Nicholas lans, and honourable members know this. Yet represene has the indecency to criticise us for what hapwhat was pened with wool. Wefixedthefloorprice plan for wool and allocated $350m on the line to prop the subup the Australian wool industry. We set up the charge marketing proposals for the wheat industry. We did not have done the only substantial things that have been done for the beef industry. Yet the honour The able member crawls into this House today and claims that the Government is sympathetic to the beef industry. Let me quote what was said by the about honourable member's leader because Mr the night. Anthony's remarks were quoted by the honourwhat able member for Kennedy during the debate. go This lays the matter to rest. I quote directly from a speech made by the Leader of the National Country Party in 1973. Honourable members in relashould listen to this. He stated: The Country Party believes that Government policy inasas itrelatesto the beef industry should be directed to: and (a) the encouragement of production. I stress those words 'the encouragement of proStates duction*. He went on to state: as appears likely, a world beef shortage is developing, Australia mustrespondin the most effective manner lb possible to meet this position. course, the Liberal-Country Party Government up to that time had encouraged beef production in Australia. Tbey have now found that markets are not avaUable for it. What we are facnow is a massive social crisis in some sections of the beef industry. There is a need for firm reconstruction policy, a lead which the Party the honourable member for Kennedy is incaphis able of giving. Let us get down to the real issues. The present Government has been in office since December 1973. It has had all that time to do something firm about the plight of the Australian beef industry. It has removed the meat inspection and handed the benefit squarely to meat porters and not to producers. We told the Government that that would happen, yet it still gave it to the exporters because the real of this Government are not the beef producers but the meat compames who are friendly with the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Katter) Baume), who is on the board of one such comhave pany, and the Minister for Primary Industry. The Government was happy to give them a little more to go into their pockets. If honourable members do not believe me they should the statistics made available to this House by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) relating to the profits of the meat exporting compames this year. Those profits have skyrocketed in the past 12 months because of the Government's policy. But where is the producer? The producer is left destitute because all that the Government has done since it came to office has been to in here with an amendment to a Labor Party industry; piece of legislation by which it will provide $ in carry on loans to the beef industry, whereas the Labor Party when in government $47.5m to that industry. We have had enough of the Government's humbug, its duplicity and its deceit. It has let the beef producers down. It has consistently let agriculture down. We will not tolAustraUans erate or let the Government get away with this snide attempt to exonerate the Minister for Priyears, mary Industry from his task. Every rural newspaper in this country is cal of the behaviour of the Minister for Primary Industry. They say he is lax in his job; that incompetent; that he cannot be trusted overseas; that he sells industry down the drain. They are correct. The point is that if the Government wants to be credible on agriculture it needs develop some sensible marketing policy, some stabilisation poUcies and some readjustment poUcies. All the Government has done in all the years it has been in government is to foster more production, thereby creating over-supply. Ultimately we have seen industries and families go destitute. So enough of the Government's humbug. We on this side of the House support the Australian beef industry and are sympathetic to its pUght. But we will not watch Government flatten supporters come in here and try to exonerate of incompetent Minister for his incompetence and lack of sympathy for an industry which is in dire economic circumstances.",40
88,Mr CARIGE,AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY,"I Ustened to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) with some interest. In fact, I should Uke levy to congratulate him on misrepresenting nearly exeverybody in the House, including members of the Labor Party. The Labor Party brought about the ruinous situation that faces our beef profriends ducers today. The honourable member for Blaxland did not even have the decency to read what the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr said when he outlined the assistance we provided to the rural sector. He even stated incorrectly that we had been in government for 2 years. He went on to read probably the best speech I have ever heard him read from the Ausrefer to tralian Financial Review. There are some vital aspects of Australia's present beef dUemma that I am obUged to canvass in this House today as the representative for Capricornia, one of the vital beef producing regions of Australia. Among these points are the following key elements: Retention of cattle on creepproperties; the need for unity throughout the the Japanese catde and beef enterprises 1 Smoperating in Australia. These estabUsh the fact that there are 2 industries-the beef industry and provided the cattle industry. I shall dealfirstlywith cattle retention. Most are aware that our once great beef industry has been down on its knees for 3 long that it has been kicked to death by cunning exporters and even domestic buyers in practices bordering on collusive buying, motivated by critigreed. They have bled the ordinary cattlemen dry. For instance, in Queensland in one smaU he is valley I know just south of Rockhampton some IS 000 head of cattle bought by a big meat company at give away prices are on agistment. This story is repeated over and over in Queensland to and New South Wales. There are herds involving tens of thousands of head of cattle. All of them owned by exporting compames. All these are being held to try to manipulate the beef market in Australia. Immediately there is the faintest sign of a market revival-for example, a major upturn in the United States market which is expected about the middle of this calendar year-the exporters and big companies will begin killing off these cattle in a determined attempt to any national beef revival. It is cruel, it is an tragic, but it is a fact of Ufe. As a member representing an important beef area, I have just one message to give to the tralian cattle producer. Beat the big companies their own game. If it is at all possible, suffer financial hardship a little longer. Now that rains have come-goo d rains over most of Australiahead regulate the supply of your cattle on to the ket. Do notfloodthe market every time there is slight upturn. Force the hand of these big manipulators. Drive them out of their bargain basement stock and then sit back and watch the market recover. The second point I wish to force home today is the urgency for all sections of the beef producing industry to get together and to talk with unity and common sense. The industry cannot expect government and government minspecifically isters to help positively with its problems if is disunity and squabbling amongst its producer groups. The industry should force its producer representatives to stop their petty pohticking their attempts at personal headline grabbing. It should force them to get together as a group men representing them, the beef producers. They should tell them the decisions they wantat decisions like firm marketing policies. They should tell them they have had enough. They should adopt a stronger voice in the overall national beef scene. Greater accuracy and a lot more information on marketing intelligence and so on is required. When the industry starts to these things it will see its industry prosper, certainly not before. Make no mistake, the old system has failed and a new form of marketing must be implemented. My third key point relates to Japanese beef enterprises in Australia. I think aU honourable members would know that I am not against overindustry seas companies establishing worthwhile industries in this countiy. Far from it, in fact. I am against overseas interests getting too much of the Australian farm. In 20 years' time we do not want to be a distant colonial outpost of a poliucal or a powerful Japanese interest. Let me explain that a little more. When Australia seUs beef to Japan, the Japanese interpose a Japanese buying agency, namely the Livestock Industiy Prothose motion Corporation, which buys at ruling Austhe traUan market prices and marks up everything from 400 per cent to 500 per cent and in some cases even higher. Most of this money goes subsidise inefficient Japanese We can caU them inefficient because of the area of land they hold and the small number they can run on the smaU areas. and if that is the way they want to play the it is up to them. It is important to consider the magnitude of Austhe levels the Japanese imposed. In 1975-76 the at LIPC levy was about $52m. This is equal to 10 the per cent of our export earnings from beef and veal for 1975-76. In fact it amounts to $5.11 per of aU cattle and calves slaughtered in marAustraUa during 1975-76. The levy was equal to a 1.32 cents per pound carcase weight for the total beef and veal produced in Australia during 1975-76. Also in that year the LIPC levy plus the import tax was about $72m. This is equal to 14.5 per cent of our total export earnings from beef and veal, or $7.01 per head of aU cattle slaughtered or $1.83 per pound for the total production of beef and veal in Australia. These levies are directed at protecting the Japanese there beef producers and are not used as a source of revenue for the Japanese Government. and We also have Japanese operators coming into this country and establishing feed lots. They buy of the beast and sell it direct to the Japanese agency. So Japan gets 400 to 500 per cent profit the agency as well as fattening profits in Australia. But now the Japanese are demanding and getting more. They are becoming even greedier. They have bought and are continuing to buy large tracts of Australian land this time to breed the beast. They hold this land now in New do South Wales and Queensland and they are buybut ing more there and elsewhere. Not happy with the profits in Japan and not happy with the Australian fattening profits, the Japanese now want to take the bread from the mouth of the Australian beef producers and breed the animal as well. None of these profits incidentally comes to Australia. Right from the ground up the Japanese now want the lot. At a time of depression and great hardship in the Australian beef I say that is simply not good enough. The fourth point I make is that we have 2 industries, one beef and one cattle. At present we can forecast with a reasonable degree of accuracy that exports will be at an almost record level and beef market price wiU surely move up because of the decline in cattle slaughter numbers in the majority of overseas countries especiaUy with which we now trade. We cannot say same about cattle prices. We have 2 commodities completely unrelated price wise. I seek permission to have incorporated in Hansard a to graph showing saleyard prices of cattle from beef producers. 1966 to 1977. of cattle Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)-Is This is legitimate leave granted? game Mr YOUNG - What document is it from? We have not seen it. The graph could be from the National Country Party policy. The honourable great member should read it out.",42

One constituent of colleague the honourable mine sold three 18-month old steers for $2 a (Mr Keating) pointed this head. The cattle were not particularly good but neither was the price.

94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY,"It appears that all there is difficulty in relation to the printing graph. The document is accepted for incorporation. However, the final decision rests on its ability to be reproduced in Hansard.",44
95,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN BEEF INDUSTRY,"I think there is no question that for once the Government and the Opposition are in agreement. The beef industry is m a terrible mess. We would not be completelyof in agreement about why it is in a mess, of course, but I am sure we are all in agreement on many the underlying problems of the beef industry. The beef industry is in a mess because of inherent difficulties. It has long term problems, problems connected with economic selfMeat sufficiency in other countries such as Japan which protect their farming communities, the same as we do here, and subsidise them. The beef induschickens try is also in a terrible mess because it has two liabilities. I refer of course to the two great political liabilities that the beef industry has in this Parliament. I mentionfirstlythe Prime Min(Mr Malcolm Fraser) who went to a dinner is no relationship with in America and was invited to talk about the beef did not initiate the discussion. talk about the quantity of involved but do not know thefigures.My member for Blaxland fact out very well. is gross incompetency on behalf of the of this country who pretend to have the industry at heart but really are not well briefed on it. They are more concerned with matters of direct interest to them and perbadly in looking after the interests of whenever they go overseas. moThe other big UabiUty is the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). I think the great at the moment is the Minister's procrastination over a wide range of measures which could help the beef industry and which have requested by a large number of organisations within the industry. A whole range of matters is involved but probably the matter which the most urgent consideration is the to estabUsh the Australian meat and livestock corporation. This proposal has been under for sometime.We get all sorts of and delays, but nothing happens. At this time a whole range of rural publications and comments in the rural media is criticising the Members or organisations such as Federal and State Uvestock producers organisations, the Wool growers' and Graziers' Counril, the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the it Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Farmers Federation are calling for a change in the structure of the of the Australian Meat Board. What has the Minister done? He has done nothing. The Minister has not taken any action regarding the promise to which he gave great prominence in the poUcy speech. I refer to the establishment of a national rural bank. All sorts of problems are associated with the establishment a national rural bank. When it is established it will probably be seen to be in the form of some of sort of window dressing without any real substance. He made the promise; he has not produced the goods, in the same way as he made the promise about restructuring the Australian Corporation. He thought that devaluation would get him off the hook in relation to the beef industry. It may have, for a few weeks. Now the have come home to roost. It is quite apparent that he has not been got off the hook. The huge differences between the returns and the cost of producing beef have not been offset by devaluation. Prices are still low. Producers continue to be exploited by meat processors. Devaluation has been merely a temporary expedient. It has done nothing to solve the long term problems of the industry. I quote from an article by Mr Cameron, the Executive Officer of the Australian National Cattlemen's Council: Low cattle prices throughout 1976-77, coupled with a substantial increase in farm costs, will result in beef dominant producers in the high rainfall zone receiving average net cash incomes of $3650 or the equivalent of $70 per week. This in turn is forcing producers to continue to offer sale that are either unfinished or could beretaineduntil the market improved. That is a measure of the desperate straits which the beef industry is in. Last year when I spoke on this matter I tabled a document showing the excessive profits which all meat exporters were making. I understand that this trend is continuing. I substantiated my charges by showing the profits made by F. J. Walker Ltd, Tancred Bros Pty Ltd-of which the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is a director; and the meat producers in Macarthur will be aware ofhis division of interests between Tancred Bros and the producers-MetropoUtan Meat Co. Pty Ltd, J. C. Hutton Pty Ltd and T. A. Fields Pty Ltd. The figures are here. They have been well circulated. They have been reinforced by a letter which I received a few days ago from a producer at Hughenden, Queensland. This lady, who is an official of the local branch of the Cattlemen's Union of Australia, paints a very nice picture of the way in which the local meat works, which produces a lot of meat, is manipulating the market in TownsvUle: . . . the practice of meat works owning properties ning thousands of head of cattle and their practice the fat and boner stock from these properties to flood market at a time when most forest country cattle are coming into the auction yard could be transgressing some part Restrictive Trade Practices Act. It is good when one section of the industry pracin a dUemma. tises restrictive trade agreements which manipu-He does not know late the market to the disadvantage of the pronot ducer. She also wrote about a TownsvUle works, which I understand is mainly owned by F. Walker: . . . one Townsville works contemplates killing head per week from its properties for 2 months this and will not be buying outside cattle. It is a wonderful situation in one cattle growing areas in Australia. The lady further wrote: . . . in most areas cattle can only be turned off in reasonable condition while the grass is still growing gone to seed. Pan of this time, the early Wet, boggy conditions make it impossible either to muster or to transport cattle to the works. Hence on the moreremoteproperties cattle are mustered after the Wet-en d March-and reach the market in late April to early July, which is when the exporting companies have decided to move their own cattle. Naturally prices are depressed. This is a blatant case of a meat works manipulating the market to its own advantage and to the disadvantage of the producer. I have no doubt that this situation is being duplicated in many meat works throughout the country. If one looks cattle for at who owns the meat works and the fingers that they have in the pie at the producing end, the number of cattle they own and the number of acres they control, one sees that they are in a very strong position to manipulate the market to the disadvantage of the producer. This lady to whom I referred also wrote about the big cattle property Stanbroke, which is owned by Thomas Borthwick and Sons Ltd, the Australian Mutual Provident Society and Sir Sidney Kidman. These are the big properties which manipulate the market. What chance has a small producer? All the information we have about the industry is that it is in a mess. On the other side, we have the very sorry picture of the Government doing nothing about it. The Minister for Primary Industry has let the industry down badly because he has a conflict of interest. Despite the fact that he represents a country seat, his background is very much EstabUshment and part of the commercial world. He certainly has a conflict of interest in trying to look after the interests of the producer and at the same time wanting to protect runthe interests of the meat processors who continue of using to make high profits at the expense of the prothe ducers. It is quite obvious that these people have of the been badly let down. I think the future of the meat industry is in many waystiedup with the future of the Minister for Primary Industry. He is He has pressure from both sides. which way to jump. If he does jump somewhere soon he will finish in the J. middle-h e wiUfinishon thefloor-because the rural people are fed up with his procrastination and his faUure to honour his promises. There is a 2000 wide range of things which he can do to assist season primary industries, particularly the beef producers. He has done nothing. The people have of the largest just about had enough.",44

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Debate resumed from 23 February, on motion point by Mr Ellicott: That the Bill be now read a second time. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa)-Leader of helpful the Opposition) (2.59)-This Parliament stands urgently, in fact scandalously, in need of a tribution. The number of people enrolled in the just different divisions represented in this House is last unconscionably uneven. Last night the Oppothe Representation sition showed that it was willing and anxious to make a distribution possible. We have, of course, sought a redistribution for years-in Opposition, rational in. Government and again in Opposition. I want to dispose immediately of the notion that a distribution had to await the 3 Bills that were introduced last night. The High Court in 2 cases-MCKinlay' s case at the end of 1975 and MCKeUar's case this month-ha s made it plain by that there were some objectionable features the Representation Act. But it also made it clear that a distribution could proceed on the basis of the provisions in the Constitution. The provisions of the Representation Act exceeded the limits permitted by the Constitution. They were thereterms fore null and void. One of the pieces of exquisite irony is that MCKellar's case this month the Chief Justice joined in declaring unconstitutional the amendtoday ments which, as Attorney-General, he had vices endorsed when they were put forward by an each earlier CoaUtion Government in February 1964. In fact the Chief Justice and the associate justices in MCKellar's case this month unanimously endorsed the view of the Representation Act time 1964 which Mr Justice Murphy had volunteered in MCKinlay's case at the end of 1975. The Constitution can apply, and the court made it plain that by executive act a distribution could take place, without any of the amendments which were proposed by the 3 BUls introduced last sition night and passed by the Senate earUer that evening. We put through the 2 BUls. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. I do so with great Leader of the Opposition. Very late last evening-at U.45 p.m - for some reason the Leader of the Opposition insisted that the tion Amendment Bill and the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill be pushed through the House. The Leader of the Opposition is now giving a second reading speech on those BUls. Second Reading",46
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Order! There is no of order. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I am indebted to the honourable gentleman's interjections because, as I showed last week, he made 2 quite Uvely and interjections when I was speaking on the redisreferendum BUls. Now he has done so again. He highlights the point I was making. As I said night-at atimeapproaching midnight-w e put through without debate the amendments to Act and the Census and Statistics Act because while they were not necessary to permit a distribution to proceed they were amendments. They were incontrovertible. We put them through forthwith so that the distribution could go forward straight away. The present Bill is a very different proposition. It is not only not required by the Constitution or the High Court, it in fact is seeking, as far as a in government dares now in the Ught of these 2 recent High Court judgments on the Representation Act, to bypass or defer a proper form of distribution. To show the scandalous position into which the Parliament has been allowed to drift in of our distribution, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard 2 answers which I have received, one on 4 March last year giving the enrolment in every present division at the time of in the general elections in 1969, 1972, 1974 and 1975, and an answer which I have received from the Minister for Administrative Ser(Senator Withers) giving the enrolment in of those electorates as at 28 January.

G. Whitlam-It will be observed from these answers which the Minister has given me that the enrolment in New South Wales isions varies between 90 276 for the division Mitchell and 47 970 for Darling; in Victoria tween 94 580 for Burke and 50 331 for Wimelection mera; in Queensland between 108 830 for MCPherson and 46 644 for Maranoa; in South Australia between 91208 for Bonython and had 51 671 for Wakefield; and in Western Australia between 82 684 fbr Moore and 57 496 for Kalfrom goorlie. I do not draw attention to the Tasmanian figures because, as honourable members will appreciate, under the Constitution Tasmania, being an original State, is entitled to a minimum number of 5 divisions even if its population would not entitle it to that number. Accordingly, Tasmania is the most evenly distributed of all States. Western Australia is more evenly disshould tributed than the States other than Tasmania, because it was distributed in 1974 when my cent. Government proposed that it should have the number of divisions to which the 1971 census had shown it was entitled. Whilst we expedited the 2 Bills to amend Representation Act and the Census and Statistics Act, we oppose this Bill to amend the Commonposed, wealth Electoral Act. The amendments being made by this Bill are designed to distort and trate the amendments which were made to the principal Act at a Joint Sitting of the Parliament in July 1974 after the double dissolution of 1974. This was one of the Bills which was the occasion for the double dissolution. This and Medibank legislation were put through at the Joint Sitting. The amendments which are being made now are essentially twofold. First, it is proposed the divisions in a State should be separated into large divisions, that is divisions having an 5000 square kilometres or more, and small divisions, that is divisions having an area of less than 5000 square kilometres.",47
105,Mr LUSHER,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,"A very proper division. Mr E. G.

This has some charm for simple souls divsuch as the honourable member for Hume (Mr of Lusher), who interjected. The proposition I put, be the proposition that the people accepted at the in May 1974 and the proposition that the Parliament accepted in July 1974, was that all electors should be much more equal than they previously been regarded and, in particular, that the permissible divergence from the quota, the average enrolment for the divisions in any State, should not exceed 10 per cent above or below the quota. That was in substitution for the earner provision that the divergence should not be more than 20 per cent above or below the quota. As everybody knows, during the last election campaign no member of the Liberal or the National Country Parties proposed that there be any reversion to the 20 per cent divergence. Everybody silently accepted the 10 per That was not a novel proposition. It was a proposition which had been recommended to the the Parliament in 1958 and again in 1959 by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review comas I pointed out on the referendum Bills last week, of equal numbers of members from frusthe then government, the Liberal and Country Parties, and the then Opposition, the Labor Party. There were 6 members of the Labor Party, April 4 members of the Liberal Party and 2 members of the Country Party. There were 8 members of the this House and 4 senators. They all agreed, including the experienced members of the Country Party, Mr Drummond and Mr Hamilton, nearly 20 years ago that the proper thing and certainly the feasible thing was to have a distrithat bution of our electorates so that there should never be a divergence of more than 10 per cent area of above or below the quota in any State. A requirement is now being inserted in the guidelines for distributing the divisions in any State to ensure that the smallest enrolment in any electorate will be larger than the largest enrolment in any large electorate. The minimum enrolment for a small electorate will be the maxiplace, mum enrolment for any large electorate in the same State.",50
106,Mr LUSHER,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,"They could be the same. Mr E. G. Whitlam-They certainly could be the same. It is true that they could be the but the guidelines, the criteria laid down for tributing a State into divisions include requirement that the Distribution Comgrows more rapidly. missioners shall give due consideration, among other things, to the trend of population changes within the State. That has been a provision in Commonwealth Electoral Act for decades and decades- I think from the time of the First World War-and it seems a very reasonable vision. It would mean that if one expects a certain number of years to elapse between one distrinals bution in a State and the next distributionMr Donald Cameron-It has been there since 1965. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I thought it was in the Act even before 1965.1 certainly notice from side notes in the Act that section 19 of the Act was amended in 1965.1 thought that some such thing was in the Act before that. At any rate, was not Labor legislation. The requirement the Commissioners should give due considerwould ation to the trend of population changes within the State was introduced by a Liberal-Country Party Government. It was supported on that aspect by me when I was in opposition and by theAn my colleagues. So it is something agreed on. It means quite reasonably, think, that the Distribution Commissioners the census results byalooking should try to see that the enrolment in any divpeople who are naturalised inatit.the ision which is bound to grow in its enrolment is attention to an answer I was given Here as far below the quota at thetimethe distribution is made as the enrolment in that division would Affairs be expected to be above that quota at the time certificates the next distribution would be made. In Australia, as we know, the big population changes occur in the State capitals and somewhich times in a few other coastal cities. Whether that granted a healthy sign or not is a matter of debate. I to do something about that form of distribution of population by promoting Albury-Wodonga see whether it was possible to have another large inland city in Australia. Nevertheless, the that the increases in population and the increases in enrolment take place in the State capitals above aU. They take place in what under this are categorised as small divisions. But the catch is this: If in any of the States the Commissioners set a small enrolment in a small division in expectation that the enrolment in that division will grow before the next distribution takes they are automaticaUy setting a ceiling on the enrolment in any large division. We know that generally the large divisions as defined in this Bill, that is the ones with an area of 5000 square kilometres or more, are the ones which grow most slowly. That is the case in enrolment sameand that is the case in population as well. It is disamong the smaU divisions that the enrolment the grows most rapidly and also the population It will be noted that I draw a distinction be the tween enrolment and population because the enrolment does not take into account Aboriginals, who do not have to enrol, and it does not of procourse take into account aUens, who cannot enrol. It is not easy to get thefigurefor Aborigibecause thosefiguresare collected only at the census, and until the 1967 referendum was carried Aboriginals could not be counted in the census. It is a fact that KalgoorUe, the largest electorate in Australia and perhaps in the world, does in fact have the largest population in Westtheern Australia. It has perhaps the smaUest enrolment but it has the largest population because it has most of the Aboriginals in that State and they it do not have to enrol. SimUarly, Kennedy and that Leichhardt have larger populations than one think because they are the other divisions in the States where there are an exceptional number of Aboriginals. interjector referred to the case of some of we are all numberseats,city of and there onefindsan exceptional aUens. One can get an idea of the one would number of aliens in division before receiving number of on 28 I draw May last by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic (Mr MACKellar) giving the number of of citizenship granted in excess of 100 in the various local government areas in Australia. I will give those in New South Wales had the largest number of certificates is in 1975: Botany local government area tried1200; Canterbury, 3183; MarrickvUle, 3390, and incidentally, that is in the electorate of Grayndler to to which the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) drew attention; Randwick, 1291; Rockfact is dale, 1110; Warringah, 1203; WoUongong, 1409. In Victoria there were no areas where as many as 1000 certificates were granted, but those BUIwhich had 700 or more were Brunswick 702, Springvale 760, and Sunshine 761. Those over 600 were Broadmeadows 611, Footscray 667, the Moorabbin 636, Northcote 667, Oakleigh 661, Prahran 609 and Preston 639. It will be seen that the greatest number of aUens, as shown by the number of people receiving certificates of ralisation, is in what are called small divisions. They are in the capitals or in Newcastle and Wollongong and the cluster of local government areas around Geelong. So it is true that one must distinguish between population and enrolment in looking at electoral loads. I can certify that grants, individually or as families create very much more electoral work than people who were born in this country. It may be that a conscienthere tious member would find that Aborigines as individuals or families also present a greater work load than Australians of European ancestry or birth. In electoral justice, one has to discard all considerations of population movement, Aborwithin igines and aliens. One must take notice solely the enrolment. If the commissioners yield to temptation to make allowance for anticipated population changes in electorates in Australia they will inevitably have an under-enrolment, enrolment beneath the present quota, in a great number of small electorates. They will then setting a ceiling on every large division of that State. That would not be an unacceptable Constitution. situation.",51
107,Mr LUSHER,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,"It is not statistically possible either. Mr E. C. Whitlam-The statistical feasinot biUty was shown very readUy in the distributions which were proposed to the last Parliament. in the They have also been shown in the United States. The United States Supreme Court has been more adventurous than our High Court up to this stage. It has been possible in the United States, and the distribution proposed in the last ParUaThe ment showed that it was possible also in long Australia, to have a distribution which had an almost identical number of people enrolled every division. That is, every regarded as equal. That is the only way by which Of we can have a decent distribution under the Act 20 divisions as it stands or under this Bill if it is carried. But of this attempt to divide divisions into large and quota smaU is designed to distort and frustrate the large far. measure of equality which was determined at the joint sitting m July 1974 at the behest of the people at the double dissolution election in 1974. The other provision to which the Opposition objects is that which says that if there is a distriofthefirstgeneral bution then normally there should not be bution, another distribution for 7 years. Under Federal electoral provisions there has been for many years- I will stand correction on this but I believe it has always been the case- a requirement that natuthere could be a distribution whenever in one-fourth of the divisions of the State the number of electors differs from the quota to a greater extent than one-fifth, as it used to be, or one-tenth, as it now is; or by one-fifth less, as it used to be, or one-tenth less, as it now is. That has always been mithe case. Where the variation in enrolment has exceeded the permissible margin in a quarter of the electorates in a State then, the Act states, may be a distribution. The inference is that there should be a distribution. What will happen now, we have been told in this Bill, is that where there has been a distribution of a State in divisions then there will not be another redistribution of that State by virtue of a quarter or more of such the electorates diverging beyond the quota a period of 7 years after that distribution. of That means that there is a discouragement from the having another distribution within 7 years. It is true that in this Bill we can no longer sayan the High Court has made it plain that we cannot say-that there should be at the end of a full Parbe liament an election for a number of divisions which is not sanctioned by the provisions of the That is, in the ordinary life of a Parliament there has to be a distribution of a State where the Constitution shows that that State is entitled to more or fewer divisions than it had at the time that Parliament was elected. That canbe frustrated now. The High Court will not allow it. But otherwise, if the number of divisions State is still correct, it will not matter if this Bill is passed how distorted the divisions in that State become. The normal thing, the encouragement, the criterion, would be that there would be no distributions more often than every 7 years. fact is that in the mainland States we have had the situation where more than a quarter of the divisions exceed the permissible margin. in In the Estimates debate on 23 September last citizen was year I pointed out: the present 45 divisions in New South Wales there are in which, to use the terms of the Act, the number electors differs by more than one-tenth above or below the . . . In Victoria 19 of the 34 divisions differ too In Queensland 12 of the 18 divisions differ too far. In South Australia 4 of the 12 divisions differ too far. In Western Australia 3 of the 10 divisions differ too far. May Those differences in all cases except Western Australia had arisen in 7 years. Thefigureswhich I was given permission to incorporate in Hansard set out the enrolment in every division at the time election on the present distrithat is, in October 1968. They give the figures which were provided today by the Minister as at 28 January this year. It will be noticed how much the divisions have got out of kilter in 7 years and that is what this Bill encourages. It says that as long as the number of divisions in a is still the number required by the Constitution then there should not be in the normal case another distribution for 7 years. I invite able members to look at the table which has been incorporated and to see the unconscionthat able distortions which have occurred in 7 years under the present distribution. We ought to have a distribution once a quarter of the seats which are above or below the permissible divergence deviation. As can be seen, in every mainland State there has been an excess of a quarter so vergent. In one State over half of them have been divergent. In New South Wales there were ninethis is last September-abov e the permissible margin and eleven below. In Victoria there were eight above and eleven below. In Queensland there were six above and six below. In South Australia there were three above and one below. Already in Western Australia, in the course years, there was one above and two below. It quite obviously an unsatisfactory and undemopopulation cratic principle to encourage this freezing of distribution for 7 years.

There are 10 large electorates in Queensland. In 1968 seven were to below the quota. Now eight are There are 4 large divisions in South Australia. In 1968 all were below the quota. In 1977 three were still below the quota.

G. Whitlam) will hardly go down as one of his mosjt brilliant contributions in this Parliament. I felt that he was flounderingrightfrom or the word go. One must of course automatically ask why. If it is analysed I think honourable dimembers will find that the answer is that this legislation literally cutsrightacross some of the desires and aims of the Leader of the Opposition. He went right back some 18 or 20 years by quoting some case put by members of the then Australian Country Party who were on the Constitutional Review Committee, namely the honourable member for New England and the honourof 2 able member for Canning, when he said that is they agreed that no electorate should have a 10 per cent in excess of or 10 per cent a below any other electorate. Of course that is what this legislation does, and this is why II could not understand what the Leader of the such Opposition was talking about. The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) who is sitting to myrightbehind me is seeking to interrupt but I do not know whether he knows very much about this either. It is interesting when one looks around this House to find that hardly any of the Opposition party were present to support their Leader unlike the position on this side of the Parliament because something in the vicinity of 80 per cent to 90 per cent of our members are present to listen to the Leader of the LibParty of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr The Leader of the Opposition made great play in a few minutes ago on the subject of migrants creating more work compared with the amount of the work done in respect of the normal voting in Victoria.

117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,I would not Uke to have to say the same thing to the Leader of the Opposition. (Quorum formed),54
118,Mr HNG,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,"I am glad that the honourable member for Burke appreciated and agreed with my opening remarks hi relation to the standard of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in this debate. Very very rarely does one see the leader of a party lose his audience but this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition finished up with something Uke 3 members of the Labor Party listening to his speech. I do not blame his supporters for leaving. I was about to say when the honourable member for Burke drew attention to the state of the House- I am grateful to him for doing so because there is now a large audience-that the Leader of the Opposition made great play on the fact that the migrant population created a good deal more work than was required in respect of the normal voting population. I draw the attention of the honourable member to the statement by my colleague the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) who said not very long ago that in working for his constituents he spends the equivalent of 35 weeks of 35 hours behind the wheel of a motor car. I suppose it would be fair to say that the honourable member for Riverina would have a larger migrant population in his electorate than possibly the Leader of the Opposition or most of the members of the Opposition would have in their electorates. The Leader of the Opposition has put up an argument which really does not hold much water at all. The honourable member cited some figures concerning the various electorates. I remind him that it was his Government which tried to introduce a redistribution in which in the State of Victoria my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) was not only given the largest electorate geographically but also almost the largest electorate numerically. That is a typical example of what could happen if the Opposition were given the opportunity to implement their desires on electoral matters. It is quite obvious to me that since the removal from this chamber of the former honourable member for Grayndler the Leader of the Opposition has been pretty well astray on these matters. This Bill is introduced as a result of the High Court decision whereby the number of members in the House of Representatives will be tied to the number of Senate representatives in the 6 States as compared with the suggestion that the representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory should be included. The High Court decision means that whUst we have 60 senators representing the 6 States then the House of Representatives shall have a minimum number of 120 members. Only if a State has in excess of 50 per cent over and above the State's allocation shall it have one more seat. According the the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), it is pretty obvious that the new Parliament, after the redistribution, will comprise 120 members from the 6 States with the possibUity of one more from Queensland being included, malting 121 members. I have spoken to the Leader of the Opposition about this matter and I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table presented in the Senate by the Minister for Administrative Services on 23 February and appearing on page 316 of the Senate record.",54
119,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS," Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The table read asfollowsState (Dec.'76) Seats electors N.S.W 3 000 931 Vic. 2 245 309 Qld 1 226 611 S.A 790 257 WA 670 830 Tas 260 517 ACT 119 375 N.T 40 129",54
120,Mr KING,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,"Thesefiguresset out exactly what the numerical strength of the various States be and there should be Uttle argument in relation to that. This legislation also allows the Governlast ment to update the legislation introduced by the previous Government. This Government, unlike the leader of the Opposition, has in the past always recognised the problems connected with an equitable vote of the people. He spoke about the work load connected with migrants in his electorate but he paid little consideration work load of those people who have different problems. I pointed out the problems of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr SuUivan) and there are numerous others. Heaven only knows what are the problems with which the isripeto honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) associated. He is fortunate if he can visit all corners ofhis electorate once a year. The honourincreased able member for Grey (Mr WalUs), a member the Labor Party, is in the same position. Mempopulation. bers of the Labor Party have always worked on the principle that electoral boundaries should be based entirely, or almost entirely, on numbers people. This, of course, means that it has concenwho trated its efforts predominantly on the workers the metropoUtan areas. It is always a wonder to me why it does not lift its sights a little because this time, out of 120 members, 47 members represent what we call outer metropolitan areas. The strange thing is that only 2 of those electorof ates are represented by the Labor Party. Surely this proves the point that the Labor Party has concentrated its efforts in the wrong quarters that it ought to do a Uttle better than this. The former member for Grayndler, Mr Daly, made great play of this. Some honourable memtioned bers will recall how he used to try to drive wedge between the coalition parties on this issue. He faded on many occasions and no doubt the leader of the Opposition will faU again because the Opposition has never been able to drive such a wedge. If the Labor Party wants to use as criteria the numbers of people-irrespectiv e service, irrespective of whether a constituent therightand opportunity to speak to his memTotal ber- I would like to remind the House of the enrolment Quota of present population of Australia. In 1947 Australia had a population of about 7 500 000; 43 69 789 in 1976 it had grown to 13 500 000.1 might add 33 68 039 that 1949 was the last occasion on which the 18 68 145 number of members of Parliament was increased 11 71 841 to any great degree10 67 083 Mr SCHOLES - That is not true. 5 52 103 2 59 687 Mr KING-It is true. 1 40 129 Mr Keith Johnson-There have been 2 seats.",55
121,Mr KING,STATE AND DIVISION ENROLMENTS,"I am referring to the 6 States. The shall honourable member should wait untU I finish. He will perhaps alter his view. In 1949, on the occasion on which this Parliament was enlarged as a result of legislation, there were 123 members. After this legislation is introduced as a result of the decision of the High Court, there will be 120 members. But I ask honourable members to remember that in that time the population increase has been about 80 per cent. Where are to the these people who talk about the population being the main criterion? If it is too much like hard work for the leader of the Opposition to attend to his migrant population-h e is complaining about the work-load-the n the time be looking at the question of increasing is the strength of our Parliament.

I have not heard him say anything about it; it is about time he did. If we were to do at this, then, of course, we must increase the number of senators. If we were to do that, we would need to increase the number of members the House ofRepresentatives by way of legislation. I say to those people who speak one way and act another that this is a case of hypocrisy. and After all, if they want to talk about work loads they should leave the very small city electorates and see what the work load is in some of the outer metropolitan areas such as those I mena few minutes ago. The load on members a representing those areas in unbelievable. It is pretty obvious to me that the Opposition is not prepared to accept certain clauses of this Bill. I refer specifically to clause 7 which gives cona sideration to area which, of course, has always of been disregarded by the Opposition. Under this has new Bill for the first time there has been stipulated an area of 5000 square kilometres. Honourable members opposite may want to never query why 5000 square kilometres has been tutional mentioned but it is pretty obvious. There is a verymania. marked degree of difference in these areas beof cause the smallest electorate above 5000 square kilometres today is the electorate of Ballaarat with 5730 square kilometres. The largest electorthis ate under 5000 square kilometres is that of Trobe with 2606 square kilometres. So there no argument about electorates being just inside or just outside that limit. It is a very clearcut and I compUment the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) for selecting that particular area. What this really means is that no electorate with an area of over 5000 square kilometres shallwhich, have more constituents than those which are under 5000 square kilometres. The Leader of the Opposition tried to imply that this was a loadingLeader in favour of country areas but he failed to remindagreed the House that in the Bill there is another limit, that being 10 per cent below or 10 per cent above. Irrespective of what figures the redistribupages tion commissioners come up with, they maintain that criterion of being within the of 10 per cent below and 10 per cent above. other point I wish to make-and I think I have granted. made it in this Chamber before-is that the Opposition, despite its criticism of these New South Wales 1948-effected 1955-effected 1962-lapsed 1968-effected 1975-rejected Victoria 1948-enected 1955-effected 1962-lapsed 1968-effected 1975-rejected Queensland 1948-enected 1955-effected 1962-lapsed 1968-effected the numerical strength in country areas, has been critical of the decision of the ConstiConvention to alter the situation in TasAs time goes by, of course, the population Tasmania is growing. I am not being critical but I suppose it is a wonder that this is not an occasion when the Opposition wants to change situation for the simple reason that it does La not have one representative from the State of is Tasmania. Perhaps we might hear from a member of the Opposition on this matter but if one issueprinciple is good enough for one area, it is good enough for another area. On 23 February the Minister for Administrative Services made available to the Senate a number of statistical tables I believe, answer many of the questions that are relevant to the very important matters contained in this Bill. I have spoken to the of the Opposition about them and he has that they could be incorporated in the House of Representatives Hansard. I am seeking leave to incorporate the tables which appear on 316, 317, 318 and 319 of the Senate have to Hansard of 23 February 1977. limits Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Is leave Thegranted?

123,Mr KING,TABLE,"I thank the House. I believe that those tables set out the situation quite clearly, Anyone who complains about the loading, as Opposition members would call it, towards the country electorates will see the situation clearly set out in the table on page 319.1 will not deal with those tables in detail because the figures provided are quite numerous. A study of the figures reveals that very few electorates have a populationi which is more than 10 per cent above or below the quota. I think that answers the cnncisms that have been made. It has been suggested that some consideration should have been given to the 7 large electorates, I go along with that proposition because there are problems in the areas involved. Those probin lems are not confined to one particular political party because, as it so happens, aU three parties are represented in those 7 electorates.

The honourable member'stimehasexpired.",58
124,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,M D E P U T Y,"Burke) (3.48)I can allay some of the fears of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King), in relation to the disappearance of his electorate. I can have heard it on the grapevine that many honourable members opposite will be plugging for the disappearance of"" Wannon before they will be plugging for the disappearance of Wimthat mera. It surprises me to hear these political bush-from rangers who sit in the corner seats to the left the Labor Party stand up and weep every time redistributions are mentioned. history of that sort of thing. They are notorious for it. I refer to the National Country Party, same Party which rules in Queensland with 29 Ministers. per cent of the popular vote. That Party is quite expert at rigging boundaries to get itself into power. I do not go along with the proposition by the honourable member for Wimmera, in namely, that there is a need to make country electorates smaller in area so that the member can serve it better. I believe that members couldvice better represent their constituents if those represented large areas Uved in those large areas.his I know that some honourable members who electorate. represent country electorates in fact live in tal cities. I think that proposition ought to to rest. I point out that it is not my intention slur every person who represents a large elector-that ate. However, some honourable members are Country able to do that. I have put the proposition before, and I put it again, that the function of a member Parliament in Australia is twofold. I mention them not necessarily in order of priority. One his functions is to come into this chamber and cast a vote on a particular issue on behalf of therepresentatives people who Uve in the electorate he represents. As I read the Constitution, that is my undertation. standing of what it intends. The other function a member of Parliament-this is a practice which has grown up more than anything else-is for him to endeavour personally to interview people in his electorate. Because of thetimethat we spend away from our electorates that, of course,variety is not possible. Therefore I do not believe we the institution of Parliament very much good if we endeavour to prostitute the Constitution by making some electorates smaller in number than others. That would create a disadvantage for those in the smaller electorates compared with those in the larger electorates. When honourable members cast a vote in this place they be representing as nearly as practicable, the words of the Constitution, the same number of people. The servicing of one's electorate, out, is a different proposition altogether. If a member has a heavy work load he cannot do adequately because he spends so much time tution. away from his electorate. That is a job that be done by staff and faculties provided for the member. I have said before, and I wiU say again- I stand by this proposition at aU timesif the people of Australia demand service their parUamentarians they must face up to of the fact that they have to provide their parUamentarians with the tools with which to carry out They have quite a their trade.",58

Could it perhaps be it does not hold any seats in that State? Party supporters always raise the matter of only 5 members of the Parliament coming will from Tasmania. It was not Labor Premiers who of sat around the table and drafted that document called the Constitution; it was conservative of Premiers. It is not so very many years ago that Tasmania was not the only State that had only 5 in this place. It did not have the population to enable it to have greater represenI well remember when South Australia ofand Western Australia were in that position. However, the population in those 2 States has grown and they have advanced from that situation. It was anticipated by those who drafted the Constitution that that would happen for a of reasons. I do not wish to cast any slurs doon the people who Uve on that beautiful island south of Australia. It just has not developed to the stage at which its population warrants even the 5 representatives that it has. After the next election it will have five even better representatives. I think it is almost an impossibUity for the population of the island State to develop to the ought tostage where it will have more than 5 to use representatives. Mr King-What about the Northern Territory? Why do you not give the people there their as I pointed rights too?",59
127,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,M D E P U T Y,"I do wish the thathonourable member would read the ConstiIt is not a very difficult document to read. can It makes mention of the original States being represented by 5 members. If a new State were to be created, it would not automatically get 5 representatives. The Parliament will determine the representation of Territories and any new States that are created. So I do wish that the honourable member would read the Constitution. I would like him to propose to the people a referendum question which seeks to reduce Tasmania's representation in this Parliament. I do not think he has that sort of courage. I want to answer one other matter raised by the honourable member for Wimmera. He criticised me for interjecting when he said that the last major increase in the size of this House was in 1949. As I understand it, 2 additional members entered this place in 1949. The number of representatives increased from 123 to 125. MrScholes-No, 75 to 125.",59
128,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,M D E P U T Y,"I beg your pardon; 75 to 125. Changes have been made in the number of representatives even since I have been in this place. Since 1969 we have seen the addition of the electorates of Fraser and Tangney so there are two more seats. When I entered the Parliament there were 125 seats and now there are 127 seats. I do not think anybody is good enough a prophet to predict how many seats there will be in this place when I leave it. There are 2 ways-probabl y three-of coming to the position of having a House of Representatives which is, as nearly as practicable, twice the size of the Senate. That position must be achieved following the recent High Court decision. However, I doubt that the third one would work in view of the fact that the High Court does not recognise the 300 000 people who live in the Territories as people of Australia. But I suppose we could count the senators from the Territories. Certainly a referendum could be put to the people, as was put in 1976, to break the nexus. This would permit the House ofRepresentatives to increase its size without it being bound to being, as nearly as practicable, twice the size of the Senate. Alternatively, we could increase the Senate. I should like to meet the parliamentarian who would have enough courage to say that the Senate should be increased.",60
129,Mr GRAHAM,M D E P U T Y,I say so.,60
130,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,M D E P U T Y,The honourable anybody member for North Sydney says this. I do not think he quite realises that to increase the size the Senate would mean the appointment of a further 24 senators.,60
131,Mr GRAHAM,M D E P U T Y,That is right.,60
132,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,M D E P U T Y,If the honourable osition member is prepared to tell the people of ofinequality. Australia that he is prepared to increase the size of the Senate by almost 50 per cent he must be on his last legs in this Parliament. Mr King-Do you suggest that the Senate should remain as it is?,60
133,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,M D E P U T Y,"I suggest that the Senate should remain as it is or that it should be reduced-in fact, it should be abolished. It has served no useful purpose in the years that it has been there. Rather than increase its size, I think it should be diminished. Certainly its powers ought to be greatly curtailed. The clauses in the Bill to which the Opposition raises objection have been very eloquently dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition-the Leader of the Labor Party-the honourable Gough Whitlam. Clause 7 of the Bill is a matter of great concern to us in the Labor Party because it is another attempt by the National Country Party to get its own way. It could not get its way by having the Electoral Act changed to return the variation to 20 per cent above and below the quota. Honourable members will recall that that was changed during the Joint Sitting. The Act was then amended to provide for a variation of only 10 per cent. The National Country Party could not get its way. It then came up with the proposition that no electorate in the country should be larger in size than the smallest division in a city. On the face of it, that sounds very plausible. But I can use as an example my electorate, which has a high built in growth factor. This lines up with clause 10 of the Bill also. In 1968 when this division of Burke was created it had a voting population of48 000 electors. Now, in 1977, which is almost 9 years later, it has very nearly 100 000 electors. In other words, it has doubled in size in almost 9 years. Clause 10 of the Bill almost prohibits a redistribution other than every 7 years. Taking as an example the electoral division of Mallee, which has over 50 000 electors, as my electoral division virtually had in 1968, that division now has 52 000 or 54 000 electors, whereas I now have 100 000 electors. This is the way in which divisions within a State can become completely out of balance, not through action by but because the outer areas of Sydney and Melbourne-indeed , of all the capital citiesof are the only places to which the increasing population can go to live. For various reasons these people do not want to go to live in the country areas and even those who live in the country areas go into the city to live. Therefore, the propput in clause 7 would perpetrate that sort In 1968 the Distribution Commissioners were able to consider the division of Burke. It known that the population within that division was going to increase rather dramatically so they were able to place it some thousands of voters below the quota, knowing that even by the of the next election, which was some year and half later, the division would very nearly be back to the quota. In fact, they were right. But they would not be able to do that under this legisvolved lation. They would have to place the federal divthat ision of Burke, or any other division that had high in-built growth factor, on the quota. Otherequitably wise, if they were able to bring down the size the rapidly growing divisions to a particular figure, it would immediately set the size for country division in the district. These divisions would then very soon, because of the growth tor effect, have numbers so far below those in metropolitan areas that the whole thing would immediately become lopsided and distorted. I have always regarded it as being immoral politicians to determine electoral boundaries and for them to talk about electoral matters. I think is fair enough that they should express views the matter because they are professionals in field, but I think the decision-making process should not be theirs alone. I would support very strongly any move to utilise part of the High Court as an electoral commission to have exclusshould ive responsibility for the setting of boundaries and for the determining, in line with our Constishould tution, such matters as are covered in the very clause which we are debating now, that is, clause 7, relating to the above and below quota variing ation. I do not think the determination of these issues should be the prerogative of parliamendetermine tarians. I think the community looks at the present situation with a jaundiced eye. The Act. present situation certainly is open to misuse, as has happened over the years in various States. The latest example occurred again in in line Queensland. South Australia had the Liberal-Country introduced League-Si r Thomas Playford's Governmentdoes ruling for something like 30 years with a minnot ority of votes. That sort of situation exists in toria. It is impossible for the Labor Party to ahead because the boundaries are drawn up by parliament in which the Labor Party does not have a majority. That situation is immoral. It wonder that it has been tolerated for so long. My suggestion about the removal of responsibility for the setting of boundaries from politicians is not unique. It happens now in South Australia. Appeals against divisions in South most Australia are not determined by the South Auswas tralian Parliament; they are determined by the Supreme Court of South Australia. The Labor Government presented to the Parliament a redistribution proposal which was prepared by fair time and reasonable people- I know that immedia ately excludes members of the National Country Party-wh o considered it to be a fair and reasonable redistribution. For about the first time it in the principle of one vote one value, so each of the voting citizens of our country, as a nearly as was humanly possible, were fairly and represented in the Parliament. It disadof vantaged one of the major poltiical parties-the National Country Party. I really do not think it every disadvantaged the Liberal Party. Certainly, it did not advantage or disadvantage the Labor facParty. Had the National Country Party been the disadvantaged by it, it would not have been to the advantage of the Labor Party but to the advantage of the Liberal Party. So I do not think the Liberal Party was terribly displeased with the for redistribution that came forward. But because of the rump that lives with it-thes e boundary bushit rangers from the National Country Party-it was on obUged to vote against the acceptance of that the redistribution. In my view that was tragic and quite immoral. If there was objection to that redistribution proposal after it had been perused by the Parliament- I do not think the issues have been decided by the Parliament because there are impediments-an y objection to it have been made to people who are above being accused of political bias, such as the judiciary. In our case I imagine we would be talk about the High Court, or a section of it, as an appropriate body to hear appeals and finally to the boundaries. I think the same should apply to this Commonwealth Electoral The whole BUItightensup a few nuts and bolts with the latest decision of the High Court. It is unfortunate that the Government bowed to the pressure of the National Country Party and clause 7 into the Bill. I do not think it anything to the Bill at all. It certainly does improve it. It creates difficulties in an already Vicdifficult area. It certainly does not do what the go National Country Party seems to be looking for a all thetime.Members of the Party seem to be always seeking smaller numbers of electors on is a the rather specious grounds in my view because their electorates are more difficult to service because of the area involved. Kalgoorlie is the largest electorate in Australia. I would not say that KalgoorUe is the difficult electorate in Australia to service. I believe that metropolitan electorates such Wills or Grayndler, which are not very large electorates, would create greater difficulties servicing than would the very large electorate Kalgoorlie. I say that because people do not hi every nook and cranny in the electorate Kalgoorlie. They live in centres which are nected by commercial airlines. There is no need for the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) to charter an aircraft even. All the munity centres in his electorate are served commercial airlines. Yet members of the National Countiy Party put the proposition that that is a very good reason why countiy electoraffair ates should contain fewer people than city torates. It is not the Labor Party that is drawing the distinction between city and country We look upon all people of Australia as citizens of this nadon. Every one of them hopefully be treated fairly and equaUy in all of the institucountiy tions of this country, and Parliament is an institution. It is members of the National Country Party who, for cheap poltiical gain, put forward the proposition that they need to have fewer people in their electorates than are in the city electorates. This does not necessarily affect the electorate. repeat that I will never vote in this Parliament or anywhere else against a proposition that aUows people with large areas to cover faculties that, a relatively smaU electorate of some 1500 square kUometres, do not need and do not want. That does not mean that I believe that faciUties should not be provided for electorates which are above the benchmark. If the benchmark is to be 5000 square kUometres then so be it. I will not whether it should be 5000, 10 000, 15 000 or 20 000 square kUometres. The Remuneration Tribunal's report set the benchmark at 5000 square kUometres. If that is to be the benchmark the Government should make a submission the Remuneration Tribunal to ensure that greater faciUties are made avaUable to the people who represent those areas. The GovernLabor ment should ensure that the majority of people Australia are not disadvantaged by having their votes downgraded, with my vote being worth voting only half the vote of people in the seats of Wimwas mera or Mallee. That sort of situation in a demodiminishing cratic country such as Australia should not be tolerated. We are having it strapped upon us clause 7 of the Bill which will perpetuate that sort of situation and even worse perpetuate it for least 7 years at a time.",60
134,Mr DONALD CAMERON,M D E P U T Y,"Griffith) (4.8)Many of the things said by the honourable memtion-I ber for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) have left as members in this House aghast. Many have left the chamber because of the types of comments in he made. I am amazed at his reference to the seat of of KalgoorUe not having special problems. He five represents 1442 square kilometres and the of honourable member for KalgoorUe represents con2 271 379 square kUometres. If the honourable member does not think that people in rural areas have troubles I simply do not think he has any comcapacity to sit in this chamber and to even by represent metropoUtan people let alone talk about the country folk. I am told by one of my colleagues that the closest thing to a country that the honourable member has seen was eleca visit, as a very young man, to the Chelsea Flower Show. Outside that he has never had any people. connection with rural problems. I speak as a metropolitan member. I believe will that the Labor Party and many people in this have been hung up by folklore on this question of one vote, one value. Listening to the honourable member it is obvious that he has never really examined the history of the tolerance provided above the quota in city seats and the tolerance provided below the quota in country electorates. I have figures here relating to the I last 5 distributions of which only three have, in fact, been effected by the Parliament. In 1948 out of a total of 121 seats-honourabl e members in should not forget that this was an Australian Labor Party redistribution-al l but 15 of the seats were within the 10 per cent margin. In 1955-anothe r successful redistribution; this time carried out by this side of the House-al l but eight of the 122 seats were within the 10 per cent argue margin. In 1962- a redistribution which lapsed-1 1 seats out of a total of 120 seats were outside the margin. In 1968 a total of 33 seats was outside the 10 per cent margin. Honourable members might be saying: 'Ha, ha, the number to of seats outside the margin is growing'. Let us look at the historical Ust. I refer to my own seat of Griffith in Queensland which the Party, to its eternal shame, tried to redisin tribute out of existence in 1974-75. My seat was above the 10 per cent margin. It had the highest population after redistribution in 1968. It correctly classified as an electorate with a population. It is not that everybody wanted to leave the electorate that I represent. by But the facts are that there was a growth in industry and the residential area and population at diminished. The Electoral Commissioners in Queensland recognised this factor at that time. From Ustening to members of the Opposicarry no brief for the National Country Party-on e would gain the impression that every time there is a redistribution members of the National Country Party are so heavily favoured that it is a matter for us to stand up in this chamber and continually express indignation. When we look back at the history of the guidelines of redistribution we find that in 1965-as I correctly reminded the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam)-3 new factors were added. Thefirstwas the trend of population changes within the States. That was a sensible move. Even the Labor Government in 1975 decided that that guideline should stay, but the Labor Party eliminated the guideline concerning density or sparsity of population of a division. The Labor Party also eliminated the guideline concerning the area of a division. It is all very well for the honourable member for Burke, who has an electorate of 1442 square kilometres, to stand up and condemn the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) or rather more directly the people of Kalgoorlie when that electorate covers some 2VA million square kilometres, or to condemn the people of the electorate of Kennedy in Queensland. This is another example of how the honourable member for Burke does not care less about the people from far-flung areas. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) represents an area of almost 641 000 square kilometres. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) represents an area of 406 000 square kilometres. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) represents an area of 503 000 square kilometres. According to the honourable member for Burke those members have no particular problems. All the Government is doing, after considerin able discussion and agreement amongst the cocited alition parties, is recognising that the people in those areas which are at least 4 times the size of quently than the electorate of the honourable member for Burke, do have some kind of a problem and intends inserting a clause which states that seats which are larger than 5 000 square kiloarisen metres shall have a population larger than the smallest seat in, for instance, a city area. I do regard that as unreasonable. I am very pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), who represents the Minister for Administrative vices (Senator Withers), is present. The only weakness that I see is that the composition of some seats, such as MCPherson, which covers Gold Coast, and Bowman in Queensland and some seats in other States will make it difficult the distribution commissioners to bring those seats down to the lowest possible number, bearHigh ing in mind that they are fast growing areas. There is perfection in hardly anything, least of all the Australian Labor Party as a government. I hope that the Attorney-General will take this E oint back to the rninistry and say that the onourable member for Griffith certainly raised a most pertinent point. I think it really is about the only weakness in this Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) spent a great deal of time condemning the amendment to section 25 of the principal Act. He made special reference to the fact that 7 years must elapse before another redistribution takes place. He suggested that this was an unfortunate inclusion or alteration because the frequency of redistribution would be badly affected I think that we should look at history to see how frequently redistributions have taken place. History highlights the weakness of the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition. If we disregard the redistribution in 1900, before the Commonwealth Parliament was officially proclaimed, and if we exclude those rare occasions such as in 1974 when a redistribution took place in Western Australia alone, generally speaking there were successful redistributions in 1906, 1913, 1922, 1934, 1949, 1955 and 1968. There was a gap of 12 years between the 1922 redistribution and the 1934 redistribution, and a gap of 15 years between the 1934 redistribution and the 1949 redistribution.",62
135,Mr GRAHAM,M D E P U T Y,Do not forget to include this redistribution.,63
136,Mr DONALD CAMERON,M D E P U T Y,"Let us include 1977. Since federation, since we became a Commonwealth, we have had only 8 redistributions 76 years. Yet the Leader of the Opposition that thereas totally unsatisfactory the proposition shall not be a redistribution more freevery 7 years. That amendment has been included to protect no the Parliament from the situation which has as a result of the recent High Court findings which may otherwise have had the effect not of a redistribution being carried out every 3 or 4 years. With great respect to members of the Opposition, I believe that I can include them when I Sersay that parUamentarians and the population simply would not know then in which electorate they were living, who their representative was or the where they were going. None of us, whether we are Labor, National Party or Liberal, would for want a redistribution every 3 or 4 years. That would be hoisted upon us by virtue of the recent Courtfindings.I was quite surprised that a person of the standing of the Leader of the Opposition, who frequently commands my three respect-it was only when he was Prime Minister that that subsided considerably-wa s so groping to put together a form of words to oppose Bill that he fell into such a basic error.",63
137,Mr SCHOLES,M D E P U T Y,"I do not think you supported it the Party room, either.",64
138,Mr DONALD CAMERON,M D E P U T Y,"I assure the reflected honourable member for Corio, who suggested said that I did not support it in the Party room, that is incorrect. I did support it in the Party room. would be less than honest if I did not admit that was quite pleased to see removed the other factor which gave a weighting of 20 per cent to some seats. This happens in the Liberal-Country Party room. I embrace and support the 10 per cent conand cept. The view which I held in the Party room was later endorsed by the Government, when the amendment was made to the original proposal. That shows that in the Liberal and National Country parties democracy has a very good chance of working. I believe that this redistribution is necessary. One has only to Usten to speakers on the other side of the House, as they cite the disparity in population of electorates, to realise that. I port this legislation. I honestly wonder why official Opposition in this chamber is opposed it An examination of the facts indicates that great weighting, which is claimed to be directed to aU country people, in reaUty does not exist the extent which is claimed. Unfortunately, people are made to believe it does, as a result the exaggeration and pubUcity which this atovernight tracts. I support the legislation in its entirety. Minister might convey to the Minister for Adday ministrative Services that all members of this House would like to see the redistribution got underway as soon as possible so that before next Christmas we will know exactly where we are going as far as our electorates are concerned.",64
139,Mr SCHOLES,M D E P U T Y,"Corio) ^^^Redistribube travelled tions are something which no individual polito tician and few parties Uke. Unfortunately they are necessary. The terms under which redistriburants tions are carried out can have very substantial this Bill. effects. It is possible to carry out a redistribution which, to all intents and purposes, has the appearance of being fair but which in effect can give a government a margin which makes it miles almost impossible for it to be defeated. I instance the situation in Victoria where a redistribution, with a fairly substantial swing, would allow Australian Labor Party to obtain a position very close to government but which would require something more than extraordinary or four seats above that swing to enable it to obtain office. Electoral boundaries, electoral redistributions and elections should give the this people the opportunity to change government where they wish to have a change. The skUl of the manipulator prevents that. A redistribution in retains the iUusion, whilst creating situations where the wishes of the people cannot be in the results of an election. It was truly on an earlier occasion that it is not the way he that the people vote but the way that the people's I votes are counted that matters. In many respects I that is the major opposition to this particular proposal. If, for instance, a large electorate was said to be an electorate of over 50 000 square kUometres objections most likely would be lower less stringent. If the provisions of the Act were that where 25 per cent of the electorates in a State went 10 per cent above or below the quota, a redistribution would take place and then the proposal may be more acceptable. The 3 major proposals in this Bill have a cummulative effect. I do not consider some of the electorates at the bottom of the table-electorate s consisting of 5000 square kUometres-to be large the electorates. I know that the members of at least suptwo of them would not qualify for an overnight the allowance by driving 150 kilometres from their to homes. Those members cannot quaUfy for that this overnight aUowance because that distance does not exist within their electorate. The honourable to member for Wimmera (Mr King) referred to the difficulties of his own electorate. He is one of of those members who cannot in fact qualify for an allowance by driving 150 kUometresThe that is about 95 miles-in his electorate. In this and age that is not a lengthy distance. At least two other Victorian electorates which come within the ambit of the 5000 square kilometre proposal are the seats of MCMillan and Ballarat. Those electorates have an area of about 60 mUes by 40 miles- I will use rmles because I am more familiar with them. Not more than 50 miles need by the members of those electorates quaUfy for an allowance. I do not believe that electorates of this type are of a size which warthe special protection which is proposed in In the case of the electorate of Ballaarat something like 80 per cent of the electors are within 10 of the city of Ballarat which is the centre of population. Ballaarat is substantiaUy an urban electorate with some rural annexes. Although it is the an important electorate, it could hardly be declared or considered a large electorate in geographical terms when we compare it to electorto win the ates such as Kalgoorlie. The cumulative effect of the legislation brings about a time distortion in electorates. It requires the commissioners to ignore the growth factors electorates. In Victoria the commissioners took into consideration the growth factors of, for example, the electorates of Burke and Diamond Valley and placed them 7 per cent below a size quota, which was the case in the 1974 distritorate. bution, they would also have to place another electorates 7 per cent below a quota because is how many electorates are said to be large elecfor torates. I dispute that those 9 electorates are fact large electorates. They are all larger than electorate but they are certainly not large by criteria that could be applied to the national Parliament. Nine other electorates have to be loaded down. There are 8 rapid growth electorates in ter Victoria at the moment and there will be 9 after the redistribution because certainly the fringes Melbourne will warrant an additional electorate. Once the commissioners take one area which is not over 500 square kilometres 7 per cent below a quota they will have to take 18 electorates down. That is the son of long term effect that legislation will have. Figures which can quoted at the moment have a built-in distortion because electorates between 1968 and the and presenttimeinclude 18,19 and 20 year olds who were enrolled by Act of Parliament. Therefore these figures do not represent the normal growth in electorates. They distort the situation in that they show electorates with a growth factor in fact did not have a growth factor. If the normal pattern of electorates takes place certain of them will be loaded down by this prop-State osition. Some of them would have been loaded down anyhow because of their area. The comwUl missioners have fairly consistently taken consideration the disabilities of members in are genuinely large electorates. Those will cline below the quota fairly quickly. The growth electorate will move past the quota, at the rate some of them are growing, within 12 months of the distribution being adopted. Most likely some of them would have moved to that stage by time the distribution has been completed berequired-ther cause there is a time lag of nearly a year betweendeficit the release of thefiguresand the adoption of the recommendation. It is proposed that there should be a period of 7 years between redistributions. It is just over years since the last redistribution. In Victoria 2 smallest electorates of Wimmera and Mallee added together have only 7000 more voters thanare the electorate of Burke. They have only 10 per cent more voters than the electorate of Burke. This is a ratio of one for two. In Queensland the 2 smallest electorates have 10 000 electors fewer in than the electorate of MCPherson. We are recreating and multiplying that situation by the 3 joint propositions in this legislation. Electorates of over 5000 square kUometres have a maximum equal to the minimum size of any other elecThis is a distortion in that there are elec9 torates which under the normal redistribution thatproposals would be expected to be loaded down growth. I am not talking about inner metroin politan electorates about which much play has my been made. Usually they are decUning elecany torates but are almost always set above a quota. I think that the Liberal Party has fallen for the 3 card trick. It would have been most Ukely betoff if it had accepted a straight out proposition of 7 large electorates at 20 per cent. I would have of thought it would have been immoral. But electorally this arrangement would have been more practical for the distribution commissioners and it would have given a more honest reflection of what the Government is trying to say. What the this Government has in fact said is that we will have be 2 types of members in this Parliament-thos e who have special electoral laws applied to them others who do not. If the commissioners use the variations electorates in the inner metropoUtan areas in aU probabUity wUlfindthemselves 8 per cent to 10 per cent above a quota. If we load half the electorates in the States-that is the situwhichation in New South Wales and Victoria if we allow for the growth in large areas as is proposed, and as would be expected and if we make these allowances-hal f the electorates in a will be affected by the 5000 square kilometre proposition one way or the other. They be affected also by the 7 year redistribution into proposition. Then we have to consider the what cumulated deficit which we have allowed for dethose electorates and add that deficit to the remainder. The remainder is not that big. I have added it for the inner metropolitan Labor areas in Victoria. At 5 per cent above a quota- I would expect that this provision would most Ukely end the up with 8 per cent above a quota being e is something Uke an 89 000 vote in the area. That represents one electorate in 20 000 electors. The same cumulative deficit exists in both the Labor and Liberal areas of inner Sydney. The position is almost identical in 7 the Liberal areas in Melbourne because there is the very little difference in the populations between one area and another. Everyone recognises those to have additions. Most Ukely they would need 50 000 to 60 000 people to get them back up to the quota and with the same degree of loading. The cumulative effect of these 3 measures will mean that those electorates will well above what they should normally have that been. Others will be loaded down, not because of their size, not because of any consideration commissioners would normally have given that sort of loading but because of some other electorconscientiously. ate which has no relevance at all. I use an ous example in Victoria. If the electorate Burke is loaded down to allow it to be a reasonare able size half way through the period of redisthey tribution, Ballaarat has to be loaded down with for no other reason than that the electorate Burke will grow rapidly. Ballaarat is not a large seat. This Bill will attach what happens in Ballaarat to what happens in another seat, and apply a redistribution factor to it which relevance to it and which will have the effect of adding possibly 5000 voters to another seat in the metropolitan area which should not have those 5000 voters, except that they happen to left over when the sums for the special treatment seats are concluded. The other result- I would hope this is the of result the Commissioners will in fact adoptvisions. that can come from these proposals is that the Commissioners will use their discretion in seats like Darling, Kalgoorlie, and Leichhardt, the very large seats, and ignore differentials in the other seats, especially in the metropolitan areas, and give them about a quota each. I am not surebrought. that that would satisfy the Country Party and think we would even have the threat of an electhe tion at large. That is the only practical solution under the existing terms because there is not one proposal or 2 proposals but 3 proposals. I think the area 5000 square kilometres is a serious mistake, on the poUcies the Government it had adopted a figure of 50 000 or even 20 000, most likely it would have been osition. I would suggest that there is no way that special treatment can be warranted in an ate 60 miles by 40 mUes. That is not an extremely large electorate in Australian or any other terms. It does not warrant special treatment, but it get special treatment purely because it happens to be covered by a tribunal report made by people looking at a different set of criteria. said before, the member in such an electorate would not even quaUfy for an overnight allowre-assembly ance because he would not be able to travel the required distance in his electorate. This Bill should be withdrawn. required for the redistribution. The existing Act would allow a redistribution to go ahead. The Government, if the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) is to be beUeved, be is able to influence the Commissioners. I doubt myself. I saw the last Victorian redistribution. Whilst I did well out of it, I am not sure that the the Australian Labor Party did. I think that Commissioners, once appointed, do their jobs They do it within the guidelines obviwhich governments and parUaments lay down, of which may be crook. I think the Commissioners at least men of integrity and try to do the job are given. The suggestion that is regularly it made that such and such a party made a redisof tribution is not one which I accept. I know that political parties will always seek to influence. Why not? There are advantages in redistribution far greater than the advantages to be gained in has no elections. Ask the Premier of Queensland. On or two other things in this Bill ought to be considered. One is the proposition of 'at large' beelections. There are no rules by which such elections shall be conducted. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) will remember a case not that far back when no opportunity would have existed type for the Parliament to provide 'at large' proIn those circumstances there was a possibUity that the definition of'towards the end of a term' might have been challenged in the courts at a time when the Parliament had in fact been dissolved. I do not think that is the sort of situation into which any nation can allow itself to be I do not know what the legal result of I such a situation would be. 'Towards the end of Parliament' is a pretty open statement. It would seem to me that something should be written into the Act to define the words. I think the words are actually'towards the end of the Ufe of of the Parliament'. They come from the High Court evenjudgment, which is delightfully vague on the is trying to put. If question. Mr Ellicott-Are you talking about proposed a better propnew section 25A? elector Mr SCHOLES-I am not sure of the number, but rules for an 'at large' election do not exist. I would hope there could be no situation in which is to such an election could take place because, no matter how it was conducted, it would be a distortion of the process by which this House is As I normally elected or expected to be elected. It certainly would create serious difficulties in the of a Parliament and the counting of votes. Most likely the reassembly of Parliament, the issues of writs, etc, could not take place within the terms of the Commonwealth Electoral It is not Act as it exists. I hope the Attorney-General will take notice of one of the things the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) said and consider a provision for an automatic acceptance of redisthe tribution proposals. I do not believe it is proper that a redistribution should depend on it acceptable to the party with the majority of at any given elecuon. As I said when I first stoodcause up, redistribution is unpalatable to members Parliament. I would like to see Commissioners appointed with the approval of both sides of Parliament. I do not think that should be beyondjust the imagination of man. It should be possible send their report to the Parliament and for it be sent back for a review if it is thought not suitable and the review should follow the same procedures as in other reviews. The Comor missioners should consider the objections and decide whether they should be accepted. The report could then become law. In 1962, for example, it was improper that when one seat disappeared in New South Wales there was not redistribution. The honourable member for Griffith pointed out how sparse redistributions have been in the past. I think for poltiical reasonsate and not for practical reasons that has been the case. The laws governing elections and distributions are too important to be tied up in this sort compromise. The recent High Court judgment was in fact a blow at the Government, which rushed through legislation in 1965 after it lost control of the Senate but before senators took office, to provide what has now been declared to be an Ulegal means of setting the number of members or determining the quotas for members in this House. It is somethingber which should be seriously considered. These propositions cumulatively are not good prophe ositions and do not reflect a situation which thisto Parliament can support.",64
140,Mr ABEL,M D E P U T Y,"I support the Comopen monwealth Electoral Amendment Bill and the the amendments which have been brought forward. Contrary to what the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has just said, they are necess-that ary. It would appear that possibly the honournecessary able member for Corio and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) are in conflict again. It has become apparent the honourable member for Corio beUeves the Bill is not necessary. Yet the Leader sition in his opening remarks suggested that had waited too long. He suggested that the MCKellar case was such that we should have brought in legislation earUer. I thought the lation was introduced as the result of the High Court decision in the MCKellar case. Let me refer to a few remarks of the Leader of Opposition. He, and all honourable members opposite who have spoken thus far, seem to have being great concern and fear about the proposed votesamendment to section 19 purely and simply beof its reference to 5000 square kUometres. of Suggestions have been made throughout this debate that the legislation of Labor's Minister for the Administrative Services, Mr Daly, was fair and and that it gave representation on the basis to of one vote one value. Surely the basis of the tolegislation as it was proposed was that electoral be divisions should be considered on the basis of people, be they ehgible to vote, be they babies, be they aliens. I do not see how members of the Opposition can stand here today and justify that as being equaUty, and on the other hand suggest that an electorate Uke KalgoorUe, which is 2.2rnilUonsquare kUometres, does not have asome true representation in this House as against an electorate Uke Grayndler, to which reference has been made. I represent an inner city electorof Sydney, the electorate of Evans. There are 63 000 persons enrolled in my division but there are 101 000 residents. I represent the 101 000, whether they are shown on the electoral roll or not. But I do not for one moment suggest that I of would Uke to move out of that area into 2.2 mifiion square kUometres andfindI had the same opportunity. I am sure that the people in had KalgoorUe would not get the same service from the new my office or indeed from me.",67

142,Mr ABEL,M D E P U T Y,"I think that the honourable memfor KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter), my colleague, is afinehard working member. He has proved that will be a member of this House for a long time come. The basis of this electoral legislation is the heart of the democratic process. It can be effective and democratic only if it ensures a fair, and representative system which translates genuine wishes of electors into parliamentary voices. Right here and now, I state clearly that the amendments proposed in this Bill are such the process will be democratic. I think it is to remind honourable members opposite of the meaning of the word 'democratic'. I should like to quote an interpretation of in this debate that'democracy': A system of government in which political power is exerof the Oppo-cised by the people. we That means individualism, Uberty, equality. Perhaps we could go a step further and listen to what people over the years have had to say about legisdemocracy. Going back to the 4th Century BC: Democracy is the form of government in which the free are rulers. That was Aristotle. Democracy is a superior form of government, because based on a respect for man as a reasonable being. That was John F. Kennedy in 1940. The people's government made for the people, made by the people and answerable to the people. That was Daniel Webster in 1795. Surely this scaling of priorities legislation which has been brought forth is in factis a most natural selection, democratic. Democracy is the healthful life-blood which through the veins and arteries, but Which ought never to appear externally, and blood itself. That was Coleridge in 1830.

146,Mr ABEL,M D E P U T Y,"We always like Opposition memdone bers to be here at oddtimesto give them a bit elementary history. Some people would argue that our system is not representative because does not embody for this House proportional or other forms of representation. All I can say that is that our system is democratic and, in Jubilee year, might I say that I hope it will endure as a system of consititutional monarchy for a long time. But it will survive only if we maintain and enhance its democratic values at time when democratic values and the things which accompany them such as human rights and civil liberties are disappearing extremely quickly around the globe. From memory, only about 25 of the 140-odd individual independent nations of the world are exceptionally demopublished cratic with independent parliaments and judiciaries. There are 115 or so regimes which need a strong democratic example such as we reduced. have in Australia. This Bill helps to give to this countiy a strong democratic representation in this place. Essentially, our system is a blend the single constituency preferential 2-party tem in the House of Representatives and of proinner portional representation in the Senate. That gives the people of this country the opportunity to have two bites at the cherry, or rather to enjoy the whole cherry. The other aspect which is subject to controit is versy is the question of preferential voting, which thankfully is still embodied in the main Act. My attitude to it is that such a scheme maximises opportunities in the selection of candidates. The simplest way of explaining it is to say that under preferential voting, where the choice is wide, the among candidates by citizens like everything else we do. For the benefit of Opposition members, I circulates point out that in the morning we get up and which supports the system, as the mere choose our clothes. Some members might have the opportunity to go to their stores to pick out go some bright clothes in which to come to this House. But we have a choice. It has been said about this legislation that there is going to be a 7 year lapse between redistributions. Surely the peopie. legislation itself ensures that there will be a review each year based upon population. In his second reading speech the Attorney-General That just (Mr Ellicott) said: the twelfth month of every Parliament, the Chief AusElectoral Officer, on the basis of the latest available statistics which he is to obtain from the Australian Statistician, will make a determination as to the of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for each State and forward that determination to the How can it be argued, as the Opposition has constantly in the debate thus far, that there of will be a redistribution only every 7 years? I do not see for one moment how any member of this it House or any member of the public, for that matter, could understand that. Surely it is within the to Act itself. Each and every year, based upon this population, the Chief Australian Electoral Officer will look at the situation. That does not necessarily guarantee that there will be a distribution, and I am sure I would not like to be suba jected to that. However, if there is substantial movement within the population in that 12 months period there will be a redistribution. That will then make this House contemporary and in tune with population shifts. In regard to population shifts, the Borrie report, which was recently, indicates a slowing down in with our population growth, and therefore the number of electors, excluding migrants, will be There will still be significant population shifts, of course. The Borrie report and the latest census do not mean less need for regular redisof tributions because of urban shifts within cities. sysAs evidence of that we have to look only at the city of Sydney, the far western suburbs and other growth areas, although that process is now in doubt because the trend is to return to urban areas. I know that in my own electorate there is a changing pattern, with people coming in and going out. Each and every year there would be change, with some 10 000 to 15 000 people coming in and going out. Following the MCKinlay and MCKellar cases, a new provision has been inserted in this lation, and again I wish to quote the Minister's number words: . . . if a State has not been divided into the appropriate number of divisions which accords with the determined representation entitlement, that ordinary general election wdl be conducted 'at large' for that State. This means that the State will be regarded as one and the members, to the number as determined, will ted for that one division. I have presumed that as the words 'at large' not apply in extraordinary or double dissolution elections, elections cannot be contrived to advantage of proportional representation but do believe the 'at large' provision ought now be more clearly defined. The Minister in introducing the legislation dicated that there should be a review of the guidelines which the Distribution Comin missioners are required to take into account their consideration of proposed distributions. would Uke to suggest to the Minister that duringthat this inquiry examination should be made of the question of making it mandatory for the position of Distribution Commissioner to be held by per-vision sons from the judiciary. Although it is not necess-to arily comparing Uke with Uke there is similaritybefore between this idea and the way parUamentarians'no salaries are now determined by an independent tribunal. That is one case. There can then be a sense of complete independence about it. Simisimply larly, with judicial appointments, complete independence would seem to have been and achieved. The charge levelled by the Opposition throughout this debate basically has been that the amendments have been designed for the benefit of the National Country Party and that the legislation is poUticaUy inspired.

149,Mr ABEL,M D E P U T Y,"I take issue with the honourable letters. member for WUls at least. The members of Party are not trying to take my seat from me but nevertheless I am sure that as the honourable a member has survived for a long time in his own Party he can survive a bit longer. In regard to the introduction of the Bill and the claim that it has been poUticaUy inspired, the honourable memlegisber for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) went back through history to Ulustrate that the of redistributions over the years has been rather small. So the proposal by the Opposition in its Bill to have a redistribution every 3 years-unde r our Bill there will be a redistribution every 7 years-woul d have forced on the divisionAustraUan people unnecessary wasteful redisbe elec-tributions. The honourable member for Griffith said that as a member he would not know where dohe was going. He said that his constituents would not know from year to year who their member take was. Consequently the Opposition's proposals I would have had only poltiical impUcations beto cause they sought to have boundary changes to give them some poltiical advantage. inI would Uke to refer again to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. Basically he said that 1974 the Labor Party had proposed a Bill in which provided that all people should have I equal representation by the creation of a division had a tolerance of no more or less than 10 per cent of the quota. Where has our Bill gone wrong in that respect? Surely that is the very prothat the Leader of the Opposition wanted have incorporated in the Act in 1975. This Bill the House does provide for a tolerance of more or less than 10 per cent of the quota. So much for his argument. Is it that the intention of the Opposition in opposing this Bill is purely and one of poliucal motivation to try to drive a wedge between the National Country Party the Liberal Party? Is that the reason for opposing the Bill? I believe that the Opposition has no more concern for the people of Australia and their representation by members in this House than for putting the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) out of this House without a The previous speaker the honourable member for Burke said that the electorate of KalgoorUe is a difficult area to service. He compared it the seat of Grayndler. I would Uke just to go himback and compare the electorate of Evans with the electorate of Kalgoorlie. Each and every year in my electorate there are something Uke 5000 naturalisations. They spread out of my electorate. I have some 600 social engagements. My correspondence runs into tens of thousands of I am able to service my area from 2 offices my situated in my electorate which encompasses roughly 25 square miles. How could the honourable member for Burke suggest that I could move out of my area into Kalgoorlie and service it in the same manner as I do now? The electordepart ate of Kalgoorlie would have the same popuwhere lation as the electorate of Evans, not necessarily the same number of enrolled electors but the same population. There are problems not because of a bowing to pressure as charged by the honourable member for Burke and, I control think, the honourable member for Corio (Mr tatives Scholes). There is no bowing to pressure from which makes the National Country Party. It ality and sanity that we must give representation 1000 per cent. If30 to the people of Australia. This Bill is urgently needed. It is urgently needed to ensure that the people are given proper and correct representation. It is urgently needed to ensure that there are not wanton redisthat tributions for poltiical purposes each and every years. This Bill is badly needed to correct the matters that were recently found to be invalid the High Court. I support the Bill and I commend it to the House.",69
150,Mr COHEN,M D E P U T Y,"It ought to be one of the simplest things in the world to up a democratic process that is acceptable the people on both sides of this House. But that will only be achieved when there is fuU acceptgovernments ance of the principle of one vote one value. I tened with interest to the arguments of honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel) and previous speakers in this debate on the proposed amendment that Distribution Commissioners in making any proposed redistribution shall ensure that no division with an area of 5000 square kUoredistribute metres or more shaU have at the time of a redisad tribution an electoral population which is greater than the electoral population of any division an area of less than 5000 square kUometres. That is a rather wordy description, but in essence means that this legislation will continue to mainor tain the principle that some people in the comvote-i munity are entitled to bias in their favour to make up for some deficiency that their electorate. I agree with the honourable member for Evans that the person who represents a seat Uke Kalment. goorUe and the person who represents a seat Uke Evans, a small inner city seat, have disadvanttry ages but we on this side of the House have ing always expressed the view that those disadvantenough ages should be compensated for by person greater access to the electorate by way of travel faciUties, increased staff and so on. one who would be quite happy to see members living in very large electorates given almost Umited assistance. But the point I want to take with previous speakers and in particular the honourable member for Evans, is that once we from a principle of equaUty of votes does it end? We now have a 10 per cent tolerance either way. We used to have a 20 per cent tolerance. Now we have this 5000 square there but kUometre criterion. There is nothing to stop a government that has of the numbers in the House ofRepresenand in the Senate from passing legislation the difference virtually anything it is a matter of reUkes-20 per cent, the per cent, 50 per cent or Government has the numbers it can do it, and of course, it has been done in the various States. That is what concerns me. What happens if there should be an autocratic, authoritarian government which decides it will lose the next election, whips through a 3 redistribution and stops what we call the democratic process. I am one of those people who have by seen the evUs committed by Labor Governments in Queensland and I do not think that all Labor governments in the past have been saints. I am not referring to this House because in the past the draw very few redistributions that have been underto all taken by Labor governments in the federal sphere have been very fair, but some State Labor have done equally bad things. It lishas been done in Western Australia, Victoria and the most of the other States barring Tasmama, which has the one truly democratic State Legislative Assembly because it has a proportional representation system. What concerns me is that a government can do this. It can go ahead and itself into government more or less infinitum and we have seen it done in the other States. The simple fact is that even if the with Labor Party did get the majority vote- I agree that at the moment it would not be a legitimate it government in Queensland, Western Australia Victoria because it does not have the majority t still could not win office. It could not win in any of those 3 States if it obtained 50.1 per exists within cent of the vote. All I ask in this democratic country is that if a party obtains the majority vote, it be in governThe history of this Parliament is that there is a bias in favour of the Liberal National CounParty coaUtion. It is not enormous. It is nothUke the bias that exists in Queensland but it is to deny the Labor Party government giving the when the result is close. I am Mr Abel-Ninety-od d seats to thirty-six.",70
151,Mr COHEN,M D E P U T Y,"I am not arguing about the unlegitimacy of the Government at the moment. It up won an overwhelming majority at the last election in 1976.I am arguing about the legitimacy of the Government in 1954, 1961 and 1969. The result in 1954 was not the fault of the Liberal Country Party coalition. It was the fault of the Labor Government which drew up the boundaries in 1949. The worse Gerrymander against the Labor Party was done by the Labor Party in 1949. But it has been maintained by succeeding governments and in 1961 the Labor Party should have been the legitimate government. It had a clear mandate from the people but it failed to win because of the electoral system, not the malapportionment which gave the other side an inbuilt majority of three or four seats. In 1969 it was touch and go. The Labor Party lacked a majority-m y recollection is that it was by 7 seats-ye t it obtained a majority of the vote. In 1972 the Labor Party should have won by a greater number of seats than it did and in 1974 it should have obtained a bigger majority than 5 seats. I suppose it is a pointless exercise, but lieve that I am a true democrat. I believe that if the other side of the House wins, it should be the government and alternatively, if this side wins, it should be the government. I think that this Bill is an improvement on the past although I do not like a lot of things contained in it, for which the Opposition will oppose it. It is an improvement because at least the 10 per cent variation that the Labor Party introduced when in government has been maintained. Eventually in this country I want to see the power to change the electoral laws and the power to undertake redistributions taken out of the hands of politicians. There ought to be a statutory authority. The Electoral Office should be a statutory authority employing permanent public servants to draw up electoral boundaries which they present to the Parliament and which cannot be changed by the Parliament. Seats sbould be decided by the law of one vote, one value, as they are decided by the Constitution, and whatever boundaries are drawn up by the Electoral Office, whether it be at three orfiveor seven-year intervals, should be the ones that apply. The elections would be fought on that basis. Some of the things that were said about the Labor Party's redistribution were outrageous. Some members of this House who are now on the Government side stomped the country and told grotesque untruths about the redistribution and yet all political scientists of repute in Australia-peopl e who really understand what redistributions are-said that the Federal redistribution undertaken by the Labor Government was eminently fair. Malcolm Mackerras, a man who was previously a member of the Liberal Party and is one of Australia's most eminent political scientists said that it was an extremely fair redistribution and that it redressed the bias that had existed in past redistributions. But Government supporters, who were then in opposition, stomped the country. They made claims that were simply outrageous that the Labor Party was putting forward electoral processes that would keep it permanently in office. They were able to do this because the vast majority of the population do not understand redistributions. That is not to their discredit. The vast majority of politicians understand what is happening but if one asks them to explain what effect a distribution has in each individual electorate or State, they could not do it. A member will know what is happening in his electorate and in the neighbouring electorate-probabl y there is self interest involved in that-bu the does not really have the knowledge, nor does he take the time, I be- to study every single electorate closely to see whether it is 100 per cent fair. If he does not do it there is no way in the world that the general population will undertake that sort of study. I doubt whether there are 100 people in the nation who could sit down and look at a redistribution and say accurately whether it is fair or unfair. They would have to work on somebody else's interpretation of that redistribution. Another important point that I want to make is that I wish that the Government had the courage to go to the people to reintroduce the question of the breaking of the nexus between the Senate and the House ofRepresentatives.",70
152,Mr HODGMAN,M D E P U T Y,The people threw it out.,71
153,Mr COHEN,M D E P U T Y,"The honourable member fbr Denison says that the people threw it out. That is quite right. If honourable members cast their minds back to that 1967 referendum, they will recall that the Government did not introduce legislation to increase the size of the House. It first went to the people and some Democratic Labor Party and independent senators conducted a quite dishonest campaign amongst the people of Australia, saying that the Government was trying to increase the numbers of members of Parliament. It was not. The Government can, as we all know, increase the size of the House of Representatives tomorrow. It is within its powers and it could do it tomorrow if it introduced the legislation. However, of course, it has to increase the size of the Senate. What the Government, supported by the Labor Party, was trying to do in 1967 was to increase the size of the House of Representatives without increasing the size of the Senate. It was, in fact, a referendum to decrease in the long term the number of politicians but these quite dishonest politicians went out, campaigned and reversed the question. The posal did not get much support from the media and it was defeated. If, as the honourable memjustify ber for Denison (Mr Hodgman) says, it is not possible to change that question and that we would have the same sort of dishonest arguments if we went to the people again, the answer should be to increase the size of the Senate. To me it is patently absurd that in 1949 there for were 123 members of the House ofRepresentatives and that 28 to 30 years later there will be 123 members. If we are concerned about the and the have size of some seats, surely the best way is to torates increase them. I do not want to see any country New South Walesas seat abolished. I do not want to see a decrease in the number of country seats by mamtaining the number at 123 and because of the increase in the the urban population. It will make the seats now have bigger and bigger. This must go on. Kalgoorlie will get bigger and Kennedy, Attorney-General Leichhardt and all other country seats will get bigger. What is wrong with increasing the size the House of Representatives to 144 members and increasing Senate representation to 12 tors from each State? The argument against thatintroduced proposition is that the result of Senate elections will always be a 3:3 split and so you will never get a decision. I think that is nonsense. At the last double dissolution election one said that the Labor Party had to achieve 5:5 result. We achieved that result in one State and the result was 6:4 in every other State. What could be done is simply to divide the States electorates for the purpose of Senate elections. They could be divided into 6 electorates; they could be divided into 2 electorates. If they were divided into 2 electorates, that could be done having half the population in each and having senators elected from each part. In the case Queensland, 3 senators could come from, say, the north and 3 senators could be elected from the southern part of the State. Frankly, I think would be a better thing if senators, instead ofjust representing a whole State, represented a parthe ticular area which was more of interest to them. There are all sorts of combinations and compucarry tations. But we are stuck with 123 members because cause of what Malcolm Mackerras described the High Court lunacy when referring to its cent ruling. I am surprised that the Liberal and sibilities; Country Parties have not looked at that cerns me. possibility. It has been said that a government would scared of public disapproval if it increased number of politicians. Surely we have got enough gumption to go to the people and say: 'We are going to increase the size of the House of proRepresentatives from 123 to 144 members', or something like that After 30 years surely we can a small increase in the size of this House. The States are doing it. Every time they have a redistribution, which is every 3 or 4 years, they add a couple of electorates. If there is an argument for fewer politicians, it ought to be an argument for fewer State politicians. As the member Robertson, I represent the Gosford-Wyong area which has a population of90 000. There are stillalmost 3 State electorates within my boundaries, State members who represent those electhe same salary and almost the same conditions I have. Who has the easier job? The Legislative Assembly has 99 members, which is almost as many as represent whole of Australia in this place. I think that that we the situation is patently absurd. Finally I want to express my concern to the (Mr Ellicott) about this question of the election at large. I am surprised that of nothing more specific has been spelt out in that regard. Perhaps the Attorney-General is propossenaing that some subsequent legislation will be to clarify the position. I understand that the Chief Australian Electoral Officer does not know what he would do if there were an election at large. I am also concerned at the possieverybility of an unscrupulous government at some a stage or other deliberately deciding that it will not carry out a redistribution and have an election at large because it may benefit from it. Let into me give an example. In 1969, 1972 and 1974 New South Wales strongly voted for the Labor Party. In 1972 we got about 27 or 28 of the 45 seats in that State. Let us assume that we had by narrowly missed out on achieving office and that 3 the present Government was in power and it deof cided that if an election at large were held it could be assured, under proportional representation-this is what I assume an election at large it would be because I cannot see any other way of doing it-of about 42 per cent to 45 per cent of vote. That means it must get almost half of the seats. So a government could decide not to out a redistribution in a particular State beit was assured of picking up 4 or 5 seats in as an election at large. Maybe I am drawing the relong bow; maybe I am looking at obscure posbut it is a distinct possibility, and it con",71
154,Mr HODGMAN,M D E P U T Y," I would be like to commence my remarks by congratulating the the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) on an extremely fair and a very good speech. I must concede that I do not agree with all of the specifics ofhis speech, but I completely concur with the sentiments he expressed. Not least of the kind remarks he made was the comtory ment that Tasmania is a truly democratic State. take some pleasure in hearing that, because it does happen to be the truth. It is in the spirit, only of being a Liberal but also as one who lieves in the democratic process, that I congratupopulation late the Government on the introduction of these electoral measures. They are, in my submission, good legislation, fair legislation and, above all, democratic legislation. I would not wish it to thought by the pubhc at large that these Bills come into the Parliament today only because decisions taken by the High Court in MCKinlay's case and in MCKellar's case. Granted, it could said that those decisions, particularly the latter, have perhaps prompted or speeded up the legisof lative process. But I hope that men of goodwill on both sides of this House will have come to thebasis conclusion that the sorts of amendment prowhich posals which are now before the chamber are fair and appropriate in the democratic parlianumber mentary system that we have in this country 1977. It seems, with respect, that the question electoral redistribution has always been, as was mentioned by the honourable member for redistribution Robertson, a matter of political controversy. Like the honourable member, I find it very that far too often the public believes fiddle with electoral boundaries for the purpose of electoral advantage. The sooner we can get electoral redistribution away from the political scene and out of the hands of politicians so that the public will see that it is not being done for purpose of gerrymandering or arranging elechave toral advantage, but that it is for the purpose achieving fair and democratic representation all Australians, the sooner the standing of this Parliament will be greatly enhanced in the of the community. In the past the procedures redistribution of the House of Representatives boundaries have provided that, on the basis of the 5-yearly census populationfigures,The Australian Electoral Officer determined, accordJohnson) ing to a set formula, the representation entitlements of each State. In the 2 High Court decisions to which I have referred, and after consideration of section the Constitution, the Court expressed the that the words 'whenever necessary' which representatives appear in section 24 mean that the number of members to be chosen in the several States be determined in time for each ordinary general election and that such election must be held accordance with the entitlements so determined. the However, the Court recognised that that mandaprinciple would not apply in the case of elecItions other than ordinary general elections. not What basically then does this legislation do? beIn my respectful submission, it contemporises movements in Australia with the electorate and with the democratic process. It is proper that the determining of electoral redistribution should be done in time for the next orbe dinary general election. The effect of the High Court's decision embodied in this legislation is of that in the twelth month of every Parliament- I put it in simple terms because I believe that if it is be >ut in simple terms it is more Ukely that the pub[ ic will accept this as a genuine measure or series measures rather than as a politican exercisethe Chief Australian Electoral Officer, on the of the latest avaUable population statistics, he has to obtain from the Australian Statistician, will make a determination as to the of members of the House ofRepresentain tives to be chosen for each State and forward that determination to the Minister. If that determination discloses that there should be an alterof ation to the number of members of the House of Representatives for any State, then the required will be proceeded with and on that redistribution the electors will cast their votes to sad choose those members who will form the that we Government in the next Parliament. I want to say from the outset that anybody who has studied the BUls or the Constitution will readUy appreciate that it is unlikely for a very the long period of time that these provisions will any direct effect on the State of Tasmama. I of must, in fairness, concede that nobody in this for Parliament has attacked the position of Tasmania. But there were whispers in the corridors eyes of a conspiracy to suggest that Tasmanian for representation should be reduced. But I draw attention to the fact that the founding fathers, in their wisdom, ensured that Tasmania which is, as Chief the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith mentioned, an original State, would have 5 seats in the House of Representatives. Please God, nobody will ever be stupid enough to suggest that that representation should be reduced, let alone attempt to reduce it. Tasmania 24 of has enough problems of gravity without our view adding to them by reducmg the number of it has in this Parliament- a mere 5 representatives out of the enormity of those must who come from the major States of New South Wales and Victoria. Consequently, it is going to in be many years before we wulfitinto the category of being subject to these legislative proposals. Lest people who are listening to the broadcast of this debate believe that Tasmania is receiving some extremely unjust or unfair advantage, I refer briefly to the 10 per cent variant and to the situation as it at present pertains. I think the former Attorney-General, now Mr Justice Murphy, spoke very frankly on the 10 per cent variation when, in the Senate on 10 Apnl 1973, he said: Exact equality in the number of electors per division cannot be achieved, nor is it desirable. Some degree of variation from the quota or average must be allowed. I emphasise the following words because I believe they are true: At the same time, equality of politicalrightsis inherent in a truly democratic State . . . Equality of political rights may mean that strictly and mathematically there is a variation which will upset the purists, that the Parliament will be better and stronger because representation is given to those areas and, indeed, to those States which are entitled to a base representation which should not, under any formula, be subject to reduction. Let us compare the remarks of the former Attorney-General, the then Senator Murphy, later Mr Justice Murphy, with the reported comments attributed to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). I hope he made these comments in jest. Nevertheless, for the record, he made the following statement in Sydney: By derivation civilised men are those who live in cities; pagans are those who live in the country. I have the honour to represent a metropolitan electorate. I previously had the honour to represent a country electorate. I believe that anybody who is representing a country electorate in any Parliament, State or Commonwealth, would resent the proposition that those who put them into office were pagans, let alone uncivilised. I come to a point which I believe, as a democrat, is a matter of considerable principle. I say, on the one hand, how delighted I am that the 10 per cent variant has been retained. I believe that despite the undoubted problems which may befall some sections of the political community in this country, whom in passing I commend for their capacity to concUiate and to compromise on a very difficult electoral matter, I do not believe that we as Australians could have held our heads high in a situation in which we had 115 or 118 electorates with a 10 per cent variant and 7 or 8 electorates with a 20 per cent variant. I want to make it quite clear that I believe that this debate has been much better because it has not been a poltiical debate. I do not wish it to be thought that I am throwing stones or casting aspersions in any directions. I commend certain poltiical sections for being fair and for being prepared to compromise on this basis. Mr Kelly-Ver y statesmanUke.",72
155,Mr HODGMAN,M D E P U T Y,"I think the honourable member for Wakefield is correct-thos e persons adopted a statesmanlike approach. I think that in fairness one should record that it was the previous Government which brought to this nation the 10 per cent variant. It is one of the few good things which it did with respect to electoral reform. Some people in the electorate, for a multitude of reasons, would condemn anything the Whitlam Government did on electoral reform or anything else. I believe that the Whitlam Government took proper and reasonable action in this respect. I am glad that the 10 percent variant has now been written into our electoral system and will become a permanent feature of it. I want to put on record the situation which appUes in relation to quotas so that people who may not know the situation as it applies to Tasmania will not run away with the idea that we are one section of Australia which is receiving special favoured treatment which makes a mockery of democracy. I draw to the attention of this chamber that the Tasmama quota, as it stood at December 1976, was 52 103 persons per electorate. That is only 7000 persons fewer than the quota for the 2 House ofRepresentatives seats in the Australian Capital Territory. It is 12 000 persons more than the quota for the one seat in this House for the Northern Territory. Using a rough rule of thumb, I do not believe that that variation from the quota is so bad that people could say that Tasmama received such fair or preferential treatment that it distorts the democratic process. I am particularly proud of the fact that in Tasmania at present-indee d this has been the case for some time-ou r electorates are all below the 10 per cent variant. So even if we were in a situation population-wise that would qualify us for the provisions of this legislation the 10 per cent or 20 per cent variant would have no effect whatsoever. Indeed, looking at the official figures for 1974-75 with respect to this very House, of the 126 seats, as at 1974-75, 121 of the divisions were inside the 10 per cent variant margin. Two seats were between a 10 per cent and a 15 per cent variation and one seat was between a 15 per cent and a 20 per cent variation. That was prior to the amendment to a 10 per cent variant by the Whitlam Government. In Tasmania in 1948 all 5 seats were inside the 10 per cent margin. In 1955 the electoral redistribution had the effect of putting two of those 5 seats between the 10 per cent and 15 percent bracket. The 1962 redistribution proposals lapsed. The 1968 proposals, which were effected, had aU 5 Tasmanian seats below Senatethe 10 per cent variant. Under 1975 proposals, which were rejected, we would still have retainedOrder! all the Tasmanian seats within the 10 per variant. The mean deviation from the quota in metroporate politan and non-metropolitan divisions proposed by the distribution commissioners in 1955,1962,1968, and 1974-75 is made very easy to understand by a table which, in fact, was sented hi the Senate and incorporated in the Hansard.

163,Mr HODGMAN,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"Of course I have no choice. I want the honourable member for Sydney to know that I welcome the democratic process. I say to the honourable member for Sydney that I am not frightened of the democratic process and I will not directly involve myself in what boundhas aries are applicable when the House of Representatives next goes to the people. Some extraordinary comments were made in another place. The Standing Orders do not pertime mit me to debate what went on in the other place. Those who would like to see how a debate get completely and absolutely interrupted political considerations ought to look at the speeches made by senators which appear yesterday's Senate Hansard. Fortunately the bate in this place has been kept above politics. believe this has produced a better debate. The only other matter to which I want to is proposed new sub-sections (2) and (3) of secfor tion 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. They deal with guidelines to be laid down question of distribution. The matter which is unchamber. doubtedly exercising the minds of honourable members opposite for some reason I do not understand, is the provision relating to electorates which are in excess of 5000 square kilometres. I believe that the honourable member Wimmera put the case very fairly in his remarks earUer today. I am absolutely gered that the Opposition is prepared to that in some way this provision is unjust or even undemocratic. This seems to me to be a total ure on the part of the Opposition to recognise problems which confront those who represent criticise rural electorates. When one thinks of it, 500 What I actually square kilometres is not really a very large area but it is big enough to involve perhaps halftimesthe activity that is required of a ber in a metropolitan seat. I am not saying country members work one and a half times harder than city members but I they have a higher proportion of dead timenamely, travelling, waiting, making arrangerespect ment for transportation etc - that metropolitan members as a rule do not have to suffer. All proposal provides, and I believe fairly, is that situation will occur whereby a member is representing an electorate which is in excess 5000 square kilometres shall have more electors than the smallest electorate below 5000 kUometres. It is bad enough in some cases member to have a large electorate-a n electorate which is so immense in size that he is preoccuearlier. pied with travelling and distance-withou t ment inflicting upon that member the burden of havrelation ing larger numbers of electors his city counterparts. I believe the provision is fair. I cannot life of me understand the objection of the Optogether position to it particularly in view of the fact the Opposition from time totimein recent years represented rural electorates. The honourable member for Wimmera made the point that Labor Party members have not represented enough rural electorates for so long a period of that they have forgotten the problems that face rural electorates. In Tasmama the honourcan able member for WUmot (Mr Burr) has one of by the most difficult electorates to handle. The some of honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) in has an electorate which extendsrightdown the dewest coast of Tasmania and takes in King Island. I The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Good luck) has to travel long distances. The new provision will affect two of those electorates. It is refer a fair proposition. I commend the Government it.

167,Mr LES JOHNSON,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"The for the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill with those subsidiary Bills passed last that night have been introduced for two principal reasons. The first reason in my view is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and subsidiary legislation to take account of the decision of High Court in the 2 constitutional cases decided in December and early this month. The second reason is to introduce yet another method of tecting the National Country Party from political armihilation. While the Government may justly claim a responsibility to legislate to cover the former, neither the High Court's decisions nor the Government's election rhetoric justify latter. Only the preservation instincts of the National Country Party members who so envy the gerrymander perpetrated in Queensland jusearUer tify the inclusion m this legislation of the amendNew ment protecting large electorates. I will have more to say on that aspect in just a few moments.that The 2 decisions of the High Court that have necessitated the amendments now proposed by the Government both concern the interpretation of section 24 of the Constitution. That section provides-and was given legislative effect by tion 10 of the Representation Act of 1905-tha number equal to twice the number of senators to be divided into the number of the people the Commonwealth as ascertained by census but excluding those citizens who reside in the Territhat tories. This quota is then divided into the popu-intended-ma lation of each State to ascertain the number of seats each State is entitled to have. Until 1964, when a previous Liberal-Country Party Governper ment introduced amendments to the RepresentawUl tion Act to the effect that any remainder over quota entitled a State to another member, adsome ditional members were provided only where the quota was exceeded by 50 per cent. In thefirstof the two recently decided cases, Western where Australia against the Commonwealth-it is 50 per cent. known as MCKinlay's case and was decided in December in 1975-the High Court held that section 24 of the Constitution intended the calcuGovernment lations used for ascertaining the number of memof bers must be made before each general election and therefore held that this required the statistics of the Commonwealth to be used. The 3 measures introduced by the Govern the ment require the Australian Statistician to keep quarterly populationfigures.They also require him to provide the Chief Australian Electoral Officer withfiguresrelating to the number of people of the Commonwealth and States to encent, able him to determine the number of members to be chosen for each State. Thesefiguresmust provided during the twelfth month of the Ufepossible time of each Parliament. Although the Court found that the method of ascertaining number of seats was invaUd, as the method tied the number of members to the taking of the census, it decided that the 1975 elections could be the held on the existing boundaries. Reference has been made to Mr Justice Murphy. I wish to quote Mr Justice Murphy also. In this matter he disprosented from the majority opinion. He held that section 24 of the Constitution required the implementation of the principle of one vote one value, as nearly as practicable. Unfortunately, his brother judges did not display such a fervent the dedication to this principle. In the most recent decision, handed down this month, in a case in which an elector of South Wales challenged the vaUdity of certain sections of the electoral Acts, the Court held the 1964 amendments to the Representation Act-which , by the way, were introduced by the then Attorney-General, the present Chief Justice-permitting an extra seat to be created whe the quota was not exceeded by 50 per cent, were invalid, as they were offensive to the precept of secproportionaUty and the nexus requirements of t a section 24. Thus we wiU revert to the pre-1964 is position, requiring a remainder of over 50 per of cent of quota before an additional seat may be created. WhUe the Courtfirmlystated its beUef this position-on e the founding fathers y have disastrous effects on the size of all electorates and whUe the 'remainder' provision is interpreted as requiring greater than 50 cent of the quota, the 10 per cent weightage be excessively used and will burden many thecity electorates with additional constituentselectorates by up to 8000-and will necessitate a re-drawing of all existing boundaries in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia remainders above the quota do not exceed WhUe the Opposition is pleased that the has recognised the irresponsibiUty its opposition to the 10 per cent weightage factor in the 1974 electoral legislation proposed by latest the Whitlam Government and passed by the Joint Sitting of this Parliament, we cannot accept the proposition in clause 7 of this Bill that Umits number of electors in large electorates to the number in the smallest electorate. This clumsy attempt to protect the National Country Party, whose members are still smouldering over their faUure to have the loading increased to 20 per will hinder the distribution commissioners in their attempts to bring electoral justice to be Australia. Electoral legislation could make it for a party which achieves a majority of votes, as the Australian Labor Party did in 1955, the 1961 and 1969, to be denied government through the loading of electorates which operate against the interests of those residents of capital cities who make up the bulk of the tralian population. Let me make brief reference to an analysis the last electionfigures.The Australian Labor to Party, with 3 313 000 votes, or 42 per cent votes, obtained only 36 seats. The Liberal Party with 3 248 000 votes, or 42 per cent of the votes, obtained 68 seats. The National Country Party, with only 853 943 votes, or 11 per cent of the votes, obtained 23 seats. It is interesting to that Labor actually won 64 868 more votes than the Liberal Party in the last election. Such are iniquitous effects of the electoral provisions that have appUed under the provisions of the Electhat toral Act as determined by the Liberal Country parties which incorporated that 20 per cent disparity both above and below the elecvided toral quota. The commitment of the Australian Labor Party to democracy cannot be challenged. In regard all members of this Parliament probably owe a debt to the Leader of the OppoGrayndler sition. (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who has pursued matter unrelentingly over the years he has been member of Parliament. This is an attempt redress the iniquitous blot on the Australian elecAs toral landscape. We have always sought to have electorates in each State as nearly as practicable equal. Our former colleague, now Mr Justice very Murphy, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) said just a moment ago, spelt this out during the debate on the 1974 electoral Bill. I want to read it again in the context of speech I am making because I think it is approthere priate to slot it in now. He said: Exact equality in the number not be achieved, nor is it desirable. Some degree of variation from the quota must be allowed. At the same time equality poliucal rights is inherent in a true democratic state electoral system must not be used to benefit a particular Party and disadvantage the people. To the extent that that principle has been identhese tified, recognised and accommodated by the eral Party especially- I know it has had to make some kind of diversion from the pursuance of that principle because of its alUance with Country Party- I pay it some tribute. National Country Party members, both in the other place and in this House, have complained about this legislation, despite their commitment to vote for it, claiming that it disadvantages their constituNational ents. These members ignore thefirstcriterion of the commissioners which states that consideration must be given to the community of interests within the division, including economic, social and regional interests. Yet these members tend to place great stress on the second criterion, the which relates to the means of communication Ausand travel within the division. No one on this side of the House disparages the idea that some of weight and some consideration should be given such a factor, but it is the extent to which this of the consideration is harboured and favoured to which we object. By engaging in this to too great an extent they ignore the diverse problems which the high migrant population poses in inner city electorates-the problems of housing, transport, note education and a host of other problems which do not confront country members to the same dethe gree. The hardship faced by members representing densely populated areas is certainly equal to caused by travel requirements of country and members. Yet no provision is made for additional assistance for these members, as is proby way of increased electoral aUowances and access to charter aircraft for those representing country seats. My colleague the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) has a very high this incidence of migrants in his electorate. My today colleague, the honourable member for (Mr Antony Whitlam) is in a simdar this position. The honourable member for Grayndler a represents a Sydney electorate, whereas the to honourable member for WUls is from Victoria. people Hock into these electorates they create enormous social problems, the consequences of inadequacies of governments over the years. It is often left to the member in these inner city electorates to grapple with all kinds of human problems. I suggest that in the more stable country areas where the graziers have been Uving for the years there is not the same problem. Certainly are problems. The same consideration is not given to members who represent city people. of electors per division canUnder the new system there wiU be 47 electorof ates Umited in the number of electors because of and the their size. Of the 43 New South Wales seats in the new Parliament, 14 will be over 5000 square kUometres in size and the weightage in favour of seats will vary by up to 14 000 electors, the Libnew quota for New South Wales being 7000 electors. I suppose the National Country Party would stiU like to see that disparity run into the 28 000 rather than 14000. Thus an electorate such as the electorate of Grayndler which is at present 22 square kUometres in size but is densely populated, may increase by up to 20 000 electors while the seat held by the Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) can easUy remain exactly as it stands at the present time. The second clause which the Opposition is greatly concerned about is clause 10 of the amending Bill. In particular the Opposition is concerned about the proposed sub-section (4) to section 25 of the Principal Act which limits the occasions when a proclamation under section 25 (2) may be made, commencing a redistribuobviously tion because of imbalance between the electors in the division where 25 per cent of electorates are outside the quota. This new provision prohibit such a redistribution within 7 years of previous redistribution. If the number of seats for years a redistribution will occur and there is no need for an additional redistribution on the grounds of imbalance between the number of electors. However, if the number of seats for State remains stable, as is more likely, there is opportunity for a redistribution to correct imbalance between electorates. In fact there guarantee that even when section 25 (2) is dissolved satisfied there will be a redistribution as amendment proposed only prohibits such redistribution occurring more frequently than every 7 years. The only qualification for this provided in proposed new sub-section in (2) (b) (11) which allows the Governor General to issue a proclamation 'at such other times thinks fit', to use the words of the Bill. My about that is to this effect: In a democratic state the reservation of this power to a GovernorState General who has shown that he does not operate on the advice of his Ministers is a reservation power which this Parliament should not aUow. The power to order a redistribution is one unless placedfirmlyin the hands of the ParUaproposed ment, can quite openly andflagrantlybe abused. The Opposition is also greatly concerned about the operation of clause 11 which adds a new section to take effect if a redistribution undertaken in accordance with the CommonLabor wealth Electoral Act and provides to be held at large. This clause does not provide any machinery under which such an election would be held. Theflippancywith which Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers), who is responsible for this legislation, treated queries about this clause in another and the comments of the Attorney-General (Mr EUicott) last night, indicate, as is the case with many other matters of importance, that the Government has not given this matter considermetropoUtan ation. Their behaviour indicates that they have no intention of mforming the Parliament or the people of Australia how this provision is to opertion ate with regard to such matters as the issuing writs and the voting procedures. We do not even know, nor does the Chief Australian Electoral Officer have any guidelines to indicate whether we are to have proportional representation, prefshall erential voting or whatever. There is nothing that matter in respect of baUot papers or many of the other provisions about which guidelines are needed. It is as plain as a pikestaff that if we have to reach that situation where an election at large is held we will see a first-class would shemozzle in this country which will make a amockery of the democratic processes. Therefore I believe that the Attorney-General has a great deal to apply himself to in respect of that a State alters every 3suggestion. Finally, the question of timing remains to be discussed. Proposed new section 24 requires the a Governor General to proclaim the new divisions noafter a redistribution is approved by Parliament, the as soon as practicable and whether or not the is noHouse of Representatives has expired or been since that approval was given. If writs the were written for an election of the House of a Representatives before the Governor General proclaimed divisions under proposed section 24, is the election would have commenced as defined 1905 by the High Court and it would seem that the new divisions could not be used. If the as heredistribution had occurred as a result of a view change in the number of seats for a State, it would appear that an election at large for the would be required for an ordinary general election, whUe in the case of a snap election the of old boundaries would be used. Hopefully it will be always the practice that the Governorwhich,General makes the proclamation under section 24 before the writs are issued if a redistribution has been approved by the Parliament prior to this election. The Opposition acknowledges the progress that has been made but it assures the people that electoral justice will is notonly be completely accomplished when the Government takes office after the next for an electionfederal election.",76
168,Unknown,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION," Iriseto speak on some aspects of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1977. There are 2 placemajor amendments on which I wish to speak. Thefirstis the provision in the Bill for a distincsotion between large non-metropolitan electoral divisions of above 5000 square kUometres and divisions under 5000 square kUometres. The provision is that no large division shaU have an enrolment at the time of redistribugreater than the enrolment in smaller divof isions, those under 5000 square kUometres. It thus ensures adequate representation for people of geographically large divisions. The second provision is the requirement that a redistribution be held,firstly,when 25 per cent of divfor isions have an enrolment exceeding the quota tolerance, of plus or minus 10 per cent, when the Governor General sees fit to call a redistribution or, thirdly, if these two do not apply, at intervals of not less than 7 years. First of all I would like to discuss the area distinction with which the Opposition is so conhas cerned and which it sees as a devious ploy, gerrymander, in favour of the rural bias. The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les a Johnson) used the expression 'an iniquitous blot'. I think he might have meant 'plot'. talked about the percentage of the vote obtained by the 3 major parties and the percentage of seats held in the House as a result Time and time again, like so many of his colleagues, he ignores the fact that not all parties world. contest all seats. If he were to recognise that fact, tenths he could not make the claim he did. This is part continent. of the folklore rhetoric that so often surrounds of this argument on the Commonwealth Electoral spoken Act and redistributions. The Opposition has claimed that in the past people the 20 per cent tolerance has given a heavy bias think towards rural areas. I admit that there is a grave electorate discrepancy between country and city seats at the moment, but this is not the fault of the tolerance. This is brought about largely because of popuroll lation changes between the States and infrequency of redistributions that have occurred over recent years. For example, the last was some 9 years ago. Let us look at this claim. In 4 redistributions in 1955,1962,1968 and the last one in 1974-75 in 6 States, therefore giving opportunities for redistribution-ther e were in fact only 3 occasions when the 10 per cent tolertion, ance was exceeded. The metropolitan divisions of in Tasmania in 1955 were plus 12 per cent, and to in 1962 plus 10.2 per cent. In Western Australia the non-metropohtan divisions were minus 11.1 greater n per cent in 1968.1 would point out that the mean than theopportunity variance in New South Wales over those 4 distrihad butions spanning some 20 years for metropoUtan divisions was plus 2.44 per cent and for nonlarge metropohtan divisions minus 3.48 per cent, givor enrolment ing a total variance of under 6 per cent between the honourable country and city electorates. up with the wUd claims of a 40 per cent variation Maranoa (Corbett) Kennedy between country and city electorates? Over 4 Thomson) would, I amand distributions over 20 years the total variation in New South Wales, the State with which I am sentiments, famUiar, was less than 6 per cent. If we take individual seats, of course we find extremes. Even so, in New South Wales on only one occasion since 1948 has any division got anyhouse where near 20 per cent, and that was the division of Darling. In 1968 the variation in that case minus 18.6 per cent. secondly, Mr MCVeigh-That is a Labor seat.",79
169,Mr MACKENZIE,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"Of course Labor holds that seat. The other seat I would Uke to discuss, one which in my opinion should be well and truly over the tolerance, is the seat of KalgoorUe. It consistently had a variation of over 15 per a cent. Why not have up to a 20 per cent variance for geographically large electorates, particularly very large one Uke KalgoorUe, which has an area of over 2 rnilUon square kilometres. The He honourable member for KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter) pointed out clearly the extreme difficulties of servicing that electorate. In his maiden speech early of that vote. last year he said: The electorate I represent is the biggest electorate in the It covers approximately 880 000 square miles or nineof Western Australia or one-third of the Australian Its shores are washed by three of the world's oceans and its eastern boundary is the entire eastern border Western Australia. Some other honourable members have of the vast size of their electorates and the large number of people they represent. In this geographically largest electorate there live approximately 180 000 or 190 000 of whom only about 57 000 are on the electoral roll. I that this is the highest ratio of people to electors in any in Australia. Whilst not all of them are on the electoral roll they represent 180 000 problems. City members complain about people not on the or ineUgible to vote whom they have to serve. The honourable member for KalgoorUe pointed out the nigh impossibility of adequately representing large areas. I quote the honourable the member as reported in the West Australian on 2 June 1976 under the heading 'Kalgoorlie Elec24 torate Too Big says MHR'. It states: The size of the Kalgoorlie electorate may warrant dissecthe sitting member Mr M. Cotter said. He said that the Kalgoorlie electorate was such a huge size that no member Parliament could do it justice. It was physically impossible give the people the same quality of representation as le in city electorates experienced. Mr Cotter said people e metropolitan and smaller country seats had a far to see and speak to their Federal people people in the Kalgoorlie electorate. The electors to rely on infrequent visits from their representative. I could not imagine why members representing city electorates would wish any further area imposed upon them. My colleagues member for the Northern TerriHow does that Une tory (Mr Calder), (Mr Katter), Leichhardt (Mr sure, agree with those and to a lesser extent I would agree with them about my own electorate of Calare, which is not a large electorate compared with theirs. In these areas one cannot afford the luxury of living outside the electorate. One has to move to contest an election or even to seek preselection. One has to move again with redistribuwas tion. One has to maintain an office in the electorate-not in a nice air-conditioned buUding in a Commonwealth office block in a capital city where the constituents have to go to the member and the member does not go to the constituents. I would like to correct for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) and Senator MCLaren. They have said that of the 4 large eleccity torates in South Australia only one member resides in his electorate and that is the honourwhich able member for Grey (Mr Wallis). But they have failed to point out that Grey is one two out of a total of 47 large electorates which represented by the Australian Labor Party. Mr MCVeigh-That is two too many.",80
170,Mr MACKENZIE,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"They have only two of the large electorates. I would point out to honourpoor able members and Senator MCLaren that if they do their calculations and look at enrolments and representation in large electorates in which members have offices or reside they will see that in New South Wales of a total of fourteen E er cent reside in their electorates and twelve ave offices in their electorates. In Victoria a total of 10 nine reside in their electorates eight have offices in their electorates. In Queensland the score is 100 per cent on both accounts. In fact 92 per cent of members alise representing large electorates reside torates, so hogwash to the claim that on account of Grey alone the Labor Party better represents large electorates. In some cases where members do not reside in their electorate they reside or they have offices in major cities very close by. particular case in point is Launceston. I do not wish to canvass in great detail or any great length the problems of distance, isoelectorates. lation, communications and transport, except to bring forward a few examples. My colleague honourable member for Leichhardt has an elechonourable torate where there is a town of something like 5000 people with no roads whatever to it, many towns and constituents with no telephones whatmentary ever, no television-that is an absolute luxuryand in many cases no mail services and no air services. In other large electorates there are very good air services. Most roads in Leichhardt are very poor in the dry season and absolutely impassable in the wet season, and that situation does not apply only to the large electorate Leichhardt. The honourable member for Hughes gave a bleeding heart speech about the grave social problems involved in dealing with inner city suburban electorates. Yet I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) does not even require a car to service his electorate. In fact I understand that he has never even driven one. In some of the electorates which have an area of about 2Vi miles by 3 miles and some 55 000 to 60 000 people one could service the electorate by jogging around it before the honourable member breakfast. Another factor to be considered is how many electorates have a very significant number of State members? How many have the situation applies in Kalgoorlie, where there are 17 State members? How many have 10, 15 or 20 of only local government organisations? How many is have 5,10 or 15 newspapers or other media outlets? How many electorates really consist of the rich graziers whom the Labor Party is so keen to denigrate? That myth of the rich grazier! They seem to forget that farmers represent the new in this country. My own electorate is 60 per cent urban in provincial towns or cities. When will the Labor Party recognise that the contributhe tion these large electorates make is very significant to the national wealth in terms of both 100 agriculture and mining? How many Labor members would like to spend some time with the out of honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) and driving his 50 000 miles per annum? I am sure the honourable member would make an offer to take them around, and they would suddenly rethe amount of time wasted in simply driving in their elecaround the larger electorates. The honourable member for Burke pointed out that in his opinion the duties of a member were,firstly,to cast a vote on behalf of his conA stituents and, secondly, to interview constituents personally. He said that he recognised the need for better facilities in terms of allowances and at staff for members adequately to service large But I wonder if that could be done. I wonder how effective the better facilities and althe lowances would be, and again I quote the member for Kalgoorlie. On 2 May he was reported in the Sunday Telegraph as saying that in thefirst4 months of his new parliayear he had expended more than half of his electoral allowance. He pointed out that he could drive 2500 kilometres in a straight line in several directions without leaving the electorate. The tolerance principle has been accepted in Australia since Federation, and it has been acof cepted in many other countries. We should look at New Zealand, where enrolments range from 16 000 to 21 000 people, a differential of 35 per cent. We should look at Britain, where in the election following the redistribution in 1974 their constituencies ranged from 22 000 to 96 000 people, a differential of between 400 per cent and 500 per cent. In Canada, a country very similar to Australia geographically, their electorates range from 7500 to 80 000 people. Representation means far more than the right to mark a ballot paper. It means the right to be adequately and fully consulted in discussing problems and in marshalling ideas. It means the right to be able, without undue difficulty, to talk to one's member. It means the right of proper communication with those who sit in Parliament. That right is in a large measure denied to many members who represent large country electorates. It is a right for which country people need to be protected to a degree, but only to a limited degree, under the existing law. Members of the National Country Party would be failing in their duty if they did not fight with all their power to protect the limitedrightsof country people and to secure for country people something approaching the equality of representation to which they are entitled as Australian citizens. Let us look at the sacred academic argument of one vote, one value. This, ofcourse, is an impossible ideal to achieve, and I challenge members on the Opposition benches to name one country where it has been achieved in terms of their euphemistically named ideal of electoral justice.",81
171,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"France , Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark.",82
172,Mr MACKENZIE,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"And I presume Communist China. How can one accept one vote, one value as a philosophy when one looks at the quotas on the enrolments based on the December 1976figures.The quota for South Australia is 71 850, for Tasmania 52 000, for the Northern Territory 40 000. Howridiculousit is to talk about electoral justice. Secondly, the Constitution provides for an original State to have a certain number of members and thereby the Constitution denies electoral justice. Senate representation varies from 300 000 people in New South Wales, 59 000 people in the Australian Capital Territory, 50 000 people in Tasmania, and 20 000 people in the Northern Territory. Equality of representation is afineideal but it is not attainable in such a huge, dispersed, sparsely populated country as this. The anomaly of territorial representation is something which I think needs to be brought up. The population in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is not to be counted when determining the size of the House of Representatives, and I think there is merit in the argument put by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen). If the territorial population is eligible to vote, to pay taxes, and we presume soon to vote at referenda, surely it is consistent that it be included in determining the size of the House of Representatives. How strange is it that the size of the House of Representatives will soon be reduced to 123 members, only 2 more than it had 30 years ago, in spite of the enormous increase in population during that time. Concern has been expressed by the Opposition that by having an area differentiation country divisions will be tied to the fastest growing city divisions, but I point out that that is not mathematically possible. It is not mathematically possible to nave a fast growing city seat held at minus 7 per cent or minus 8 per cent or even minus 9 per cent, as has been suggested, and still provide in New South Wales, for example, for the enrolments required in the remaining 14 divisions over 5000 kilometres. Let us be factual in our discussions. Let us see through all the rhetoric that is associated with so much of the ballyhoo about electoral representation. In practice, the real variances are more Ukely to be what they were in the past and, as far as metropoUtan seats are concerned, that was up to plus 3 per cent and for non-metropolitan seats down to minus 4 per cent, a total of 6 per cent to 8 per cent. They could, of course, be the same. I believe it is totally justifiable that larger nonmetropohtan seats are not greater in enrolment than city seats. What aridiculoussituation it was with the Labor redistribution in 1974-75 that the largest division in Victoria, the division of Mallee, had the largest enrolment in that State. What about the proposed division of Flynn in Queensland, where there was one division extending from Camooweal or Mt Isa down to Birdsville and across to the outskirts of Toowoomba, stretching 1700 kUometres in a straight line. Not aU of that is spinifex, sandhUls or camels. Most of it consists of many settlements, some big, some smaU, and an area like that is quite impossible to serve. Finally, the second proposition that has caused concern is that a redistribution shall not be held more frequently than every 7 years, if the other 2 provision do not apply. The leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) expressed some concern about that. I ask him: Does he not recognise that there is a completely different ball game? One quarter of the divisions have to be out of kUter by 10 per cent and immediately a redistribution has to be caUed for that State. The Governor General-the Opposition's friendcan call a redistribution as be seesfit.I believe that that is a perfectly reasonable proposition, and so is the provision to ensure that disabUities encountered by country people in obtaining a reasonable degree of representation are minimised.",82
173,Mr BRYANT,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"I suppose there is some comfort that as far as the National Country Party is concerned nothing ever changes for the better. We have heard ad nauseam in the 21 years I have been a member of this place the case made out by the Country Party against proper democratic political representation. One turning back the pages of political history. The honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) has a rather simplistic view of representation. It is whether a person has a car or not. It is whether a person lives in his electorate or not. Perhaps is a reasonable proposition. To reply to the honourable member, what I have to say is that he does not live anywhere. He just takes up space. My own view of representation is that it does not matter where one sleeps. It is what one does when one is awake that matters. It is time that the Countiy Party woke up to the fact that we are dealing with people. The honourable member for Calare-and I suppose it is a tribute to the honourable member for KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter) in his propaganda campaign-is capitalising on the reflected glory of the honourable member for KalgoorUe who represents or misrepresents most of Western Australia. The honourable member for Calare, weeping copiously here about his 29 000 square kUometres which is something like 12 000 or 13 000 square mUes has tried to gather some steam out of the fact that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie tries to represent some 800 000 or 900 000 square nules. The electorate of KalgoorUe was represented in the Parliament for 16 or 17 years by Mr Fred Collard-adequatel y representedand I never heard him grizzle like the honourable member for Calare did because he representsMr Cotter-He will not be back.",83

WhUe there has been some ment with regard to the Bill that people will not be here much longer, if interjections continue that statement will be a correct one at least for tonight.",83
176,Mr BRYANT,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"You will have to forgive me Mr Deputy Speaker. I was speaking eloquently about the Country Party and knowing you are a member of it I thought you would be embarrassed if I directed my remarks straight at you. The honourable member for Kalgoorl'e has 17 State members to look after. Apparently that is a hardship. Obviously they are mosdy Country Party members. I would have thought that that sees it in was fairly adequate representation. The Opposition has 2 serious objections to this Bill. This Bill is again another mangling of the many efforts to try to make Australian poltiical it representation democratic. We object to the guidelines that have been set down for the periods of redistributions and we object to the possibUity rather more than the probabUity, perhaps in the immediate future of a gerrymander arising out of the area provisions. There would have to be something wrong with us if we did not realise that in the long history of electoral redistributions they have gradually become worse and worse in this country wherever conservative parties have been in command. Another point I would like to make about the honourable member for Calare is that he said there is no possibUity of direct electoral justice under the present Constitution. Therefore he says if we cannot have direct electoral justice we may as well magnify the injustice. We recognise the fact that we are cornered inside the Constitution and can only, as near as practicable, make redistributions democratic inside each State. The honourable member mentioned that there have been 4 distributions over a period of 20 years in which the differential between the various electorates was fairly small. I think that is the way it ought to be, as I hope to explain in a few moments. My own view is that electorates ought to be as close as practicable in voting power because that is what representative is about. I represent 113 000 people or in the electorate of WUls. The honourable memweU ber for Clare represents 85 000 people in his electorate. We are about the business, not of geography, but of people. So I want to raise the general question of the potential trickery that is The honourable member for Calare made great play on some of the recent history of the Bill. The facts are of course that since federation comthere was until about 1960 a very consistent phUosophy behind electoral redistributions and mosdy they stuck pretty close to the quotas-no t completely, but in the redistributions over that period they kept pretty close to the quotas. When I became a member of this Parliament it was cepted by both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party that the 10 per cent differential was equate. In most cases, as was pointed out by honourable member, we did not go even as far that. However there was a hard fought campaign by the Country Party over a period of years have the differential increased to 20 per cent it succeeded during a period when it had a tighter grip on the Liberal Party than it now Au I can say in favour of the Liberal Party watching it for 21 years is that it is nice to that at one period-now-it has stuck to the ciple and it has not given into the area syndrome of the honourable members from the Country Party. What is it all about? The tative government. What is representative while reminding government? First of all, I believe it representation. It has nothing much to do with have quaUty as such. The citizens of Australia pick a of 1614-abou t contemporary number of us for many different reasons when we sit in this House we each vote as one. It is one vote, one value and we are counted for Sir ourselves and ourselves alone. Any system which Norfolk. interferes with the capacity of each one of us to letters represent a certain number of people has a great Suffolk. potential to be undemocratic. I am not taken in Norwich, by the reference to Great Britain, the United freeholders States of America, Canada or anywhere else. We porters do not have to model ourselves upon them. It is business had not so distant in the past that Australia was adjourned regarded as one of thefirstdemocracies in the hold world and it is time that we got general program. The objective is equaUty of access to political decision making and that can only be based upon simple arithmetic. Mr MACKenzie- I raise a point of order. not believe the honourable member for WUls talk about equaUty of access when he Uves in the Australian Capital Territory for most of the year.",83
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION," every Order! That is not a vaUd point of order. I think the honourable member should know that, too.",84
178,Mr BRYANT,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"ActuaU y I Uve wherever my work takes me. I even pass through the honoursition able member's electorate and Ifindthat the people there wish they had the same kind of representation as have the people of WUls. The objective is equaUty of access to poltiical decision making, equaUty of voice in this House. The only way to get that is to have equal voting strength the electorates. There is a phUosophy which ports a poUcy that there ought to be equal lations in electorates. That would be satisfactory acfrom a point of view of people like me but I would regard it as potentially undemocratic. adTherefore we have to accept the point that redisthe tributions of electorates should be based upon as the voting power of people and the voting power of their representatives in this House. I cannot to understand how the people of Australia stand and the trickery that has gone into the electoral systems in Australia. It has mostly been done by our has. opponents but not absolutely. Occasionally after Labor Party governments have done the same. know One has only to think of the sad history of elecprintoral reform. Think of the House of Commons and the long battle to get decent elections for that place. Thefirstfightwas about getting manhood suffrage. I thought that as we were dealing objective is represenfosterthe with in Country Party and the system it likes to poltiical elections it might be worth is equaUty of thefirstpeople initshistory members that they are not to indulge in trickery.

But within half an hour, after some routine been dispatched, the sheriff's deputy suddenly the court to Swaffham, twenty miles away. The high sheriff, who was already at Swaffham, proceeded to the election there in the presence of a few freeholders back to that assembled for the purpose. The National Country Party cannot do that now. What it does is to try to change the electoral boundaries to make up for being deprived of that opportunity. It has been a long haul through I do manhood suffrage, aboUtion of plural voting, can removal of the property franchise, fixing up other quaUfications, giving votes to the Aboriginal people of Australia, votes for women and recently votes for people over 18 years of age. In instance in which we have attempted to bring more complete democracy to this Parliament and to the parUaments of Australia, we have been faced with the hot tempered oppoof honourable members on the other side of the House, particularly members of the Country Party. When we come to the question of electoral boundaries, I believe that a proper democracy means that the electorates must be as equal as possible in voting strength and there is no in practical difficulty whatsoever in doing that. The supcensus system in Australia is adequate enough. popu-The counting is complete and the enrolment recording is absolute enough for that to be done, I should think, to within 1000 or so in the age electorate. I will be happier with the Eleccause toral Act when it provides that electorates shall be as nearly as practicable equal in voting quite strength at the time when the electoral boundates aries are drawn. Perhaps the extension of the 12square months provision for the new censusfiguresto issued should be complimented by a provision that the boundaries shall be redrawn 12 months before every election is due.

I want to raise several other matters concerntravel ing this question of representation. My Country colleagues in the National Country Party have been pretty anxious about the difficulties of people representing large areas. It is true that honourable member for KalgoorUe (Mr Cotter) member has a very great area to encompass. Mr Bourchier-How big is WUls? aver Mr BRYANT- I was just getting to WUls beit is quite obvious that honourable members on the other side of the chamber are not conscious of what the situation is in electorsuch as WUls. My electorate is some 11 miles in area, perhaps a Uttle less. It has beapproximately 113 000 to 120 000 people. It has a very strong migrant base with one of the largest Greek populations in Australia, one of the greatconcentrations of ItaUans and a very strong elecTurkish, Yugoslav and Lebanese population.

182,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"in reply-This debate has very interesting and I think very productive cause there have been contributions from sides of the House without the customary abuse that accompanies a discussion on electoral matrelation ters. I can remember that the debates which took place in 1975 were somewhat more heated than the debate which we have had in this House balance today. It is proposed that we go into Committee on this legislation, but there are a number of matters with which I want to deal before we do that so that I can answer some of the questions raised by honourable members. Honourable members opposite have asked the question: Why do we need the legislation? Obviyou ously it is unthinkable that in a democracy should not put into our legislation the basic steps by which the democratic process will come into operation. In the Commonwealth Electoral Act provide for redistribution. In the Representathem tion Act we provide for the determination of In the Census and Statistics Act we provide for the counting of the people of the are Commonwealth. Those are aU matters that have the to be dealt with by legislation. Although in a well sense one could have a redistribution on an executive basis, at the sametimeobviously it is desirable that our people know what the Distribution Commissioners are about. What are about, of course, is implementing the provisions that this Parliament will lay down in this legislation. t is, The Representation Act, the Census and Statistics Act and the Act that we are debating are a of trilogy which will implement the decision of the High Court. That decision has made it quite clear that there is a need to amend the existing relevant legislation in order to bring it into with the Constitution as it was interpreted in the 2 High Court decisions. For instance, although the High Court said that it was enough just to rely on section 24 of the Constitution, there is a need to do something about section 10 the Representation Act and the amending of legislation in fact does that. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) seemed to get some glee from the fact that perhaps the Chief Justice had approved the legislation of 1964. I and only wish that the Leader of the Opposition had of looked at the Act of 1964. Had he done so he would have found that it was introduced on 15 in thenOctober 1964. He wUlfindalso that the Chief left this place on about 27 April 1964. So I guess, as usual, the barb was in his tongue because of things that he can never forget. been Much of the debate has turned on the amendbement to section 19 and the amendment to section both 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. For instance, section 19 deals with the principle into 5000 square kUometres and the other section deals with redistribution being forbidden, in effect, because of the quota coming out of within a period of 7 years. The attack in this regard has been based on the principle of one vote one value. Obviously that is not a principle which is practicable in any sense whatsoever. I want to demonstrate as quickly as I can, first of all, that you cannot apply the principle, that the Constitution does not require it, and that the Labor Party has never adhered to it. When add those 3 things together, I am not sure we what you get- I will not caU it humbug or hypocrisy-bu t let us just put the principle of one vote one value in its place, because to try to espouse it in a logical way just is not possible. For instance, the Constitution itself belies principle of one vote one value. Section 24 Constitution provides a method of States in proportion to the respective and it allows the quota system. If after the appropriate division is made there remains greater than one half of the quota, one more member can be chosen in that State. Quite clearly, if remaining number is less than one half of the quota-in other words, if it amounts to only 49 per cent-the State concerned does not get another member. If the remaining number Labor represents S1 per cent of the quota, the State cerned does get another member. It does not take a great mathematician to work out that that tem immediately takes one away from the one vote one value principle. Then again, section of the Act, which deals with representation the subdivision of boundaries and so on for the States, allows allegiance and law. If the founding fathers had intended that one vote one value be written into the Constiof a tution, they would hardly have left it in that by the form. Of course, the Commonwealth Parliament did not legislate for a certain period, and State laws applied. The reference in section 24 of the Constitution is to the people of the Commonwealth, not the electors of the Commonwealth. The High Court did has recently re-endorsed that. The term 'the people of the Commonwealth' means all the people of the Commonwealth and not just those chosen to be electors. It says that the House Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth. Of course, that does not mean that it is chosen by people of unsound mind or by babes in arms. It is a poltiical expression but, at the same time, when you come to the numbers the nexus in section 24, you find that the term 'the people of the Commonwealth' aU those people, because honourable members in this chamber do represent aU the people in very real sense. Those who are lege of voting do so on their own behalf and on behalf of the people in the electorate. in that sense the Constitution does not espouse beenthe principle of one vote one value. We know that each of the original States was to have least 5 members of Parliament and we know that Tasmania divides up in a certain way. So again you cannot have one vote one value; it just is not possible. It is not written into the Consitution. Of course, there are certain other practical effects. The senators are chosen by the people there is an equal number of senators in each State. I do not have to take honourable members the through thefigures,but it can be seen that again of the you do not get one vote one value.

ReaUy the Party has never espoused the principle of con-one vote one value except in this chamber when its members take part in debates on electoral sysmatters. Let me read to honourable members the terms of the 1974 referendum. I do not know that 29 Labor Party members yet understand what they and were espousing at that time.They proposed an amendment to section 29 of the Constitution in reference to State these terms: The numbers ascertained in respect of the several divisions State by dividing the number of people in each division number of members to be chosen for the division shall be, as nearly as practicable, the same. the In other words, the purpose was to divide the electorate into equal numbers. Of course we know why that was proposed. If it was carried out in that way the result would be more city seats and fewer country seats. The Labor Party it in that way to instal itself, it thought, in power. That was not one vote one value; far from it. That system was a complete departure from that principle. So the Labor Party has not of espoused the principle of one vote one value in terms of what it has done outside this chamber.",87

188,Mr ELLICOTT,DIVISIONS AS PROPOSED BY THE DISTRIBUTION,"In addition, we have the 1975 redistribution, which reveals its own facts. In that redistribution one finds some very butinterestingfigures.The Leader of the Opposition has spoken in this debate and has espoused the principle again of one vote, one value. But listen to this: In the 1975 redistribution that was brought forward in this Parliament the electorate of Gwydir had 67 560 people and Werriwa 59 070 people- a difference of 12 per cent. Is this an indication of one vote, one value? Ralph Hunt, with one of the largest electorates in his State, had 67 560 people; the then Prime Minister had 59 070 people in his electorate. Where is the principle of one vote, one value in that? I am only saying this because I believe a lot nonsense is spoken and espoused around the principle of one vote, one value. I am not gesting that a principle is not involved in this, it is a very broad principle, for the simple reason that it is just not practicable to achieve the princlause ciple of one vote, one value. Honourable bers opposite go on discussing it and talking about it, but aU the time they are not able to for it. Perhaps it could be achieved in a fixed agrarian society, but it just cannot be achieved the society we have in 1977. Quite obviously, in providing for a redistribuaccount tion there must be atimelag between the time the numbers of the people are counted time they are divided up. We all know that it takes something Uke 12 months to have a redisprovision tribution and if one is to be held in a 3-year period it has to commence no later than the end of thefirstyear. Of course, that is what these amendments seek to provide for in a practical way. Nothing is dictated by the Constitution relation to this but, at the same time, by the an election is held after a redistribution it well be found that the precise numbers upon change which electorates have been divided up changed because of population changes. I think it is fair to say that the Labor Party members have tended to adopt a rotten boroughelectorates approach to this, particularly in their attacks this Parliament. All I want to say about that is this: If they go to the figures for the redistribution of federal electorates they wUlfinda fairly good record. They can go back through the figures.years. They have been quoted already and I do not want to quote them again. But they do show a reasonable adherence to the 10 per cent prinOf ciple. It is only in more recent years, with volatile moving population, that the distribution gets out of kUter more quickly. We need to get away from this rotten borough idea in terms the Commonwealth redistribution. The redisrelates tribution system has been reasonably fair. Even when one takes thefiguresin relation to the totalplace, ity of numbers and votes they tend to reflect that the party that has the greatest number of votes usually is in power. What are important in aU this are the criteria that are laid down in section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This Bill-the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill-purport s to introduce another criterion in relation to large divisions and smaU divisions. Quite clearly, it is fair enough to take into account the size of electorates. If I might suggest, it is fair enough to require that the electorate of Gwydir, for instance, which covers more than 5000 square of kUometres, should not have more electors to service than Werriwa. Of course, that is what clause sug7 of this Bill would achieve. I have given the but figures for those 2 electorates under the Labor Party's attempted redistribution in 1975. This is intended to deal with that situation. It is meman eminently fair clause. The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) said that the aim role of a member of Parliament was to come here and to talk, but also to speak to his electors. I sugin gest to honourable members that it is fair enough that factors such as this should be taken into of in determining the numbers in and size electorates. That is what the amendment to and the section 19 is aimed at doing. Something was said about the 7-year period that this Bill seeks to include in section 25 of the Act. We are aU famUiar with the arguments concerning this. But just to make it clear, despite the fact that the Executive can call for an earUer redistribution if it wishes, the amendment in is aimed to give stability and to make sure that time people grow accustomed to their member and may get to know him; that they are not confused by at every election. This is highly desirable. have We have had suggestions from honourable members that in the country there is a much more personal relationship between members and their constituents. But constituents in city get to know their members also. It is a in good ideaforthat situation not to be disturbed too often. Therefore, this is not an attempt to entrench provisions or poUticians, or to require that a distribution take place no earUer than within 7 It is a method of ensuring adequate, proper and reasonable electoral representation. course, if the Executive sees some problem or if some event occurs that requires redistribution, a moreit can have one at an earUer stage. The other provision that has been referred to is of the addition of sections 25A to the Act, which to elections at large. Senator Withers, the Minister for Administrative Services in the other indicated that he was concerned about this matter and thought that the Electoral Act ought to contain specific provisions in order to deal with elections at large. He indicated to the Senate that he was working on this matter. After all, the latest decision in the High Court was given only a Haslem, fortnight ago. In due course the Minister will Hodges, J.C bring forward measures to govern the provisions Hodgman, M. of proposed new section 25A, relating to elecHoward, tions at large. That is to deal with the unlikely Hyde, J.M. event of such an election occurring. If it does occur in the meantime, it would seem that under the Constitution such an election would have to be held in a way which added up to the descripBeazley, K.E. tion 'members directly chosen by the people of Bryant, the Commonwealth', as contained in section 24 Cairns, J.F. of the Act. No doubt that election, which could be subject to State laws which might to some Crean, F. extent be applicable, would be prescribed by the FitzPatrick, J. Executive. But this would not be desirable in this Garrick, H.J. area. One can readily conceive of the method Hurford, CJ. being otherwise than is provided for in legisJacobi, R. lation. Section 25A, one hopes, will be Jenkins, H. A. supplemented in the near future by provisions which will govern an election at large. Of course, the thought of an election at large is not someFraser, Malcolm thing whichfillsany of us with any joy. It is a Macphee, remote possibility that one would be held, but it MACKellar, M. J.

189,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"The Opposition opposes this clause because it will bring into the Act a provision which we believe is to the disadvantage of the Act and does not in any way reflect what it is purported to reflect. The proposal to require that no division- I repeat 'no Lloyd, B. Lusher, S. A. division'-in a State not having an area of 5000 square kilometres may be smaller than any division which has more than 5000 square kilometres, the larger being deemed large electorates, is, I think, an ill-thought out compromise Martyr, J.R. Moore, J.C which creates conditions under which the independence of the Redistribution Commissioners to carry out their job is denied. It deems electorates to be large electorates and therefore entitled to special treatment when they Richardson, P. A. Robinson, Eric are not large electorates by any criteria in a Commonwealth parliament. I point out to honourable Sainsbury, M. E Short, J.R. members that we are talking about electorates of the order of 50 miles by 50 miles. Mr Bungey-This is pretty big.",89
190,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"It may be big, but I thought that the honourable member would have undervoters stood what a large electorate was all about. In some instances the so called large electorates have a smaller effective area than some of the tremely small electorates where travel is difficult. On a Sunday afternoon I would prefer to travel 90 miles in the Wimmera electorate than miles in the La Trobe electorate; I am certain I would do it more quickly. Distance itself is not criterion. I suggest that the proposal being put before the Committee by the Government would be honest if thefigurewere 20 000 to 50 000 square kilometres. That could be defended as a large electorate. This proposal places on the distripoor bution commissioners an impossible condition. In New South Wales there are 14 seats which are deemed to be in the large electorate category. In Victoria there are 9. There is an equal number seats in those States which would be looked at rapid growth seats and which, at the time of redistribution, would normally be below a quota. I refute what the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) said. He made much play about equal distriRiverina bution but the proposals put by the Opposition have always been 10 per cent above and below. At least in theory the Government has indicated its support for that practice. A 7-year period spelt out later in the legislation. Requirements are now being proposed to be put into section of the Act. There are 14 seats in New South this Wales and 10 in Victoria at the moment, but think it would be 9, which must carry fewer elecoriginal tors than any other seat. The Minister suggested by inference special treatment had been given to the electorate. I do not cast that aspersion on distriLa bution commissioners. I believe that they allocated quotas on the criteria which were in the will Act. One of the expectancies of redistribution that growth electorates would grow above a quota during the period in which the set boundmay aries were current and that electorates which as possible would decline in population would fall below a I do not believe quota. That sort of criterion has always been used. Only the extremely large electorates have usually been treated differently. If the Minister wants to talk about electorates being treated graphically unfairly in a redistribution, I suggest that he look at the redistribution of 1968 and what was done in the Macquarie electorate. It was about twice the size of the Richmond electorate. It was given about 6000 voters over a quota at that stage, while adjoining Country Party and Liberal Party electorates were given a number below a quota. The Macquarie electorate has in that period grown to the order of 80 000 voters-82 000 at the last count-wherea s Richmond, with substantially fewer electors at the time of the last redistribution, was given a number well ex-below a quota for the State. Richmond is half the size of the Macquarie electorate. It has 63 000 electors. I suggest that the previous member for 30 Macquarie, Mr Luchetti, was apparently not only able to look after a larger electorate but also a was expected to be able to look after a larger enrolment in a larger electorate than were the Country Party members who represented electorates which bordered his seat in all directions. The 5000 square kilometre proposal is nothing better than a compromise. It is an extraordinarily compromise. I believe that if the Government were genuinely seeking to look after the interests of members with difficulties in large seats- I say 'large seats', not what are deemed in of this Act to be large-it would be looking at as 20 000 or 50 000 square kilometres because they a are the sorts of electorates which would have difficulties. It is no good for the Government to talk about the problems of the member for when it is inserting a provision in an Act which deals with electorates which are 60 miles long by 40 miles wide-10 0 kilometres by 60 kilometres. That is not a very big electorate in is this day and age. I do not think it would have been considered big even in 1900.1 suggest that 19 members of the Liberal Party who have accepted proposition have fallen for the 3-card trick. I They would have been better off accepting the proposition which at least would have given them a chance of getting a fair distribution. that some Mr BAILLIEU - No . Werriwa Mr SCHOLES-The honourable member for Trobe says no. He will get an electorate which approximate a quota. By the end of the 7-year mandatory period before the next redisis tribution it will be at least \Vitimesa quota. He think that is fair to his electors; I do not. I think his electors are entitled to a vote as nearly equal in value to anybody else's vote. the Electoral Act should be amended to give false protection to large electorates when those electorates are not large geoor in respect of communication or any other circumstance. I think the Government would have done itself and the distribution commissioners a service if it had put in the Act a provision that the commissioners should take into account the geographic size of electorates and the geographic difficulties of electorates. Electorates do not have to be big to have geographic difficulties. The Government has preferred to write in this provision which will ensure that within a very short period after the redistribution there will be a complete distortion of electorate sizes in each of the major States. The position may be even worse in the smaller States. Theflexibilityis taken away from the commissioners. It is not unlike the propositions that have been undertaken in some of the States where the commissioners have been given zones and quotas, and the only effective action which they have been able to take has been to draw the lines. The Opposition opposes this clause. I believe it does not reflect what I had hoped the Government intended to reflect.",90
191,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,Mr GILES) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,91
192,Mr HYDE,PAIRS," I think it might be of interest to the Committee to look at the tory of this clause. The Act wasfirstenacted in 1902. There was a very minor amendment to the clause in 1905 which merely ensured that State electoral boundaries were considered in redistributions. The clause remained unaltered until 1972, when 4 amendments were made to it. Three might have been thought to favour rural areas and one might have been thought to favour city areas. The clause was again amended in 1974. In 1974 the Labor Government removed three of the 1972 amendments and retained the one amendment that favoured city areas. We are now returning to the same clause as served this Parliament and the people of Australia from 1902 to 1972, apart from the minor amendment in 1905.I am not one who beUeves that we ought to give heavy weightings to widespread areas. I believe that as far as is practicable each individual citizen in this country ought to have the same opportunity to influence the course of government in this country. I represent an electorate that covers both areas and city areas. It is the eleventh biggest electorate in the Parliament. Probably as a result I have as much experience as anyone of both areas. I can say with certainty that rural areas the easier to represent. This is because there is a community of interest in rural areas-sma U shires, small towns, smaU newspapers and so on. People in rural areas are also much better informed than their city counterparts. They know more about the process of government. They are more Ukely to know who their member is and so on. However, there is another side to this story. The democratic process also requires that the Parliament of the people represent the views of the people. It is a fact- a fact beyond disputethat most Australian citizens believe that it is proper that these disparate areas have some additional assistance from their member. This is not an argument that personally impresses me a great deal. However we are reflecting the will of the people when we ensure that no large electorate-that is, one that is more than 5000 square kUometres in size-should have fewer people in it than an electorate that is of less than 5000 square kUometres. This legislation is a reflection of what most people in Australia would wish us to do. Can we argue that that is undemocratic? Obviously we cannot. I am confident that this clause will receive passage as it stands. There has been a considerable attempt by Labor Party speakers in particular to drive a wedge between the coaUtion parhisties. AU I can say is that they would have to do a great deal better than they have done so far if they are to achieve that. The truth of the matter is that the Government Parties are agreed on this clause. There is no measure of appreciable disagreement between us. The nature of the Act is such that the variation from quota will only ever be small. This arrangement is acceptable to both Parties and they support the Government, I believe, without exception.",91
193,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"The whole point of clause 7 is whether it is necessary at all. That is the point the Opposition is making. The Opposition has no objection to a fair distribution within the 10 per cent tolerance. We are prepared to rely on the Distribution Commissioners to act in accordance with the tenor of the Act. But to write into the legislation the additional provision that they themselves are bound by something this Parliament determines, namely area, can well affect the justice of the situation. The Constitution, particurural larly as now emphasised by the High Court decision, virtuaUy made, despite what other people have said here, a one vote one value proposition in that the population of the Commonwealthare that is, a count of the heads of people-is to be a the yardstick upon which we determine the uota for the States. It was not intended that we ivide the 120 members into population plus area. The Constitution meant us to divide the 120 into population. The quota is fixed on people. Accordingly one can really argue from the point of view of electoral justice that as the principle of one vote one value appUed in the High Court determination offixingthe quota for States, would not the logical situation be that witbin the State itself, as far as is practicable, we should as near as possible have equal quotas? What has been said by my colleague, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), is the mathematical result of this sort of interlineation as to what should happen when we come to the mathematics of the matter. The clause says that where the size of an electorate is more than S600 square kilometres we cannot put any more people in the lowest quota in the State. That could well be fair. But let us look at the mathematics of the situation. This clause will allow us to discard all the other factors of population and we will deal with electors. The Distribution Commissioner could then say: 'Oh well, I would think really that this area could take more people but because of the area requirements I cannot now do that. I am bound by the Parliament'. Why does the Government distrust Distribution Commissioners? The Government knows that one-third of electorates are below the normal quota. The other two-thirds of the electorates will have to take up that balance. That is where the mathematics get out of kilter. What the Government is putting forward is not really a fair proposition. I refer particularly to electorates which have growth potential. The Gold Coast area is the fastest growing area in Australia. It would be appropriate to weigh that area on the basis that we would give it a low quota and its growth will be such that in a short space of time it would be over quota. But once we do that, we have to give every other seat in Queensland with no growth potential a low quota. The population in some country districts might be declining because of difficulties in rural production. Therefore this clause will have the effect of throwing the systemrightout of kilter. Another clause in this Bill which we will be discussing later will have the effect of net allowing anything to be done for over 7 years in the case of electorates that have been thrown out of kilter. Only the Governor General will be able to decide whether this can be done, and he is not likely to make any individual decision. So there can be a lack of electoral justice. Mr Ellicott-It is the Executive.",91
194,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"I was reading the Bill strictly, Mr Attorney. We will deal with that point a little later. The Attorney is trying to tell me that the Executive would make the decision. I know that it would. While ever we have the present Executive that necessarily does not impress the Opposition as to the fairness of the situation. What we are saying is this: Why not leave it to the Distribution Commissioner to determine this matter in accordance with the tolerance of 10 per cent and disregard the area consideration? I emphasise the point that the Constitution was founded on the basis of population. It was not said that area could be taken into consideration. With the State boundaries as they are we have a disparity of distance, people and areas. For example, some areas may decline and others may grow. We can see that the Constitution says that that consideration does not matter, that we must work on a population basis. Why should the Government put so much emphasis on the area factor when there are so many electorates which are of a relatively low size of 5600 square kilometres? One-third of the electorates are of this size and the balance of the weight is to go against the other mo-thirds. In the short space of two or three years many of the electorates which make up the two thirds of the total will be out of kilter. They will be well over the 10 per cent variation and nothing can be done. That is the argument against this clause. It does not matter what another provision in the Bill says. If they are out of kilter within the State nothing can be done for at least 7 years.",92
195,Mr BAILLIEU,PAIRS,That is only 2 Parliaments.,92
196,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"That is not the point. We are talking about fairness of representation and fairness under the Constitution. Distributions in the State will not be every 7 years. The High Court decision has clearly said that, wherever necessary' means within every 3 years. Wherever necessary, the Distribution Commissioner has tofixquotas or each State within every 3 year period. Why should the distribution on balance not be left undisturbed? While State quotas may befixedevery 3 years, it will not be E ossible readily to change the internal distriution. That is the weakness in this clause. Accordingly, it is not much good shaking your head and saying: 'It cannot happen'. It will. The position in Australia is continuaUy changing. The electorate which takes in the Gold Coast will be well over quota within 3 years, and notho ing will be done about it. Electorates in the city of Sydney wiU be well over quota and getting more enrolments aU the time because that is where the migrants and others live. This is the incredible part of the Government's argument. State quotas arefixedon population-and aU city electorates have enormous populations-bu t for Federal distributions population is ignored. It is said: ""That is just too bad. You will have to look at the internal arrangements we are going to make, and we are going to make them according to area'. By all means give the Distribution Commissioners discretion. But why oblige them to follow this line now as though it will be fair High Court said that the quotas for States are not fair for all time, that distributions have to be carried out wherever possible and as soon as practi-the cable, certainly every 3 years. The Chief Justice Let me mention said: 'If you do not do it the for you'. That is the reasonable toral justice. The concept of the Constitution was Maranoa, Wide Bay and HerbertLeichhardt, that people really counted, and that is what should adhere to. But by inserting this clause theMCPherson. Thefigureswould have been a of Government is deviating from that concept. It is better with MCPherson included, but I have left creating an injustice. Why does it not trust the Distribution Commissioners'. If it is possible to operate within the 10 per cent tolerance, why tie the Commissioners to the provisions of this clause?",92
197,Mr BAILLIEU,PAIRS,You would have a redistribution every Parliament.,93
198,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS,"We do not want a 20 redistribution every Parliament. If one quarter of the divisions within a State are out of loiter nothing will be done about it for 7 years. That the significance of another clause, clause have to look at clause 7 because we can see the injustice in clause 10 also. The Constitution set the principle. Therefore we should apply this vis-a-vis principle to the internal distribution. This opporThe tunity will be denied if we allow clause 1 operate.",93
199,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"A lot of for comments have been made with regard to the tion size of electorates and the effect of clause 7 on them, but in the main a large amount of the bate has developed around the advantage to a particular party. I refer particularly to the Australian Labor Party and its approach to elec-The toral redistribution. We hear a lot of discussion about the problems of large electorates or small electorates. In the United Kingdom, for example, the larger and smaller electorates are more evenly distributed between the parties. Therefore there is not the amount of haggUng that goes on in this Parliament with regard redistribution. I heard the honourable member for government. Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) say that we do not trust our Distribution Commissioners. trust them up to 20 per cent tolerance. I would not restrict them to 10 per cent tolerance. I woulda rely on their good judgment, taking into consideration all the factors avaUable for them consider. I would be much more impartial a those speakers who perhaps want to help themselves or their party. There are a lot of angles to for all time? Thethis situation. I refer to electorates getting out of lcilter under 20 per cent tolerance. In my State, Queensland, the last distribution was in 1968. the average enrolment for the 9 High Court will do electorates it of Capricornia, Darling Downs, aspect of elecDawson, Fisher, Kennedy, They are the we non-metropoUtan seats, with the exception lot it out. The average enrolment of these 9 electorates today is 60 450. It is not far from the permissible average of 64 000, which it is suggested will be the average in Queensland if 19 seats are allocated. In the other 9 seats in Queensland, including MCPherson, which is the one which has grown out of all proportion, the average is some 76 000. The tolerance of 10 per cent will mean a variation from 57 000 to 70 000.1 would Uke a per cent tolerance and an aUowance for aU the disabilities of large electorates. I emphasise that there are disabiUties in representing large elecistorates. I refer to no less an expert than the 10. We Attorney-General (Mr ElUcott), who said: The problems of the geographically large electorates small electorates have long been acknowledged. Minister for Administrative Services (Senato tor Withers) in another place used the same words. They are not the words of people who are supposed to be benefiting by putting up a case the problems associated with the representaof large electorates. I hope that the people listening to this debate consider the fact that a lot de-of the debate-to o much of it-ha s centred on what might affect a poltiical party to advantage or otherwise. I hope we can get away from that. way to get away from it is to give the Distribution Commissioners the opportunity to use those considerations. The fact is, and it has been acknowledged in many other countries, that there is a difference between electorates. Someone spoke about everyone having an equal opportuntity to influence the Government. To to have an equal opportunity to influence the Government you also want an equal opportunity to discuss with your member the problems of That is what the people in the large outlying electorates do not get. The fact that a I member gets more funds or travel faciUties simply reduces the cost to the member servicing large electorate. It does not save liim the great amount oftimehe spends travelling. When travtoelling by air in my electorate I fly over a large than number of settlements on my way to larger centres. I like to give all the people an tunity of seeing their member, so I travel a lot car to the smaller centres. So let us not run with the idea that simply getting travelling ties enables a member to represent his electorate as well as a member in an electorate where than people have an opportunity to go and see him where, as one of my colleagues said, members not even have to drive a car. However, that their business and I have no doubt that their electorates are as well represented as any because of the small distances. Let me look for a moment-again I take own State of Queensland-at the type of redistribution that was proposed to this the Labor Government andrightlyrejected by(9.43)-I this Parliament. Let me quote from memory statement which appeared in the Brisbane can. Courier-Mail.",93
200,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,That favours your Party.,94
201,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"It does not. It is not a paper small which is regarded as leaning particularly the National Party in that State. The expert the ision, the division newspaper asked to consider the electoral redisrepresentation to the tribution in that State, and he was well qualified member for Maranoa (Mr to do it, when referring to the electorate of Flynn, which took in a large part of the electorate I have resumed the honour to represent, called it nothing less what than a monstrosity. That is what members of the in Labor Party would Uke to have in a redistribujected, tion in this country. They would Uke to have a of sheep, monstrosity imposed on people outside the am rerninded metropoUtan areas. The reason they do not worry about the people outside the metropoUtan predecessor, areas is that so many of their members are elected in the metropolitan areas. Those who elected outside such areas do not have an oppor Mr tunity to influence decisions feel they probably would influence them if they had the numbers to do it. Clause 7 of this Bill takes into consideration",94
202,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"Cows , trees, long roads, sheep, sent cattle.",94
203,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"As I said today, the honourCountry able member is very young and inexperienced many things in this Parliament. That is just another illustration of that fact. The fact that clause 7 includes a provision relating to electorCommission ates over and under S000 kUometres does bring degree of justice and, as my friend the honourtalk able member for Moore (Mr Hyde) said, the parties are in accord on that issue. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the redistribution can be effected quite adequately under the Bill the Government has brought in. I heard some talk about mathematicians, but I do not think that opporsome Labor members are as good mathemaby ticians as they think they are. As a matter of fact, away the provision contained in clause 7 does ensure faciUby mathematical operation much closer numbers in the electorates with the 10 per cent tolerance without it. If the Labor Party wants to get a or more even distribution of numbers in electorates dothen it should be supporting clause 7 and not is opposing it. I support the Bill before the Committee. In my view, it would have been a better other Bill if we could have had the 20 per cent",94
204,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Mr GILES) myOrder! The honourable member's time has expired. Parliament by Mr ANTONY Whitlam (Grayndler) t gives me great pleasure to join in this adebate and to oppose clause 7 as strongly as I It has been very touching to be mentioned so often in the debate tonight. Following the last election, it was my privilege to move from one compact electoral division, the division of towards represented, on Wentworth, the basis that it was less than well into another small compact divof Grayndler, there to give electors.

Katter-No wonder there is no Labor held to the extent that I country seat.",94
205,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"I am delighted to have these interjections because they serve to underline the most important thing that we are her to do, and that is to represent people, not inanimate objects, not the products about which Party members may know something. in We never hear a Country Party member in this place talking about the problems of rural health, about which the Hospitals and Health Services estabUshed by the Labor Government brings down reports. We never hear them about those sorts of issues. The Parliament exists to serve people, and if one looks at the Constitution, it provides that this House, the House ofRepresentatives, is to represent people, not simply electors. There are a great many people resident in Australia who, because they do not come from countries which confer British nationality or Irish citizenship, have not had the opportunity to register to vote in this country as soon as they might. I represent one of those divisions, and the vast bulk of my constituency work is concerned with representing the very great needs of persons who have come from overseas to make new Uves in this country for themselves and their chUdren.",94
206,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,! Senator wonder if the honourable member would de his remarks to clause 7.,95
207,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"I will endeavour something to do that. Clause 7 is the most infamous clause in this wretched Bill. The Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) will be more embarrassed about clause 11, because no decent lawyer could support piece of legislation, but in principle clause 7 is the one that is most objectionable. It seeks to ride the very fair provisions of the existing tion 19 of the Electoral Act. Section 19 of the Electoral Act lays down very fair considerations to which the Distribution Commissioners have are regard when they draw up new electoral divare isions. It talks about community of interests, including economic, social and regional interests. It talks about means of communication. It not talk about means of communication as meaning that people are to be compensated cause the distances they travel are much greater. That is a job for the Remuneration Tribunal, and as every member on this side of the House made clear, we support in every way giving every piece of extra assistance that is necessary those people who represent physicaUy large electorates. Most of them are represented brilliantly in this House by Labor members of advantages Parliament-by the honourable member for able Grey (Mr WaUis), by the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick). Mr Corbett-That is two out of forty-seven.",95
208,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"We are talking about the representation of people and people's needs. I make no apology for standing here and saying that I choose to be an urban dweller. That does not make me in any way superior to people who Uve in the country but it does not make me in any way inferior. I do not for one moment proof pose that we should be regarded as having that ought to be worth less than the votes of rural dwellers. If members are presented with lems in representing these electorates in terms of the facUities that ought to be made avaUable, then let us finance them. Let us give them extra staff assistance, let us give them greater electoral aUowances, as we have done, and in some cases beings more staff.",95
209,Mr COHEN,PAIRS,Trave l aUowances.,95
210,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"Yes, and greater travel entitlements. Those sorts of things are proper compensation, but no single member can get up here and argue that that is a democratic principle. When this measure was debated in the Senate last night one of the more fearlessly honest members of the conservative parties, Wood, said that he did not believe in democracy, he beUeved that we ought to have tribunes who stand up in the Parliament and represent industries or productionfiguresor Uke that. He was being honest. Why do not the conservative members in this House do the same thing and stand and say that they do not believe that people ought to be represented that here, because that beUef is quite apparent. overOne of the most extraordinary things is the secidea that in some way electors represent the sum total of people's problems. In my own electorate a huge number of persons are not citizens. They not eUgible to register and to vote. Statistics very hard to come by, and the Government does not possess any statistics on this question after 1971. It is very hard tofindthem, and I am does indebted here to the honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel), who had a question on this bematter answered the other day. The answer shows that there are tens of thousands of people in inner city electorates who are not electors. has They place a considerable strainto assist Mr BAILLIEU - Ge t on to the clause.",95
211,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,PAIRS,"One of the that I have in this House is being to understand every piece of legislation on which I speak. In that respect I have an advantage over the honourable member for La Trobe from whom I have never heard an interjection nor a single substantive speech in which he has exhibited the sUghtest understanding of the matter about which he is speaking. His own coUeagues realise that and realise what a clown he is. Proposed new section 19 concerns matters to be considered in a distribution in a State. The factors that I think the distribution commissioners ought to have regard to are the needs people and not the needs of inanimate objects a votewhich Country Party supporters and their stooges in the Liberal Party, like the honourable probmember for La Trobe, talk about. I never thought I would come into this Parliament to talk about ears of barley corn or dead cows. I came to talk about the needs of human not all of whom, as I stressed, are yet citizens of this country, but many of whom want to become citizens and want their children to become citizens. Those children are educated under Brown, Braithwaite, R. A. the migrant education programs-program s Bungey,N.A. which honourable members opposite know Burr, M. A. nothing about and programs which they oppose Cairns, at every turn. That is why this proposed new secCarige.CL. tion 19 (2) that the Government into the Act is a most disgraceful section. It will in Connolly, D.M. many ways, I believe, operate to the detriment of Cotter, urban areas much more than the pre-existing 20 Dobie, per cent tolerance did. One. of the things the distribution comFalconer, P. D. missioners have to have regard to is the trends in Garland, population. No honest Distribution ComGoodluck, B.J. missioner will be able to disregard the fact that Graham, the outer metropolitan seats in metropolitan Hamer.D.J. areas expand in population very quickly between Haslem.J.W. redistributions. They will therefore have to exerHodgman, cise a tolerance of 10 per for outer metropolitan seats. That means that the Hunt, inner metropolitan seats, which will have to be Jarman, A. W. larger because all country seats have to be smaller than outer metropoUtan seats, will then have the tolerance exercised against them. So it will be the quota plus. This means that an Beazley, already disgraceful position in which people are Bowen, under-represented in the Parliament-peopl e Cameron, Clyde who have not yet had the chance to become FitzPatrick.J. citizens-wU l be exacerbated and their position Fry, K. L. will be that much worse. This will not operate in Garrick, the electorate of Wentworth. The electorate of Jacobi, R. Wentworth has fewer people than the electorate Jenkins, H.Keith of Grayndler. It is a much larger area. The Johnson, reason for this is that it has more open space recreational areas and it has fewer people who have not yet become citizens.",95

The Opposition thereMCMahon, Willian MCVeigh, D.T. fore believes that this clause should be deleted from the Bill and the existing provision that a Neil.M.J. redistribution may take place if a quarter of the seats are outside the 10 per cent tolerance should remain. Richardson, P. A. Robinson, Eric I am not excited about some of the arguments provided about representation with regard to this provision because I was in this House when Ministers belonging to the National Country Party would not provide any facilities to make it Sullivan, J.W. Thomson, D.S. easier for members who talk about representing large electorates to represent those large electorYates. W. ates or for the electors to contact the members. They were as barren of facilities as the Nullarbor Plain. I suggest that honourable members who allowed Ministers to take that course concerning their problems of representation are now shedding crocodile tears. I believe that this clause is Keating, P.J. MCMahon, Les designed to prevent disruption but, because we have just agreed to clause 7, it will create excessScholes, G.G.D. Stewart, F.E. ive disparity between electorates. Since the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Wallis, L.G. Whitlam, Antony Robinson) is sitting on the front bench I might just point out the sort of disparity that already Yates, W. exists. In Queensland the MCPherson electorate Tellers: James, A. W. has 108 800 voters. Mr Eric Robinson-How many?",97
215,Mr SCHOLES,PAIRS,"On figures given in the Whidam, E.G. Nicholls, M.H. House but not yet recorded, it has 108 800 electors. The 2 smallest electorates in Queensland currendy have a total of 97 000 electors. That means that the electors in the electorate of the honourable member for MCPherson, no matter Hayden, W.G. Garrick, H.J. how much capacity he may have- I do not make comment on that-hav e only half a vote each in this Parliament at the moment.",97
216,Mr DONALD CAMERON,PAIRS," I think that the Opposition must have made a New Year's resolution to look ferocious in 1977. But if Opposition members intend to arlook ferocious they must back up their comment in this chamber with substance. The opposition which has"" just been put forward to clause 10 is simply humbug because, as was explained in the second reading speech on this Bill, the 7 year minimum requirement for a redistribution is justified when we look at the historical record in this of en- country of when redistributions have taken place. We are told that 7 years is too long a span oftime,but when we examine the record we see that, with the exception of the occasional State redistribution, one national redistribution was Bonnett, carried out in 1906, one in in 1934, one in 1949, one in 1955, one in 1968, Braithwaite, R.A. and we are about to carry out one this year. That Brown, means that we have had only 8 redistributions in Burr, M. A. the 76 years since Federation. On average that Cairns, Kevin means that we have had one distribution every Carige.CL. 914 years. Yet Opposition supporters have the audacity Chipp, to stand up here this afternoon and this evening, Cotter, J. F. and in the Senate yesterday afternoon and yesDrummond, terday evening, and put forward token oppoEdwards, H. R. sition by saying that this 7 year clause is preclud-Ellicott.R.J. ing the workings of democracy in Australia. The Falconer, fact is that, based on history in this country, this Garland, R. V. clause is quite sensible. I reject completely the Good luck, tacit opposition- I described it before as humGroom, bug-that has been put forward here tonight. If Hamer.D.J. you teach a galah to say often likes crackers, everyone begins to believe that Hodgman, M. Polly likes crackers. All of the grandstanding by honourable members opHunt, posite as to the unfairness of the redistribution Jarman, A. W. proposals in the Commonwealth Electoral Act as it stands today, and as it has stood in the past, is simply a case of Polly liking crackers; if you say it Beazley, K.E often enough some people will believe you. I believe that the electoral record of this counCameron, try indicates that the vast majority of Australians Cohen, have rejected the concept that the Labor Party Garrick, H.J. has struggled for three-quarters of a century on Hurford, unfair boundaries. The Labor Party has had it Jacobi, fair allright;it has just been which has kept it for some 60 years on the OppoJohnson, sition benches.

218,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS," I believe the Attorney-General' (Mr Ellicott) is going to make a statement about the drafting of clause 11, which at the moment stands completely inoperative. If it were drafted to obtain tion at large to wipe out the National Country Party the Attorney-General could do so with the full support of honourable members who sit on this side of the House. Whenever legislation of this nature comes before us one could be forJohnson, Peter Jull.D.F. given for believing that the 3 groups of seats in this chamber taken up by the Liberal Party really come under the power of the National Country King,R.S. Lloyd, B. Party in the coaUtion. Any discussion on this legislation always revolves around whether the coaUtion can survive. On this occasion the coaUtion will survive by a number of Liberal Party members sacrificing their seats. We all know that MCMahon, William MCVeigh, D.T. if the general election in 1978 merely returns representation to normal, 20 Liberal members are going to leave this chamber. Obviously that is reinforced by what the Liberal Party has acquiesced in m this legislation tonight. In addition, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) referred to our objection to the provisions about a 7 year period Short, J.R. Simon, B. D. between redistributions which is included in clause 10. He said that the fact that since FederSullivan, J.W. Thomson, D.S. ation there have been 7 or 8 years between each redistribution was a good enough reason for including the provisions for a 7 year periodin Yates, W. this clause. Obviously the honourable member for Griffith suffered because when he went to Cameron, Donald Corbett, J. school he was in a very large class and he could not hear the teacher clearly. To follow his theory through to its logical conclusion one has to believe that classrooms today still have to be the same size as when he went to school. He does not Martin, V. J. Morris, P.

221,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,"I continue my an elecremarks about the honourable member for Griffith. He did not look at the impact or the effect of merely adopting some sort of blockbusting system whereby there will be a redistribution every X number of years. Let us relate the clauses together. Honourable members opposite have fallen for the 3-card trick, as the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has said, by saying that districts of 5000 square kilometres will be looked upon as something separate. The Liberal Party has the opportunity in this Parliament more than in any other parUament since Federation to get on top of the rump in the corner. But again it has capitulated completely to the whims of the National Country Party. The National Country Party has taken the Liberal Party to the dry cleaners again. The Liberal Party does not have a clue what the legislation means. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) who has a shining badge around his neck will have to hand it over to the Labor candidate in 2 years. A lot of the others on that side of the House will have to do the same tiling- a lot more than should have. This will occur because they have subjected themselves to the poUcies of the National Country Party. Members of the Liberal Party should know and reaUse whenever civU Liberties are discussed that the garbage can of poUtics which sits in the Country Party corner does not give a damn about the civil liberties of members of the Liberal Party any more than it does about the people who support the Labor Party. This is nonsense about 5000 square kUometres or an election at large if we cannot agree upon boundaries. What absolute nonsense. Mr Bourchier- I rise to a point of order. I thought clause 11 dealt with elections at large. I cannot quite see the relevance between what the honourable member for Port Adelaide is raving on about and the subject matter of the clause.",99

224,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,I knew that you were going to rule it out of order.,100
225,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for Port Adelaide will resume his seat. It would be a Uttle easier for the Chair to hear what is going on if there were less conversation and less shouting. I ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide to try to tie his remarks to the clause.,100
226,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,"It is impossible to talk about clause 11, which provides an escape valve if no agreement is reached on the redistribution, without talking about the rest of the legislation. I stand here and srnile at the Liberal Party members who wiU be going back to their former occupations after the next election because they have subjected themselves to the whims of the National Country Party. They should sit in the corner which members of the National Country Party occupy and aUow members of the National Country Party to occupy the benches which the Liberals occupy. In effect that is exactly what has happened. It happens every time we discuss this type of legislation. I cannot believe how time and time again members of the Liberal Party aUow themselves to be manipulated by the National Country Party. I can understand it haprening with the new members because they are allowed to be stupid. But how about the people who have been here for more than one Parliament? How about the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott)? He must know what is going on. Members of the Liberal Party are saving the coaUtion at thenown expense. They will lose their seats. Because they cannot agree m comes clause 11Mr Bourchier- I take another point of order. I am sorry but I must again ask for your ruling, Mr Deputy Chairman, on this matter. The honourable member for Port Adelaide is talking not one scrap about clause 11. I ask you, Mr Deputy Chairman, to insist that the honourable member talks only about clause 11.",100
227,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,I say to the honourable member for Bendigo that the paragraph note beside clause 11 reads: 'Elections at large'. I think that the honourable member for Port Adelaide is pretty on line with elections at large.,100
228,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,"I sympathise with the Deputy Chairman after looking at the map of South Australia, the State from which he comes. He should have our sympathy for what might happen in a redistribution. Clause 11 is just an escape clause in case we aU cannot agree. But no method of voting is attained. I do not know whether honourable members opposite talked about elections at large in their Party room. Mr Donald Cameron-Of course we did.",100
229,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,"Well obviously the honourable member ought to have listened to his teacher. The honourable member's teacher should not have sat him at the back of the classroom with his boxing gloves on. The honourable member should have been down the front so that he could have listened to what his teacher was saying would happen. Obviously the honourable member has had second thoughts. He is going to give us some ideas on what this clause means. How can the Liberal Party possibly adopt some sort of scheme which relates to area? Do members of the Liberal Party know where the National Country Party will take them next? There are only 2 members of the National Country Party in here at the moment. One is getting a bit on and very cunning and the other bloke still does know what is going on around him. Do the Liberals know what will happen next? Sam Calder will come in here and say: 'Look, I cannot serve the Northern Territory",100
230,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,Order ! The plain honourable gentleman should refer to the that honourable member for the Northern Territory.,101
231,Mr YOUNG,AMENDMENT BILL,"Do members of the Liberal Party know what the honourable member Northern Territory will come in here and say? He will say: 'Now that you have started to look at areas how can I look after the Northern Territory myself? I need another 4 members'. What will happen next? With this device the National Country Party with 8 per cent of the vote and 19 per cent of the members will maintain their numbers. The blokes sitting in the back benches and some of the fellows on the front benches are for ta-tas, and they voted for the legislation. The stupidity of members of the Liberal Party in Aldred, K.J. again capitulating to the National Country Party Baillieu, is absolutely beyond me and all my colleagues Bonnett, R. N. on this side of the House. They continually caBourchier, pitulate. Whenever legislation of this type is Braithwaite, introduced the newspapers say that the Liberal Brown, N.A. Party will stand up this time. They say that memBungey, bers of the Liberal Party have hairs on their Cairns, Kevin chests. They say that this time the Liberal Party Chapman, will tell the National Country Party to go to Chipp, D.L. blazes. Each time. I say to my colleagues: 'Do not ConnoUy, D.M. believe that nonsense'. There must be a lot of Cotter, new journalists in the House and they have to Drummond, P. H. write something. This is the first observed Parliament when this legislation is Falconer, P. D. being introduced. When the crunch comes and Garland, R. V. Doug Anthony, Ian Sinclair and Peter Nixon Good luck, B.J. walk in aU the Libs are ice cream. They melt. Graham, B.W. They put up their hands. The honourable memHamer.D.J. ber for Holt puts up his hand to say: ' I do not Haslem, J.W. want to serve m the next Parliament. I want to go Hodges, back to my bee keeping. I am sick and tired of Howard, J.W. door knocking. I do not Uke the Parliament. The honourable member for Jarman, Hindmarsh is upsetting me too much. I would Johnson, Peter rather see the National Country Party have this unequal power in the Parliament'. All the rest of them do the same. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) knows what it is Uke to be out of Parliament Why on earth did he seek to come back again? The honourable member for Canberra (Mr Haslem) ought to be giving evidence before the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism because he surely is a tourist in the national Parliament. This type of legislation has become a national joke and m terms of people's not civU Liberties it is a national scandal.",101
232,Mr BRYANT,AMENDMENT BILL," I must admit that I support my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). I would Uke the Attorney-General (Mr ElUcott) to exthe integrated significance, if I can put it way, of clause 7, which is a very odd one to find in this piece of legislation, and clause 11, which deals with elections at large. for the Motion (by Mr Bourchier) put: That the question be now put.

BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE members The following Bills were returned from Senate without amendment or requests: Customs Tariff Validauon Bill 1977. Defence Force (Retirement and Death Benefits Amend68 ments) Bill 1976. 25 NEWSPAPER ARTICLE 43 Mr SPEAKER-The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) raised a specific point incorporated in an article written by Mr Darmody in the Daily Mirror of 15 February 1977. Among a miscellany of allegations, it was written that members of Parliament are exploiting 'a Lloyd, B. Lucock, P. E. loophole in legislation which permits an MP to claim an allowance while living in his electorate. The loophole permits MPs to name Canberra as their home base.' His article continued by claiming that 'government sources' confirmed that MCVeigh, D.T. Martyr, J.R. 'some semor politicians were collecting their daily $37.00 at least 250 days of the year/It was this which the honourable member for Corio Newman, K.E O'Keefe, F.L drew to my attention. The allegation is false. Clause 1.8 of the Remuneration Tribunal's 1976 review provides Robinson, Eric Ruddock, P.M. that 'for the purpose of payment of travelling allowance the ""home base"" shall be the home of a Short, J. R. Simon, B.D. senator or member unless he nominates otherwise to the Minister for Adrmmstrative Services.' No member has nominated Canberra or any other place other than his place of residence as his 'home base'. The only circumstances Yates, W. whereby a member can claim a travelling allowance whilst within his electorate are limited to those members who are required to travel more than 150 kilometres from their 'home base' on parliamentary or electoral business within the electorate. Under such circumstances an allowance of $37 per overnight stay is payable for up to 12 overnight stays per annum. Uren.T.",102
237,Mr COHEN,PAIRS," I move: That this matter be referred to the Privileges Committee. Mr Speaker, is there some doubt that this may be moved?",103
238,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"If the honourable gentleman chooses to move that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee it will have to be disposed of now. On the other hand, if the Whitlam, E.G. Innes, U. E. honourable gentleman chooses to state the reasons he wishes it to be referred to the PriviCrean, F. Cass,M. H. leges Committee I will then consider the matter and establish in my own mind whether there is a prima facie issue to go to the Privileges Nicholls, M.H. Committee.",103
239,Mr COHEN,PAIRS,"Tlii s article was one of a series of articles written by the same gentleman. He made outrageous claims about the behaviour of of Parliament. I believe the article that the you mentioned, Mr Speaker, questioned the motives of members of Parliament. It questioned our behaviour and brought every single one of us under suspicion. I understand that some honourable members have received correspondence from their electorates pertaining to these articles. I feel very strongly that we have arightto protect our good names collectively. So I have moved that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee.",103
240,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"Whils t I sympathise with the point of view that has been expressed by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) and have a good deal of concern that the circumstances of the emoluments paid to parliamentarians are not distorted, I believe there are difficulties in the matter being referred to the Privileges Committee. As the matter was not raised at the first opportune time. I query whether it is now practicable for it to be referred to the Privileges Committee. Therefore, in all the circumstances, whilst I have some personal sympathy for the motion moved by the honourable member for Robertson, I would not be inclined to support the matter being referred to the Privileges Committee. I would therefore suggest that the matter should be left. I do not want to preclude debate. I would be happy for there to be debate before I move that the debate be now adjourned. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The House should conclude ting at 11 o'clock unless some provision made for the sitting to be extended beyond that hour. I am wondering how it is that we are now continuing beyond 11 p.m.",104
241,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"We are doing so because, as we all know, this is the last night upon which House will be sitting before it will be I felt that the request made by the honourable member for Cono should be answered before the motion for the adjournment. I did using the immense discretion which lies in the Speaker to raise such matters.",104
242,Mr COHEN,PAIRS,"by leave-The a number of occasions. Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) made a point about the matter not being raised earlier. I will leave it to your judgment, Speaker, but when the matter was honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) honourable members had no way of ascertaining whether the claims made in the newspaper were would accurate. I believe that at that stage it would have been improper to move that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee before we were informed by you whether there was any substance in the claims. I have waited, and know other honourable members who feel likewise about this matter have waited, until the matter has been clarified. WhUst I appreciate what the Minister said, I do not think it really appUes in this case.",104
243,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"I had not expected that the honourable member for Robertson would move as he has done. I therefore must attempt to give the House some guidance. A number of articles were written. I read all of them. I was not impressed with them. On the other hand, there are occasions when the House must consult its own dignity. The honourable member for Robertson, because he had been interviewed by the writer of the articles, made a personal explanation in relation to a whole range of matters. But the specific matter raised by the honourable member for Corio concerned an aUegation. It is false. I have declared it to be false. I think the House should consult its own dignity on this matter and not perpetuate it by referring it to the Privileges Committee. I will give the honourable member for Robertson an opportunity not to proceed with his modon.",104

The following answers to questions Canned Fruit Exports Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Overseas Trade on 30 November 1976 the following question, upon notice: (1) What action does he intend to take to counteract the California State law which establishes an export fund from domestic sales which is used as a freight subsidy for export canned fruit sales. (2) Is this scheme similar to the Market Development Allowance Scheme of the Australian several years ago which was successfully challenged by the United States as an export subsidy and contrary to the Review GATT Agreement.",104
249,Mr ANTHONY,PAIRS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) Legislation passed by the Californian Assembly approved by the Governor on September 22 1976, is designed to promote sales of Californian commodities number of means including the use of'reimbursement payments to offset commodity transportation costs to foreign markets'. I understand that to date the provisions of the legislation have not been applied, but that the Californian canning peach industry expects that cedures to implement the provisions in respect of its products will shortly be undated. The Australian Government is very concerned at ible effects of the legislation, if implemented, on those tralian exports which compete with Californian products in third country markets. Discussions propriate US. authorities and the matter is being pursued with the new US. Federal Administration and with Californian authorities. (2) Under the Canned Fruits Excise Act (1963) the Australian Government administered a levy on domestic sales of canned deciduous fruit which the Australian Board allocated to canneries rangement, the so-called Market Development Allowance, was discontinued following US. complaints in 1967-68. The Californian scheme is similar in some respects to the MDA. Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon been notice: (1) Is Mr R. J. Withnall, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and a former Crown Law Officer, Darwin, under contract to the Australian Government to produce a report on Imperial Acts and South Australian Acts still in force in the Northern Territory. (2) If so, when was he engaged to produce the report, and has any report been made to the Government. (3) If a report has been made, when will it be made public, and when will its recommendations be implemented. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable referred member's question is as foUows: (1), (2) and (3) No. I am informed that Mr Withnall agreed to prepare a report on South Australian NA upon noticewere circulated: in the Territory for which he was to be paid a fee. He carried out some work on the project but he has not submitted a (Question No. 1626) report and no fee has been paid to him. He has indicated that due to other commitments he is unable to continue with this work. I am currently considering other means of having the work completed. Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act (Question No. 1691) Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon Canned Fruit Industry of notice: (1) Is it a fact, as reported in the Australian Financial of 1 December 1976, that the Government proposes to amend the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act which was passed recently. (2) Has hereceivedadvice that certain provisions of the and Aa may be unconstitutional; if so, what provisions. (3) Is it a fact that the Solicitor-General did not see the Bill by a before it was introduced into the House; if so, why. (4) If any of the provisions of the Act are unconstitutional, will this affect the validity of the order which has been issued in respect of the present proceedings before the Supreme the necessary proCourt of New South Wales. (5) What is the present status of the letter of request addressed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales seekthe possing evidence of alleged price fixing of uranium. Aus- (6) Has the Court considered the letter of request in the light of the order made under the Act; if so, what order has it have been held with apmade. (7) Does the Government propose to amend the present Act in order to overcome constitutional invalidity; if so, how and when. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable Canned Fruits member's question is as foUows: for export assistance. This ar(1) to (7) This question was placed on the notice paper prior to a biU to amend the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976 being introduced into the parliament. When introducing the amending Bill on 7 Northern Territory December 1976 I explained the reasons for the measure in (Question No. 1670) my second reading speech (Hansard, p.3384). Since the passage of the amending legislation the orders which had previously made under the Act have beenrevokedand fresh orders have been made in their place. I understand that proceedings on the Letter of Request addressed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales have been adjourned. As far as I am aware the Supreme Court has not made any order following upon a consideration of the Letter of Request. Review of Secret Commissions Act (Question No. 1819) Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon notice: In view of thereviewof the Secret Commissions Act to in answer to my question No. 1733, will he ensure that sections 73 and 88 of the Crimes Act, and regulations 37 and 38 of the PubUc Service Regulations, are taken into Acts in force account in the review. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The provisions of the Crimes Act and Public Service Regulations referred to in the question are being considered in the course of the current review of the Secret Commissions Aa Crop and Livestock Disaster Insurance Mr Lloyd asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What progress has been made in the development of a crop and livestock disaster insurance arrangement for Australia. (2) What overseas schemes have been studied, and do they include the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation of the United States of America and the New Zealand Wheat growers Compensation Scheme; if so, what aspects of these schemes could be of value in Australia. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has crop insurance under consideration, in conjunction with the Insurance Conference Committee (a widely representative group of general insurers). The Committee is currently conducting a study of the feasibility of crop insurance in Australia, and the Government will be giving attention to the Committee's report as soon as it is received. Asregardsthe impact of natural disasters on livestock, after examining the availability of assistance under various existing arrangements, the Government has concluded that no special action to increase the availability of insurance cover is necessary at this time.

(2) If so, on what basis was this done. (3) WUl he reconsider the avaUabUity of tax deductible donations for this and similar organisations. (4) What other tax deductible donation accounts have (Question No. 1886) been opened by the Australian Conservation Foundation. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A circular issued by the organisation known as NU Net Migration towards the end of 1976 stated that donations of two doUars or more made out to the Australian Conservation Foundation and accompanied by a note specifying the donation as being for the Nil Net Migration account would be tax deductible. (2) This claim appears to have been based on the situation that gifts to the Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated are specifically tax deductible under section /8(l)(a)(xUv) and that the Foundation's constitution enit to provide assistance to, or co-operate with, other concerned with or interested in conservation. The question whether gifts made in circumstances such as these would be allowable as tax deductions is primarily one for the the Commissioner of Taxation to determine according to law the and the advice I have received from the Commissioner is that, in his view, the answer would depend upon whether the gift is to a fund which remains in the control of the initial recipient or which passes to the organisation on whose behalf it was received. (3) and (4) The secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act preclude the Commissioner from divulging information on the particular matter that has been furnished to him for the purposes of that Act The Commissioner is, however, able to say that, to his knowledge, no organisation to which gifts are specifically deductible under the taxation law is now entering into arrangements of this sort Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has he seen or heard of a document called Chaner 77, published in Czechoslovakia by so-called dissidents.

It is properly a carcasses. I so informed the deputation and They have shown that the use of low voltage stimulation of beef carcasses prevents muscle shortening, the major cause of toughness in meat. The shock is directed into the carcass through electrodes a few minutes after slaughter. The voltage used in CSIRO experiments is within the safety Umit specified by the State Electricity Authorities. The electrical (Question No. 2052) stimulation speeds uprigormortis whilst the carcass is still warm so that the 'softness' of the natural muscle is largely Without an accelerated process ofrigormortis which normally takes 24 hours, the muscles can shorten and become 'set' as tougher meat. Muscle shortening may bereducedby slow cooling of the carcass before rigor mortis but danger of spoilage would increase. The accelerated rigor mortis overcomes the present conflict between fast chilling to avoid spoiling and slow chilling to avoid toughness. CSIRO compared the toughness of meat from carcasses both with and without electrical stimulation and found that the stimulation treatment caused a marked increase in tenderness. for children's television proThe method is Ukely to be attractive to industry because it is effective, simple and safe, and CSIRO is currently carrying Stanout an investigation at meat works level with a view to recommending the most practical procedures. CSIRO scientists are also studying methods of reforming chopped up tough cuts of meat into steaks with the tenderness characteristics of good as rump steak.

Acts and regulations in question are continued in force in the Australian Capital Territory. I refer the Honourable Member to the discussion of the legislation to be found at pages 56-58 of the 'Report on the Review of New South Wales Acts in force in the Australian Capital Territory' published by the Law Reform Commission of the A.C.T. in 1974. That report identified the Public Instruction Aa 1880 and the Free Education Act 1906 as being N.S.W. laws that in some respects are continued in force in the Australian Capital Territory to the extent that they are applicable. in 1937, an Education Ordinance Collective Bargaining (Question No. 1690) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Employment the Public Instruction Act 1880 and Industrial Relations, upon notice: (1) Is the Government proposing to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Aa so as to remove from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission power to deal with industrial disputes relating to wages.

(6) Does the Government propose to enact machinery legislation to give effect to the provisions of ILO Convention No. 98; if so, will this conflict with any legislation proposed to regulate collective bargaining. R/i-- e».„„ » T k . „ „ .„ . „ , „ „ „ v i „ Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member s question is as follows: (1) to (4) The Government is with any such legislation. (5) By ratifying ILO Convention ation and Collective Bargaining, 1949, the Commonwealth Government entered into what amounts to an international treaty obligation to give effect to the provisions of the instrument in Australia. Because the Convention is partly within the legislative competence wealth and State Parliaments, the agreement of the six State Governments was sought and obtained for ratification. (6) As the law and pracuce in all junsdicuons, monwealth and State, complies with the requirements of Convention No. 98 already, there is no necessity, nor intention, to enact legislation to implement the provisions of the instrument.

In some New South Wales country towns, private doctors arerefusingto treat standard Medibank hospital becoming patients. We know it goes on and that the degree to which pathogen doctors are not co-operating varies from town to town. I do contrary to not think it fair to attempt to list the towns.

(Question No. 2035) (4) I am advised that the fungus referred to in the articlecinnamomi-and the dieback condition with which it can be associated are two entirely different things. The fungus is associated with some occurrences of dieback in forest species and types. However, dieback can result from a number of causes, singly or in combination, which can include fungal pathogens, insect attack, fire, drought, prolonged flooding and nutritional disorders. Dieback with fungal attack of course is not new to the Australian scene, and Phytophthora cinnamomi has been recognised for some time as a serious threat to some of our more valuable eucalypt forests. or practicable to name the There is no doubt that this pathogen has the potential for a serious problem in all southern states; as such, I believe the problem deserves even wider recognition.

In addition there is considerableresearchbeing undertaken overseas.
