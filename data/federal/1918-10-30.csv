Mr Watt (Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister andTreasurer) [3.1] -(B y leave.)-It is my'- melancholy duty to announce to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House, the death of the Honourable J vmes Chester Manifold. On Saturday last it came to the ears of Ministers that the late honourable member, who was returning to Australia from England, by way of America, 'had boarded a steamer at San Francisco in sickness, and I asked the Gtovemor-Qeneral to forward to the British Consul at Honolulu the following message:Please ascertain by wireless and advise urgently the condition of health of Chester Manifold, 'passenger on a steamer en. routs from San Francisco to Australia approaching Honolulu. To that message the following reply was received:With reference to your telegram 26th October, Chester Manifold died on the 23rd October, and was buried at sea. This intelligence came as a great shock to the Government, and will he received' by honourable members on both sides of the House, and by the public generally, with a feeling of the deepest regret. Mr Manifold was elected, in 1901, member for the division of Corangamite in the first House of Representatives, and retired voluntarily in 1903. For ten , years he abstained from publio life, and then in 1913,' at the request of his party, re-contested and won the Western District seat, which he held thenceforth to the time of his death. He has been taken from us at the comparatively early age of fifty-one. He came of a well known and honoured Western District family whose name is a household word throughout Victoria. In sporting life, in church life, and in public life alike he was honoured and respected. To me who had the privilege of his acquaintance before he entered Parliament, he seemed the best t3""pe of the true Australian gentleman. The late Sir George Turner-the first Treasurer of the Commonwealth, a man who endeared, himself to everyone who met him in public life, and retired full of years and honours from his work in this House--ono e said, "" I wish we had more men in public life like Manifold.""I think I express the opinion of every man in this Chamber when I say that Australia could not afford to lose, such a character. Mr Manifold's generosity was proverbial. He gave freely *o all great patriotic, and charitable undertakings, and he gave unostentatiously. Those best able to judge inform me that during his career he gave away moTe than two substantial fortunes. One of the latest instances of his munificence was the gift of ah estate on the Richmond River,- New South Wales, worth £30,000, which he cheerfully and voluntarily vested. in a local oommittee for the repatriation of soldiers who went to the war from the Richmond River district. His gifts tn the Church of England were on a lavish scale, and the most recent instance of his liberality that bias come to my knowledge was his action in leaving his cheque for £500, with an appreciation of the work of the institution, after a visit to St. Dunstan's Hostel for Blind Soldiers in London. Those who come from the district in which MT. Manifold .was. born, and who know him best, speak in terms of unmeasured praise of his generosity to his tenants, his workmen, and to all with whom he was brought into contact in social, business, and private life. Notwithstanding his great wealth, inmotionfluence, and generosity, Mr Manifold was a simplo, unaffected man, and probably appreciation the most popular member of this House in OUT' time. He was a man against the whose career and memory no one would say a word of detraction, and no word has ever been said in derogation of him. The sporting public knew him as a sportsman. They'knew when his colours were up that his horses would run for a true lover of the sport, for a man who was in the game, not for what he could make out of it, hut for sheer love, of the sport. No more honourable in'an ever took his seat in this Bouse. He was courteous, kind, and tolerant, and showed no bitterness towards opponents, whether local or general. He spoke here but seldom, but his advice, when offered, was simple, sound common sense, such as. honourable members appreciated. When, on the second occasion since the war began, he was leaving for England to see his son, who had been serving in the trenches, and other relatives, the Government took advantage of the opportunity to ask him to look into conditions generally surrounding the Australian Ex'pe'ditionary Porce. While in Great Britain he. did a great deal of valuable work for us, furnishing several informative and useful - reports regarding the welfare of our men in camp and hospitals, and the conditions of re-embarkation for Australia. I am informed by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearoe) that his independent opinion on the vexed question of fitness for service of men sent abroad proved extremely valuable to the Defence Department, and Senator Pearce has conveyed to me his particular desire to be associated with our expression of the deep sense of loss we have sustained by the death of a public man of his estimable qualities. I desire that the House shall unanimously and appropriately express its appreciation of this loss sustained by it and the country,, and convey to the members of Mr Manifold's family our sincere condolences. He was nn ideal husband and! parent, and a much-loved man in every walk of life - T move- I shall ask the Leader of the Opposition to second the That .this House places upon record its high of the great public services of the. late Hon. JameB Chester Manifold, member far diyraion of Corangamite, and tenders its sincere Bympathy to the bereaved widow and relatives of an eminent citizen whose decease, is a great loss to the Commonwealth.",20
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.10] - I received a great shock this morning on learning that Chester Manifold, as we all knew him, had passed away, because I was unaware that he had been ill. I most sincerely endorse the admirable sentiments expressed by the Acting Prime Minister. During the whole of his time in this Parliament I have never heard an angry interjection from the late honourable member for Corangamite. He was one of the most popular members of the House. He was a good fellow, and the "" p a l "" of every honourable member, no matter on which side of the House he sat. He> was in the first Commonwealth Parliament. There are few of us left who were here then. A few weeks ago we expressed our regret at the loss of two - other mem-' bers of that Parliament, but they at least had reached the allotted' span, whereas the late Mr Manifold was in. the prime of life. We feel it all the more when a man so vigorous as ho was is cut off, and we see him no longer in his place in the House. On behalf of every honourable member of the Opposition I extend to the widow and relatives of the deceased gentleman our deepest sympathy in the loss they have sustained. It must be some comfort to them to know that his last mission W..B partly to engage in work on behalf of Australian soldiers, and an endeavour to improve their conditions. TJndoubted'y we all regret the untimely death of the late honourable gentleman. Question unanimously resolved in the affirmative, honourable members rising in their places. Motion (by Mr Watt"") agreed toThat Mr Speaker* be requested to transmit to Mrs Manifold the foregoing resolution and a copy of the speeches delivered - thereon. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",22
