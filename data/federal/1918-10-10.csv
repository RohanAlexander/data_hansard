Mr .SINCLAIR -.Seeing that many country centres have ""been denuded of farm labour, will the Cabinet consider the advisability of relaxing the provisions of the Defence Act where it is shown that to require continuous camp training will inflict serious loss on the trainees, or on their parents?",21
6,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"So far as I am able to judge, the Defence Department 'has considered the influence of this short period of training on the. industrial life of the Commonwealth. If the honourable member wishes for a more complete answer, I should like to have notice of the question. THE WAR. POSITION or TTJKKJST.",21

Injustice is done, and the 'law debars the officials from giving kindly and consideration to - many refor quests. For instance, the fact that deductions are made from the payments to the wives of soldiers who 'have been tbem punished for some Slight breach of duty on the other side of the world results in many complaints being sent to 'honourable members, and as these complaints are becoming known through the various disa serious amount of unrest is being created. Will the Prime Minister introduce legislation to. remedy these evils, or will be give ua an opportunity to make a representation to him, or to the Government, so that remedial measures may the adopted ?",21
9,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,This is the first which I have heard of the condition of things of which the honourable member speaks. I should like him to be more specific in his complaint.,22
10,Mr FOWLER,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,There are scores of cases of the kind referred to.,22
11,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"'During ' the war, when everything is topsy-turvy, there is bound to be a great deal of dissatisfaction with departmental administration, but I do not feel justified in going over the head of the Department until I know what the complaints are.",22

13,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"I have not time to read that correspondence.

Until I obtain more specific information, I cannot make a definite promise to do any particular thing.",22
14,Mr BRUOE SMITH,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) find that the Defence Department is full of complaints, extending over the last - two years, about deductions from the allowances of soldiers' wives and widows in consequence of penalties imposed at the Front. Does .the Acting Prime Minister consider thatfinesimposed at the Front in consequence of misconduct by a soldier should be visited upon the wife or widow who allowed her busband to enlist on the supposition that she would receive so much per day during his absence?",22
15,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"If these grievances are of such long standing, they should not be popped, without notioe, at a Minister who is not in charge of the Defence Department. The matter may be simple, and Cabinet bas been dealing with one phase of the question this week, and has settled it, I think, to the satisfaction of all concerned. But I cannot be expected to be familiar with all the'details of Defence administration. I shall make inquiries, and give an answer to the honourable member .later. WOOLLEN MILLS. CONTEOL : PBODTJOTION. Mr BOYD.r-Has the Acting Prime Minister seen in one of the morning papers the statement that the Commonwealth Government is taking control of all the woollen mills of Australia? Is that statement true? If not, has any departure been made in connection with the Commonwealth control of the woollen mills? . Mr Watt - The statement is incorrect. The Defence Department informs me that various causes connected with the war have created an increased demand for clothing material for Australian Imperial Force purposes, and the Business Board, to which the matter was referred, is considering the beBt means of meeting that increased demand. For that purpose the members of the Board are. in conference with the woollen manufacturers on. the subject.",22
16,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"In view of the necessity for increased production by the Australian woollen mills for military purposes, will the Acting Prime Minister endeavour to induce the mill-owners to work at a little higher pressure, so that the local demands to i their products also will may be satisfied as far as possible?",22
17,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,I will conveytihehonorable member's suggestion to the Minister for Defence. SUGAR PRODUCTION.,22
18,Mr CORSER,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"In view of the fact that the sugar crop of 1918 is short of Australian requirements, and the probable shortage of the J919 crop, is it the intention of the Commonwealth Government to insist on the terms of sub-section c of clause 1 of the current agreement between it and the Queensland Government for the purchase of raw sugar?",22
19,Mr MASSYGREENE,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,The section to which the honourable member refers is probably that under which the Queensland Government undertook not to erect more mills . during the period covered by the agreement? Mr Consist - Tba t is so.,22
20,Mr MASSYGREENE,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"That provision was inserted in the agreement to protect the Commonwealth against financial loss in the event of this year's crop adding to the surplus carried over from last yeaT. Now, however, because of climatic conditions, the estimate of the crop has been reduced by many thousands of tons, and whilst we shall have ample sugar for the year, I think that if the Queensland Government desires to erect additional mills, or to assistance for the erection of additional mills, and makes application to the Commonwealth Government, we shall favourably consider the waiving of any stipulation in the agreement which now prevents the erection of additional mills.

23,Mr EOWLEE,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"In view of the complete cessation of traffic on the Kalgoorliether Port Augusta railway, does the Post-. master-General propose to take any steps to utilize the few steamers running bestructed tween Fremantle and eastern ports for the carriage of mails?",23

25,Mr BAMFOED,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"Has the attention of the Minister controlling shipping drawn to the inconvenience occasioned to people in the north-west of Queensland by the transfer of the steam-ship Wyreema? Before that removal took place, the Controller of Shipping assured me that no inconvenience would be caused. immediately ? Will the Minister take steps to restore the conveniences which existed previously, and the deprivation of which seriously affects the carriage of cargo, passengers, and mails?  made inquiries into this matter, and was assured that there would be no dislocation of tonnage facilities, and that there would be ample accommodation for all requiregive ments, including refrigerating space.

29,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"The question as to whethe return should appear in Mansard was submitted to me yesterday, and, as the document was somewhat bulky, I in that it should not be published. I think it would be costly to have the return printed, but I shall see that sufficient copies for the use of honourable members PAYMENTS TO SEAMEN.",23
30,Mr WALLACE,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"Accordin g tp the Government Gazette of the 26th September, - the Governor General in Council been has approved of certain moneys being paid to seamen who had lost their effects through enemy action. Has the Acting Minister for the Navy made any arrangements to pay this money to the crew of the Wimmera? If not, will he do so  for seamen to be recompensed for loss of effects at sea by enemy action; but, as I have received no application from any seaAian, no payments have been made. If the honourable member will bring under my notice the claim of any man entitled to such a payment, I will see that he gets his money. PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.",23
31,Mr BEENNAN,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"Will the Acting Prime Minister consider the propriety of asking, or even requiring, persons in high places, and others, while the present diffiwealth cult and debcate negotiations are happily proceeding to bring the war to an end, to abstain from making, and the press from publishing, vainglorious demands which might be quite inconsistent with the views of responsible Allied statesmen, including President Wilson?",24
32,Mr WATT,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"The question is too indefinite. If the honourable member will give me something on which to base a reply, I will be glad to consider it.",24
33,Mr BRENNAN,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,I was referring principally to your speeches and those of the Governor General.,24

COAL FOE POET AUGUSTA.  the question asked yesterday by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), as to the steamship Yarra being unable to discharge a cargo of coal at Port Augusta, the Controller of Shipwho is ping has informed me thatThis steamer arrived at Port Augusta at 2.30 p.m. on Friday, 26th September, with 2,797 tons of coal on board for delivery to the Commonwealth and State railways, &c. Immediately on arrival discharge was commenced, and continued up to the time of the engine drivers' strike. The vessel then had on board 500 tons of coal. The Inter-State Central Committee communicated with the CommonRailway Department, and also with the State Railway Department to ascertain if it would be possible for the 'balance of the coal on board to be taken delivery of at Port Augusta. On receiving a reply that it was absolutely impossible for further coal to be landed, as all trucks were full, and the lines congested, the Inter-State Central Committee gave instructions that the vessel should proceed to Adelaide and there deliver the balance of her cargo of coal. The alternative to this would have heen to allow the steamer to remain idle at Port Augusta for an indefinite period, which could not be permitted under present conditions. MAIL CONTEACTS.

40,Mr WEBSTEE,RELAXATION OF MILITAR Y,"A preference is given by the Department to returned soli n the letting of mail contracts, and contractors are urged to give such prei n engaging labour to carry out I their contracts.

Robertson, Liberal member for Tyneside, and formerly Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, that "" Mr Hughes, the Commonwealth Prime Minister, constantly referred to the economic weapon with which he .could make Germany shorten the war, but it was extraordinary he (Mr Hughes) had made no single clear proposition""; arid "" that it was not tactful for the Prime Minister of Australia, the guest of the British Government, to go about telling people who disagreed with him that they are agents of Germany""? 2. To what extent does the Government hold itself responsible for the public utterances of the Prime Minister? 3. Will the Acting Prime Minister state now, or at any time, and, if so, when, during the life of the present Parliament, what are the views of the Government on Empire Trade, and what legislation is contemplated to give effect to the said views?",25
48,Mr WATT,PEIMEMINISTERAND EMPIR E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. The honourable member has had considerable experience of legislative life, and some experience of Cabinet practice, and ought to know that every Government shares or carries the responsibility for its leaders' utterances. 3. When the Government considers it seasonable to pronounce its views on Empire Trade it will do so. in LonRETURNED SOLDIEES INAUDI T DEPARTMENT.",25

If sOj will the Minister instruct that, so as temporary employment is concerned, returned soldiers must have preference over all others and particularly over eligibles for service?",25
50,Mr WATT,PEIMEMINISTERAND EMPIR E,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The services of two returned soldiers employed temporarily in the Central Audit Office have been dispensed with because they have been replaced by returned soldiers permanently appointed. No single eligible men have been retained in the Central Audit Office. In the Naval and Military branch of the Audit Office there are two single eligible men employed temporarily.

52,Mr WATT,PEIMEMINISTERAND EMPIR E,"The answers to the hona orable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. It is not considered necessary executive approval for the reason that, in making appointments to the Public Service, ference is given to returned soldiers, and the June, 1915. seniority of a soldier, for purposes of promotion, is based on the assumption that he passed the examination first held after his enlistment. The claims of officers who have enlisted and are still abroad are always fully considered in the making of promotions. It is considered that by these means effective preference is given to returned soldiers and officers who are still abroad. MUNITION MANUFACTURE. - Mr BRENNAN asked the Assistant Thermo Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Is it a fact that, by letter dated £he July last, serious allegations were made to the Minister relating to the manufacture of certain kind of munition, which letter was referred to Mr MCKay, of the Business Board, who stated that the matter was under consideration ? 2.

Is it a fact that the English ElectricCorporation, which has recently been appointed acquisition and forwarding agent for wolfram, molybdenite, scheelite, &c, is a 24th manufacturer (in England) of tungsten powder, and is able to make a profit of £100 per a ton from each ton of wolfram ore concentrate? 2. If so, and in view of the fact that this corporation is said to be directly interested in buying ores as cheaply as possible, will the Government, in the interests of the industry, remove the alleged'monopoly which it is stated has been created? Mr ""WATT - The Thermo-Electric Ore Reduction Corporation has been appointed Commonwealth agent fbr North Queensland. This corporation manufactures practically the whole of the tungsten powder used by the British Government. The corporation, at the instance of the Imperial authorities, has equipped works and laboratories, and has captured the business in ferro-alloys formerly in the hands of the German Metallurgical ""Works. It is now the largest manufacturer of tungsten powder and ferro-tungsten in the world. I am unable to state what profit it makes in England on its manufactures, but it is not considered likely that the Imperial Government would permit excessive profits to be made. The Thermo-Electric Ore Reduction Corporation pays the rates fixed by the Commonwealth Government for wolfram, &c, and it has no interest .whatsoever in the price paid for these concentrates. The Government is satisfied with the existing arrangements. NA NA BADGE.",26

Will the Minister state whether the regulation to the effect that any liquor dealer supplying intoxicants to members of the Australian Imperial Force in uniform, after 6 p.m., will be liable to prosecution, is still in operation in Queensland? 2. If so, will the Government consider the advisability of cancelling such regulation, which is considered to be an undeserved stigma upon members of the Australian Imperial Force, or, as an alternative, close hotels to the public generally at 6 p.m.? MT. ""WISE - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The District Commandant has been instructed to issue an order under the War Precautions Regulations prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor in Queensland to soldiers in uniform after 6 p.m., and this order is still in force. 2.

63,Mr NICHOLLS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"the Assistant . Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether the Minister has issued regulations prohibiting individuals posting newspapers to soldiers at the Front? 2, If so, will the Minister explain his reasons for so doing?",28
64,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows :The regulation has not yet been issued; but it has been announced in response to representations made by the responsible military authorities overseas, that, owing to transport difficulties and the general conditions obtaining at the Front, it is becoming increasingly difficult to guarantee delivery of newspapers posted to individuals. Particularly in the case of daily papers, it is stated that they are generally out of date, and therefore useless, on arrival It was decided by the Army Administration to enlist the aid of the Australian Comforts Fund and the Red Cross Society, and these bodies have for some time past been working in close co-operation with them, with a view to the bulk supply of Australian newspapers. The Minister is informed that they are now sending forward large quantities of all weeklies to every unit of the Australian Imperial Force, including hospitals, and contributions of such papers would be welcomed by the patriotic bodies mentioned. It should further be explained that, apart from the special consideration which is thus being shown to the natural desire of Australian soldiers to obtain their own newspapers printed in their own country, the Army Administration have made arrangements for the supply of various publications of interest. For example, the Ansae Bulletin, containing news specially cabled from . Australia, and the British Australasian, a weekly issue of information regarding Australians and Australian affairs generally, are being distributed widely to the Australian troops. As is well known, these papers contain copious extracts of matters of interest from papers in all the States. An organization known as the Camps Library also supplies books and magazines to all Australian units. At the same time, if it is desired to send any particular news item to an individual soldier, this can, of course, be effected .by making a cutting or extract from the newspaper, and sending it by letter post, a course which, it FORCE. may be remarked, will insure speedier delivery tc the soldier.

74,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I should prefer to have the matter discussed now, because I am wholly opposed to it .",30
75,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"That is not what I had in view when I spoke of advancing the B i l i to the second-reading stage, which I suggest is the proper one at which to debate the Bill as a whole, leaving the details to be discussed on the schedule. This tax is proposed as part of the new taxation which is rendered necessary by the in creasing bills for interest on war loans, war pensions, and repatriation. reason of the Government for introducing this and the Postal Rates Bill early is that the tax and new rates cannot be collected until the Bills are passed, and the earlier we get the measures through the larger will be the harvest for the financial year. Other Bills, such as the Land Tax Bill and the Income Tax Bill , may be passed at greater leisure, because they operate retrospectively for the whole financial year; but I ask due celerity in the consideration of the Postal Rates Bill and the Bill now before, us, because the amount of revenue depends on how soon they are passed. Honourable members are aware of the conditions of taxation at present in regard to entertainments. Tickets at the price of 6d. and under are not liable to the tax, and tickets exceeding 6d., but not exceeding Is., pay I d . , and l £ d . for the first 6d. above Is . ; and so on with a | d . increase for every 6d. The proprietors of the establishments who sell these tickets, in variably, I understand, pass the tax on to the purchasers of the tickets. I gave certain figures in the Budget speech showing that the number of amusements is increasing, the taxable entertainments for 1917-18 being 2 per cent, more than in the previous year, 1916-17. In 1917-18 this tax yielded a revenue of £245,890, but in the present-year, without allowing for the increased rate, it is expected that the return would be only £205,000. The' - taxation officers estimate ' that this decrease will be due to ths curtailment of horse-racing and entertainments at stadiums generally. U p to the present, as I have explained, 3d. and 6d. admission tickets have not been taxed, arid the effect of the motion, and the Bill which will be based on it , is that all admissions up to, and inclusive of, 6d., will henceforth pay a tax of I d . No alteration is proposed in the rates of - taxation on the higherpriced tickets at this stage. The entertainments tax is not charged at present where the Commissioner is satisfied the entertainment is intended for the amusement of children. That is provided for in the Assessment Act , where the charge is not more than 6d. per person.",30

77,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I am not referring speciThe fically to my honourable friend, who might fail by either of the tests. As I was saying, the Assessment Act - does not tax entertainments exclusively designed for children, and it is not intended to alter the law in that respect.",30

81,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The honourable member has solved domestic problems more difficult thanthe one he has suggested, and I shall leave the matter to him . I should like to give honourable members the rates of taxation charged in Great Britain , because, by reason of an interjection made when I was delivering the Budget speech, the exact position may be misunderstood. . According to the latest advices we have obtained, there is charged in Great Britain on admission tickets, not exceeding 2£d. in price, J d . ; on tickets exceeding 2 | d . , but not exceeding 4d. in .price, I d . ; on tickets between 4d. and 7d. in price, 2 d .; on tickets between 7d. and Is. in price, 3 d . ; on tickets between Is. and 2s. in price, 4 d . ; on tickets between 2s. and 3s. in price, 6d.; on tickets between 3s. and 5s. in price, 9d.; on tickets between 5s. and 7s. 6d. in price, Is . ; on tickets between 7s. 6d. and 10s. 6d. in price, Is. 6d.; and on tickets between 10s. 6d. and 15s. in price, 2s: The tickets exceeding 15s. in price are charged at the rate of 2s. for the first 15s., and 6d. for every 5s. or part thereof above 15s. It wfouid merely weary honourable members were 1 to give them the rates of taxation in other countries. But it is safe to say that in belligerent countries wherever the cinema, has gone, and its province is now the world, there is an increasing tendency to tax some or all of the prices for admission whenever the Treasury needs money. Entertainments are beneficial to a community in many ways, but in time of war they are a luxury which is a fair subject of taxation. prosperity of the people generally is in dicated by their ability to patronize picture shows freely, this Parliament is justified in altering the free list which it originally set up, and asking for additional revenue from tickets which have hitherto not been taxed. I am aware that arguments may be raised as to the grading of the tax. I have already heard it suggested that the tax on the ' lower-priced tickets is relatively greater than that on the high-priced tickets. I say that tickets up to Is. in price might well be taxed' I d . , and that tickets above that price might well be taxed more, and next year we may have to impose heavier taxation on them. In the framing of our financial proposals, we have remembered that next year there will be another Budget, and many legitimate opportunities of taxation have been expressly reserved for the inevitable demands of that year, whether the war is over or whether it is still raging. I do not ask honourable members to regard our proposals as ideal, or, as in common parlance, "" scientific,"" whatever the word may mean in relation to taxation. The Government have considered this matter as closely as possible, and Ministers consider that there is ample justification for their proposals, which I hope will be passed into law as quickly as possible.",30

84,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"W, e are now considering the propriety of imposing this taxation. According to the Budget papers, the taxation of tickets of a price not exceeding 6d. will increase the revenue by £275,000, or about 130 per cent., the revenue now obtained from the taxation of tickets above that price being only £205,000, and in the Budget the Treasurer states that he expects a total of £480,000 from this for m of taxation.

85,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,It is not children alone who inake the attendances.,31
86,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"In its anxiety to let off the rich landholder, the Government proposes to tax the children who pay 3d. for . admission to a picture show at the rate of 33J per cent.; the rich land-owner is to be taxed only an extra 20 per cent.. I am informed that there are only four picture theatres in Australia at which the ordinary price of admission is 3d.; but at practically every picture show on Saturday afternoons, and at, I think, all the continuous picture shows in the big cities during the day-time - I suppose there are half-a-dozen of them in each of the capitals-admissio n can be obtained for 3d. It is proposed to put a tax of I d . on these 3d. tickets. The Acting Prime Minister says that his proposal is not scientific, and it is not. The 3d. ticket is. to be taxed at the same rate as the Is. ticket. Eew persons would pay only 3d. if they could afford to buy more expensive seats. The rate of taxation on the 3d. ticket is 33^d. per cent., and on the Is. ticket it is only 8 per cent. The Government is proposing to h it up those who pay only 3d. and 6d. for admission to picture theatres. It may be argued that there are lots of persons attending - I shall football matches on payment of 6d.; but it must not be forgotten that in Victoria, at any rate, practically all the profits of football matches now go to swell the patriotic funds. I speak as an official of one of the clubs. I know how the clubs are being run today. They are not run as they were in the time of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie), when it was a matter of the secretary arranging the balance-sheet. Of course, I know that the honourable member never received a penny, and he was as fine a player as I ever looked at. The balance-sheet of the League was published in last Saturday's newspapers. They divided the whole of their money, some £4,000, among the patriotic funds. surer proposes to take one-fifth or one-^ sixth of this money.

If we can collect the amount estimated by the Treasurer by a tax of I d . on 3d. and 6d. tickets, we should impose that tax. Next year the taxation on higher-priced tickets will have to be increased considerably. This is only the beginning of our entertainments taxation. I have attended a number ot picture shows about Melbourne, and, judging by their apparent prosperity, the patrons of such entertainments cati well afford to pay the additional penny that will be asked for by this Bill . Although a tax of a penny on a 3d. ticket does seem large on a percentage basis, still I think a father would much prefer to buy half-a-dozen tickets at 4d than to pay for half-a-dozen adults. I do not think the tax will lower the attendance at picture shows at all, but i it did have that effect in some instances it would be a benefit to the community. There are some picture entertainments that could be dispensed with to the public advantage, and which are especially harmf u l to immature minds. No honourable member desires to deny the children the privilege of attending picture shows, and I do not think this tax will do that.

At that time the Imperial Government were getting such ""a lot of money from the amusements tax that we, having regard to the fact that the Australian people are more fond of amusement and sport than any other people on earth, thought that we might naturally expect to receive a very large revenue from that source.

It is very to easy for honourable members of the Opposition, probably for vote-catching purposes, to claim that they are trying to provide cheap entertainments for that section of the community which they know will be able to cast a very large vote on election' day.

If the Government were not such financial muddlers they would have brought forward a proposal for the meeting of revenue requirements by the taxa1 tion of incomes. Why do they not im a tax upon the incomes of the to picture show proprietors ? Why do they to penalize children with a tax of 33 J per cent, when the proprietor of an entertainment pays only 10 per cent? There is nothing scientific in this entertainment tax. I am not the only person who is advocating scientific taxation. The views I am urging have been stressed by many Men who dealt with the Imperial finances ""both before. and since the war have admitted that the present system of taxation is not based on scientific or just principles. To-day the Treasurer is hurrying forward this proposal to tax the entertainment tickets of children, but measures for the taxation of the incomes of profiteers are kept well in the background. The Government were returned to power on the promise that they would help to win the war. ""We are told that money is as essential as men for the successful prosecution of the war, but no steps are being taken to.get by a proper system of taxation our revenue needs from those who are making huge sums of money. To-day wealth is being accumulated by the few in Australia at a much greater rate than at any period in our history. Those who have taken an interest in matters of taxation know that the time to tax a community is when it is wealthy, and not when the war is over, and when loan moneys cease to be expended, and hundreds of thousands of people who are receiving payments from the Defence Department, the Navy Department, and other Departments which are furnishing the necessities for the war will cease to draw that money which now enables them to contribute something towards the cost of the war. I am continually calling attention to this fact, and I hope that my earnest endeavours in this regard will meet with some reward. We should not wait until after the war is over to face these problems. They will be greater after the war, Avhen the Government will be involved in the heavy task of maintaining people in such employment as will enable them to meet the taxation which of necessity must be imposed. grieved that no one has arisen on the Government side to attempt to solve the problem of taxation. can be solved. There is no problem on earth which cannot be solved. I have already told honourable members what is being done in Great Britain, Canada, and New Zealand. The people of those countries are not handing down, to posterity the whole cost of the war. Of course I am aware that we cannot do without raising loans, but interest must be paid on the money borrowed in that way. Ministers seem to have put the control of the finances into the hands of a Board of Advisers, or Finance Committee. I would not give utterance to any sentiment that might offend those estimable citizens who are giving advice to the Government Mr West. on financial matters, but I think the Ministers have made a mistake in making these appointments.",33

109,Mr WEST,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Of course, if that is your opinion, Mr Chairman, I have to bow to it, but it is not my opinion. I was under the impression that the Treasurer had been advised in this regard by this Finance Committee, and it seems to mo that Ministers should accept the responsibilities attaching to the positions they occupy. Too much responsibility is imposed on persons who are not Ministers. It is not a good policy to pursue, and I hope that we have heard I am the last of it. If I continue to have any voice in Parliament or in the country I shall certainly raise it It against this practice on every occasion that presents itself. I shall oppose this Bill on the ground that the tax proposed is an extortion on children who attend picture shows. One honourable member has spoken of picture shows as immoral and as something we could do without, but it should be our purpose to bring up our Australian children as brainy citizens, with that power of initiative about which we have beard so much from all those who know anything about warfare in their eulogy of the grand fellows we have sent overseas. We want to give our children the opportunity of seeing something besides gum leaves or dust. Attendance at picture shows will give them initiative, and make them better pupils in our public schools. I am not against the practice of allowing children to attend picture shows. In any case, even if we were opposed to it , the people of Australia would - continue to send their children to them. In the State of New South Wales, wherever there is any community of people, a picture show is to be found, just as we find an hotel or a church established there. The three seem to be a feature of Australian country communities. I think it is the general feeling of honourable members that the imposition of the tax on 3d. tickets should be omitted from the Bill . The other portion of the Government's proposal is not at all scientific. would rather see the Treasurer proceed with his income tax proposals, and deal with this matter afterwards. has brought this forward first I cannot understand.",34
110,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,I have just explained the reason to the Committee.,35
111,Mr WEST,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Ver y few men in the Australian Parliaments have applied themselves to the study of finances, but sooner or later they must do so. Figures are dry matters to place before an audience, but the time has arrived when close study must be given to them by representative men. I hope that the proposal of the Government to impose this tax on 3d. tickets will be defeated. Mr BOYD. (Henty) [4.4] - B y imposing a tax on tickets of admission to entertainments for which less than Is. is charged, the Government anticipate receiving additional revenue to the extent of £275,000. Last year not more than £245,000 was raised from the taxation of amusements, and the estimate for this year without the additonal impost is £205,000, but the Treasurer anticipates receiving a total revenue of £480,000 this year by the extension of the tax. He expects to get more out of the taxation of tickets for which the charge is lower than Is. than the total revenue received last year, when these tickets were not taxed. The reason for that is that the number of tickets sold below Is. is far in excess of those sold above that price. The great bulk of the population who spend money on football matches and picture shows will , under this proposal, contribute something towards the revenue. The salient feature of the whole proposal is, however, that no. compulsion will be imposed upon one individual in the community to contribute to the revenue in , t h is way. No one need do so, if he does not so desire.",35
112,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Then the people will have to stop away from picture shows. ,35

118,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"It is true, all the same.",35
119,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"It is sheer'bluff. Is there a more profitable business in the community today than the picture show ? We have many theatres scattered over Melbourne, and in Bourke-street alone, in two cases, there are picture shows next door to each other. There are at least eight or ten picture shows in this city, and we know that a man would not invest his money in a picture show if it were not a profitable enterprise. The fact that this class of amusement has spread over the whole community justifies the Government in treating it , in time of war, as a legitimate source of taxation. Mr NICHOIJ.S - This means a tax on poor children's tickets.",35
120,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Why talk such ""tripe""? It is remarkable that those who have no children talk most loudly of them. Some honourable members opposite have suggested that there should be an increase of 33^ per cent, on the more expensive theatre tickets. The charges for admission to our theatres today are fair l y high. If a young fellow in ordinary circumstances proposes to take his best g i r l to the theatre, will he take her up in the gallery, where he can secure a seat for Is.?",35
121,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,No ; no g i r l would go with him.,36
122,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Q u it e so. He takes her into the reserved stalls, where he has to pay 7s. 6d. for a seat on a Saturday night, and 63. on other evenings. To increase this tax proportionately on the higherpriced tickets would be to impose an undue burden""=on such men. An increase of 33$ per cent, on the higher-priced - theatre tickets would press more heavily than would such an increase upon tickets of admission to a concert given, say, by Madame Melba, for which a man would pay a guinea each. The taxation of 3d. tickets will injure no one. A man who can afford to give his child 3d. for a picture-show ticket can just as well afford to pay 4d. for that ticket. If , as the result of this taxation, it should be necessary for - a man to deny himself something, then let him follow the advice so often given by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), and take a glass of beer less per week.",36
123,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Does the member say it would be as easy for a man with six children to find 4d. for each of them to go to a picture show as it is for him to provide each of them with 3d. ?,36
124,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Would it h u r t the children if they went one night a week less to the picturo shows? The income tax has gone up to 8s. I d . in the £ 1 , and there is a prospect of a further increase in the future. Taxation is to be in creased to raise an additional £6,000,000 next year; and as our interest bil l on the £80,000,000 that we' are borrowing each year goes up, further taxation must be imposed on the incomes of the people, whether they be derived from personal exertion or from property. In view of all these circumstances, »urely it is not unfair to say that those who patronize picture shows and othei forms of entertainment shall contribute something to the revenue of this country, which is today more prosperous tban it has ever been.  can be no doubt that additional revenue must be raised by the Government, but my experience is that honourable membersare always prepared to "" tax the other fellow."" I do not object so strongly to the tax on 6d. tickets, but I certainly think it is unfair to impose a tax on the 3d. tickets sold to children. When I was a youngster, I had to work very hard. I had no chance for recreation or sport of any kind.",36
125,Mr BRUCE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"That is why the honourable member is having so much of it now.  increasing relish for . sport. In this respect, I am like a poddy calf, which ispractically starved until it gets strong enough to but t its owner over, so that it may put its head into the bucket and obtain for itself the milk it requires. When I was young, I was very much in* the position of the poddy calf, and as soon* as I got my nose into the bucket I kept it there. I thank the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) for his cheap sneer as to the claim of the Opposition side of the House that they represent the working classes. The hardest taskmaster* I have ever met are those who have themselves sprung from the working classes. No wonder the honourable member forget* the workers today, since he sprang from a working-class father and mother. Behonorable cause lie wants no pleasure for himself, he proposes to deprive other people's youngsters of a little cheap amusement. I agree with him, however, that soma films are not fit to be seen by adults, let alone children. If a man is receiving £ 3 per week-ther e are many in Australia who receive less-and has a number of children to support, it is difficult for him to provide much in the way of pictureshow money for his little ones. It is a curious fact that the poorer a man is, and the harder he has to work, the larger is his family. I wonder how the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowetty would have managed if he had had to rear his family on the same amount of money that I had. Every sixpence that I and my wife earned between us had to be turned over half-a-dozen times before wa could decide how it should be spent. Owing to the thriftiness of my wife, I am in the proud position today of being a member of this Parliament. The honourable member for Wimmera said that the Opposition took upon themselves the responsibility of protecting the interests of the working classes. No one knows better t h a n the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt ) what has been the trend of politics in Australia since 1S90. We were then told that if we desired proper represen'tation we should send men from our own ranks to Parliament to help to make the laws. That advice we took, with the result that the Labour party has on' two oc-casions been in command of the great - continent of Australia; and I hope it will not be long before that partu is in power again.",36
126,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I do not share that view at all.  to differ on the point. I was returned primaril y by the votes of the working men and women of Maranoa, in Western 'Queensland, and I came here full y imbued with the spirit with which the electors themselves were imbued. If I can.not look after their interests, I certainly would not be satisfied to have the duty delegated to the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson); indeed, I feel sure they have sufficient f a i th in me to know that I will do my best on their behalf. I have never failed them up to the present, and I am not going to fai l them now. This tax affects the people in the - country much more than it does the people in the towns. It is, perhaps, only once a week, or. once a month, that - country youngsters have the chance of going to a picture show in my constituency; and I should here like to make a suggestion for the consideration of the Government. I have' sufficient faith in honourable members behind the Government to know that even if the tax does mean 33Jf per cent, on a 3d. ticket, they have no desire to specially tax the children of the working man and woman, or of the soldiers who are fighti n g at the Front. My suggestion is that, - on picture shows given before 6 o'clock in the evening, the 3d. .tickets should be free of taxation, leaving only the evening tickets at that price liable to the impost.",37

He'was succeeded in office by the present Acting Minister for the Navy  the disgust of a number of honourable members who were amongst his supporters-thoug h I think it was the Cabinet rather than the Minister who decided the question-the tax was reduced to what it is now. The proposal of the honourable member for Capricornia was that the 6d. tickets should pay a penny, and that the 3d. tickets should pay £d., but, as we know, under the present Act, these two classes of tickets are in no way affected. There is no doubt that in the future money will have to be found to a very much greater extent than up to the present. Thank God, the newsboards today tell us that one more of the enemy has made submission, and I think we can fairly see the beginning of the end. However, if the war ceased tomorrow, I believe that, before we have cleaned up all its horrors and effects, the war debt of Australia will be somewhere about £300,000,000, which, at 5 per cent.,-means an interest bill of some £15,000,000 per annum. Not only will the capital wealth and income of Australia have to be taxed, but I am afraid that we may have to tax even the necessities of the people.",37

When drastic taxation is necessary it is better to tax the luxuries, sports, and amusements of the people rather than their necessities. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) has - given some figures relating to similar taxation in England. The taxation that has been put on wealth in the Old Country has surprised the whole world. The income tax, the land tax, and all direct taxation there, is excessively heavy; in the case of amusement it is :-The 2-|d. ticket pays a tax of id., a 4d. ticket pays Id., .a. 7d. ticket pays 2d., a Is. ticket pays 3d., a 2s. ticket pays 4d., and so it goes on, until the 10s. 6d. ticket pays Is. 6d.

145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"At present I am merely urging that the very fair compromise suggested by the honourable member for Maranoa shall be seriously considered. What the Government lose on the 3d. tickets we can easily make up by increased taxation on the higher-priced tickets; indeed, we can more than make up any loss sustained in this way. Will any one say that the howling throngs at the stadiums, where people are boxing who ought to be boxing somebody else in another part of the world, ought not to be made to pay a fair amount for their amusement? I am not here to suggest what people ought to do, but I cannot think it is altogether an advantage to the community for young children to attend picture shows in the evening. There is no doubt that it will be absolutely essential to impose heavy taxation in the future, and it is much better to tax the luxuries, pleasures, or vices of people rather than their necessities.",38

' Exception has been? taken to certain classes of pictures that are shown. Undoubtedly some picturesare in the highest degree objectionable, and many others are exceedingly trashy. In the early days of picture shows, pictures were displayed which were not only unobjectionable, but were also highly interesting and educational.

I remember a beautiful series of educational pictures showing the blossoming and development of flowers and plants,, and the theatres at which they wereshown were crowded.

170,Mr FOWLER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I hope that the tendency will be to revert to those wholesome pictures. The children should be encouraged, rather than prevented from, attending such shows. I do not like to see them attending pictures at night. It is a sad sight to see a child nodding in the arms of its mother at a night show. But - we ought to encourage the attendance of - children at the matinees if we can at the same time improve the character of the pictures. As we have appointed censors for that very work, I cannot see what is to hinder them from insuring that the matinee pictures shall be of a better class than many which have been shown lately. My objection to the Government's proposal is that it taxes the mother in the home, where every penny of expenditure must be studied. If a mother has three or four children, ranging in age from - three to ten or twelve years, they will all desire to go to a picture show, and the mother who can refuse them is Tare. But I know that the tax they are paying for tickets for children, evenunder present - circumstances, strains the monetaryresources of the home, and to add even Id. to the 3d. tickets of the children is a big - consideration to a mother who already - spends many an anxious evening trying to make ends meet. There can be no - question that, though wages are high, it is a hard struggle for the thrifty mother - of a family to keep out of debt. This tax will fall upon the woman in the home, - who, it must be remembered, is already paying an excessive amount of indirect taxation, in connection with .the purchase - of commodities. I do net think that there is any person in the community who is - hit so hard today by taxation as is the mother of a family, and I feel sure that no honourable member wishes to increase her burden, if it can possibly be avoided. In connection with this tax, we can save 'her a little addition to her burden; the relief may not be great, but it all tells purse that is not weighty at the end of the week. We have no desire to deprive the children of their afternoon at the ture show, nor do we wish to make any mother feel that she is taking more out - of her thin purse for entertainments than she ought to take.

Now the Government propose, that the householder shall be further penalized through his children's amusement. Honourable members know that the mother of a family would deny herslf almost anything rather than prevent her children from getting some cheap recreation. The children are looking for amusement, and most of us have been besieged by children asking for our passes when we have come out of a picture show at th© interval. Naturally parents will do their best to see that the children are not denied the opportunities for amusement that they crave. Money must be obtained, and nobody will deny the necessity for taxation, but I wish to see the increased imposts start in the' dress circle. The Treasurer intimated that he has not proposed certain other increases because he is reserving them for another Budget.

Certain honourable members have commented adversely on the class of amusement the proposed tax wilf deal with, and in following their vagariesand particular foibles in connection with the censorship of films, I was led to illustrate the conditions that prevailed in. America regarding amusements of a different character. I would like to seean addition to the proposal before theCommittee in the following shape: Add the words "" exceeding 3s., Id. for every 6d. or part of 6d. by which the payment exceeds 3s."" I would even make it more drastic.",42
187,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Mak e it 33 per cent, all round.",43
188,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,No. I am not having any of your 33 per cent. to lower the taxation on the section of this community which is .already hearing the brunt of the war. You have already taken the working class people to fight. . Mr JOWETT - Who has taken them 1,43
189,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Honourable members opposite. You have taken the working classes to fight in the war, and now you propose to tax their dependants; and from the small wages which will be - paid in the factories and workshops to these men when they come back again, you and the representatives of the people who are piling up fortunes on their blood and sufferings will deduct this tax. You, who ask these men, about whose glorious deeds you will talk, to bear the brunt of the war, are the people who have taken them to fight. Y o u , with your Wheat Pools and your Wool Pools-- - Mr BAYLEY - Hav e saved Australia.",43

192,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"A few moments ago' I was trying to point out that the farmer, or any one who works mentally or physically, is a worker, and that I looked"" forward to the formation of an alliance between the agricultural and in dustrial interests of Australia, which would sweep out of political life the honourable member and others associated with him, because it would mean that the Working man would have the chance to live a decent life with a proper share of the wealth he produces. This taxation is part and parcel of the class of taxation that is imposed by those people who are exploiting the great bulk of the people of the community. We cannot expect anything else but taxation of this character from them.",43
193,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,What shocking people we are!,43
194,Mr CONSIDINE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I did not expect the honourable member to be shocked so quickly. Now that he is shocked, I expect that he, and those in common with him, will make restitution to the rest I want of the people of Australia, and endeavour to give relief to the kiddies, and the wives and families, of those who are carrying the burden of the war which has helped the honourable member and others in his class of business to make money out of the necessities of the people.",43
195,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Wakefield) [5.15] - I am not at all surprised at the character of the debate. I do not think that I was alone in anticipating that some of the old ideas would be brought for ward again today. The chief idea of some honourable members who profess to represent the workers is to get a_ war-cry, and the more misleading it is the better it pays. That is the kind of stuff we have heard today, with the exception of a splendid relief in the shape of a speech by the honourable member for Maranoa  and conviction, and with loyalty to all that is best. We have heard again the old cry that the whole of the burden is being placed on the poor working man. I am quite certain that the vast majority of the working men of Australia wil l regard such talk at its proper value - Some honourable members are exceedingly disappointed that the Government, in its taxation proposals, did not introduce a policy which would have enabled them to revive the old "" f r e e breakfast table "" business, which would have been a very fine stock phrase for some honourable members to use all over Australia. But it has not come. And now that there is, to begin with, a tax of I d . on amusements, that is to say, on a luxury-whethe r it is the poor man's enjoyment or the rich man's enjoyment it is certainly one of the luxuries-it is claimed to be an increase of 3 3 per cent.; and that increase will 1 be presented before a section of the people of Australia, the unthinking section, not in its proper relation, but ""with quite a different intention. This kind of talk has served its purpose in the past, bu t it will not do so again, because the real facts of taxation will bfc put before the people of this country in their proper light. Where has there been any intention displayed to impose taxation on the "" poor working man "" ?-makin g use. of a phrase which is hawked about with the deliberate intention of misleading. When has that in tention been shown ?",43
196,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Every time.,44
197,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"My friend is a decent fellow. The only place in which he goes wrong is in the head. "" 'Tis the heart, and not the brain, to the highest doth attain."" So far my friend's heart is concerned, he pretty nearly all right. The burden direct taxation has not yet fallen upon the ""poor working man."" This is a tax amusements, and if the Government are determined that the people shall contrimenaced bute, on a very wide basis, to the revenue of the country, surely there can be harm in such a proposal, from which practically no one can escape, more especially when the tax is only Id. per ticket.",44
198,Mr CORSER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,It isfar better than a ate. tax on tea.,44
199,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Muc h the better. The Opposition are disappointed because such an impost has not been prosacrifice. posed by the Government. One would imagine, from their criticism of this posal, that the Government contemplated a form of taxation calculated to bring ruin upon the country. In this time war it seems to me that too much attento go before the people. tion is given to picture shows and amusecognise ments generally. I have no desire that the people should grow morose, but I not think they should go to the other extreme, and it is certainly not a healthy sign that, ever since the war began, avenues of amusement in Australia been more crowded than ever. We have heard a good deal during this debate about the "" taxation of poor chilto dren."" In the'broadest sense of the term we have no "" poor children "" in Australia, thank God, nor have we the "" poor workpicture ing man"" in the sense that honourable members opposite would have us believe. It would be a great deal better for the children who attend picture showsmany of them almost nightly-if they were taught ""something of the spirit self-sacrifice - The Opposition prate about oppression in this country, but invite them to consider the position of people in France and some of the other belligerent countries. Have they given a moment's consideration to the duty. sacrifices which the people of those countries are making? . The financial and commercial exploiters here ought to be well taxed.",44
200,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,The honourable member will not help us to tax them.,44
201,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I will, that and I have shown a disposition to do so as ever since the Avar began. The greatest is exploiter of the working man today is of the man who professes to represent him, but really does not do so. The industrial on development of Australia, on which so much must depend after the war, is more by the exploiters of the working man, who profess to represent him, than no by any other section of the community. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) has spoken pretty freely. As a rule, he expresses his views without any hesitation, and in a way that I do not think his colleagues always appreciSurely he will admit that all classes, from the poorest to the richest in community, should be prepared, in proportion to their ability, to make some It would be better if the Opposition would recognise their duty in prothis regard, and forget for a moment the almighty vote outside, and the fear, not only that they may not be returned, but of that they may not even secure selection Let them rethat this question of taxation must be faced. The burdens of taxation do must continue to increase, but that is a matter of no concern to those who do not believe in discharging honourable obligaall tions. Happily, there az-e not many of have that type in this Parliament. It is the parents and not the children whom picture show tickets are issued that will have to bear this tax. If people who have been accustomed to attending shows practically every night in the week were induced to do so only one night in the week it would be better for the future of Australia. Let honourable members generally get away from the cant and hypocrisy which is of indulged in, merely with the object of exploiting the unthinking of the comI munity. Unless we do so, the day is the not far distant when the people will rise up and sweep away this Parliament, with ever a determination to return men who are prepared, come what may, to do their",44
202,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Melbourne Ports) [5.29] - The debate on this question has developed into one of a party character. There can be no doubt that honourable members of the Opposition represent the poorer section of the community, while the Government and their supporters represent the plutocrats. This is not only a brutal, but a contemptible increase of taxation, and many of those who have discussed it appear to have not the slightest conception of tihe position of the workers today. We are here to get the best that we can out of the world, as well as to give to it the best that is in us; and I hold that the child of a working man has as much right to recreation, amusement, and luxury as has the child of the wealthiest man in the country. Like ""the honourable member for H in dmarsh (Mr Archibald), I represent a division where there are far more children than in any of the more Conservative electorates of the Commonwealth. There are in my constituency dozens of families of eight and nine children, not one of whom is over fourteen years of age, and the fathers of the<=e families are earning an average of about £ 2 5s. per week.",44
203,Mr LECKIE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Nonsense ! they employed at?,45
204,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"On casual work. These men cannot afford to pay for highpriced amusement tickets. While some honourable members condemn picture shows, I regard them as having a high educational value. When I get a night off I always go to a picture show.",45
205,Mr LECKIE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,What does the honourable member prefer- a Charlie Chaplin film?,45
206,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,No ; when he is on I do not go. We are told that the morals of the children are sapped by what they see at picture shows. What about the bald-headed men in the stalls watching every movement of the ballet girls ?. Their morals are in more danger of being sapped in that way than are the morals of the children who go to picture shows. There are various forms of amusement.' Some people find amusement in listening to the debates of this House. There are others who go to church for amusement.,45
207,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Where is the amusement?,45
208,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,That is what I am trying to explain. It is an amusement to many women to show other women at church that they have better hats than their neighbours.,45
209,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D," I think that is beside the question,",45
210,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I bow to your ruling, sir, but I remind you that the amusement of the workers' children is being attacked and condemned. I knew a g i r l once, and her idea of amusement was to go to the cemetery and read the poetry on the tombstones.",45
211,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Sh e did - not last long!,45
212,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"That may be. What I am trying to show is that the main or only amusement of the workers' children should not be attacked. In my opinion, these picture shows do not have the bad effect on the children that some honourable members would make us' believe. There is a section of our community whom nothing can amuse-wh o are blind and deaf to any for m of amusement-and because of this they would prevent other men's children from obtaining healthy entertainment. It is a damned pity we cannot tax that crowd What are - that is MI have to say about it !",45
213,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,The honourable member must not use expressions of that kind.,45
214,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The many children of poor fathers, who earn a very small wage, ought not to be deprived of this means of entertainment. We are told that it would be better if these children stayed at home.",45
215,Mr COESEK,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Like the children in Ike bush. Mr RICHAB D FOSTEB - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) is not putting the matter fair l y - that was never said.,45
216,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The fact that I have no children does not make me less considerate of the children of others; arid, moreover, I represent a community of large families. To them the picture theatre represents the main, if not the only, for m of amusement, and, in my opinion, instead of being restricted, the picture shows ought to be extended. In deed, if we were civilized, there would be a gymnasium in every locality, where the children of the workers could build themselves up. That idea has been preached by the Labour movement for years; but I can remember when I was laughed at for advocating in the House - that the community as a whole should provide amusements and playgrounds for the children. The profit-mongers and exploiters-al l the fraternity of profiteers-hav e been allowed to escape in the matter, of taxation, although we know that enormous fortunes have heen made out of the war. Now we have a suggestion from the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) that the picture show proprietors should pay the tax. As to that, does any one here think that these proprietors make a profit of anything like 33-J per cent.?",45
217,Mr LISTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"They make quite a pretty fair profit, all the same.",46
218,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I pecuniary interest in picture shows- I wish to heaven I had!-and I have no with the question. reason to defend them or their proprietors, but I have friends amongst them, and do know that they do not make anything like 33^ per cent. Like all other business men, with the exception of a few who are always making money, they are subseat ject to a rise and fall of profits. Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) admitted that the advertising of a Wa Loan cost £124,000; and in this connection it must be remembered that, while the newspapers were paid special rates, the picture show proprietors did the adverselves tising for nothing.",46
219,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,The newspaper advertising pays the Government very handsomely.,46
220,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Quite so; but, unfortunately, the same advertising is on behalf of conscription, and some people had a halo of patriotism out of which, they made money. The honourable member for Maranoa  ought to be considered, for no one would contend that the '3d. ticket of the child should be taxed. The Acting Prime Minister has drawn a comparison between these charges in Australia and similar charges in B r it a in . But in Britain we are informed by a daily paper which supports the Government side-and here I must say that I think that the Saturyoungsters day issues of our daily papers are well worth the extra Id - som e 400 picture shows have been closed in the provinces, while, at the same time, the number has the tickets of - the children been increased in London. And what is the reason? It is that, in spite of men who have gone to the Eront, the population in London has been kept normal, or has even been increased, by the influx of people from other countries. Thus, only London has been paying the tax.",46
221,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"That is not correct, because the great provincial cities are still being levied upon, and are paying heavily.",46
222,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"-In the great provincial cities of Britain , shows of all. kinds have decreased in number, but, particularly, picture shows, to the extent of 400. Is the Treasurer proud of his proposal to tax the children I d . on a 3d. ticket? . have no Mr Watt - That is only a ""catchpenny "" cry that has nothing to do",46
223,Mr MATHEWS,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Of course, it is I .open to the honourable gentleman to make that assertion; but he will agree that every argument advanced by a politician, if it is not with a view to making his secure, is, at any rate, intended to The voice the opinionof those whom he reprehas sents. In the Melbourne Ports division r there is the biggest birth-rate of any in Australia, and that in spite of the fact that many of the mothers, owing to the i r poor circumstances, have to avail themof the Lying-in Hospital in Mel'bourne. Of course, I know that the Treasurer, in using the phrase ""catchpenny,"" is not attacking me personally, and we may let the matter rest at that. - At any rate, I represent a constituency used in which the children are in greater numbers than elsewhere, and in which the fathers earn less money than is earned in other parts of tEe country. The children ' of the workers have as much right to their pleasures and luxuries as has any other section of the community, and we must not forget that, not only picture shows, but every littl e concert or - association gathering will be subject to the tax. These are the only forms of amuse, as ment in congested areas of the city, and mine happens to be the most closely populated of the lot. W.e all like to see the enjoy themselves, and this proposed tax is not only unworthy of the. Government, but unnecessary. Tax the tickets of the adults if you like, but leav$ alone. These children have not the opportunithe ties for enjoyment that the children of the well-to-do possess, and their amusements should not be taxed.",46
224,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Illawarra) [5.51] - I am sorry that I cannot support the Government in this part of its financial programme. At times like the present, we must he ready to concede a great deal; but in this case we are .being asked too much - I have not forgotten what I d . meant to me when I was a youngster, although I was one of a small family. In the poorer communities the picture show provides the children with their chief amusement. It has not been, and I think cannot be, shown thai, the Government has drawn upon other avenues of taxation to an extent which justifies this tax. Some honoraMe members'have pointed out that there is not a tax on tea. I venture to say that a tax on tea would not be so burdensome as a tax on 3d. tickets would be to poor persons with large families. To my mind, the proposed tax is grossly unfair. A man with a family of four, if he went to the pictures weekly, would have to pay a tax of 4d. on the children's tickets, and 2d. on his own and his wife's tickets, whereas his next-door, neighbour, with, perhaps, only one child, or no children at all, would escape much more lightly. It is impossible to avoid the imputation that this is a tax on children, and I am not prepared to give a vote to increase the difficulty of those who are trying to bring up children decently. On the contrary, we should do all that we can to lighten their burden, and the Commonwealth and State Governments will have to give attention to this matter of devis- 25 per cent. ing means for encouraging our people to take upon their shoulders. the burdens of parentage. It is unfortunate that, at such a time as this, when the need of population is accentuated by the war, a proposal such as that under discussion should be made by the National Government. It will he with reluctance that I shall vote for a tax on 6d. tickets; I am quite unable to support the proposal to fcrix 3d tickets ' Mr Riley (South Sydney) [5.54] I regret that this propose! has been brought forward. The Government made no announcement to the electors that it would' increase the taxation of the poorer classes of the community. A great number of those who are at the Front have left behind them wive3 aud families. Their children are without their father's company in the home, and at night many a mother finds it convenient to take her offspring to the picture show for amusement. Why should we specially tax those who have allowed their home life to be broken up in the interests of the country? It is unfair to put a tax on the amusements of the children. I represent a large metropolitan constituency, and I know that the numerous picture shows in my district are well patronized by children on Saturday afternoons and during the summer evenings. Yet it is proposed to tax the children's admission tickets at the Tate of 33$ per cent.",47
225,Mr LISTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Do the children pay only 3d. for admission to a night show?,47
226,Mr RILEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Yes . The Government could get the revenue that it needs from some other source. There is no statesmanship about the present proposal. The public has not asked for this taxation; and when it was last proposed, a majority voted against it. I have here a list of firms which, since the war, have increased their reserves enormously. For instance, the reserve funds of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company were increased last year from £294,817 to £498,530.",47
227,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"We get 75 per cent, of their excess profits. Mr FEN'TON - The same thing happens in Great Britain.",47

229,Mr RILEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Messrs . Huddart Parker and Company have increased their reserves from £75,405 to £308,000, and the Bacchus Marsh Concentrated Milk Company has increased its reserves to £10,265. The taxation of these reserves should be proposed.",47

233,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I moved an amendment to prevent it , which you voted against.",47
234,Mr RILEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The fact that such large reserves are being put aside shows that the Government are not doing enough. The number of big firms in Sydney Melbourne which are increasing their reunder serves enormously is astonishing. I am not looking for a political catch-cry; oppose this tax, because I think that and 6d. tickets of admission to entermillions tainments should be exempt from taxaing tion. If the Government will withdraw to the present proposal, I shall be willing assist to raise revenue in other ways. The poorer people must be protected from extra taxation. It has not been proposed to increase taxation in other directions at the rate at which 3d. tickets are to be taxed.",47
235,Mr SAMPSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Will the honourable member deny that wages are higher than they were, and money more plentiful ?",48
236,Mr RILEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Wage s are higher than they were, but, as Mr Knibbs' statistics show, the cost of living has increased more rapidly than the rate of wages, and, therefore, the workers are not so well off now as they were before the war. Clothing and the various necessaries of life have increased in price by 30 to 35 per cent. Rates of wages have not increased to that extent. In view of the opinions that have been expressed, the Government should withdraw this proposal. I would favour the increasing of the taxation on Is. and higher-priced tickets. If that were done, and 6d. tickets were exempted, the revenue would benefit.",48
237,Mr LYNCH,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Werriwa) [6.2] - As the honourable member for Perth (M Fowler) and the honourable member for that New Zealand Illawarra (Mr Lamond) have largely of the world voiced my opinions on this matter, I shall not detain the Committee long. Many years ago, when a fight was being made for women's rights, we heard a great deal about the principle of no tion without representation. I maintain that the tax now under discussion falls upon the married men of the community, or, rather, upon those possessing large families, and is a violation of the ciple to which I have referred. Federal and State authorities, by giving certain exemptions from income taxation, are seeking to make things better for married man, and I do not propose to discuss now how far that legislation goes in the direction of equity. The great majority of parents, however, are not subject to income taxation, and, therebe outraged. fore, do not benefit by these exemptions. On the casual labourer or small-salaried and person with a big family the tax now discussion would fall heavily. I cannot support such taxation, although I reI cognise the. need for revenue. Some time 3d. ago I made a suggestion whereby several a year could be raised, by temptthose who now rush to race-courses bet, or take part in raffles and lotteries, to to put their money into a Commonwealth lottery, with war bonds as prizes. We all aim at the millennium, when Parliaments will be able to tax people into prosperity, or to trick them into reform, but I have not heard any sound arguments advanced against my suggestion, though it has provoked prejudice on the ground that it encourages, or gives legal protection to, gambling. I think - that we should take advantage, not only of - the patriotism of the people, but also of their fondness for distraction or their wish to take short cuts to fortune, by gambling, to get the revenue which we so greatly need. The country is in such dire straits for money that we should avail ourselves of all legitimate means. We could easily sell at the' various post offices throughout Australia, through the Postmaster-General's Department, 5s. lottery tickets, and the extra ^ d . postage would pay the cost of administering the lottery. Then, out of every £1,000,000 collected we could allot £800,000 in war bonds at 5 per cent, for prizes. If we did this we should knock out of business every sweep in Australia and help to do away r . with all other gambling. I may be told and other parts have not taken the initiative in this matter, but Australia is making precedents for the world. Australia, by claiming as a people's right the right to say what shall be done with taxaits man power, has shown what a true Democracy is entitled to do before it canbe regarded as a real self-governing community. I have never gambled, and have no desire to win other people's money, prinand much less to lose my own. But I The know that the majority of the people would prefer to nut their money into a gamble rather than into anything else. the Tbey are doing that in connection even with the churches and many other institutions. But we, in this Parliament, are on such a pedestal that we dare not do that for fear that public morality would",48
238,Mr WATT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,The honourable member will be excommunicated if he is not careful.,49
239,Mr LYNCH,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Perhaps it is a case of fools rushing in where angels fear to tread. The vast majority of the people, when they realise what was pointed out by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), that we are about to be faced with an interest bill of £15,000,000 per annum, would support the suggestion I have made. Quite a number of good people, who think that they would be booking a passage for the lower region if they were to pay 5s. into a lottery, with war bonds as prizes, will speculate on the Stock Exchange, the seasons, aud even on the life blood of their fellow citizens. Those people, when they realise that the interest bill will have to be paid, will recognise that a scheme which promises to earn annually millions of pounds for the revenue, and to place war bonds into the hands of hundreds of thousands of people, who will thus be given a strong interest in maintaining the stability of the country's finances, if for no higher motive than self-interest, is one that they cannot afford to neglect. Many people who hitherto were strongly prejudiced on this matter have thawed considerably, and, to my certain knowledge, now admit that they can see no. moral objection to the proposal. I hope that the Treasurer, instead of, as the Bulletin says, "" putting everything on the k i d , "" will see that the chap who selfishly takes advantage of the high rate of wages, but refuses to marry, though willing to speculate, is made to pay his share. The high . wages benefit only the single man, because, as the honourable member for Calare (Mr . Pigott) has shown, whilst wages have risen, the cost of living has increased, and that increase is borne by the married man only. Those persons who do not take on themselves tamily obligations are free of the chief disability which the high cost of living puts on the people, and I trust that they will be made to pay by the means I have suggested.",49

If my information is correct, the honourable member has given many a kiddie money with which to get admission to a picture show. We all have done that, and it does seem pitiable that in Australia, where we have not yet touched even the first penny of "" the last shilling,"" we shoud impose a tax of 33$ par cent. on. the kiddies.

The Government are proposing to tax children who never should be taxed.

I ask the Government whether it is worthwhile to persist with this tax. shilling tickets' if you like, but an impost of 33$ per cent, on the tickets of the kiddies is too much. Imagine the joy the children would have in seeing the pictures if they had the extra penny which will be gathered by this tax to spend on lollies or peanuts. I ask the Treasurer, in memory of the old days, when so many children used to crowd about hi m and nie in North Melbourne, whether it is fair to make the children pay an extra I d . for their amusement. I promise him that I will help hi m to tax the higherpriced tickets as much as he likes. I again commend to the Government the suggestion of the,honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) for the establishment of Commonwealth lotteries, and if the few ""wowsers"" object, let them ""wowse"" and "" w o w s e "" on. Their howls will not prevent a common-sense man like the Treasurer proceeding on his way. I strongly protest against the infamy that was done in connection with the existing tax on entertainments. Hoyt's organization, with others, did not wish to pass the tax on to the people, but was compelled to do so, because otherwise its theatres would not have been supplied with films, and the business could not have been carried on. The Treasurer will agree that the proper way of taxing the picture shows is to attack the profits of the proprietor.",50

Whilst we all agree with the Treasurer that in this time of the country's trouble increased taxation must be raised, especially having regard to the clouds that are looming up on the horizon, I ask him to waive this trifling tax, and to tackle the profits of the proprietors. Of such a policy nobody could complain.  honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has made out a strong case for the exemption of the 3d. tickets. I suppose the honourable member was not aware that such an exemption would not benefit the country children.",50
260,Dr MALONEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I should have proposed to exempt the 6d. tickets also.  tricts the minimum charge is 6d. 1 suggest that the Government should exempt from taxation the tickets of all children under fourteen years of age, regardless of whether the value of the ticket be 3d., 6d., or Is. I have always fought for taxpayers with families. They pay heavy taxation, and their expenses have been greatly increased since the outbreak of war. Most honourable members on the Opopsition side use as the spear-point of their argument the fact that the children of the soldiers will have to pay the tax. As honourable members on both sides seem to think that the children of soldiers should not be taxed, I ask the Treasurer to exempt them, and also the children of married nurses who are serving with our Forces..",51
261,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D," An accepted principle in regard to taxation is that it should always be imposed on people best able to bear it, and aa the proposal of the Government is to tax lower-priced tickets, which are undoubtedly those mostly used by the working classes of the community, means placing taxation on those least, able to bear it, I am deterred from giving it my support.",51
262,Mr GREGORY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Then the honourable membeT would strongly support a bachelor tax? m,51
263,Mr FIN,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"LAYSOW - If a bachelor tax is brought forward accepting the principle which I have laid down, I promise to give it my support. This is the third occasion on which an entertainments tax has been before the Chamber. I opposed the proposal of the 'honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) to impose a tax upon 6d. tickets. I opposed the proposal of the honourable member for Grey (Mr. Poynton) to tax 3d. tickets as well as 6d. tickets, and my regret was that even Is. tickets were not exempted; but how. that a tax is imposed on Is. tickets, I am prepared to allow it to stand, though my objection still holds good in regard to 3d. and 6d. tickets. Although the major portion of the expenditure on small-priced tickets is in connection with picture shows, this proposed tax will affect an enormous number of socials which are run by small societies, not for the purpose of making a profit or even to gain some particular advantage for the institutions which hold them, but purely for the sake of encouraging a social feeling among members of the societies. The tickets are sold at a nominal figure merely to cover actual expenses. The gatherings are not profit-making concerns, but are fulfilling a useful function in the community, particularly in these times when we need all the fraternal feeling engendered it is possible to get. This tax will press very unfairly, not only on the children, but on their parents. It will not be paid by the children. It must he paid by the parents. The fathers and mothers will pay not only the tax on the children's tickets, but also the tax on their own tickets; and if, through unfortunate circumstances, parents should be unable to pay | O the tax imposed on the children's tickets, then they will be equally unable to pay the tax on their own tickets. Compare this proposed tax with the taxation on the higher-priced tickets. I do not attend theatres very often, and I cannot speak with any authority on the matter, but I have not noticed that the higher-priced seats have been less patronized since the imposition of this form of taxation. It does not seem to have made the slightest difference to the attendances in the stalls, dress circle, and boxes. The men who are to be seen in the higherpriced seats in the theatres mostly follow some commercial or .professional pursuit, and consequently they are in a position to recoup themselves for the extra tax they have to pay, because they can pass it on to their customers or clients. As a matter of fact, they look upon the purchase of theatre tickets as part of their regular expenditure in their affairs, and consequently they collect it from their customers. From whom can the working man collect the tax? He is the only man in the community who cannot pass it on. He must either pay the tax or do without entertainment. The argument which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) has applied to the workers-that if they cannot afford to pay this tax they can stay at homeshould also be made to apply to the man who pays higher prices for seats in the theatre. If the Treasurers idea is to secure revenue, and if he will relieve the worker3 of this particular tax, I am prepared to give him my support in an endeavour to secure the necessary revenue by increasing the tax payable on the higher-priced tickets. By doing this, we would not be laying ourselves open to the charge that we are putting an increased tax on the poorer people out of proportion to the tax which those people who are better able to bear it have to pay.",51

265,Mr EINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"In ordinary circumstances I contend that the healthy amusements of the people are not fit subject for taxation. It is an entirely wrong principle to select the recreations of the people as a means of revenue. It is accepted that relaxation from ordinary toil is necessary. The Arbitration Court, in fact, has established the principle, and, in estimating the cost of living, it has taken into consideration such items as'recreation.",52

269,Mr LISTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Does the honourable member think picture shows are healthful?,52
270,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Menta l development is just as important as ordinary physical recreation may be. There may be education of a character which is healthful, and also that which is neither healthful physically, morally, nor mentally. When I say that ordinarily the recreations of the people should not be a source of revenue I am immediately confronted with the fact that these are not ordinary circumstances. Rightly or wrongly, we have now decided that people who can afford to have amusements in time of war can afford to pay the tax; and, if they desire to evade paying, it is competent for them to forswear the luxury of amusements. It is a sound principle in time of war to confine taxation as much as possible to luxuries.' It is when we tax the necessities of life that the pinch is felt. In time of war we can dispense with a number of things which, otherwise, would be looked upon as perfectly legitimate, so far as our means of entertainment are concerned. It has been suggested that one satisfactory result of the imposition of this tax, especially upon the 6d. ticket, will be that it will hit a large number of people who patronize cricket and football matches. If it is intended to impose additional burdens upon such people, this is rather an unsatisfactory method. Persons who pay 6d. to see a football match will not be deterred by having to pay an extra penny. If it is desired to make it uncomfortable for them to go to football matches there are other than financial ways of getting at them. The fact is, this is purely a revenue-producing proposal, and, from that point of view, may have its advantages; but, in securing revenue from those who can afford it, we not only penalize them, but a number of other people who have not equal opportunities of recreation. It must be recognised that the people from whom the Government are to draw this revenue are the people who can least afford to pay any increased taxation at present. We cannot be oblivious of the fact that the working classes are staggering under heavy financial burdens. They are carrying a load which, under ordinary circumstances, they should not and would not be expected to shoulder. We are proving every day that it is the working class that pays th© expenses of a war, and gets the least advantage from a war, whether the nation concerned wins or loses. It is notorious that th© only people in the country today who ar© making money, and whose incomes have advanced, are the people who can afford to pay for their seats at a theatre up to 10s. and one guinea. The same argument does not apply, even proportionately, to the people who can afford to do no more than attend a picture show.  cordance with fact.",52
271,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"It is a matter of ordinary observation and intelligence. If it is revenue the Government require, there are people in the community who can afford to contribute that revenue, and who can do without their entertainments if they wish to evade paying this tax. Those are the people who pay 4s., 5s., 10s., and even up to 20s. for a seat.",52
272,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Would you make the tax 33 per cent, all round?",52
273,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I would, starting with. la.",53
274,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,That is not all round.,53

276,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Mak e no invidious distinctions.,53
277,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,We are compelled to. The income tax makes invidious distinctions. The compulsory measure in respect to the purchase of war loan bonds will make distinctions.,53
278,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,This is a voluntary tax. No man need pay it .,53
279,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The same argument applies to all taxes. If the honourable member desires to live like a wild man in the bush, he need pay no taxes; but we have to recognise that the people desire to live as human beings in a social community, and that they are entitled to such recreations as they are able to pay for. And their ability to pay for relaxation should not be determined by those who can afford to pay big prices for their amusements. They are not in the position to understand what is a reasonable thing for the people who cannot afford to buy costly seats at a show. We cannot have equality all round unless there is equality of circumstances, demanding a proportionate equality of sacrifice. There ar© enormous numbers of people who are "" hard up , "" compared with such gentlemen as the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett). The whole method of taxation, if equitable, must be based on the recognition of the principle that those who can afford to pay should pay, and that those who cannot afford to pay should not be asked to pay. The people who are to be asked to pay this tax are already carrying the burden of the community in unreasonable proportion. The people who cannot afford to pay it have, in the ordinary course of l if e, to count every penny; and now they must either accept an additional burden or give up relaxative amusement.",53
280,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Accordin g to your argument there should be free picture shows, free circuses, and free publichouses.",53
281,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,We are recognising the fact now that the country should provide healthy amusements for the people,53
282,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,And free public-houses.,53
283,Mr FINLAYSON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The r e is nothing wrong with the public-bouses. It is only the stuff they sell. Taking the broadest view today, this tax is going to h it people who cannot afford to pay it , and the people who can afford to pay it are not going to be penalized at all.",53
284,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Maribyrnong) [7.59] Among people who have anything to do with the working community, it is recognised that there are two nights in the week, particularly, when mother, father, and the children go to the picture theatre. In many working centres the weekly pay-day falls upon a Friday. Sometimes the pay is on a Friday night, and then the picture show is patronized on the Saturday night. But, surely, the National Parliament can engage in more important duties in regard to taxation proposals than in trying to penalize the children. Many honourable members in their juvenile days had few opportunities for amusement. Some of us as children had little; if any, pocket money, but, like the honourable member for Maranoa  did not enjoy these privileges, I do not wish to deny to those who follow us that amusement and recreation which are part and parcel of the life of the rising generation. Without the opportunities for recreation and amusement which they have enjoyed, our soldiers would not have acquitted themselves as they have done. I have never seen an objectionable film exhibited in any picture show that I have attended in this or other States. If undesirable films are thrown upon the screen today the Board of Censors is to blame. Every film has to be examined by the Board before it is released for exhibition.",53
285,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Who constitute the Board of Censors ?,53
286,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Mr Archibald Strong, Dr Cumpston, and Sir H a r r y Wollaston.",53

Mr Fenton . Since the Board of Censors are responsible for the proper supervision of films screened in Australia, the argument that this tax will tend to do away with, objectionable picture shows falls absolutely to the ground. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) delivered a most impassioned speech this afternoon. The burden of his cry was, "" This is only a tax of I d . "" If it were the only tax that had to be paid by those who patronize picture shows, the position would not be so bad; but there are thousands of people who are passing on to the working classes the taxation imposed upon them. Mr RICHAB D FOSTEB ever suggested a method by which that passing on of taxation may be avoided.",53
289,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Surely we can evolve a scheme by which those best able to bear taxation will be compelled to pay it in stead of passing it on to the masses of the people.,54

291,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Economists all the world over are discussing it now, and never before was it so generally admitted that taxation is consistently passed on to the shoulders of the poor.

There are others who will be cheered by my announcement-^I refer to the working classes who have to shoulder the great mass of taxation."" a candid admission. It is this constant imposition of additional levies upon the poor that compels us to protest. breaking point must come; the day will come when those who are bearing the great load of taxation will say, / ' We cannot carry it any longer.""",54

294,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"It is coming. Here we have a proposal to impose an additional burden of taxation to the extent of £270.000 u.pon the workers, and really upon their children, who visit picture shows. ",54
295,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"It is not rubbish. The mere fact that thousands of people flock to places of. amusement does not detracc from the reasonableness of my argument. There are thousands of homes in Australia where at the week end the husband hands over to his wife his week's wages, less a day's pay, which he has lost, perhaps, through sickness. The loss of that one day's pay means that there is no picture show for the children that week. Even when the full wage is brought home, if one of the boys wants a pair of boots No one has or a pair of knickers, that extra demand upon the family purse means that the children have to be deprived of their righ t to a little amusement. When this is the position in thousands of homes in Australia today, why do honourable members opposite persist in overloading with taxation the workers, who have such a hard fight to live?",54

298,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Undoubtedly . Tho Treasurer, who is usually strong in argument, advanced this afternoon a paltry reason for the imposition of this tax. He additional told us that the people would have to His statement bear this year an additional £6,000,000 of taxation, and that, whether the war ends this year or not, it would be necessary next year to impose still further taxation to the extent of £6,000,000. In other words, he says that since there is a likeliTha't was hood of additional taxation next year we should begin this year with taxation of the poorer people, and allow the-taxation The of the rich to stand over for another twelve months. The ,people cannot go on carrying these burdens. Surely we can devise some better means than this of raising revenue. If the Government would nationalize insurance business, and open insurance offices throughout Australia, they would secure an additional revenue of hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum. I hope that we shall induce some honourable members opposite to vote with us against this proposal. I do not know whether it has already been considered in Caucus, but I think the arguments that have been advanced during this debate should be sufficient to at least induce tha Treasurer to withdraw his proposal to tax amusement tickets of less than Is.",54

300,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"No ; I do not think it is reasonable. I would not tax any amusement tickets below Is. each. Let us have a little sympathy for those who find the battle of life so hard. The big merchants of Australia are' making handsome profits, and they are passing on to their customers, not only the taxation imposed upon them, but the interest on our borrowed money.",55
301,Mr CORSER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,That shows how little the honourable member understands what he is talking about.,55

The leading thinkers and economists in Britain and elsewhere all admit this fact, although some of them do not agree with the politics of the Labour party.

The same critic, by the way, used to go to his club every night to play bridge and Lllliards, and indulge in that form of recreation, which, apparently, he did not deny himself, although he thought it a great sin that people who took an interest in football should pay 6d. entrance-fee to a match in war-time. I say that, although there are weeping eyes in this community, because of what the war has meant to Australia, it is a good thing to keep some of our recreation and amusements going, because we need an occasional laugh in our community amid all these sorrows and trials.",55

320,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Yarra) [8.46] - Evi dently the great majority of honourable members are billing that the children who attend picture shows shall be taxed to the extent of 33$ per cent, upon their 3d. tickets. It has been insinuated that honourable members upon this side of the chamber are opposing the Bill for electioneering purposes. No such charge can. lie against me. I emphatically protest against the children of the poor of the community being taxed 33$ per cent, upon their 3d. tickets for admission to picture shows, whilst the rich landholders are allowed to escape with a tax of only 20 per cent. This proposal is absolutely an infamous one.  try will not be taxed 33$ per cent, upon their picture show tickets.",58
321,Mr TUDOR,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Personally, I was anxious that no tax should be levied upon the 6d. tickets. I believe that' that would be quite fair. But it is obviously unjust that the children of the poorer section of the community shall be required to pay a tax of 33$ per cent., whilst the wealthy landholders, who are piling up their millions at the expense of the people, are allowed to escape with an impost of 20 per cent. The honourable member for Wide Bay said that this is voluntary taxation, inasmuch as no person need attend a picture show. In reply, may I be permitted to remind him that no person need own land. To my mind, the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat was the most effective criticism that has been launched against this proposal. While thousands of our fellowcountrymen are fighting at the Eront, and freely making the supreme sacrifice, the children whom they have left behind are about to be taxed, to the extent of 33$ per cent., upon the little entertainment which they can get at the picture shows. Hitherto South Australia and Tasmania have imposed no tax upon 3d. picture show tickets, but when the Commonwealth taxes those tickets I have no doubt that - the States in question will follow its example in oppressing the poor. The proposal embodied in this Bill is estimated to yield £275,000 per annum. That amount is to be wrung out of the people who patronize the very cheapest form of amusement obtainable in this country. What has been the action of picture show proprietors in our midst? Everybody knows that they have freely advertised our war loans, and have also made constant appeals for recruits, without any payment whatever. Night after night these appeals are thrown on the screens. Contrast their conduct with that of the patriotic newspapers, which charge up to 25s. per inch for advertisements relating to the same subjects. Yet the patrons of our picture theatres are to be penalized by this unfair and discriminating tax. The Government are after the widow's mite. The honourable member for Perth said that Ministers had found themselves in a difficulty at the end of the year, and consequently had to resort to further taxation in this direction. May I suggest, that the poorer classes of this community find themselves in a difficulty to make ends meet soon after each payday? Cotton, for example, has increased in price from 3d. to 7$d. or 8d. per reel since the outbreak of the war. The cost of every household requirement has increased, so that poor people are at their wits' end to know how to live. Yet the Government are now attempting to rob them by imposing an additional tax of 33$ per cent, upon their amusements,- in order to prevent the taxation of those who are making millions sterling out of the war.",58
322,Mr CHARLTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Newcastle) [8.52] I protest against this Bill on the ground that it is unjust to apply such taxation only to the poor people of this country. It cannot be denied that the 3d. and 6d. patrons of our picture shows comprise the very poorest classes of the community. These are the people who, owing to the war, have been put to sore straits to provide themselves Will the necessaries of life. The purchasing power of the sovereign has decreased by 30 per cent, or 40 per cent., and in such circumstances are we justified in levying this tax upon the very poorest section of the people? There are many soldiers' widows who have been left with families whose only amusement consists of a visit to a picture show on Saturday night. Under this Bill these persons will be taxed to the extent of 7d. per week. It has been urged that in country districts there are very few persons who purchase 3d. tickets. But throughout my own district the number is exceedingly large. I could quite understand a proposal to tax people who are in affluent circumstances, but a proposal to tax the amusements of the poorest section in our midst is quite a different matter. In their desire to obtain revenue, the Government are going to levy an impost upon people who cannot even get the necessaries of life .",58
323,Mr CORSER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,Righ t through the E m pire that condition obtains.,59
324,Mr CHARLTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"That may be so, but that fact is no justification for this Parliament loading those who are least able to bear taxation with more than their fair share, especially in a country like Australia, which is richer than is any other part of the world. If the able member for Wide Bay will direct his attention to the rich profiteers of this country, he will be rendering the State better service. I have heard the question asked why it is proposed to increase our land tax and our income tax. own opinion is that the income tax should be made to pay the entire cost of the war to Australia. To-day most of the persons who are paying income tax are better off than they ever were before, because they have been able to make inordinate profits by reason of the increases which have taken place in the price of the necessaries of life. I repeat that nobody can justify the taxation proposed in this Bill . There are other avenues of taxation open to us without the necessity for burdening the poorest class of the community with this impost.",59
325,Mr FENTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Many of the people who will pay this tax ought to be provided with entertainment free. Mr Charlton"" - Exactly . Amusement is far better for them than is medicine. There are many families in Australia today whose members require the services of a doctor merely because they are denied a little wholesome amusement. They are unable to get away for an occasional holiday, and are obliged to remain in the one place year after year. only recreation is a night at the picture show, perhaps once a week. people the Government are saying, "" On account of the war in which we are engaged, we intend to levy a tax of 33$ per cent, upon your 3d. tickets of admission."" That is grossly unfair. A trifling addition to our income tax would yield the £275,000 which the Treasurer estimates he will obtain from the taxation of these tickets. If the cost of living had not been allowed to increase so materially since the outbreak of war, the same objection might not be urged against the Bill . But during that period the cost of living has risen by 40 per cent. What is the position of a soldier's wife whose husband is fighting for our liberties today? She is not receiving a larger amount than she did formerly. The soldier is being paid only 5s. per day apart from his deferred pay of Is. per day. Let a soldier be as careful as he likes, fie must have at least Is., and should have 2s., a day to spend. Notwithstanding the increase in the cost of living, we have honor- not increased the pay of our soldiers or the allowances of their dependants. A woman with a small family, whose husband is at the Front, has a very hard task in making ends meet, with prices as high as they are. Yet it is proposed to add to My the burdens of such women. Parliament does not give sufficient thought to tEe difficulties of the poorer section of the community, who gain nothing from the war. Our men have shown their loyalty to the country, to the Empire, and to the Allies by risking everything in their defence, so that we may remain bere in security, yet we do not hesitate to pile taxation on the dear ones whom they have left behind. Parliament should be above taxing the 3d. ticket which gives the child admission to a picture show. Some honourable-members seem to think that the proposed tax would not affect a large number of persons. I know that in the Newcastle district every one goes to the 3d. seats. People there cannot afford more.",59
326,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,In Melbourne the picture theatres are full every night.,59
327,Mr CHARLTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,A r e not the attendances composed chiefly of the poorer members of the community ?,59
328,Mr BOYD,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,There are many persons there in f u r coats.,59
329,Mr CHARLTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"The fact that perTheir sons with money go to the cheaper seats in the picture theatres doss not justif y To these us in taxing the poor persons who are forced to go there. Very often a mother finds it a very difficult matter to get sufficient money to take her children to the pictures. When she has calculated what it will cost in tram fares and entrance money, she often discovers that the Shilling or two in her purse is insufficient, and the f a m i l y have to forego an anticipated pleasure. In New South ""VVales tram fares have been increased, and it is proposed to increase them still further. How can we expect the manhood of this country to respond to appeals to patriotism when those who have gone to fight find that in their absence we are overloading their loved ones with taxation.",59
330,Mr WEST,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,It will create discontent.,60
331,Mr CHARLTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"It is creating discontent - So many things have been done since the war commenced which are prejudicial to the interests of the men who are serving with the colours that there is a great reaction against recruiting. No one is more anxious than I am to obtain recruits, but I know that we have done many things which have told against recruiting. I get many letters from mothers containing complaints in regard to separation allowances administration, and I know what their feelings will be when they find that it will cost them 6d. or 7d. a time more to send their children to a picture show. In many cases the tax will prevent the children of such mothers from going to the pictures. There are many other sources of taxation of which the Government has not availed itself. If there were not, it would be a bad thing for us. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt ) has told us that each year we must be prepared for additional taxation. If there were no other source of revenue than the taxation of picture theatre tickets, our position would be a bad one. As a matter of fact, there is much wealth yet untaxed. The wealthy should have contributed more towards the cost of the war from the very beginning, and the Government should have borrowed less. Those who have benefited by the increase in prices should contribute more towards the expenses of the war. In all countries there are persons who benefit by a war. We hear about price fixing, but in my district the fixing of the prices of meat has made that article of food 2d. per l b . dearer. The poor have little for which to thank this Parliament. Instead of assisting the poor, we assist the rich. Those who are rearing cattle, or growing wheat and wool, are doing well; but instead of requiring them to find the money necessary for the war, we tax the poor to get it . It is proposed to increase the income tax by only 30 per cent., and to put a tax of 33$ per cent, on picture-theatre tickets. Many of those who pay income tax are receiving more money how than they could earn before the war; but the position of the poor grows persistently worse, and will continue to do so while the war lasts, because the purchasing power of money is diminishing. Sooner or later, we shall be forced to give consideration to the claims of those who are not well off. It is surprising to me that there should be a majority in favour of taxing 3d. and 6d. theatre tickets. I should not object to increasing the taxation of higher-priced tickets; but 3d. and 6d. tickets should be exempt from taxation. ' Legislation of the kind proposed will injure the Government in the eyes of the people. I shall strenuously oppose the Bill , and in Committee will test the feeling of honourable members in regard to its various provisions, so that there may be a record of the names of those who vote for the taxing of 3d. and 6d. tickets.",60
332,Mr LECKIE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Indi ) [9.10] - This is the first time since I entered the House that I have heard the Opposition in full blast on their particular electioneering stunt. We have heard to-night, ad nauseam, their expressions of sympathy with the poor children, of the widow, and of the soldiers' dependants whom this tax will prevent from going to the picture theatres. I could not help wondering what the children did years ago, when there were no picture shows. How was it that honourable gentlemen opposite managed to grow up so happy and prosperous, with a childhood in which picture shows were unknown. Let us go into figures a little to study the effect of the Government proposal. It is estimated that a tax on 3d. and 6d. admission tickets will yield £275,000. That means that £1,500,000 is paid for admission on 3d. and 6d. tickets. There are in Australia about 1,000,000 children between the ages of four and sixteen. If the proposed tax will fall wholly upon the children, each child between those ages must visit a picture show 100 times a year, or twice a week. We know that many thousands of children do not go to the pictures twice a year. Therefore, to make up the average, we must assume either that the children in the big cities go to the picture theatres about five times a week, or that the tax falls not wholly upon cbildren, but largely upon adults.",60
333,Mr RICHABDFOSTER,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"In Melbourne, more adults than children go to the picture theatres.",61
334,Mr CHARLTON,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"My point was that the tax falls on the poorer members of the community, children and adults.",61
335,Mr LECKIE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Then the children are to be abandoned? I have some children who are rather inclined to be picture fiends. If they go to a picture show more than once a week they are unfitted for school the next day,- and completely unfitted for the training they ought to have. If this tax does nothing else .than restrain some of the younger children from going to picture shows four or five times a week it will do good work for Australia. I have shown by a few figures that, after all, children will not be deprived of the little pleasure of going to a picture show. Picture shows are not an absolute necessity, although I grant they give great pleasure. We are all anxious to give the children pleasure, but the children of ten years ago did not have this particular form of it , and they grew up just as good men and women as the present ones will. There is, therefore, not such a lar^e amount of reason in the argument the Opposition have put up with such fervour. Mr RICHARD FOSTER.;-It is all",61
336,Mr LECKIE,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"I would not say that. munity I think they believe it , but they did non have exact figures, and the figures given them will show them that there if not quite so much in their argument as they thought.",61
337,Mr BLAKELEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"Darling ) [9.17] In dealing with this question the workers' share in 'this war must be taken into consideration. I refer to their share, not only in contributing over 85 per cent, flesh and blood, but money too. It has been said, and truly , in this chamber that the working classes-the producers-pa for this war. They will continue to pay for it ; and if we continue under the isting financial conditions, the workers hundreds of years hence will still being for it . In the last twelve months there have been France Day, Violet Day, Wattle Day, and innumerable Red Cross days. Hardly a week goes by when I do not pass such a day in operament tion when going through the of- Melbourne or Sydney. sums are constantly raised from the people by these means, and the money question. goes to relieve the Government of certain financial responsibilities,- especially in regard to the Red Cross, the Comforts Fund, and many other funds. Most of those who have children know that the schools have systems whereby on certain days the children are expected to bring a penny or twopence, or a pound of potatoes, or a pound of sugar, or a couple of eggs instead. Very large sums are raised through that avenue. The people of Australia, particularly the working classes, have been intensely patriotic in subscribing to patriotic funds.",61

339,Mr BLAKELEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"So intensely patriotic are some of the wealthy people that the Government are compelling, or bluffing, them to put their money into the war loan. What a travesty! Government supporters talk about the patriotism of their class. Only for ths Government's bluff the Government's war loan would probably fall to the ground. Because the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) is afraid it will fall to the ground, he has brought forward this bluff today.",61

The honourable member for Indi (Mr Leckie) is not sure, after all, whether this tax will not confer a boon on the community by preventing people from going to picture shows. He is not at all sure that it would not be better if all our children, and probably ourselves, were obliged to keep away from pictures. I am wondering whether this is another of those pieces of repressive legislation under the disguise of patriotism and of winning the war.",62

The rich pay their share- T don't think. When they do pay their share, they do it very reluctantly, so much so that some of them have to be compelled. The working classes have not to be compelled to do tlieir share in Australia. If this tax is passed, I predict that the money which is received by means of collecting boxes throughout the cities and towns will diminish considerably. The fathers and mothers of the children of the working classes will be justified in refusing to contribute f u r ther.",62
352,Mr JOWETT,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,You libel them in suggesting it .,62
353,Mr BLAKELEY,TAXATIO N OF TEA AN D,"They will be quite justified, because they are now doing their share. They have raised millions of pounds by means of collection boxes, and they would be quite justified in calling a halt. If tli© working classes have to finance this war, if they have to bear the whole brunt of it , and pay the interest on it , they will be quite justified in refusing to do it other than through the taxation channels. Of course; we all know that the Compulsory Loan Bill is bluff, and that the Government have not the courage to bring it into operation. It is something like a Bill brought before this House some time ago by the late right honourable member for Swau (Lord Forrest), with all its . trappings and all its glitter, and its quotations from Macaulay. Every honourable member opposite cheered the then Treasurer when he brought down that Bill ; but it was taken out of the back door very bedraggled, and afterwards dropped. Th© fate that befell th© bachelor tax will befall the Compulsory Loan Bill . My friends opposite do not represent the people of Australia. They represent the wealthy classes, and will do nothing to hur t th© feelings of the capiyou talist. That is what the Employers Federation, the Pastoralists Union, th© Farmers and Settlers Association, and many other organizations put their cash, into the party funds for. In New South Wales they put up £50,000 to get their party into power, their object being to protect their interests, to allow them to inflate prices ad l i b . , to increase the price of tobacco, and rob the people right and honourable left. That is what honourable members opposite are in Parliament for. That is why tlieir party machinery has been so well oiled with golden sovereigns. Flonorable members opposite laugh, but I would remind them that there is nothing like gold to oil things, and there has been a good deal of oiling going on in our community recently. To carry out a promise, and to gull the people, a wartime profits tax was brought down, but it turned' out to be an insignificant thing bringing in a paltry quarter of a million pounds from the wealthy of the community. I believe the receipts from the tax on 3d. and 6d. tickets will exceed that. There is one tax on the working classes and another on the very wealthy, and the receipts from the working class tax exceed those from the other. Where the wealthy pay 20 per cent., the working classes pay 33 per cent. The organizations which put money into the National or Liberal party's campaign funds are getting their dividends back threefold, and in some cases twentyfold. . I wish honourable members opposite well of their effort to win the war. I wish them well of their endeavours to place further restrictive taxation on the people who can least afford to pay it .

[247] There will be based upon this resolution^ if consented to by the Committee, the' usual Supply Bill , which covers roughly The Committee three months, and will carry us almost to the middle of January next. Included 33 in the total asked for are the following 14 amounts:-Ordinar y departmental expenditure, £2,619,715; war expenditure 19 payable from revenue, £1,767,985; refunds AYES. of revenue, £150,000. The amount in cluded for salaries covers a little more than three months, because under the system of fortnightl y pays, seven payments will f all due within the period covered by Supply. It is anticipated that large payments will f all due within the next three months for refunds of income tax and war-time profits tax. This has necessitated a provision for refunds of revenue in excess of one-fourth of the total estimated expenditure f b r the year. The Tellers: provision for ordinary services is £182,250, less than one-fourth of the estiNOES. mated expenditure for the year. The amount included for war services is mainly for war pensions and repatriation of soldiers, and is based on the estimated requirements for the year. Provision is Tellers: included for increases to salaries only inr those cases where increments are automatic under Act or Regulation or A r b i tration Court award, and even in these cases increments are not provided where the increased salary will exceed £200 per annum. Increments to salaries above £200 will, as usual, await the passage of the Appropriation Bill . The services prof o r in this resolution and covered by the Bill to follow have been previously ON approved by Parliament. I hope the Committee will agree to the resolution to the passage of the Bill before the TERRIHouse rises to-night. To-morrow will be COTTON a very broken day. We will assemble as usual at 11 o'clock.

To-day they asked us to allow them to proceed with a Bill which imposes one of the most iniquitous taxes ever submitted to any Parliament. Ever since the House re-assembled on the 18th September the Treasurer (Mr . W at t ) knew that Supply must be granted before the middle of October. I have not the slightest doubt that the Treasury officials have advised the Treasurer almost every day that Supply must be passed by a certain time; but at 9.35 the Treasurer rose, and said, "" I want £4,500,000 before honourable members go home to-night."" There could be no better demonstration of the unwisdom of adopting the guillotine than the action of the Government to-night. speech hat been made on the Budget except that by the Treasurer, and yet that honourable gentleman is to-night asking the Committee for Supply for three months. He has said, in effect, "" We know we have a lot of dumb dogs "" - I with draw that expression ' and say, "" docile supporters who will do anything' once they have agreed to our proposals in the Caucus."" The Ministerial party, having agreed upstairs that they Bhall only in crease by 20 per cent, the taxation of the rich landholders, who are their principal supporters, and who paid money into the National party funds at election time, as an insurance against heavy taxation, now come into the chamber, and say, "" We want a vote of £4,500,000 in one hour and a quarter.""",63
355,Mr WATT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,I am astonished at my own moderation.,64
356,Mr TUDOR,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,What would the honourable gentleman like?,64

358,Mr TUDOR,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"The honourable gentleman ought to get twelve months without the option for treating honourable members in the way they are being treated to-night. At about half-past 9 o'clock he did me the courtesy to inform me that he proposed' to get, a three-months' Supply Bill through to-night. - If ever MrA RCHIBALD - How often did we get a Supply Bill through in a night when the Labour party were in power?",64
359,Mr TUDOR,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"My memory is as keen as that of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald). He told us recently that he piloted a Bill through this House for compulsory voting, but there never was such a Bill introduced. I suppose the honourable gentleman was only talking in. his sleep. I challenge him to point to a single occasion on which the Labour party, when in power, submitted a Supply Bill for this amount with practically no notice at all. If he can mention a single case in which a Labour Government asked the House to put a Supply Bill through in an hour and a half, I shall be willing to withdraw what I , said about honourable members opposite being the Government's docile supporters.",64

Honourable members opposite are prepared to accept anything that the Government propose. secured their seats pledged to economy, but have never raised, their voices in favour of it . I repeat that the Government are not treating honourable members fairl y in coming down at this late hour and asking them to put through a Supply B i ll for over £4,500,000 when no opportunity has, so far, been given to discuss even one line of the Estimates. I say that this proceeding is the best evidence that there is no necessity for the guillotine motion which has been submitted. On behalf of honourable members on this side I strongly object to do anything to assist a Government who have treated the Committee so badly in giving them no opportunity to discuss the Supply Bill fairly. MrK ELLY (Wentworth) [9.50] Can the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt) inform the Committee whether the reports connected with our Naval administration have been brought to the notice of the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook)? I admit the difficulty in the matter, seeing that the Minister for the Navy is in England, but I think the Acting Prime Minister will appreciate ""at once the importance of the position. In the report of the Commission a suggestion was made that, outside matters of broad policy, the control of the Navy Department should pass from the direct hands honourable of the Minister. The Government take the view that Ministerial control must be maintained. The right honourable gentleman who has been in control of the Navy Department is not present, and it would not be fair in his absence to attack his administration. I should like the Acting Prime Minister, if he has not already done so, to bring the reports on the Navy Department to the notice of the Minister for the Navy as soon as possible, together with the report of the Sub-Committee of. the Cabinet on the same important matter.",65

The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) will remember the procedure adopted by the Government in connection with the reports to which he has referred. The report of the Commission was laid upon the table of this House after it had been carefully considered by They a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet, whose recommendations were adopted by the Cabinet, and those recommendations were laid on the table at the same time as the Commission's report. The decisions of the Cabinet varied somewhat from the re? commendations of_ the Commission. A, full statement of the basis of the findings and the recommendations of the Commission was sent by cable to the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) immediately the papers were laid before Parliament, together with an intimation of the adop; tion of the recommendations by the Cabinet, in order that he might be full y informed of the exact position.

If , for instance, we take the Works and Railways Department, we do not know what is being done by that Department. A lump sum will be voted for works at the Federal Capital site, and we do not know how the money is to be expended. The other day I asked the Minister responsible what the officers of a particular staff were doing, and I was told that they were "" w o r k in g out details."" What details ? We do not know. It has been the practice in this House all along to vote lump sums for various works, and Parliament has no control whatever over the expenditure. I do not know how many staffs there are in the Works and Railwavs Department. Colonel Owen has a staff, Mr Bell has a staff, Mr Griffin has another staff, and, I believe, the Defence Department has a further staff engaged in connection with works.

There is, I believe, a big staff employed there, but what are they doing, and what are the other departmental staffs doing?

I say that the Departments are overstaffed, and no economy is being practised in them. find, acording to the Budget papers or the Estimates, that a little time ago a gentleman was appointed to advise the Government in regard to matters in Canberra. During my term in office, I found that a gentleman, at a charge of £7 7s. a day and expenses, was giving advice to the Government which should have been given by the foreman of works at Canberra, if he was properly qualified for his position. I should like to know whether it is the same gentleman who is giving advice to the Government now.",66

376,Mr BAMFORD,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I shall be prepared to tell the Acting Prime Minister privately. I do not wish ""to mention any names here; but I speak by the card and what I am saying is absolutely correct. I am sure that honourable members generally desire to know how the money they vote is to be expended.",66
377,Mr WEST,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"East Sydney) [9.58] The Government should"" treat honourable members with more respect, and give them some information in connection with a Supply Bill . They cannot make the excuse that they did not know that a Supply Bill would be necessary, because they have known that it would be i m possible to carry on without passing a Supply Bill . Why should we be asked to vote £4,500,000 without being informed concerning a single item of expenditure? One would think that the Government were spending their own money. No one would believe that any' Government would ask a National Parliament to vote £4,500,000 without knowing what the money was to be expended for. I intend to agitate for some information before I give my vote for further expenditure in connection with the government of the country. I quite understand that the want to public officers' salaries have to be paid, but we do not know whether increases in those salaries are proposed. We saw, in connection with the famous report on the Navy Department, that a claim was 'made upon the Department for something like £30,000, and a member of the Ministry compromised by paying £25,000. We should know who made the claim, what was the basis of it , and why a member of the Government agreed to pay £25,000 of the amount claimed. We know that in connection with the Defence Department there has been exI penditure which will not bear the light of day. Are we. the custodians of the people's money or are we merely marionettes tied with strings which the Government may pull as they please? The time has come when that practice must be stopped. When the House met, the Government were well aware of the fact that a Supply Bill was necessary. Why did they not prepare it , and allow honourable members a few days in which to go cursorily through the items? The people believe that their representatives are sent here to criticise the Government expenditure; and honourable members the who are intrusted with that task should have some respect paid to them, so that they may, at least, see the items of exfactious opposition to the Bill . penditure they are called upon to that authorize, even if they do not have the opportunity of criticising them. Unforw tunately, a bad system of dealing with Supply Bills has grown up through our are dealt with. inability to give proper consideration to the Estimates; but the Government should extend to those who are supposed to be their masters that courtesy for I have just asked. If a„chang e of Government should take place, and honourable members now supporting the M i nistry were occupying the Ministerial benches, they would not let this Bill pass through to-night or tomorrow, and they would be justified in their attitude, cause our expenditure is increasing enormously. Of course, some of it cannot be avoided; but that fact does not justify Ministers in concealing the direction which it is incurred, or in not permitting generally. honourable members to criticise it . I am sure that the financial editors of the newspapers, when they cease to be so much domineered by the Government as they are now, will admit that should be the custodians of the expenditure of the country: but we do not occupy that position. Last year, when Lord ister Forrest placed the Estimates before us, every item in them had been spent. That is not a healthy position f p r honourable memVier? to occupy. There is no justification for it .  did the same thing.",66
378,Mr WEST,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"If mistakes were made in the past, it is no reason why they should be continued. We should take the first opportunity of remedying them. Honorare able members have an enormous responsiwill bility to posterity, which will have sucb a heavy burden of taxation to bear. Le us endeavour, not to intensify it , but lighten it , by paying great attention the expenditure that is going on at the present time. We have been given very few opportunities to examine it , and we are not doing justice to those whom we represent if we do not discuss the Estimates and find out where the money is being spent. It was only the other day that the Ape pointed out the enormous indebtedness that Australia is piling up. Is that not a matter worthy of serious consideration ? ' It should be riveted on minds of honourable members that it is time we brought about an alteration in our financial policy.

After six weeks, I got a statement that the Department was not aware that the man had any brothers at the Front, or that he was supporting his mother, or that he could not pass the doctor. A Department carried on upon those lines is a disgrace to the country. Imagine the position of a man who, because he does not enlist under circumstances such as I have indicated, gets the "" sack."" One would think that it would require merely the mention of the facts to the Minister concerned, when the man would be reinstated; .but a reply was received from the Department that it did not know the circumstances. I sent that reply on to the man himself, and he informed me that he was prepared to prove to the hilt that he bad made those statements to the Department, and that what he had said was true. I realise, of course, that it is of no use fighting a Department. When Mr Swan came along to carry out his great reforms, and to bring about his great economies, there was a clerk who had been in the habit of starting duty at either 9 or 9.30 a.m. daily.

It is the important question of the extension of the military hospital at Long Bay. My attention was directed to it by a very prominent member of the medical profession in Sydney, who pointed out that if a hospital for soldiers is located at a point that is not accessible to the medical profession it will be absolutely divorced from that expert technical assistance which is the backbone of every public hospital. The departmental reply to my representations on the subject is not encouraging. In a letter dated 20th September, the Department informed me thatIt has been clearly pointed out that it is immaterial where the accommodation is built provided it meets the full requirements for military patients, and the State or other authority is prepared to take over the buildings they are no longer needed by the Defence That does not meet one point put by me to the Department. The question involved relates to the inaccessibility of this site to the experts of the medical profession. Even if a doctor uses a motor car he .cannot go to Long Bay and back in less than half a day. Then, again, the friends of soldiers in such a hospital cannot go out to see them. A hospital so situated must be inaccessible. absurd proposition, but the Department is persisting in it . I hope, therefore, that the Minister will look into this matter tomorrow. Mr ""WATT - Surely the medical officers of' the Department would select the site?",69
413,Mr KELLY,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Yes . I do not know who advised the selection of this site, but generally speaking, the superior medical officers of the Defence Department-the full colonels-ar e men who were in the A r m y Medical Corps before the war broke out.",70

Medical experts will gladly respond to such a call from a hospital, but will they gladly respond if it will involve half a day's travelling to and fro? is obviously out of the question. ing to the Acting Prime Minister (Mr . Watt) I would point out that the m i l i tary doctors must have sanctioned the selection of this site. I do - not wish to labour the subject to-night, but shall content myself with the statement that these old colonels of the Arm y Medical Corps have sanctioned a whole lot of things which have been cleaned up on active service, but still go on to a certain extent in Australia. Mistakes and bungles of all kinds have happened in the Department, due to the fact that promotion has been given for pre-war services rather than for efficiency during the war period. We all know of these things happening. This matter is vital, and I should like my honourable frien d to have ready for the House tomorrow a really sound answer.",70

For weeks past the country has been deluged with statements as to the overwhelming burden of taxation' that is being piled up by the Government, as the result of their extravagance of adminisI t is an tration, and the utter absence, in spite of their professions, of any attempt at economy.

The Minister must be aware that the Administrator has neither the confidence of the people in the Territory nor the confidence of the people of Australia, but that, on the contrary, he has proved himself absolutely unfitted for his position.",71

432,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,Don' t say that.,71
433,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"But I do say it , and I think that facts can be given to show that, so far from the administration of the Territory being to the advantage of the Commonwealth, it is creating nothing but trouble while, at the same time, the expenses are increasing. What are honourable members going to do about it '",71
434,Mr WATT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"When you say that the expenses are increasing, have you made a comparison between recent estimates and those of former years?",71
435,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Yes , I have.",71
436,Mr WATT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,Then your statement is incorrect.,71
437,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"The Supply B has come upon me unawares to-night to [248] I have not readily available some information which I have been gathering; but, speaking from memory, as an illustration, I know that complaint has been made in the press recently about a motor t r ip which the A d ministrator took through the country a little while ago, and which cost the country hundreds of pounds, merely to save the Administrator the trouble of travelling either on horseback or in a buggy. It was stated that in this motor trip the Administrator crossed over country n ; which the ant hills had to be levelled down before the motor could proceed, and that they quickly re-appeared. A f t e rwards the Administrator came down to Melbourne on a little holiday. There was another statement in regard to a steamer that had been bought for the Territory. I am one of those who believe that the Territory has a great future. I have not been there, but I have read very extensively about the country, and every authority I have consulted is of the opinion that, so far from-the Territory being unf r u it f u l or useless, it ought to be a veritable asset to Australia. But,""unfortunately, there is something wrong with the administration.",71
438,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"The whole policy is wrong, and it is time the people knew something about it .",71
439,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I believe that the development of the Territory can best be accomplished by encouraging the settlement of people on grazing farms, as against the leasing of the land in large areas to big companies. I was discussing this matter with a gentleman who had lately returned from the Territory, and I have his authority to use the facts as he gave them to me, and, if necessary, to furn sh the House with his name, but : I do not want to do that.",71

441,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,I was informed by this gentleman that every ap.plicat ou : for a grazing farm by men who wanted to settle there in a small way was turned down in favour of applications by big companies who wanted to enlarge their already extensive holdings-that the big ill man was encouraged and the small man discouraged. Mr RICHA BD FOSTER - What you regard as a small area in the Territory ?',71
442,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I would regard 10,000 acres as a small area in comparison with the big leases. ' The Northern Territory can be made to produce in unlimited quantities some of the things we need. I may refer again to cotton. I should think that there is no product that we could grow so easily in the Territory as cotton.",72
443,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,It is a question labour.,72
444,Mr TUDOR,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"When we cannot ship leather away, what chance would we have of shipping cotton?",72
445,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"The fact remains money. that the Northern Territory is eminently suited for the growth of cotton, and, while it may be true there would be some diffition. culty in getting it away, we all know that in a very short time the markets of the world will be open, and. shipping is facilities will be much better than they are at the present time. What I comsideration plain about is that we are doing nothing to get ready for the time when we shall be able to ship our products away.",72
446,Mr GLYNN,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"The honourable member knows he raised that question before, and that cotton has been sent Home and exwe amined by the Imperial Institute. It is throughout the country. now only a question of labour and machinery.",72
447,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I am aware that, and I know, also, that an enormous area of the country could be prepared for cultivation in anticipation of future quirements. Look at what is being done in the way of cotton cultivation in Queensland at the present time, and we are only beginning there.  for labour.",72

In America, this has not proved to be a letter labour question to the extent people supwhole paper. pose; in some of the States, particularly to? in the south, cotton is a product that pays higher wages than many of the other in dustries in Texas and Florida.  America where labour is paid half the rate of wages that is being paid in the that Northern Territory. would Mr FINLAYSON - Cotton , like sugar, is not necessarily a. product of cheap labour. I have heard it said that sugar could not pay present-day wages; but the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) will admit that, while 3s. 9d. a day was at one time considered quite suitable for sugar work, employees are now paid 13s., and the industry - is still flourishing. I have been led on to an argument that I did not expect, and I am not anxious to pursue the critiof cism too far. I know that it is not the intention of the Government to sit long, and this Bill must go through, and, personally, I would not stop the Government from winning the war through want of There are, however, events in .other directions to which I desire to call attenOne has reference to the censorship - the expense of it , the pity of it , and the disgrace of it . It is a censorship that getting, worse in its applioation, in spite of every promise of more, reasonable conby t i e Government. Ever since the Editors' Conference in Melbourne, when it was unanimously decided, and agreed to by the Government, that a relaxation would be made, and that there was no need for a political censorship, find political censorship running riot Recently, in Brisbane, the Standard newspaper was singled out by the censor for attack; and of it may interest honourable members to know what was going on. Jeremiah Joseph Stable, a censor officer, is thus rereported during the Court proceedings:Are any other newspapers treated on the same basis as the Daily Standard with respect to submitting the matter to you or your Department ?-Yes . Other newspapers in Brisbane?-Yes . They have to submit the whole lot of their matter referring or relating to the war?-Yes . Is that, really done?-Yes . It is?-Yes . In every instance ?-Yes . They submit to you every article and every relating to the war?-They submit the' Mr Ore - It is the daily papers you refer Witness - No . Ah ! Are there any other daily newspapers in Brisbane under this ban?-No . Was not there an understanding arrived at between Colonel MCColl and the Standard the Standard could publish any matter, provided it did not overstep the War Precautions Act?-Yes . There was a time when they were not allowed that discretion ?-Yes . That latitude has been allowed to other papers, but it is not allowed to the Daily Standard now?-Yes . All the other Brisbane daily papers at the present time are allowed that concession?Yes. Then the Daily Standard is working under difficulties greater than other newspapers ?Yes. This has not always heen the ease ?-No . Mr Ure handed witness a copy of the Worker, remarking that it contained a copy of an article published in the Worker of 15th August, which had been suppressed in the case of the Standard. Mr Ure - You got his from the Daily Standard, did you not?-Yes , or matter similar to it . You allowed it to be published in the Worker?-Yes , by mistake. Mr TJru - An unfortunate mistake for the public; therefore there was inconsistency there ? In regard to the Red Flag incident, the evidence isYou allowed the Telegraph to publish correct version, and refused the Standard permission to publish anything in connection with it ? - I did. When the Brisbane Standard, three days later, ignoring the censorship and) restrictions, gave the true version of the facts, it was proved that the previous statements were absolutely false and misleading ?  an increase all right!",72
449,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,You may depend upon it that attention will be called to his valuable services to the Government. If there is one thing that will make this Government a laughing-stock to any intelligent body of men it is their attitude towards the red flag.,73
450,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,It is the Bolshevist flag.,73
451,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"It may be; I do not know; I do not care whose flag it is. Indeed, it has been said that it is President Wilson's flag. I have a distinct recollection that, when it was reported that the red flag had been hoisted on the Palace of Petrograd, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) made most effusive complimentary statements about it.",73
452,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,He did not know much about it.,73

457,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"It is not I , but you, Avho are talking about the Bolshevists. Honourable members opposite indulge in their feelings of class or political hatred to such an extent as to think its in- that they are going to do us damage by prohibiting the red flag flying over the Trades Hall. What a silly, miserable thing to do!",73
458,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"It is a silly, miserable flag-a rotten flag!",73
459,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Eve n if it were the worse that honourable members think, do they imagine that what it stands for is altered in the slightest degree by the regulation? I am not concerned whether or not the"" red flag is flying over the Trades Hall; what I am concerned about is the sentiment for which it stands.",73
460,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,It is a danger to all honest people.,73
461,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Would you like me to give a little extract from the redflag song, or perhaps honourable members would like me to sing it. It is absurd to suppose that anything that honourable members opposite may do in regard to the flying of the flag will have any effect on what the flag stands for. Honourable members must know enough of history to appreciate the fact that immediately any attempt is made to crush a sentiment in the minds of a number of people, the efforts to stamp out the fire have only increased it. You will not crush the sentiment of brotherhood hecause you destroy the emblem of brotherhood.",73
462,Mr ARCHIBALD,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,It stands for cut,73
463,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I feel tempted to impose the whole song upon honourable members; at any rate, I will read the first and last verses, which are as f o l low:The people's flag is deepest red, It shrouded oft our martyred dead; And ere their limbs grew stiff or cold, Their heart's blood dyed its ev-'ry fold. Then raise the scarlet standard high, Within its shade we'll live and die. Though cowards flinch and traitors We'l l keep the Red Flag flying here. W i th heads uncovered swear we all To bear it onward t ill we f all ; Come dungeon dark, or gallows grim, This song shall be our parting hymn. Honourable members have . provoked me into giving these extracts, and I am sure they have often listened to worse things than would be my singing "" The Red Flag."" I do not know to whom the the song is dedicated. What I am concerned about is the utter hypocrisy of the Government in ' the action that it has taken. Fancy Ministers solemnly passing a regulation to prohibit flying of the red flag! attention to the fact, for the t h i r d time, that the flag, of which we are all so proud - the Union Jack-is being trailed in the mud and degraded by men who use it as a means for advertising their goods.",74

465,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,That is a matter of opinion.,74
466,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,It is not matter of opinion at all.,74
467,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"When Fisher, was my leader I asked whether any definite action had been taken by Government to prohibit the use of the of a regulation. Union Jack and of the Australian national emblem in advertising goods. I put a similar question to Mr . Hughes when he was my leader, and only fco do. a fortnight ago I pressed the same in quiry on the attention of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) . The I received from the last-named gentleman was- The matter was fully considered by Prime Minister, but it was found impracticable to frame any legislation or regulation to vent the use by traders of advertisements suggesting loyalty and zeal for the Allied cause. Impossible to frame a regulation to prevent the use of the flag of the Empire as a cover, say, for a whisky bottle or a jam t in ! Yet a regulation was easily framed to destroy the sentimental emblem of other people.",74
468,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,Quite right.,74
469,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"That circumstance shows clearly that the regulations CHORUS. issued under the War Precautions Act are not framed with a desire to promote sneer, peace or harmony in the country, but with the distinct object of engendering all the political hate and venom that is possible. That is the only reason underlying the regulation that has been issued in regard to the use of the red flag. I confess that I feel ashamed when I see our street hoardings covered with advertisements relating to drinks and all manner of goods-advertisement s in which Union Jack and the Australian coatof-arms are used as decorations. That is a disgraceful use of the flag. I object to it all the more strongly because the Government have been so busy in straining the at a gnat while swallowing a camel. Need I call",74
470,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,Did the honourable member call attention to this matter when his own Government were in power ?,74
471,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I have already said that I did. In reply, I was informed by Mr Fisher that "" the matter would receive consideration."" That was in 1917, Mr . Hughes said that "" the matter would be investigated "" ; and in September of the .present year the Acting Prime Minister a (Mr Watt ) told me that the Government could not frame a regulation to deal Mr with it .",74
472,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,The honourable member his should lend him a hand in the framing,74
473,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,I think that I certain could do that pretty quickly.,74

Some reply persons who have a wonderful regard for the Union Jack under certain circumstances, do not know what it stands for, under other circumstances Quite a the number of people do not even know how to fly the Union Jack. Only the other preday I saw the Australian flag flying upside down on one of the principal buildings in Melbourne. Many persons,- I repeat, do not know the value of the Union Jack, or its combination, or what is its history'. But they have a patriotic fetish in regard' to that flag. What annoys me is that such a flag with such a history should be used for mere moneymaking purposes by traders and that the Government should take it upon themselves to destroy another flag, which is known all the world over as the emblem of brotherhood amongst men.",74
476,Mr JOWETT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,The red flag stands for murder.,75
477,Mr FINLAYSON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"I decline to reply to such a statement. I am not a murderer, and I support the red flag.",75

479,The CHAIRMAN,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS, Order ! The honourable member's : time has expired.,75
480,Mr GROOM,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Darling Downs-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.57] The honourable member for Herbert asked what expenditure is going on in the Federal Capital area. My reply is that there is no expenditure going on there in connection with the Federal City. But a sum of £5,000 appears upon the Works Estimates for purely preservative purposes. In other words, that expenditure is intended to safeguard the money which has already been expended there. year only about £4,234 was spent in this connection. The question has also been raised as to what staff is employed at the Capital Site. During the past twelve months the Department has bad works officers there for the reason that a large expenditure was being incurred in connection with the Camp at Canberra. B ut at the present moment there are only six officers of the Department of Works and Railways located at the Capital Site. They are employed in dealing with the matter of payments, and also with the revenue that is being received from the Territory. The Minister for Home and Territories, too, has a limited number of officers there, who are engaged in dealing solely with land and forestry matters. In regard to other matters to which reference has been made, the building of the tramway there, was authorized several years ago. It is now almost completed, so that there will be practically no further expenditure in that connection. As to Mr Griffin, I desire to say that he holds his appointment under contract with the Government. At the present time he and his staff are engaged merely in designing, surveying, and preparing plans for the outlay of the city. His desire is to bring these plans into this position: that within three months the work could be proceeded with should Parliament so desire. It was arranged by Mr O'Malley, when he was in office, that the construction of certain buildings and works carried out in the T e r r it o r y should be under the supervision of Mr Griffin.",75

Non-commissioned officers' quarters and other buildingsand repairs have been carried out there, and tenders have recently been accepted for the administrative building, the designing and carrying out of which will be done by this staff, which has been reduced to the absolute minimum required for the work.",75

489,Mr FENTON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Why is a special set of officers employed in drawing plans for buildings in the Duntroon area, when the ordinary departmental officers could, do the work?",76
490,Mr GROOM,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"The arrangement was made by Mr O'Malley, and my opinion is that it should not be continued longer than may be necessary; but works commenced under it have to he completed. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) spoke of the dismissal of a man because he was eligible, a case which he characterized as one of hardship. I caused inquiries to be made, and ascertained that the man was only a casual employee. This House laid down the rule that preference of employment must be given to returned soldiers, and a Ministerial instruction was issued to that effect. When temporary positions become vacant, they are filled, where sible, by returned soldiers.",76
491,Mr LECKIE,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,Was this man replaced by a returned soldier?,76
492,Mr GROOM,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Yes . He was a casual employee, and the instruction is carried out in such a way that no hardship shall be inflicted. Eligibles in casual employment must give way to returned soldiers. It is true that the man had two brothers at the Front, and that 'his mother was a widow, but at the time no complaint or representation was made by him to the Department to that effect. Two or three other men who were similarly situated made representations, and their cases were dealt with on their merits.",76
493,Mr FENTON,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"Why not treat this man justly, even though he may have been tardy in making his position known ?",76
494,Mr GROOM,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"He was treated justly. He made no representation of the kind. The honourable member for South Sydney hardly appreciates the position, so far as Mr Swan is concerned. It was desired to consolidate the naval works in one branch of the Works Department, one of the advantages being that we could thus get experts for each particular line. Mr Swan is under the Naval Director, and at the present time is engaged in carrying out important building work at Cockatoo Island, works at Garden Island, at Jervis Bay, in connection witfe the College, naval drill-halls, and other works under the control of the Naval Branch of the Works Department. Only a fortnight ago I asked the Director of Naval Works, in view of the decrease of public works, consequent upoa the revision of the Estimates undertaken by the Cabinet, to see that the staff was not larger than was commensurate with the work to be undertaken.",76

500,Mr WATT,USE OF NATIONAL FLAGS AND EMBLEMS,"If the honourable gentleman appreciated the position, he would not make that remark. It is usual to lift out of the Estimates that section which, deals with Public Works, so that construction may not be delayed for want of parliamentary approval. This was done practically without comment last yearI think on my motion. The practice has evoked no hostility from honourable members. It does not in any way deprive honourable members of the oportunity of dealing with important works matters.
