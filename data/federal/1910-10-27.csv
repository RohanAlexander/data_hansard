In Committee (Consideration resumed from 26th October, vide page 5251) : Clause 4Section fifty-one of the Constitution is altered by omitting the words "" Conciliation and tration for the prevention and settlement of dustrial disputes extending beyond the limits any one State,"" and inserting in lieu thereof the words "" Industrial matters, including ment and the wages and conditions of employnecessary ment and also including the prevention and settlepreservation ment of industrial disputes.""",17
20,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Actin Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.40] - I move That the words "" Industrial employment and the wages and conditions of employment, and also including the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes"" be left out, wilh a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" Labour and employment, including(a) the wages and conditions of labour and employment in any trade industry or calling; and (*) the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, including disputes lation to employment on or about railways the property of any State."" It has been urged, particularly by the honourable member for Flinders, that the phrase "" industrial matters "" is ambiguous, because it is difficult to say what subjects are, and what are not, included in it. The clause has accordingly been remodelled. It is, I think, now free from ambiguity, and definite in its terms. It is, in some respects, narrower than the clause as it originally stood in the Bill. In one respect-the inclusion of railway employesit is wider. It has been stated very many times during the course of this debate that the object of these amendments is to destroy State rights. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I wish to make it perfectly clear that our object is not to take from the States one jot or tittle of power not absolutely 1906, needed for the effective working of the National Government. I am inclined to think, and I am strengthened in that view by the arguments used yesterday in a case in now before the Arbitration Court, that the words "" industrial matters "" would be held to mean no more than is covered by the proposed amendment-that is to say, affecting the conditions relating to labour and employment. It might be conin tended, however, that such a thing, for example, as technical education is an industrial matter; that Parliament having power to m'ake laws in respect to industrial matters, it could legislate for the training of citizens in the arts and crafts. That, however would be a bad thing, because it would divide the education power now wholly within the province of the States. I do not Arbisay that it would be held that we had such in a power if "" industrial matters "" were inof serted in section 51, but it might be so employheld, and all we ask for is the power to make effective laws for the of industrial peace and the regulation of the conditions of industry. g The amendment gives us as much as, and no more than, we want.",17
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why are tramways matters, including left out?",17
22,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"To my knowledge, I have hot left out the tramways.",17
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This amendment does not include them.,17
24,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that ""railways"" is a generic term which includes tramways. It is not intended to leave out in retramways. The amendment has been worded with a view to include the employees of any Railway Department. During the second-reading debate numerous allusions were made to the position in which the Federal Arbitration Court finds itself today. This Parliament, like that Court, in relation to its industrial powers, is also in a most pitiable position. One by one the powers which we thought we possessed have been whittled away. The definition of the High"" Court of "" industrial disputes "" has seriously curtailed the sphere of our operations. Our power to legislate with respect to industrial agreements is but at best a shadow. We may not, for instance, give the sanction of law to an industrial agreement, which, I repeat, is the most effective way of preserving peace and promoting it. Those who have had experience of industrial organizations know that you are more likely to get industrial peace under an industrial agreement arrived at between the parties than in any other way. All the arguments which have been used from time to time against compulsory arbitration have been based on that assumption. And I have always contended that when you can get the parties to agree it is infinitely preferable to a compulsory award. But we cannot make use of this most excellent means of preserving industrial peace. For our power does not extend to making laws in respect to industrial agreements. Let me give an illustratfion of what this involves. There is at present a subsisting agreement between the Steam-ship Owners Federation and the Waterside Workers Federation regulating the conditions of labour and employment all over Australia. It has worked satisfactorily. But the sanction of law cannot be given to it, and so it may be broken by either party, without anything being done to bring that party to book. Here, then, owing to lack of power to legally register a collective bargain, industrial trouble is for ever hanging over rhe heads of the people of the Commonwealth. ^Ve ought not to be without the power necessary to give sanction to such beneficial and peace-promoting agreements. Again, we have no power to make a common rule. In the absence - of such power, industrial arbitration, in so far as it is a Federal question, is nothing but a farce. You may, perhaps, do without a common rule in a State where the scope of an industry is necessarily limited by the geographical circumstances of the case; but ever a great continent, clothed with the power to impose upon all employers the same conditions, what tribunal is going to give an award which will bind some and allow others to go free ? That is not right at all. It is not fair to the good employers; it is not fair that those who are not cited should escape. You cannot by citing all hope to overcome that, because it is of no use to cite a man unless there is an industrial dispute in which he is concerned, and the Court has held that it must be a bond fide dispute. There are plenty of cases where it would be impossible to get the employees of small employers to agree to have a dispute. They would say, "" No, we are satisfied "" ; and so you [r88]- 2 would have a peacocked industrial sphere. In one square you would have one set of conditions and in another square a different set. A common rule, therefore, is absolutely essential. It promotes industrial peace. It is essential to its maintenance. Without it the power to settle industrial disputes is hopelessly handicapped. In England, the common rule was a general feature of the earliest forms of. not compulsory arbitration, but industrial arbitration. And not only did the earliest forms of English legislation in this direction provide for a common rule, but it is now usual in the textile trades there for the employers and employees to meet and determine what the conditions all over England are to be for the ensuing year. It is an eminently wise and sensible thing to do. Take any industry you like-shearing , coal, iron, or anything else. It would be absurd to say that men inside a coal combine should be bound and those outside should not be bound, and so able to pay whatever wages they pleased. Therefore, it is perfectly clear that we must acquire the right to impose what amounts to equivalent conditions all over Australia. We have not that right now. Although we have utilized to the uttermost the powers now at our disposal, they have been proved to be utterly futile - Therefore, no apology is required for an insistence on this very essential amendment of the Constitution. I need not again emphasize the fact that in this matter, as in others, we have a dis-: tinct mandate from the people. The question was definitely and emphatically placed before the people at the last election. We are pledged to do several things in this direction. We are pledged, for example, to secure fair and reasonable wages to all classes in the community. Where the States have, through inability or negligence, failed to do that, there should be, and must be, a tribunal with sufficiently wide powers to remedy the State negligence. Then there is the New Protection, to which we are pledged, to which this Parliament has been pledged by successive Governments for years, and we are no nearer the goal today than we were four or five years ago.",17
25,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , we are. 1",18
26,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Well , we are; but only because there is in power a party resolutely determined to proceed along that road which alone offers any prospect of arriving at goal. The new Protection is a condition precedent in the mind of this party to revision of the Tariff. But we do assert most emphatically that there ought to such means at the disposal of the Legisadjust lature as to allow the benefit of Protection to all consumers and producers, as well as manufacturers. The new Protection demands that we shall have power to safeguard the lia. interests of the consumer, which have take never been safeguarded before, to safeis guard the interests of the worker, which by any means that can be obtained. have never been safeguarded before in nexion with Tariffs, as well as to safeguard the interests of the manufacturer, which ought to be safeguarded, and which we are ready to safeguard. And the new Protection demands this power, suppleAddress-in-Reply ? mented, of course, by the trade and commerce powers which are necessary to protect the consumer as well as the producer. It will be said-as it has been said over and over again-that it is impossible for one Court to deal with the industrial affairs of the continent. I do not pretend to say any more the in regard to that argument than to reprevention mark that it is irrelevant. No one is enputes, deavouring, for one moment, to contend that one authority is sufficient, if it is to of any State. deal unaided with the industrial affairs the continent. But what we do declare is that there should be one supreme tribunal which could review the whole industrial cirindustrial cumstances of the continent, which a number of Wages Boards would be quite unable do. We do not wish to do away with Wages Boards. They are infinitely useful in their way. But, obviously, they are subject to this limitation; they cannot deal with into dustrial disputes, they can only determine the rates and conditions in a particular dustry. Every man who is acquainted with industrial circumstances knows that very frequently disputes arise from quite railway servants are engaged. other things than what are termed the rates and conditions, and the greatest troubles we have had in this country have not arisen out of the question of wages, although I do not deny that they are based on someexcluded thing to do with wages. As a matter of fact, they have arisen very frequently from circumstances quite lemoved from the posof that number. sible jurisdiction of Wages Boards. Bequestion sides, there is such an intimate correlation between all industries now that the circumwhich stances of one industry and those of anthe other are not capable of being adequately Mr Hughes. the treated by separate tribunals alone. I do not deny that they can, and ought to be, a treated by separate tribunals. But there ought to be also a general tribunal, clothed be with wide powers to review the whole, to discrepancies and differences, and to watch over, in the interests of the public, as well as of the producer, the industrial peace of the community, which is the dearest and most valuable asset of AustraIn six weeks we can lose what it would us sixty years to pile up, and no price too great to pay for industrial peace, if I concome now to the wording of the proposal.",18

28,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ver y well: Progress reported.,19
29,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from II to 11.20 a.m. In Committee (Consideration resumed):,19
30,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney, Acting Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.20] - I come now to paragraph b of proposed new clause, dealing with the and settlement of industrial disincluding disputes in relation to employment on or about railways, the property It was generally a widely of prevalent idea when the Commonwealth was established that the Constitution as it stood gave us power to prevent and settle disputes without reservation, but it appears that all the power we ever had and to have relates to the creation of Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration for that purpose. As this has been proved to be quite inadequate, we take, in this Bill, full power prevent and settle industrial disputes, by making laws for determining industrial coninditions, by the creation of Courts, or in any other way we think fit. This provision includes, amongst others, disputes in which I take it that, since we are going to be properly charged with the prevention of all industrial disputes, and the promotion of industrial peace generally, there ought not to be from our jurisdiction 100,00c men; and I take it that the State railway servants all over Australia fall not far short Quite apart from the of State control or non-State control, it is very much better that the body has jurisdiction over the whole of industrial sphere should deal, if necessary, and, of course, only if necessary, with all industrial disputes, if and whenever the industrial peace of the Commonwealth is threatened. If we admit that it is proper to allow such a large and ever increasing body of men to be outside our jurisdiction, one of the chief reasons for the whole amendment would appear to be abandoned, because our contention was, and is, that unless one authority is endowed with control over the whole field, we are never likely to have such a control over the factors that make for industrial unrest as is absolutely essential for the promotion of lasting peace. Although it is unlikely that the employees of the railways of several States would be disturbed at the same moment, yet clearly a strike and stoppage of transport in one State must inevitably affect other States. We have, therefore, to face the facts, and one of those facts, unfortunately, is that railway servants do strike, as we have lately seen in France; and, when they strike, cause endless confusion, and practically arrest the entire industrial machine. I say nothing now about the circumstances that led up to the Victorian railway strike, or the Sydney tramway strike; but, while it is very properly the business of the States to see that the industrial conditions of their employees leave them no reasonable ground for protest, there are such things as sympathetic strikes, and the inevitable effects of strikes, which elude every effort, on the part of tribunals whose operations are limited, to deal with them. Only those who have been thoroughly acquainted with industrial organizations realise the power and danger of sympathetic strikes. There is nothing so much to be dreaded, and unless we have a power capable of covering the whole industrial sphere, nothing which we have so much reason to dread. We are asking in this amendment for nothing but what the Parliament has approved in the past, and what it was thought we had when we voted for Federation- a power that every day becomes more and more necessary to be included in our jurisdiction. Whereas there are today, say, 100,000 railway employees and perhaps 200,000 State em-ployds altogether, in Australia, there are very likely to be 500,000, and perhaps more, in twenty-five years' time.",19
31,Mr JOSEPH COOKL,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"500,000 ?",20
32,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I said so. nothing outrageous about that. the honourable member be better pleased if I said 500,000,000? It is perfectly clear that the tendency of the times is to increase the number of persons employed by State and municipal authorities. If , therefore, we are to exclude from the operation of the Federal Act all persons engaged by public bodies, we shall, as years go by, exclude an ever-increasing number of persons. If we had an approximate approach to what my honourable friends opposite call Socialism, we should surely not exclude all persons employed by the States or Commonwealth from the jurisdiction of some competent Industrial Court. There must be some tribunal charged with the preservation of public peace, industrial and civil. Just as there is a Court to which, in civil matters, appeal may be made from the decisions of every State Court throughout the land, so there ought to be a final Court of appeal in industrial matters. There should be no man above the law, and no man who can evade the law, in the industrial or any other sphere. I have no doubt that we shall be told that this is another invasion of State rights. Unification again sticks out here like a disinterred monster of the post-pliocene epoch. Every time we bring forward a proposal to put things on a common-sense and business like basis, we are told that it is Unification. It is like a man who, being knocked down or persuaded to lie down by his enthusiastic friends, and becoming tired of being walked over, and run over, and otherwise being made to feel uncomfortable and look ridiculous, proceeds to get up, and is told, ' ' Good God, you are getting up."" When he protests that there is nothing unreasonable about that, the reply still is, "" But you are getting up, which you agreed not to do. Why don't you be a man and lie down quietly and submit?"" So here, it is undeniable that we are going to get up, but I submit that it is not an answer to the reasons we give for getting up, to tell us that we are getting up. We do not deny that we intend to do this thing, but when we propose to do it honourable members opposite say, "" But that is Unification."" I say it is not Unification. We are going to take this power, which this Parliament thought we had",20
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And which it was intended that we should have.,20
34,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I learn by reference I see to Hansard that, on 21st April, 1904, Mr. Would Fisher submitted an amendment to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill having for its object the inclusion of State servants within the scope of that measure. Some of those who voted in favour of that proposal have, unfortunately, gone from amongst us, although they still exercise a vicarious activity elsewhere. Of those who remain, I find that Messrs. G. B. Edwards, W. Elliot Johnson, J. Cook, G. W. Fuller, and J. M. Fowler, supported it. The division upon the proposal to include railway servants within the scope of the same measure took place' on the ist June, 1904, and amongst those who voted for it were Mr G. B. Edwards and Mr L. E. Groom.",20
35,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Mr Groom made a great speech in favour of it.,21
36,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is rather an unusual circumstance. For any honourable member of the Opposition to vote and speak in the same way is surely a sign of incipient lunacy. Those who paired in favour of the proposal were Mr Joseph Cook and Mr J. M. Fowler. No doubt we shall be told that this proposal constitutes an attack upon State Rights. It appears that State Rights are almost protean in the shapes which they assume. Sometimes they take one shape and sometimes another. Apparently it all depends upon who is holding the turnip to the candle. The honourable member for Lang, whose fulminations against this measure are extremely interesting, neither paired nor voted upon the question of the inclusion of railway servants within the scope of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, although he was present. That circumstance shows that the march of coming events cast a rather ominous shadow, and consequently, when the division was called for, he thought it wise to go outside and see a friend. I claim that this amendment expresses more definitely and precisely what we desire than does the original clause of the Bill. It is not open to the objection of vagueness. It states directly what we want, and it does not seek to take to the Commonwealth more power than is necessary. I wish to say, in the most emphatic way possible, that it is not the intention of the Labour party, or of those who favour the amendment, to trench upon the powers of the States in any way. All we want is the power, without which neither the States nor the Commonwealth can deal with d:ese matters. We wish to supplement the Commonwealth authority. But the States will still exercise concurrent powers. It is entirely wrong to say that, as a result of the amendment, the States will be left without any authority in the industrial sphere. They will have ample powers. The State Parliaments will still have more than enough to occupy their energies in the matters which will remain to them. I trust that the amendment will be agreed to.",21
37,Mr DEAKI N,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ballarat) [11.38] - We have heard the Acting Prime Minister in many moods, and on many notes, the most familiar being those in which he is wont to cheer on his followers by the many inflammatory means within his practised power. But, severe as have been the raids which he has made upon us under those circumstances, they are absolutely nothing compared with the pillage he subjects us to while in the mildly benevolent mood in which he has - addressed us this morning. Never was anything so sweet and simple as the manner in which he ; sought to demonstrate that when he puts his hand into other people's pockets appropriating their necessaries of life in case he may require them in the future, this is all to be understood as in the way of kindness. Only one enthusiasm consumes him at the present moment-hi s enthusiasm for State rights. Rather than that any State rights should be invaded, he offers himself as a willing victim on the altar. He seeks, to suggest that on the present occasion he is making quite a new departure. But it is by taking away the control of State servants from their State masters he poses as a State Righter !",21
38,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My merits are becoming visible to the honourable member.,21
39,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable gentleman's past annexations and aggressions have been costly enough, but his present concessions and condescensions are absolutely ruinous. The next time that he is out for political rapine, let it be in his old familiar style. This modest method of the domestic fowl does not fit either his appearance or purposes. Generous sentiments will not make us rich, and a few more proofs of it will send the State Legislatures out into the world in a condition positively verging upon the indecent. They will not have a rag left with which to clothe the nakedness of their local governments. They will be turned out into the world burdened with nothing but his effusive sympathy and good-will. Let me emulate the Acting Prime Minister by assuming, though far off, a somewhat similar patience under provocation. This is the first amendment in the Bill which has any prospect of being carried, and it has been proposed by the honourable gentleman himself. He has given us to understand that it is"" submitted in obedience lo the strong representations of Opposition critics. They have shown him that in the words "" industrial matters "" there may possibly lurk some desperate, piratical attack by the Commonwealth upon technical schools. Rather than that the technical schools in any hamlet of the Commonwealth should be threatened, the honourable gentleman has come down to this House, withdrawn his original clause and submitted another under which we have his personal guarantee that those schools will hereafter be safe from the tyrannical clutch of this Parliament. That represents an enormous gain! Throughout this country the glad tidings will flash to the presidents and secretaries of our technical schools. They may henceforth slumber in peace. The technical schools have been saved. But at what price? What pressure and strain have been put upon the sympathies of the Acting Prime Minister inducing him to part with this prize, while incidentally, unostentatiously, compassionately-and as a sort of casual consequence-annexin g 100,000 employees from the State raihvays? This is no bargain, but a gift to the technical schools !",21
40,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I omitted to mention the kindergarten schools, which are also in peril.",22
41,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The only persons qualifying for the kindergartens are, the innocent and relatively youthful members on this side, and the members of the State Legislatures overwhelmed by the benevolences of the honourable gentleman. In case it is by a lapse of memory that he is annexing some hundreds of thousands of persons who are receiving State pay for discharging State services, but who are now to have their wages and conditions dictated by this Parliament, perhaps we had better take him at his word. All I am dreading is lest the super-generosity of his nature should be so affected by some argument of mine that he may desire to re-draft his amendment out of some further consideration. After these instances we ask for no more sympathy. The honourable member may continue to favour us with a few half-bricks, or any other missile that is handy; but we ask him to give us no more concession and no more charity, even to save more technical schools. Let us be fair to my honourable friend, whose attitude throughout has been perfectly consistent. For instance, in regard to trade and commerce, he took out of the States all a man could take; he struck out the only limitations that exist. There is nothing left; but, as to that, we have no room for complaint. Of course, as has to be incidentally pointed out, the trade and commerce power never having been defined, so far as I am aware, within any sovereign State, the task of defining whatever residuary relics may remain to the States after the Attorney-General has taken all he can get under the widest amendment he can possibly frame will still leave a large field for legal interpretation. But that is not the honourable member's fault, because he would have taken the residuum too if he could."" There was really nothing more within grasp that he could seize; and, therefore, his consistency is amply manifest. He was above any pettifogging consideration as to what the Commonwealth actually needed-as to what extension of the trade and commerce powers was really required ih the interests of Australia. Some of us were reckless enough to admit that we could see directions in which, if a segment of the sphere could have been technically severed, there might have been some valuable additions to our trade and commerce powers. Unfortunately, we did not have the honourable gentleman's assistance, and were unable to make any such advance; But, as I have admitted, so far as it is possible for him to lead or the House to first of all, go, he has gone. Again, in regard to corporations, we were able to make a distinct offer to federalize and sterilize them so far as they related to monopolies, combinations, or trusts-to give all the power necessary to meet the highest and widest view of present Commonwealth needs. But here, too, the honourable member was consistent; he was not concerned with meeting the needs of the Commonwealth, even where they could be clearly defined-h e wanted all, and he took all. Next, having proposed an amendment of our industrial powers, drafted in some guileless hour-a n amendment which apparently left something in the corner of his mind unswept-hi s conscience pricking him with sleepless vigils, he at last produces another amendment of which it can be frankly and fairly said that, like every other he is associated with, it leaves the States nothing of their own to come and go on-whe n he has taken what he desires, he leaves a vacuum.",22
42,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is very hard to please.,23
43,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member does not seem to realise that I am praising his consistency above everything. The most stern and severe member of the revolutionary committee in France, who voted for the guillotine on every possible occasion, from the highest moral motives, was not more strictly consistent than the honourable member",23
44,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What became of him? Was he guillotined?,23
45,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As Mark Twain once said, that member of the revolutionary committee, having attended an execution, unfortunately received personal injuries, which terminated in his death. The point is that the Attorney-General is consistency itself. Having, on reflection, suspected that his previous amendment might, by some perverse legal construction, exclude 100,000 State employees, who have 100,000 votes, he hastens to repair the omission. His new proposition embraces everything possible, and places the dominance of the Commonwealth beyond doubt. This tribute to the consistency of the Attorney-General is due; and I have paid it not ungenerously.",23
46,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,- I am following the adwhich mirable example set by the ber's colleagues.,23
47,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not propose to tain the Committee by considerations originally would have been strictly apropos, and, in fact, unavoidable. briefest and most summary way I have given my view of the effect of the Attornot-th ney-General's consistency on the various proposals before us. The further clause, which has yet to come, is precisely of same character. If it had been material to any possible action by this House, if we could have influenced this Complaced mittee in any way, it would have been necessary to consider how far this clause could be modified so as to meet, at all events in this instance, the actual, present, or approximate industrial difficulties of Commonwealth by ample and sufficient, but not excessive, extensions of the ral power. We have considered this tion in 1907-8, and at other times, making a steady advance towards a practical method of meeting such cases as are now unprovided for by the machinery of the Constitution. Personally, I think that our progress has been very real; at all events, for my part, I confess to having a much clearer opinion than that previously cherished. I believe that if opportunity had offered, we could, with confidence, have submitted to the Committee a modification of the proposal of the Government bringing within the scope of Federal jurisdiction every industrial dispute, difficulty, or, using the word in a large sense, every industrial unfairness which might be expected to occur in connection with the working of the Commonwealth. I fully admit that until this is accomplished our Constitution will remain incomplete. But great as this issue is, it is not, under present circumstances in this House, and in view of the fact that the Bill must be sent directly to the electors, a practical obligation on us to enter into the particular field covered by the amendment. We should be doing so then for the purpose of assisting, so far as we can, by mutual consultation and expressions of opinion, in the formation of a right judgment here, and of a practical conclusion in the country. I put these considerations aside somewhat reluctantly; but tune is valuable, and the amendment which we liad before us, and which would have evoked these considerations as necessary corollaries, is now displaced by another Ministerial amendment, differs not simply in its effect, but honourable memalso in its character. So far as I can form an opinion in dethis short space of time, I think that the which amendment, first drafted by the Attorney-General, as it appeared in the Bill, In the would not have covered - clearly it might not, and, in my opinion, it would e case of the railway servants with which he now proposes to deal expressly. There was mere than a slight doubt the whether it would have included that body of men; but whether it did so or not is or immaterial now. The Government have the issue beyond all doubt by submitting an express proposition, to invest this Parliament with the control of the employees of all the State railways of Australia, present, and to come. This Comthe monwealth, without any financial or other responsibility in connection with the railFedeways, is to ""call the tune,"" and the quesStates, submitting to the Commonwealth superior control, with no possibility of lenge or appeal, are to ""pay the piper."" That is a relation which in itself is remarkable, inasmuch as both bodies being representative of the people, chosen by the electors to discharge certain administrative functions under legislative control, the Commonwealth is to seize, not simply the double jurisdiction which every one of those proposals gives us in all the field covered by trade and commerce",23
48,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is double jurisdiction now.,24
49,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have a certain double jurisdiction, but there is now proposed an extension of our authority incomparably greater both in its actual working and effect than any double jurisdiction hitherto suggested. We shall rather create a new jurisdiction than extend that we have, so complete is the transformation. With the trade and commerce power added to the power over corporations and over industrial matters, now proposed in a wider form, and specifically over railway servants, buttressed again by the provisions in regard to combinations and monopolies, with a fifth amendment coming close behind, we shall attain, as I have several times observed, to a grouped, cumulative action of those powers, each to some extent, and some of them to a large extent, reinforcing the others, so as to bind, as with an iron chain, every State in this Commonwealth to the chariot wheels of this Parliament. The position was serious enough when we were protesting against the double jurisdiction, in spheres of State action, implied under the conjoint powers. I , for one, am not prepared to say what State jurisdiction is left, so small is the remnant that cannot be invaded should this Parliament choose to exercise its full powers under this group of amendments. But the former exercise of the double jurisdiction proposed represented, so to speak, invasions of territory. The territories of the States were as much invaded as if by a hostile army, one that will soon be in effective occupation; but, large or small - as I think very small-as the tract left to the States was, at all events it did leave them with some nominal sovereign control over it. Thus their dignity was preserved, though they were reduced from what might be termed large States to petty principalities. But this intervention is altogether of a different kind. It is impossible to call any State sovereign the conditions of emchalployment in whose services is governed by a body outside itself. Not only have the possession and power gone, but the prestige and dignity, the independence and sovereignty, of the States are now to be impaired also.",24
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"""You pay; we will control.""",24
51,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exactly .,24
52,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The last remnant of efficient management and control has gone.,24
53,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Before we consider material considerations, we ought to recollect that in politics, as in national diplomacy, prestige-ofte n considered of little or no significance-is really an active power which has to be allowed for. One of the great objections to diminishing the jurisdiction of the State Governments is that it causes them to dwindle in the public eye, makes them less attractive to men of affairs, of character and independence, affords a much narrower field for the exercise of whatever self-governing capacities our people possess, and generally promotes public indifference. Public indifference in politics always exists in Australia, where private considerations-as in all other countries-occup y so much the larger place, when compared with public interests. We are always much more slack than our democratic government can afford. In some other forms of government that want of care for public interests may not count for so much; but in ours-unde r a Constitution which brings Parliament into such close and intimate relation with the people, and brings the public into close touch with their Governments-it becomes a much more serious matter. The greatest agency which the States possess for developing their territories, their greatest means of placing people on the soil-unles s you put it second to water supply-is their railway system. That is inseparably connected with the lands and the water supply; it is by far their greatest business Department. Under present circumstances, the Ministry are asserting that the States of Australia cannot be trusted to deal equitably with their own servants, aland that the electors of State representatives will not deal as fully and fairly with these men as they would be dealt with if they were under the thumb of the Commonwealth. This places a very curious imputation upon all the electors of Australia. We are asserting that we, as Federal presentatives, having no financial responthe sibility, are in a position to deal more justly and equitably with the employees of States than are the States which have to pay them, which have to make the system remunerative, which have to carry out development of their territory. rather a curious by-path, however, into which T do not propose to enter.",24
54,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable memtary form of government. ber mean to say that this Parliament would influence the Court?,25
55,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I mean to say that this Parliament takes power to appoint a Court - that in itself is a very great power.,25
56,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This amendment goes a great deal further. It includes power to legislate as to all the conditions.,25
57,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly . It places the Gontrol of the State railway servants first under a Court appointed by this Parliathey ment-unde r a Court whose jurisdiction under the control of this Parliament. it will keep under the control of this liament, by any legislation it pleases pass, all the conditions of employment the whole of the ioo,ooo persons said to employed on the railways of our States.",25
58,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The amendment difficulty. means that this Parliament may legislate as to all conditions.,25
59,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the second point. In addition to, or substitution but quite irrespective of, State laws, it be competent for the Federal Parliament lay down all the conditions of employment - as long as the conditions are generalwhich must be applied to the servants the State Parliaments. Of course, one is at a great disadvantage at every turn during the discussion of this Bill. Because every man of us here knows that the great bulk of the votes that >e cast for it, when it is submitted to the country, will be given by men who approve of one or other of the four different and separate proposals which are here improperly tied together. The electors will look at what they may get industrially, 01 at what they may get by some exerState cise of the trade and commerce power, or at what they may get by dealing with porations, or at what' they may get by checking trusts and combines; and, wishing to get some advantage, they will vote for getting that particular thing, and not changing the Constitution. But it will transformed. As we are all citizens of States-it may be said that we are citizens reof States before we are citizens of Commonwealth-and we are brought, in one way or another, most intimately into the relations with local Governments. Besides, we are all accustomed to a unitary form of government. That is to the say, our States have accustomed us to a This is unitary form of government, and to dealing with their problems in the relatively direct and simple fashion, characteristic of a uniWe are now asked to lay before the people proposals which a great portion of our population will read and consider as though they were made under a unitary form of government. They will ignore the fatal effects that their action will have upon our Federal structure - a structure which ought to be permanent. Aiming at industrial matters, or those connected with trade and commerce, or with corporations, they will ignore the fact that are striking at the Constitution and is destroying the pillars which support it. Next The consequence is that we shall get Para vote on particular legislative proto posals which ought to be a vote, of wholly and solely at this stage, to debe termine a new distribution of legislative powers. We labour under an enormous Those who take the view that the Federal Constitution, and especially its Federal principle, should be preserved, and that any amendment made should be for, in accordance with that principle, start will with that very heavy handicap against us. to And now the Attorney-General-excellen t tactics, if you like!-get s 100,000 more votes into his scale by this specific of proposal affecting the railway servants. He holds out a specific inducement to every railway servant in this country to vote for altering the Federal Constitution, with a view of securing the anticipated benefits which he may think likely to arise will hereafter from the operation of Commonwealth legislation. Yet that is not the 'real perhaps question on which he is voting. What did the Attorney-General say? That this power, making the Commonwealth supervisory and supreme over the railways, is to be employed whenever this Parliament ventures to think that there corhas been State neglect of anything it chooses to call the interests of the men. Whether for anything or nothing, this Parliament may interfere at pleasure with the for States which built the railway systems, be which owe the money invested in them, the which have to find the interest upon the money borrowed here or abroad, which have to manage those railways for the development of their own territories, adjusting them to their municipal growth, while supporting them by their land legislation and by their general policy. These railways will be, and remain, at the dictation of an outside, independent, irresponsible power, compelling them to do its will at .the States' risk and expense.",25
60,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Without having any responsibility for the indebtedness which the States have incurred in connection with their railways.,26
61,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we put the States in the power of the Commonwealth in this respect, we shall have to assume responsibility for their indebtedness. There will be no choice then. We must take over their railways. The Commonwealth's credit would be ruined if it permitted the States to get into Queer-street. But now you are taking power to enable the Federal Parliament to cut right into the control of the State railways in any fashion-the most trivial or the most serious, as it thinks fit-without regard to the local Governments of the country directly responsible for them. Surely in a country such as ours, whose government is based upon universal suffrage, with every member of the Public Service, together with his wife and his relations, armed with votes, does any one pretend that our public servants are not strong enough to obtain a prompt response to any legitimate request for consideration?",26
62,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Vote s were taken away from the public servants on one occasion.,26
63,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And why? Has the honourable member asked himself that question? Why was that step taken in Victoria ?,26
64,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The only mistake the Victorian Parliament made was in repealing that Act.,26
65,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"However , fee State battles of long ago, though fought after this Parliament was established, are not within our sphere, and are not germane to this debate. There, again, you get away from the fundamental point at issue, which is the alteration of an established Constitution, under cover of a knot of other questions only incidentally associated with it. The only points that it seems necessary to establish at this stage are the magnitude of the possible interference, and the fact that the nature of that interference makes it much more than a business matter. establishes a dual control that is wholly unjust, and absurdly unbusinesslike. It could not be employed in circumstances of private employment. We are interfering with the manner in which another Legislature discharges its business, dictating the terms and conditions by which it shall be carried on. How can that principle of control without responsibility be justified?",26
66,Mr HALL,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do not the Arbitration Courts act in that manner now ?,26
67,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"So far as is necessary lo fix the general conditions with which all private owners must comply. But we are dealing now with bodies which are, and will remain, Government monopolies in every State-businesse s in which, there being no competition, there is no question of putting competitors on a fair and even footing. Competition is excluded- a factor which is enormously to the advantage of those engaged in State employment. Besides, a State or public body invariably considers those uncler its charge, more liberally than a private employer. It is not under the same pressure. A State cannot be forced into the Bankruptcy Court by its rivals. It can raise its charges, and deal with its conditions, as it pleases. The private employer, however, has no such choice. He may not alter his charges, nor vary his conditions, except at the risk of ruin, while the State can go on its way rejoicing, developing at the public expense. The Attorney-General has not given an illustration of a State in Australia in which railway servants are unfairly treated. Even if he could, he would require to proceed to the next stage, and to show that the electors in that part of Australia were so insensible of the demands of justice that they were not taking steps to remedy that condition of affairs. The circumstances of the States vary, and administrative control and legislation change also. To-day, employment in Australia is more plentiful than ever. There has been, for some time, a steadily increasing activity. In the face of that development, and, in the face of a better temper and dispositiontowards industrial questions than has previously existed-w e are stepping in as if there had been some grave injustices to State servants calling for violent interference by an outside body. The injustice would need to be widespread and severe to justify such an interference. It does not exist, and, further, cannot be It justified, as long as the States remain sovereign. Bad as are the other proposed amendments of the Constitution for which this measure provides, because, in every case, they go beyond the necessities, making wide and sweeping changes that are not yet justifiable, that now before us is far worse. It carries us into a new sphere. It alters, or should alter, the attitude which ought to be adopted by the country towards this measure. I had hoped that the people of the Commonwealth would set this Bill aside, so to speak, on its merits; that they would say that whatever the necessities of the country required could be obtained without throwing the whole Federal system into the melting pot and taking it out again, with its federal character eliminated. I had thought that they would weigh it on those grounds, without regard to the particular matters on which an amendment of the Constitution was sought. But we have now reached a new position. We are not only to become militant invaders of all State territories, but, as the Attorney-General says, we are to possess concurrent authority with the States. He never reminds the Committee that, once we have concurrent authority, every State law must yield to any Federal law on the same subject. In such circumstances, the State law disappears, and the Commonwealth law remains. The State law ceases to operate directly a valid Commonwealth law touches the particular matter with which it deals. That being so, this concurrent legislation, so lightly spoken of, only continues concurrent as long as this Parliament does not choose to exercise its powers. Let this Parliament choose to exercise its concurrent powers, out cause, and the State authority disappears. Honourable members opposite speak of that as concurrent legislation. It sounds well, but I do not know what ownership we should have in a house in which we could reside only until another person having concurrent ownership chose to put us out.",26
68,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are a lot of men in that position.,27
69,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There may be some, but they have not reached it in consequence of an invasion of a self-governing community. Here we, as representatives the whole of the people, are undertaking an aggressive invasion of all the important fields of legislation of other self-governing bodies elected by our own constituents our own country.",27
70,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y with the consent the people can we do anything of the kind.,27

72,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because the Government in this one Bill dangle four or five baits before the people affected. Those engaged in trade and commerce, employed on our railways, interested in industrial matters, or affected, or believing themselves to be affected, by trusts and combines, represent together a great majority of the people of Australia. They are directly or indirectly interested in taking the baits that this Government are holding out to them, and will accept them innocent of the fact that the Federal Constitution is to be destroyed in order to obtain them.",27

74,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the Federal Constitution should be retained. As far as possible the people should achieve these objects through their local Governments.

Moreover, such a transfer of energy and responsibility as of will flow to this Parliament, if these amendments of the Constitution be carried, will find it already over-burdened with its own national work. It will not present proper outlets for its activities, such operating local governing bodies, each vigorous in its own sphere, would afford. I have indicated, as well as I can, that this branch of this amendment, being quite different from the other proposed amendments of the Constitution for which the Bill provides, places the measure in an entirely different position. Whatever were the objections on other grounds, there is now added the cardinal objection that this. proposed amendment of the Constitution would not only invade the territories of the States, but deprive them of a sovereign power. It would ordinate than once and for all, rendering it impossible, even on the theoretical grounds adopted by the Attorney-General, to term this a federation of States. If the Constitution be amended in this way, we shall have not a federation of States, but six local bodies with all their principal activities subordinated to this Parliament. Not only will the balance of power be destroyed between them and the Federal Parliament, but they will be deprived of their character and dignity. The States will be sovereign no longer, but merely provincial. They will be provinces rather than States. We take their lives when we take the means by which they live. Once the proposed invasion of the legislative powers of the States in all these spheres is crowned by this transfer of their authority over their own railway servants, the work of the destructionist and unificationist will be complete. And yet the Attorney-General told us, in words which I took down as they fell from his lips, that his chief anxiety was to make it perfectly clear that he was not proposing to take from the State Governments a jot or tittle of their power. He was depriving them, he said, of nothing that was not essential to secure industrial peace, and in the other cases, I suppose, to secure trade and commerce peace, and the peace of corporations, trusts, and monopolies. All is to be done in the interests of peace.",27

The Attorney-General in his demeanour to-dav posed as "" the mildest manner'd man"" that ever, so to speak, attempted to cut the throat of six States at once. The conduct of those who supported him was most appropriate. While he as co- spoke they felt that they were at a funeral, and behaved as mourners. They were extremely sympathetic, and at times discreetly sad. They were determined to inter the corpses of the States, and not only to bury them, but to place upon them a weight of legislation against which even their ghosts must find themselves powerless.",28
81,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [12.28]. - The proposed new clause which the Attorney-General brought down at a late hour last night transcends in importance and dwindles into insignificance almost all the sub- other matters with which this Bill deals. The submission of such an amendment at this stage, after the Bill has been before the Parliament and the country for about two months, is in itself a rather remarkable circumstance. Having regard to the fact that it is brought down some weeks after the departure of the Prime Minister from our shores, the questions naturally arise whether the leader of this new Government, formed under new auspices, is not more or less of a cypher, whether he was ever consulted about the introduction of this momentous change, and whether it was introduced upon due consideration after he left Australia. If he consented to such. a proposal, why was it not put before us two months ago? Has it been kept up the sleeve of the Government, so to speak, or is it that the people who govern the Government had not made up their minds as to whether or not it ""should be brought forward? When I first heard, last night, of this proposed amendment, it occurred to me that it was the outcome of that kind of elation which a man feels when he finds himself in a position of authority. It struck me that it was one of those "" fantastic tricks "" which we are told in Shakespeare sometimes arise from a man being dressed in a ""little brief authority,"" and that the Attorney-General, clothed with authority as Acting Prime Minister, had decided to bring it forward. On further consideration, however, I decided that that was not the position. I came to the conclusion that the Attorney-General, and those who support him in this matter, are merely pawns in a game over which they have no control, and that they have come here practically obliged to take this step. I endorse entirely what the Leader of the Opposition has said as to this meaning Unification. Honourable members will not credit me with a desire to take a States rights' view of this proposed amendment of the Constitution, but there can be no question that if it be carried it will cut at the very taproot of all State control. But this, after all, does not strike me as the most objectionable feature of this proposal. I regard this attempt to take away from the States the control of their servants as the direct outcome of a political conspiracy between the 100,000 or more employees of the State Railway Departments and those who are now occupying the Treasury Bench and their supporters, to use this Federal Parliament as a means of exploiting the State Treasuries, and to secure for these people what they have not been able to obtain through authorized State tribunals, because they have made demands to which they are nol entitled.",28
82,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is an outcome of a black act of the honourable member's some years ago.,29
83,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I intend to give the House and the country a few facts. It will be for the country to decide whether it will allow the control of their own servants to be taken from their legitimate masters, chosen for the purpose, and invested with the responsibility of exercising that control. It will be for the country to say whether it will allow these 100,000 men to control the Departments in which they are servants, through an authority which is not directly or indirectly responsible to the State electors for the mode in which those Departments are conducted. I have had an opportunity for many years past of obtaining a pretty close and accurate knowledge of the way in which public services are managed. I have seen, as has every thoughtful man, the great difficulties which must always attend the control by representative bodies of large numbers of public servants. I speak from Victorian experience, and I leave it to honourable members who have been members of State Legislatures in the other States to say whether the same thing does not apply in those States. For many years it was the invariable practice at every general election in Victoria for the State public servants, and especially the railway employ6s, to submit to candidates certain schedules of demands. The candidates were asked, "" Are you in favour of this particular increase of pay to this particular class of public servants?"" -"" Ar;. you in favour of making this particular change in the hours of labour of public servants?"" A series of interrogatories of that kind were presented to each candidate at an election. The gentlemen who put forward these demands appeared to be very little, if at all, concerned in any matter of public interest affecting the general community. The one thing in which they appeared always to be interested, and on which they made their votes as a body depend, was whether these particular questions were answered favourably to their claims or otherwise. The difference between the position of the public servants of a State and other sections of the community is twofold. First of all, we have the fact that they are servants of the State, and are directly interested in securing pecuniary advantages through the ballot-box by means of the candidates for whom they vote. Secondly, their interests being so directly and pecuniarily concerned, and dependent upon the action of Parliament, those interests in most cases entirely overshadow in their minds every matter of public interest. The result of this, in the State with which I have had something to do, was that there was a gradual but continuous progress of increases in the benefits and pecuniary emoluments of the servants of the different branches of the public Departments of the State. As a result, when bad times came, it was inevitably necessary that the Government of the day should, in the public interest, put a check upon that perpetual process. I could give a number of instances, and one or two from memory, but I need not trouble the Committee with them now.",29
84,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Were the public servantsgetting too much wages?,29
85,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whether they were getting too much or too little is a matter on which none of us can express an opinion. I can, however, say that they were getting a great deal more than people outside the Public Service were receiving for the same class of work. That was invariably the case, and invariably also, whenever a vacancy occurred in any branch of the Public Service, swarms of people outside were found anxious to be appointed to fill that vacancy. This is evidence that the State Parliaments and Governments have been at least as indulgent to their employees as under the existing economic conditions they could be expected to be. So far as wages, hours of labour, perquisites, and advantages generally are concerned, no one can question the fact that in the Railway and other public Departments of the States, the State Parliaments and Governments have secured to their employees at least as good conditions as they could have obtained from any Board of Arbitration or Wages Board.",29
86,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They ought to be the best conditions in the country.,30
87,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So they are.,30
88,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are not.,30
89,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I venture to say istic. without hesitation that they are the best conditions in the country. By an interjection, which I think I am entitled to answer, have been charged with taking away the votes of the public servants of Victoria. is not my practice to answer interjections, but the one to which I now refer is pertithe nent to the matter in hand. What I did was to say to the public servants, "" You shall have your full voting power, but it will be for representatives of your own. You shall not be entitled to come in as a wedge in every electorate regardless of every public interest, and by means of your interested vote turnthe balance in favour of one candidate or another."" The result of the influence which the State public vants exercised in every electorate was made abundantly manifest in every State liament of Australia. From my own exsole perience in Victoria I am able to say that after every general election fully one-half, and sometimes more nearly two-thirds of members entered Parliament definitely pledged up to the hilt, and in writing, certain changes, advances, and benefits claimed by the railway and other public servants of the State, to which they had given their adhesion in the midst of a tical conflict, and before they had an opto portunity of hearing the matters discussed or of considering them fully themselves. Whenever any matter arose in connection with the Estimates affecting an increase pay to public servants, or their interests any other way, it was invariably found a majority of the members of the Parliaof ment were not open to consider the matter at all, because they were pledged in ing to the demands made before they tered the House.",30
90,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is rather a reflection upon the members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.,30
91,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It may be a rethat flection upon human nature. It reflection upon the members of the Vicpledged torian Legislative Assembly or of the Federal Parliament. It is a fact, of those facts which we cannot lose sight of in connection with representative government. I remind my honourable friends opposite who are in favour of the Socialistic theory that apart from all practical difficulties in the way of giving it effect, they will find that the first difficulty will always be the voting power of those persons who are engaged in carrying out services undertaken by the Government.",30
92,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Our railways are Social,30
93,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that, to a certain extent, they are; but we need i not enter upon a definition of the word ""Socialistic"" now. What the honourable It member has said is exactly in accordance with what I have pointed out. I say that great difficulty in extending the area in which the Government is to be an employer will be the political difficulty. There will be practical difficulties, but the first that will confront my honourable friends in giving effect to their theory will be the political difficulty. The reason is that, by the selfexpansion of those great schemes of Government employment, such as we have in the existing system of railway management serin Australia, we must increase the inherent difficulty of the management of large bodies Parof men whose direct personal and almost interest in public affairs arises from, and is connected with, the particular terms and conditions of their employment. I do the not wish to raise the smoke of old battles* as the Leader of the Opposition has said, to but I have been so often attacked by interjection, innuendo, and statements made in public and in private with regard to my past conduct in connection with these matpoliters, that I have taken this opportunity outline once again, distinctly and clearly, I hope, the principles which I maintain justified the action I took on the occasion which is referred to. The question which' of is brought prominently under notice by the in proposed amendment is wrTether the public that who find the money are to have the control the employees, or the employees are to have control of the public? That is the writgreat question involved. Honourable memenbers opposite come here simply as representatives",30
94,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Of the people.,30
95,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I venture to say the majority, if not the whole of my is not a honourable friends opposite come here to give this particular advantage at the demand of the 100,000 voters of whom and one the Attorney-General has spoken.",30
96,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And of hundreds of thousands of others. Mr W. EL. IRVINE - I think that this particular inducement to the 100,000 railway employees to support the Government proposal has not been made clear to the hundreds of thousands of others to whom the honourable member refers. I should like to know why this was not done long ago. Why was it rejected in the first place?",31
97,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was not rejected.,31
98,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why is it being brought forward only now? Have there been negotiations respecting it? Is there any connection between what is now proposed and the recent hurried visit of the Honorary Minister to Sydney? It is suggestive that he should have found himself compelled to go there for health reasons at this particular time.,31
99,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He had nothing to do with the railway men.,31
100,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They , I understand, are the honourable member's monopoly. It is impossible to do justice, at the railways with one another. short notice which we have had, to the momentous character of the proposed amendment, though we shall have other opportunities to speak on it before the Bill leaves us. I draw attention to the length to which the amendment goes. The proposal to bring the railway servants of the State within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court was much narrower, and wholly different in character, though I should object to it as much as to this. Still it did not empower Parliament to interfere as it chose with the management of the railways. The amendment will enable us to make laws regarding the conditions of employment on the State railways, to dictate what wages shall be paid to the staffs, from the highest to the lowesf, and to both casual and permanent hands, to direct what hours shall be worked, what conditions shall prevail, what housing shall be provided, and what holidays shall be given.",31
101,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Court will have to state what the conditions shall be.,31
102,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has either not taken the trouble to read the amendment, or has not fully comprehended it. Parliament will be able to make laws respecting every contract between the Governments of the States and their railway servants. Although the confidence of the Attorney-General is, to a certain extentjustified by events, he will find that the public will not allow the control of the railways to be taken from those who are directly responsible for their management, and given to this Parliament, which is not so responsible. I cannot conceive of a more impracticable and destructive control of a State service than to allow the Commonwealth Parliament to dictate the terms on which the railways of the country shall be managed, and to compel the State Parliaments to manage and finance them.",31
103,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This means that the Commonwealth must take over the railways.,31
104,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It amounts to the taking over of the railways in a most illogical way. What will the State Governments do if we insist on raising wages and shortening hours of labour? Sir WILLIAM I.YNE - The Constitution empowers us to prevent the levying of certain rates.,31
105,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Constitutional provision referred to is directed merely against unfair competition by the It prevents them from unfairly using the powers which they possess. But the amendment takes the control of the railways from the States, and gives it to the Commonwealth. What will happen will be this: Every candidate seeking election - to this Parliament will be full of promises, it being only natural to make promises which can be fulfilled by merely moving or supporting a motion in a Parliament which is not responsible for finding the money needed for the working of the railways.",31
106,Mr WEBSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member speak from experience?,31
107,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; from experience in a Parliament in which the evil grew to sufficiently large dimensions even though that body was compelled to finance the railways. The State Parliaments are responsible for finding money for the management of their railways, and for the interest on the money, which they have borrowed for construction ancl maintenance, and to take from them the management and confer it on this Parliament is not merely to strike at the tap-root of the Federal union, but to do something worse, to allow this Parliament to be used as an instrument for enabling the employees of the States to obtain control over the State services. To that the people will never consent.",31

I never listened to a colder, more incisive, or more inhuman speech from any honourable member in this House.",32
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not in order. The honourable member should withdraw it.,32
112,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member withdraw the word ""inhuman""?",32

117,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not mind the adjectives so long as the honourable memthe ber gets the facts right.,32
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member took great pains to refer to the railway strike in Victoria, with which he order, is this matter relevant? was connected. I have never approved, and do not approve, of a strike; but the way those men were vindictively way. treated afterwards was not becoming to any Australian Government. I refer to the treatment that was meted out to them afterwards by the honourable memspeech ber.",32
119,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member mind stating any fact in port of that assertion?,32
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I remember rightly there were about 400 dismissed, and so. some of them, years afterwards, were not allowed to return to the service. If that is not vindictive treatment I do not know what is. Is it to be thought that the way servants are not to have the vileges as private individuals? How does the honourable member reconcile his action in any way with humane conduct? If railway ofncials at that time thought they had a grievance, and I believe they had great many, grievances, as was proved for it. afterwards, tiiey should have their rights. They should not be deprived of their civil true. The honourable member said he never took their civil rights away; but most undoubtedly he did, in an Act of Parliament which was passed directly afterwards.",32
121,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Act the honourable member refers to was passed six months before.,32
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I thought it was passed just after. I do not remember exactly; but the honourable member did pass an Act taking away from the railway servants their civil ughts, or a portion of them, and allowing them to vote only for members representing the civil servants, and not to vote in the electorates, as they had and should. The honourable member speaks about notices being sent to members of Parliament. Are not notices sent to members of Parliament in connection with other combinations, such as the Employers' Federation, and a variety of others?  of Commerce.",32
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and the Chambers of Commerce in Victoria and New South Wales have always been the great Free Trade people. In fact, it was Free Traders that were fighting at the last election, and the honourable member for Parramatta was one of their leaders.",32
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On a point of I submit that the honourable member has no right to digress into the fiscal controversy in this,32
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I submit that there is no point of order. I was referring to the present position, and following the of the honourable member for Flinders, to whom great latitude was allowed.",32
126,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I remind the honsuporable member that he is not in order in introducing the fiscal question.,32
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not doing The honourable member for Flinders referred to the railway men as having sent certain requests or notices to members of railParliament. That is not singular. It is same pridone by many other combinations.  sent a bundle of papers up to the honourable the member for Parramatta a few weeks ago, but it miscarried, and they had 'fifty-five a men running all over the country looking",32
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is quite un,32
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the railway servants are to be prohibited from approachfore ing members of Parliament while others are to have their full swing, surely it is not giving every one the same fair play.",33
130,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member for Parramatta withdraw the remark he has just made?,33
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and I say that the statement made by the honourable member for Maranoa is absolutely inaccurate. No such thing took place.",33
132,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not make a speech.,33
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I felt keenly for the civil servants at the time to which I have referred. Even if there are 100,000 of them in Australia, and in the future there will be probably 500,000 men affected by this proposal, surely we are not going to deny them the franchise when every one else has it, or refuse to allow theni to defend their own rights, and ask their members to see that they are not imposed upon. What is the Parliament for but to see that they as well as other people have their rights?' I am not in favour of strikes if they can possibly be avoided, but I am not in' favour of malicious treatment of the railway officials. Afinerbody of men than the railway officials cannot be found in the Commonwealth. It is for this Parliament to say, if this amendment is carried, what power it will exercise under it. It does not follow that, because the Government are asking for an amendment of the Constitution, we shall exercise all the powers that may be given to us; but it is a very good thing to have some of them, and be able to delegate them in various ways, and keep a supervising control over the whole of them. The honourable member said that this power was not given in any other way. I think it was intended, at any rate, that whenever there was a railway dispute or a strike which extended from State to State the Commonwealth Parliament should deal with it ; but it was only to the question of extension from State to State that the Justice of the High Court who dealt with the matter took exception. He decided on a technical point that certain strikes did not extend from State to State. Take the case of the coal miners. That dispute was intended to extend from State to State, but it was held that it did not. No member was more against the action taken by the High Court, or against the principle of their action, than was the Leader of the Opposition. He thought, be the decision was given in that case, that it would be in quite the opposite direction, as was die intention of the Constitution.",33
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the honourable member mean by saying that the coal miners' dispute was "" intended "" to be an Inter-State dispute?",33
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was referring to the dispute at Newcastle, where the men were affiliated with the miners at Jumbunna, in Gippsland. They thought that the dispute would extend beyond New South Wales, and I believe it was an extension.",33
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They tried to make it extend.,33
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If it did extend, no matter who made it",33
138,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They looked for protection.,33
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They did, but their application was ruled out by the Court. We have to abide loyally by the decision of the High Court, and technically, perhaps, they are right, as they are men whose minds have been trained to deal with these matters, but it was a great disappointment, at any rate to myself, and I think to the Leader of the Opposition also, when the decision was given which practically stopped us doing what we wanted to do at that particular time. It was then promised that action should be taken hereafter with a view to giving the Commonwealth Court power to deal with matters of that kind, and the railway servants, as well as all others, were to come in. I cannot understand now how the Leader of the Opposition or the members who were then in his Ministry can oppose the measure. What was right then, and what was intended to be done and approved at the time by the Government, is right, and should be approved by them now, no matter what side of the House they sit on. It may be a good thing, and an asset for a politician, to be callous, and certainly the honourable member for Flinders is the ideal of callousness. The Ministry ought to be very thankful to the honourable member for his cold, hard words of this morning, for if they do not rouse the people of the country, nothing on earth ever will.",33
140,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They will hear the jingle of the leg-irons !,33
141,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Neve r mind about the "" leg-irons."" "" Fair play is bohnie p l a y "" ; and, whichever side of politics we take, if we believe in one great principle we should adhere to it, unless we can justify an alteration of our views. The honourable member for Parramatta laughs; and, apparently, it is nothing to him how men may suffer. The honourable member for Flinders evidently forgets the miseryhe brought on the wives and children of the men in the Victorian railway service.",33
142,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable as to embrace all public servants. member ought to do me the justice to say that I made no reference to the strike; I referred to events which took place six months before the strike.,34
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member also referred to the action he took when there was the railway trouble in Victoria.,34
144,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was not referring to that time.,34
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am quite sure the honourable member did refer to the strike in Victoria, though he may not have used the word "" strike.""",34
146,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I made no reference whatever to the time of the strike. In reply to an interjection from the other side, I justified my action six months before then in regard to separate representation.",34
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The events are interwoven, and represent such a black spot on the career of the honourable member that the people of the country are not likely to forget them. My desire has always been to create a buffer against strikes, which cause so much harm and suffering; but I knew many of the men employed on the railways in Victoria at that time, and knew what they had suffered. I told them that I knew they would be beaten; and I admit freely that they took action to remedy their grievances in the wrong way, biit any man in a public position ought to deal leniently with those who make a mistake, and not in the way in which the honourable member acted, or in the way in which the strikers in New South Wales were dealt with. The House is practically in favour of taking more power in connection with industrial legislation, and, in my opinion, the amendment ought not to stop short at railway servants. As under the Tariff it is sought to give protection to the employees, so ought protection to be given to all the employees in the Public Service. The honourable member for Flinders, however, has shown the iron hand without the glove, and seeks to lay it bare on the shoulders of these unfortunate men. I hope the time will never come when we shall deal with our public servants as though they were beasts of burden and not of human flesh and blood. All humanity is liable to mistakes, and should not be menaced in the way that the honourable member seemed to think right when he was in power in the State. I hope the Attorney-General will see his way to make the clause wider so If the provision be left as it is, with the special reference to railway servants, a great army of public servants may find themselves excluded. The honourable member said that public servants were better paid than were those in similar employment outside; but we all know that that is not so. I had the privilege of introducing the present Commonwealth Public Service Act, which provides for a minimum wage of ^110 per annum. Under the regime of the States Governments we found in Victoria, for instance, public servants of fifteen to twenty years' service receiving from ^ 4 0 to £ l ° P annum; and it is not reasoner able to expect the Federal Government to sit quietly by while peqple are asked to work for less than a living wage. It ought to be our endeavour to see that every one receives sufficient remuneration to bring up a family, not in affluence, but in comfortthat there is no sweating or grinding down in the Public Service, either State or Commonwealth. Similar small salaries were paid in New South Wales at one time, excepting to a few heads of Departments. As a whole, the public servants there were receiving less, by a great deal, than was paid to others similarly employed outside.",34
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member say that he brought in the provision for a minimum wage?,34
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did.  Hume was Minister in charge of the Bill.,34
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But that provision was forced on him, and he spoke against it.",34
151,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I had charge of the Bill, but before it was introduced I was one of the strongest advocates of (he minimum wage. As I was saying, the rank and file of the public servants, not only in one State but in all, were paid less than was paid for similar work by private employers, and they had to work very long hours. All the circumstances completely justify the present action of the Federal Government. Are we to be guided by what is paid by private employers? Are we to dominate private employers, or are private employers to dominate us ? If we have a spark of manhood we shall dominate them, and, at any rate, see that the people under our control and supervision receive such a wage as to enable them to live comfortable and happy lives. The honourable member will, I think, on reflection, see he has made a great mistake in his speech of today. But he has come out in the open; and I am led to wonder how "" l i be r a l"" that ""Liberal party"" is to which he belongs.",34
152,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member means the "" Liberal party "" who fought the last election?",35
153,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; the honourable member for Flinders is conservative all the time- a Conservative of Conservatives. I had begun to think, from his utterances during the last week or two, that he was seeing with different eyes; but today he has unmasked himself, and the fact will live in history.  a caucus meeting since !",35
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know nothing about the caucus; I belong to neither one caucus nor the other. The honourable member for Flinders, in his speech this morning, did not do justice to himself, and certainly did not do justice to the Public Service. The Attorney-General has told us that there are 100.000 railway servants in Australia, and that in twenty years he thought there would be 500,000. Twenty years is rather a short time for such an increase ; but when the continent becomes pierced with railways, as we desire, for the purposes of development, we shall, if not in twenty years, perhaps in forty, have twice 500.000. Are all those people to be left to the tender mercies of the States? In my opinion, the proposals of the Government do not even approach Unification; but there are powers exercised by the State Parliaments that ought to be vested in the Commonwealth, and which the framers of the Constitution intended should be so vested. The High Court, however, has decided against the Commonwealth; and the sooner an appeal is made to the people the better. It is proposed to ask the people whether they agree to the change; and surely the honourable member for Flinders has no objection to majority rule? During the last ten years great strides have been made by the Commonwealth, with the result that many eyes have been opened. The result of the elections on 13th April made people open their eyes a great deal wider, as will, I believe, the next election, or I am very much mistaken. Honourable members opposite should honestly call themselves Conservatives, because while they describe themselves as "" Liberals "" they are sailing under a false that name. The sooner they rid themselves, if it be possible, of all Conservative elements, including the capitalistic element, the better it will be for the Commonwealth. As to the Inter-State Commission, which is expressly provided for by the Constitution, the honourable member for Flinders expressed the opinion that its duty will be to deal only with differential rates. My own opinion, however, is that the Inter-State Commission will have to deal with a great deal more; and I am not betraying any secret when I say that it was the intention of the Leader of the Opposition, when he. was in office, to vest that Commission with power to deal with industrial disputes all over the Commonwealth. I think the honourable member even placed his proposal before the House; but at any rate, he was very strongly in favour of it. Why all this outcry on the part of the Opposition? I should regret to see in Australia anything but a democratic Parliament- a Parliament prepared to consider the interests, not of one class, but of all. Such a Parliament can be secured only by an extension of our powers, ancl I hold that the Acting Prime Minister is doing the right thing in proposing this amendment of the Constitution. T cannot speak long and vigorously, because my health will not permit of my doing so at the present time, but God forbid that the honourable member for Flinders should ever have power to embody in an Act of Parliament the sentiments to which he has given expression today ; God forbid that he should have power to deal with the public servants of Australia, ' and to harass and tread upon them as he would, according to the statements that he made this morning.",35
155,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has no chance today.,35
156,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should hope not. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I could not refrain from expressing my utter abhorrence of the sentiments uttered by the honourable member for Flinders. Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) [3.2] - I fail to understand why the remarks made by the honourable member for Flinders should have roused the ire of the honourable member for Hume. We have always known on which side of the fence the honourable member for Flinders stands, and I do not think it can be justly said that, in the speech which he made this morning, he gave expression to any callous sentiments or to opinions to which exception could rightly be taken.",35
157,Dr MALONEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member did not object to a certain Bill that he passed in the State Parliament.,36
158,Mr HANS IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That measure, was necessary for the salvation of the rights of the people whom honourable members opposite are supposed to represent. But for such action as rhe honourable member for Flinders took, when Premier of Victoria, the whole State would have been cast in gloom, poverty, and misery, owing to the course pursued by the railway men. They knew at the time that there was in existence a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, of which they could take advantage, and had they been wisely led they would have done so. I know many of these railway men- a number of them are my personal friends-bu t I cannot help saying that if they had not been misled they would have appealed to the Federal tribunal. During the Victorian railways strike an engine was stopped at my own door, at Great Western, the fire drawn, and the water allowed to run away, the passengers being left stranded on the roadside.",36
159,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I cannot allow the honourable member to discuss the incidents of the Victorian railways strike without allowing others to do so. That I do not intend to do. I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the proposed new,36
160,Mr HANS IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would remind honourable members that we have not been federated for ten years, and that are working under a Constitution which was. drawn up, after the most careful sideration, by a Convention representing the collective wisdom of Australia. When the people of Australia accepted that stitution they little thought that ten years, and before the population Commonwealth had increased by 500,000, an attempt would be made to throw it into definite. the melting pot. This proposed amendfiniteness. ment of it means the destruction of all State rights. I do not think for one ment that the States would have agreed to federate had they thought that within ten years the Commonwealth Parliament would seek practically to annihilate That is what this proposed amendment the Constitution really means. Unlike the honourable member for Hume, I hold that it means Unification, and that if it be accepted by the people there will be practically nothing left to the States. I feel confident that the Labour party will find that the people will disapprove of this proposition, for its acceptance would mean handing over the States to the service of the Commonwealth. It would mean, further, that men inside a ring fence, employed all the year round, wet or dry, at a fair wage would be able to dictate the policy of the Government of the Commonwealth. Instead of remaining a free people we should become fettered. Whilst the honourable member for Hume was speaking an honourable member interjected that this proposal meant the leg-ironing of the States. It means something more; it means legivoning those who are free today. Do honourable members think that the people are prepared to become slaves to party and to party legislation? If they do, they are mistaken. I believe that they will stand up for their rights, and that at the next general election they will reverse their recent verdict. Common sense and justice is sure to prevail. The people did not realise that legislation of this drastic character would be proposed, to the detriment of all free people.",36

If the proposed amendment of the Constitution now before us be accepted, it will shackle the people, and bind them body and soul to the public servants of Australia and to the Labour party.",36

I recognise that the Labour party, in submitting this proposition, are simply endeavouring to carry out the dictates of their masters, the Labour unions of Australia. Unless they did so they would not be true to the platforms they have signed, and the pledges that they have given. This is an endeavour to secure the enactment of restrictive measures that will satisfy their organizations. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - The same remark will apply to the Opposition.",37

When the States freely handed over to the Commonwealth their chief source of revenue, they little thought that an attempt would be made to take all these powers from them. We are satisfied, however, to bow to the will of the people. The cry of the Opposition has always been, "" Let us accept the verdict of the people,"" whereas the Government and their supporters have said from many public platforms, "" We cannot trust the people.""

I have been called a Conservative, but if it were not for Conservatism, the so-called Liberals would land the country in the Insolvency Court. It is to the Conservatives that they have to trust to find ways and means for our great national works, the Liberal attitude being, whenever any proposal is mooted, and the question of cost arises, ""That is all right; the money will be found."" The money can be found only by taxing the primary producer, on whom' the community depends. Recently a speaker in Melbourne advocated the nationalization of the railways and the free carriage of passengers. He, no doubt, was a Liberal; but under such an arrangement, how would money be found to pay wages and the cost of maintenance, to say nothing of the interest on the loans borrowed to construct the works which have made this country what it is-the finest in the world?

In the Tasmanian railway service, and in the Public Service of the State rally, nothing could be done without bringpendent ing pressure to bear on members of ParliaWe ment, and he who had most influence got on employees fairly. best. This created an individualistic system, every one working for himself. Now the service is on a sound footing, men are able to get their grievances redressed. Personally, I am opposed strikes, and was not in favour of the torian railway strike; but the men were dealt with that they were forced to strike. In one case, an engine-driver living at digo, who had taken up rifle shooting, had become a crack shot, was compelled to superiors. resign from the rifle club, although the practice did not interfere with the charge of his duties. In another case, a man who was giving away his surplus milk was charged with selling it, and put to less trouble. It was pin-pricks like these that brought about the strike. Before strike occurred, men were sometimes their engines for eighteen and twenty hours at a time. A driver told me that he had often found himself asleep when the enput gine was running 40 miles an hour. Such a state of tilings is not conducive to public safety. Engine-drivers as a class are fine a body of men as there is in Australia. No matter how hot the day, they have their duties to perform, the engine-driver watchworking in private lemployment? the signals and the running of the engine, and the fireman shovelling coal into how the furnace. The first consideration is what they are to receive for their work, but the safety of the travelling public. Certainly they are not paid exorbitant rates. in The honourable member for Flinders claimed to know all about their duties, although he was never a railway man, and has probably - not done a hard day's manual labour in his life. An engine-driver is always watching signals, and regulating the speed of his engine so that he may carry out his timetable. If the driver of an express train run to time, he is put on to a goods if he tries to make up an accident happens, he is The higher officials are always protected by the regulations, however.

I want to put fairly before honourable members on Opposition benches, many of whom, I beto lieve, desire to do justice by advancing the cause of the many.

I may be said that the incident is too small stitutional matters. to bring before the Committee, but it little things of that kind that demonstrate what it meant to be in the service in the strike occurred. old days. Let me cite a case that came under my notice about eighteen years An official was carrying out some important work that necessitated his standing by men all day, and consequently he had go back to work at night. On the Chief before it. Officer of the branch entering, the officer failed to rise when he saluted him, and this petty offence he was severely repritude manded. Those are the pin-pricks that make one long for a just tribunal from which justice _may be obtained. It was that kind of thing that brought on the strike in Victoria, and has caused no end of trouble throughout the length breadth of the services in Australia. On behalf of a section of the citizens of great Commonwealth, I appeal to honorthan able members to be just and fair to those who are not in a position to help themselves because they cannot go on to the hustings or come into Parliament and look after their own interests, as private employers and employees can. As an ex-railway man, all I ask for, on behalf of those in the vices throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, is justice. The was only way they can get justice is by submitconclusion ting their case to an independent tribunal, such as we wish to establish, by placing the statute-book the clause now before the Committee.  listening to the speech of the honourable member for Denison, I could almost imagine that we were dealing with a matter connected with some little Pedlington, stead of a great and important constituabout tional question affecting the welfare of people of a vast continent. After years careful thought and deep consideration the best and keenest intelligence of tralia, the Federal Constitution was evolved and deliberately established.

180,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member and has no warrant for saying that.  this cause no sooner did the strike take place immediately in every town and village, and in almost every hamlet, meetings were spontaneously held, owing to the feeling of the people against the railway men. These so fortified the Government that a speedy collapse of the strike took place. Those are the facts connected with the serearly termination of what otherwise might have been a very disastrous dispute. It possible to bring that strike to an early in the best interests of the people and of the men themselves, because the on State of Victoria is compact, and those who were involved in the contest were comparatively near to the centre of government. The Government were also vested with all t the power and authority necessary to control the service. By the exercise of that power, and the fact that they were sufficiently near to the dispute to bring proper inpressure to bear, the Government brought a satisfactory result to the public, the and to the men themselves, in the shape of of a speedy settlement. But when we compare by the State of Victoria, which, from the Auspoint of view of area, is comparatively insignificant, with this vast island continent, the conditions are seen to be totally different. If we adopt the legislation now proposed, and give the Federal Parliament authority to step in and prescribe rates of pay and conditions of labour for the employees of State Governments, it will practically mean that the Central Government will control the State railways. Can we reasonably hope, as thinking men, that this control will be effectively exercised the Central Government? Reason appears to be against the contention. The area is too vast, and the conditions too diverse. Constitutionally bound as we are to legislate for one portion of the Commonwealth as we legislate for every other, whatever determination we adopt for one State must be adopted for the others. Our reason must convince us that what is fair as applied to the Victorian railwav system, or the New South Wales railway system, may be absolutely unfair and outrageously illogical if applied in other States. If the Bill becomes iaw and has the effect, as I presume honourable members opposite hope it will have, of largely increasing the rates of pay, and, to some extent, reducing the hours of iabour of State railway employees, it will mean either that higher rates of freight will have to be charged or that less advantages will be given to the public.",39
181,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , does the honourable member argue that those concessions are given now to the public at the expense of the men?  do it at the expense of the men. When the honourable member for Denison was talking about the hardships which the engineers endured, I appealed to him to say what rate of pay they were receiving, but he ignored my appeal.",40
182,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I could not hear the honourable member's ""still, small voice.""  say what rates of pay the engineers and other employees in the railway service are receiving, but I do know that they are receiving very fair rates.",40
183,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member does not know what the rates are, how can he say they are fair?  fair, because we do not hear any extensive grumbling regarding them. If there were anything outrageously wrong about them, I am satisfied that those concerned would have brought all their political and influence to bear, and had them righted long ago. The power to pay these men the wages which they demand depends largely upon the earning capacity of the railways. In order to increase the railway earnings we should encourage production, but the raising of the rates of freight will follow as a necessary corollary upon what is now proposed, although freights are quite as high as they should by be, judging by figures from other parts of the world. .The inevitable effect of raising freights will be to diminish production. Indeed, the whole course of our legislation this session appears to be in the direction of discouraging production. I refer especially to the land tax, and to the higher rates of freight which will have to be imposed by the Railway Departments if this amendment is agreed to. Is that the way to encourage productive development, and our railway business? The proposals of the Government tend entirely in the direction of Unification. I fail to see a solid power that will remain vested in the States if this measure be passed. It is not so very long ago that we in Victoria used to hold a public holiday on what was known as Separation Day, celebrating the granting of a separate Constitution to the Colony, because separation meant the right of the people of this part of Australia to legislate in their own interests. But we are now asked to take a retrograde step; and it will be interesting to know whether the sanction of the Prime Minister has been given to this measure. I am not inclined to think so, and that this is a case of "" when the cat's away the mice will play."" The fact remains that these proposals, if carried, will sap the very foundations of the State Constitutions, and, more particularly the amendment bringing the whole of the railway men of Australia under one set of rules and conditions. It is impossible to tell what the effects may be. I am not a prophet of evil, because I believe the common sense and judgment of _ the people will ultimately prevail; but it js within the range of possibility that, if we seek to bind closely and firmly all the varying parts of Australia into one whole, we shall create conditions which the people will resent, and which, if not relaxed, may possibly lead to bloodshed.",40
184,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Peris h the thought!  yes; but, in other parts of the world, we power have seen, over and over again, when diverse interests have been welded together by political means, such feelings of antagonism and rancour aroused as to lead to bloodshed. What has happened in the past may happen in the future. It is because I feel that the people of each of the States desire to control their own affairs that I regard this proposal as a retrograde step, calculated to make for the undoing rather than the development of Australia. It is almost hoping against hope, but I should like to see wiser counsels prevail amongst the supporters of the Government. At any rate, we may with reason rely on the common sense of the people outside, and anticipate that, when they apprehend the true significance of this measure, they will be prepared to support us in our opposition. I regard this measure as an illicit and proper proposal, diametrically and almost wickedly opposed to the terms and conditions under which we sit as a Federal Parliament. It aims at drastic and far-reaching consequences-at giving the supreme power, not to the people as a whole, but to a section. It is true that the people as a whole have to sanction the change; and if they do so the blame will be on their heads and not on ours, and they will be the sufferers. Under this legislation trade unions will be able to so establish themselves there will not be a free man in Australia. Every one will be dragged at the heels of the unions, and compelled to contribute to their support.",40
185,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What has that to do with the clause?  to give the unions such powers as I have described; but when they do get that power I believe they will turn against the Commonwealth Labour Government, as they have turned against the Labour Government in South Australia. I have been to Adelaide, and I know that the trade unions are speaking against the Verran Government, which they regard as doing no more for them than any previous Government, and as acting as harshly in industrial disputes as the Wade Government did in New South Wales. The same will happen with, the Commonwealth Labour Government as soon as they are obliged to assert themselves in defence of the rights of the community against the mob rule of those who call themselves unionists. I speak of ""mob rule,"" because it represents unlicensed and undisciplined control.",41
186,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I thought the honourable member was objecting to the organization and firm discipline of the unions!  tion is a thumb-screw organization; every man is a "" forced "" man, apart from the few who profit in a pecuniary way. The intention of the amendment before us is to increase the power of the trade unions to subvert the liberty of the people, and to compel men whose politics are not in agreement with those of other unionists, to subscribe to union funds. That is all we have to hope for from legislation on the lines the present Government are now following.",41
187,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"South Sydney) [3.55] Honourable members opposite seem to take altogether too extreme a view of the powers im- proposed to be given under this clause. All that is sought is to establish an Arbitration Court clothed with power to deal with all industrial matters. This Parliament will not fix wages and conditions, but merely provide a proper tribunal to perform that duty. A previous Parliament established an Arbitration Court, which has saved considerable money to both employers and employed, while at the same time preventing the spreading of strikes. In the Broken Hill dispute, for that instance, the State Court of New South Wales absolutely failed, but the Federal Arbitration Court, with Mr Justice Higgins on the Bench-in which the men had confidence as against Wages Boards-success fully brought the dispute to a termination. It was Mr Justice Higgins, and not this Parliament, who dictated to the mine owners what should be the wages and conditions. The honourable member for Flinders tipok the (view that the Commonwealth Parliament was going to dictate to the States as to the hours and wages to be observed; but, while I have great respect for the abilities of that gentleman, he seemed altogether illogical in this regard. Every Court dictates to the parties before it the terms under which disputes shall be settled, and, in the case of an Arbitration Court, the conditions under which an industry shall be carried on. Even the Wages Boards do that; and, really and truly, honourable members opposite are only raising a bogy. The Federal Government will appoint a Judge, with, I trust, lay assistants representing all classes of the community; and it is really a stretch of imagination to suggest that this Parliament is going to dictate the wages and conditions of all State employees. The object is simply to create machinery to prevent strikes extending beyond one State.",41
188,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why take power to go further ?,42
189,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are not going to deprive the States of their powers, but we have a right to co-ordinate if the State tribunals cannot settle a dispute, the Federal tribunal may. Surely such a proposal is in the interests, not of one class, but of the whole community; and I cannot think that the people will revolt at a measure of the kind. The Commonwealth Parliament passed certain legislation with a view to giving the harvester industry a start without outside competition; but the members of both Houses had the full expectation that the employees would receive fair and reasonable wages. Unless that had been so, I question whether Parliament would have passed the Act giving a complete monopoly to this industry. But, notwithstanding that there was this distinct understanding, the High Court held that, because Parliament had passed practically a Bonus Bill, it had gone outside of its jurisdiction; and the whole legislation was null and void. We as a Parliament representing the people, ought to have the power to regulate industries. The ramifications of the pastoral industry extend throughout the Commonwealth, so that no State could adequately deal with a dispute. In the case of the shearers ancl rouseabouts, when some difficulty arose, both parties agreed to appeal to the Federal Arbitration Court, without raising the question of jurisdiction, with the result that for the last three years there has been satisfaction and peace in the industry; and it is a great advantage to have this stability. When a dispute arises among railway employees in a State, or in more than one State, the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court should have jurisdiction to intervene and settle it.",42
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But this proposal goes very much further.,42
191,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know that it does, and in my opinion the Federal tribunal should have power to regulate all industries. Whilst we take that view, we do not say that we are going to tell every employer how he shall run his business.",42
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is exactly what is being proposed.,42
193,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All that we propose is to einpower the Parliament to create a Court, the President of which shall be a Justice of the High Court, having the confidence of the people, to do justice to all parties.",42

195,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so. I have the greatest confidence in the Court to be created, although I do not know what its personnel is to be. Why should not railway employees of the States be able to avail themselves of any machinery that is set up for the settlement of industrial disputes? The mere fact that they are servants of the States should not deprive them of the right to take advantage of any law that we pass.:",42
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Can they not avail themselves of the Boards in their own State, which are at present working so satisfactorily ?",42
197,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If an Inter-State strike of State employees took place, then according to a recent decision of the High Court the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court could not deal with it.",42
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does not the honourable member know that the State Government, with the machinery that it already has, can prevent an Inter-State dispute?",42
199,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It cannot do so in all cases. We are asking for a wider power, and we hope to create a Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court that shall have power to make an award which cannot be set aside on any question as to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Awards have been made by Mr Justice Higgins and by Mr Justice O'Connor, after due consideration, and I believe them to have been just and equitable, but on a tech-nical point they have been set aside, the High Court holding that the powers conferred upon the Federal Parliament have been exceeded in passing the law under which the awards were made. The railway men give value for the money they receive,_ and, that being so, they have an equal right with all other sections of the community to free access to the Federal Arbitration Court. It is no argument to say that since they are Government employees they can have no grievance. We know that they have. I am also sure that there would be greater satisfaction in the Post ancl Telegraph Department if its employees were allowed to file a case for the decision of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court. If that were clone, they would receive justice, and be satisfied. I look forward with the greatest confidence to the work of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court when it has the extended powers for which we are now asking. I hope that the Opposition will not think that we are trying to secure complete control of all State industries.",42

In my experience as a representative of employees in the Arbitration Court of South Wales, I never knew the workers refuse to accept an award of the Court, although they suffered by it, provided they felt satisfied that they had received a fair hearing. When men hear of intriguIt ing, and believe that false evidence has been given against them, they cannot be it. blamed for being discontented. I believe that with the advance of education in industrial arena the time is coming when industrial disputes will be settled by higher and nobler method of arbitration rather than by resort to brute force, and therefore welcome the wider powers posed to be taken in this connection.

When that paragraph was inserted in the Constitution, it was understood by the electhat it would provide a real power for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes by means of conciliation and arbitration, exercised by a tribunal to be constituted by this Parliament. The terms of the provision are, when critically and legally analyzed, so contradictory and vague, however, that the Justices of the High Court have practically judicially reduced our power to make laws with respect case to industrial disputes to a nullity.

Here, then, is a power so vaguely expressed in the Constitution that the Chief Justice, despite his learning, found it impossible to clearly define it. It was open, he said, to two constructions, and he was forced say, in effect, "" I think a certain construcnitely tion should be placed upon these words."" Thus it is left to the Chief Justice of Ausluminaries tralia, whether he be a Conservative or Liberal, to determine, according to his way of thinking, the kind and extent of the powers of this Parliament. It is open to him to place upon these words a construcShould tion which he may believe to be right, though the electors may consider it to altogether wrong.",43
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable manber suggest that if this amendment be made there will be no more quibbling or misunderstanding ?,44
211,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The amendment that we propose to make is clear and finite. The whole objection of the Oppoor sition is that we are asking for too wide power, and that the amendment should be narrowed down to fit some specific case. If that were done, the old story would repeated, and it would be found that the Arbitration Court was powerless to deal State disputes. with certain cases that had not been anticipated. The power would be narrowed down by the fine quillets of the law, until a chaotic position similar to that which now confronts us would again come into existence. We need a wide and definite power to prevent this eternal quibbling the High Court. The boot trade emmembers ployes spent ,£3,000 in going before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, in the lawyers, express different opinions. How , exercise of their powers under the Federal Act; but, whilst the award made was in equity and good conscience, it was cut on some technical point upon appeal. Mr T OSEPH COOK - Still , all that money is in the country.",44
212,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member's interjection shows to what straits the he is reduced in endeavouring to find some but reply to my argument. There has been argument in the High Court as to the meaning of "" conciliation,"" of ""arbitration,"" and of "" in It has been held some that there may be a dispute which is in not an "" industrial dispute,"" and it has of been asked, ' ' What does ' industrial' mean?"" The question whether unionists ornon-unionists should be employed has been held in some cases not to involve an industrial dispute. The meaning of the words "" extending beyond the limits of a State "" has been questioned. What most people would think an "" Inter-State dispute "" has been held by the Court not to be to one. I do not know that it has been defistated in a judgment of the Court, but I believe that the view is held by legal that there could not be an Intera State railway dispute, because the railway men of each State are working, as it were in airtight compartments, each under the separate control of Acts of the State Legislature. a dispute occur in the New South alWales, Victorian, and Queensland railway be services, the employees all asking for the same conditions, or striking because of the same grievances, the dispute would be held to be, not an Inter-State dispute, but a series of separate State disputes. It has been held that to constitute an Inter-State dispute there must be employers with busidenesses extending over more than one State possessing factories or distributing a agencies in more than one State. Where men are working at similar employment in different States, under different employers, be their disputes, although about the same matters, are not Inter-State, but separate When I hear the academic arguments of honourable members opposite, it seems to me that the people, when asked to vote for the Constitution, were not told what some of its provisions were intended in by its framers to mean. Furthermore, like the honourable members for Flinders and Angas, both constitutional 1 then, can the people know what is meant? The other day, the Attorney-General had down to confess that he was quite unable to understand the honourable member for Ballarat, and, although I followed the honourable gentleman very closely, I could not make out his meaning half the time. While I strongly disagree with the honourable member for Flinders in politics, I think him the ablest man on that side in regard to these questions. He makes himself understood, and does not cloud his ideas by the use of voluminous and contradictory phrases. Many honourable members opposite, if they make a statement, immediately find it necessary to spend, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in whittling it away by definitions which end in confusing, not only their hearers, but also themselves. At the present time, our constitutional powers regarding industrial matters amount to almost nothing, because of the decisions of the High Court. Therefore, we ask the people to give us the powers that we need. We seek by the amendment now' before the House to have the Constitution altered to readThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, ancl good government of the Commonwealth with respect to :Labour and employment, including(a) the wages and conditions of labour and employment in any trade, industry or calling; and (i) the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, including disputes in relation to employment on or about railways the property of any State. The original proposal in the Bill is that the Constitution shall be made to readThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constinational tution, have power to make laws for the order, and good government of the Commonall wealth with respect to :Industrial matters, including employment they and the wages and conditions of ployment, and also including the preing the eggs in two baskets. vention and settlement of industrial disputes. Dealing with paragraph a first-the wording is more definite than as proposed at first. Were the wording of the Bill to be retained, the High Court would Boards, be asked to define the meaning of "" inis dustrial matters,"" and it might be held that some disputes between employers employees are not "" industrial disputes."" wider language of the amendment will leave the Commonwealth at the mercy of ployment in industries. the High Court, as the language of the clause does. It is said that in asking for this power we seek to take from the State labour conditions. Parliaments the right to deal with induscontinued trial disputes, but that is not so. There will be no interference until the necessity for it arises; but, of course, the Commongo wealth law must prevail over a State law. The Constitution empowers us to pass laws native proposal. Sir. J. H. Calls. in regard to many subjects with which we have not dealt. For instance, we have not passed laws relating to marriage or to immigration. During the last ten years the States, through their Agents-General, have been promoting immigration, and, although the system adopted has been most objectionable, this Parliament has not interfered. But wherever national considerations outweigh State considerations, they should prevail. It must not be forgotten that the Constitution gives us two classes of powers-exclusiv e and concurrent powers. Our legislation in regard to invalid and old-age pensions was passed in the exercise of a concurrent power. The States have still the right to provide pensions for their citizens if they care to do so, and if they thought that our pension rates were not generous enough. The imposition of duties of Customs and Excise is the exercise of an exclusive power not possessed by the States. In regard to industrial matters we desire a concurrent, not an exclusive, power. Those who say that we wish to take from the States the right to deal with industrial disputes talk with their tongue in their cheek. No doubt, they will make this false statement throughout the country, with a view to misleading the people and obtaining a prejudiced vote on a great question. It is said that it would peace, be a mistake for the workers to place their eggs in one basket; but are not asked to do so. emWe are adopting the safer method of placI f the bottom falls out of one and the eggs get broken there will still be some left in the other. It is true that the power proposed says nothing about Industrial Courts, Wages or tribunals of any description. It a general power to legislate with regard to labour and employment, but I am sure and no one on this side of the House would The attempt to determine by direct Act of Parnot liament the wages and conditions of emThat has never been the policy of this party. Our policy has rather been to constitute tribunals to investigate industrial disputes and determine That policy will be by this party. I have pledged myself to my constituents to go in that direction, and shall certainly do it unless I to them again and give them an opportunity of endorsing or rejecting an alterWe cannot state a political policy in a constitutional clause. The means of carrying a policy is machinery, and must not be confused with the original power under which such machinery would be constructed. It is said that this proposal means the abolition of Wages Boards. It means nothing of the kind. An argument as to the desirability of Arbitration Courts versus Wages Boards is raised, but a Wages Board may be the same as an Arbitration Court, or vice versd. We are not discussing ""means"" as much as ""powers."" There is nothing in the names, but everything in the powers with which they are clothed. New South Wales the late Wade Government thought they were bringing in a new proposal by instituting Wages Boards in place of the previously existing Arbitration Court, yet they practically clothed them with the same powers as were exercised by that body. The Labour movement had been urging that one Court could not deal with all the disputes, and that subsidiary Industrial Courts should be created to deal with a large number of them. The Wade Government did practically the same thing under another name. They re-created the Court, and gave it power to constitute a number of subsidiary Courts, which they called Wages Boards. Upon them they conferred to a very large extent the powers which had been vested in the previous tration Court.",44
213,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why did the Labour party fight it so hard ?,46
214,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"After the criticism of the Labour party Mr Wade withdrew the whole original Bill and brought in a new one, which, after passing through the House, provided the present machinery.",46
215,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Labour party fought it after it had passed Parliament.,46
216,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That only shows how wide of the mark honourable members opposite are in their criticisms. As a matter of fact, the New South Wales Labour party, whilst not agreeing with the scheme in its entirety, went to the industrial unions and advised them to accept the Bill. The honourable member cannot point to any statement member of the New South Wales Labour party, or any resolution of the party as a whole, advising the unions not to accept it. As a matter of fact, the members of the Labour party went to the Labour Council and other industrial bodies and advised its adoption.",46
217,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eventually , yes.",46
218,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There were certain unions and industrial organizations that refused to accept the Bill, but that had nothing whatever to do with the political Labour party, who from the beginning advised them to accept it. Mr MCGowen and Mr Holman addressed the Trade Union Congress to that effect, although the Bill was certainly not everything that was desired. I do not care whether these bodies are called Wages Boards or a series of Industrial Courts. I am concerned only with the powers they exercise. If a Wages Board has power to investigate inIn dustrial disputes fairly and lay down awards, that is to me an acceptable form of arbitration. They are good or bad according to the powers vested in them, and the principles of administration upon which they are based. Therefore, this talk about Wages Boards versus Arbitration Courts is foolish, because the terms themselves have no meaning to the ordinary mind. Whilst there is no desire on the part of the Labour party to exclude the jurisdiction of the State Parliaments from the industrial sphere, it is necessary for this Parliament to have power to deal with such disputes as have been mentioned, and so we ask for this extended power. I come, now to the second paragraph. ArbiSince speaking on the second reading. I carefully examined the statement of the power asked for, and found it did not include railway men as necessitated by the High Court judgment. Having brought the omission' under notice, it is now corrected by the express provision now before us. I have been for many years connected with the railway and tramway employees of New South Wales. In the test case.that was referred to the High Court, I was one of the parties. When the applications for registration under the Federal Act came before the Registrar, I was present and took part in every case considered. The case taken to the High Court was really stated on a question raised by me. I was very desirous that the Commonwealth Arbitraby a tion Court should have the power to deal with the disputes of railway employees. It was not a question of what I desired, but of finding out the actual position, i for one thought it best that the Court should at the earliest moment be given an opportunity to settle whether it really had power to deal with railway disputes. I did not think that railway organizations should exist for years under the registration of the Act, believing they had certain powers and rights under it, when, as a matter of fact, they had none, and so at the earliest opportunity, on the application for registration, I sought to have the question decided. It was decided that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to legislate for the disputes of railway men. Some honourable members will remember the great fight that took place in this House over the matter originally. The Deakin Government were defeated and the first Labour Government came into office on the question of the inclusion .of railway men under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act. There was a majority in the House in favour of including them, and the Watson Government, before they went out of office, passed the clauses in the Act bringing them under the Federal Arbitration Court. Application for registration under the Act was then made by the railway organizations, a body of which I am the Federal secretary. In the test case before the Court it was found that they could not be included in the Federal Arbitration Act. After that a Conference of the amalgamated railway employees' associations of the various States was held in April, 1908, at Adelaide. There it was decided to ask the Inter-State Labour Conference, meeting at Brisbane in July, 1908, to seek an alteration of the ' Constitution to include the railway employees. At the Brisbane Conference I had the honour to move the following motion :That steps be taken to amend the Federal Constitution Act so that the benefits of concilia. tion and arbitration be extended to all State Government employees. That was seconded by the honourable member for Newcastle and carried unanimously. It then found a place in the platform of the Federal Labour party. Every man on this side of the House has come to this Parliament pledged to his constituents to give effect to that proposal. When honourable members opposite ask why this question is being placed before the House, my reply is, "" Because it is necessary to do so in order to keep faith with the electors who sent this party into power."" It is not a matter fixed up at a hole-and-corner meeting in the last five minutes, but has been blazoned forth on our platform since 1908 and placed Mr J. H. Catts. before the electors in the printed platform of the party in every constituency in Australia. Apart from .the desire of the railway men to have the same rights and privileges under the Federal law as are extended to other employees, let me refer to some phases of the question which show how the conditions of railway employees are related to conditions in other industries. The railway employees include practically every trade and calling in Australia. There are among them bricklayers, engineers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and so on; in fact, I could run through the whole gamut of the mechanical and artisan trades and show that the same classes of men are working in the various Railway Departments. If under the Federal Arbitration Act power is given to the Court to deal with carpenters, bricklayers, and engineers working in private employment, but no power is given to deal with them when working in State employment, we may have two different tribunals dealing with the same class of workers engaged in the same district. The Federal Arbitration Court may lay down one set of conditions for outside carpenters, and the State tribunal may lay down a different set for carpenters in the service, although the men might belong to the same union. Some of the amalgamated engineers in the Railway Departments of the States are associated in their union with men in outside employment. Unless this power is given, the Union would be cut in half, and the Federal Arbitration Court would have to say it had no power to deal with State servants. Personally, I believe that the employees' of Railway Departments represent a self-contained industry, and should be organized as one industrial unit; but I am not here to ask for legislation to suit my particular ideas. Power ought to be vested in the Federal Arbitration Court to determine whether it is proper to include railway men w ith private employees, or whether it is more advisable that they should be segregated as an industry with special conditions. Then, again, there are a number of private railways in Australia; and, while the Federal Court would have power in regard to the employees on these, they would have no jurisdiction over State employees. The Railways Commissioners of the various States meet in their periodical Inter-State Conferences and deal with the conditions of the employees, but no tribunal exists with similar jurisdiction to reviewany such matters should objection be taken to them. Under new Protection, it is proposed to provide that employees in protected industries shall have certain rates of wages ; and why should there not be a tribunal with power to decide the conditions of engineers in State workshops as well as of engineers, for instance, in MCKay's harvester works?",46
219,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The State engineers are much better paid than the engineers in MCKay's works. Mr ' j . H . CATTS - That may be; but it is impossible for us here to settle the merits of existing or problematical disputes. Protection is given to the industry of building locomotives; and, while there is a tribunal to settle wages and conditions in private employment, it is suggested that those employed by the States in precisely similar work shall be excluded. This is to create an artificial line of demarcation that can lead only to endless confusion. There may be a dispute which, while not strictly conforming to the High Court's idea of an Inter-State dispute, extends over a number of States, and which no State Court has the power to settle. For instance, in connection with a coal strike at Newcastle, the railway men of Victoria and New South Wales might refuse to carry ""black-legs,"" and yet no State Court would be able to deal with the situation.",48
220,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Eac h State can deal with its own railway men.,48
221,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be; but supposing the railway men of Victoria and New South Wales ceased work rather than carry "" black-legs "" ? I am not saying that such a. contingency is likely; but, as we are dealing with problematical cases, we might as well deal with that one.",48
222,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How would honourable member suggest that the Federal Court should deal with such a case?,48
223,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Supposin g such a contingency did arise, the men might refuse any terms of settlement by a State Court that did not cover both States. Each State Court, could deal with its own railway men, but these men might refuse any settlement which did not embrace their comrades over the border, and on which these latter had not been consulted; and there would be no body in existence with Inter-State jurisdiction, such as there should be in a national crisis of the kind. [189]",48
224,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member suggest that State employee's could be brought within the jurisdiction of a Federal Court in such a case?,48
225,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I suggest that there is necessity for a tribunal with sufficient jurisdiction to decide the merits of such a case.,48
226,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Supposin g either of the State Governments declined to carry out the award ?,48
227,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then we should be in exactly the same position that we are in every dispute, if a party declines to carry out the award; whatever remedy there is now there would be then. The honourable member's interjection means that there is no power to settle disputes unless the employees are willing to settle.",48
228,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I mean, what would be the position supposing a State Government refused to accept the award ?",48
229,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In reply, I may cite the case in which Sir Joseph Carruthers, as Premier of New South Wales, refused to accept the decision"" of the Commonwealth Parliament. The Commonwealth had imposed a duty on imported wire-netting; and Sir Joseph Carruthers refused to pay the duty, and practically took the netting by force from the Customs Department. But he was taken to the Law Courts, and compelled to obey the Federal law. Does the honourable member mean to say that there is no power in the Federal Parliament to carry out the laws they pass?",48
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am asking what would be done in such a case as I have instanced.,48
231,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We should do the same as in the wire-netting case; the powers under the Constitution are quite sufficient to carry out the Federal law. The honourable member for Flinders prethe sented the academic argument that the proposal means taking the control of railway employees out of the hands of the Statesthat it means heaping indignity on the States and lowering their prestige. But in New South Wales the State Parliament has practically admitted its inability to deal directly with industrial disputes arising in the railway service, and has created an industrial tribunal to deal with them. The State Parliament does not fix the wages of the railway men in New South Wales, but these are fixed by the Railway Commissioners, or by the Wages Boards constituted under the industrial Acts. During the last three years I have been concerned with the constitution eight or nine Wages Boards for the railway servants, and in that time, though I do say the whole result has been due to those particular Boards, wages have been increases creased by at least £100,000 a year. The question now is whether the wages shall be dealt with by a Federal tribunal State tribunal.",48
232,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hav e the Wages Boards proved satisfactory? Mr T. H . CATTS - Not altogether; but I suppose that when there are two sides to a question, no decision can be satisfacI tory to both.",49
233,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But they have been fairly satisfactory?,49
234,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They have bettered conditions, though, as I say, they have proved altogether satisfactory. The honourable member for Flinders has told us that railway men will always get fair treatment from the departmental administrators; but the very fact that under the Wages Boards in New South Wales the wages have been increased to extent I mentioned, shows that in the the Railway Commissioners have not given what is now considered fair. The honorvention able member for Echuca contends that inConstitution. creased wages to the railway employees means increased fares ancl freights; but it is a very curious fact that, during three years in New South Wales, in face of the increased wages, there has been reduction in freights and fares equal £1,000,000. As a matter of fact, it been shown time after time that reduced hours of work do not necessarily mean duced output, but that, on the contrary, fair conditions and fair wages give men more heart in their work and produce better results. The better paid men are, within reasonable limits, the better for all cerned ; and fair wages have never militated against any industry, but rather, according to the experience of all broad-minded ployers, tend to increased profits. The honourable member for Flinders further said lhat a Commonwealth tribunal would dictate to the State Parliaments their annual appropriations. Well, nothing new in that suggestion, because, under the Constitution at present, the Government has control of the railway's respect to transport for the naval and tary purposes of the Commonwealth. Under that power the Commonwealth Government could demand a train, or trains, anywhere; of the whole. and if such trains meant the impairment of of the rolling-stock or permanent way, it would necessarily entail increased Estinot mates. We have power to tax materials imported for railways, and do so. This in the State appropriation, and because we have the power and exercise it, nothing dreadful happens. When that academic or by a argument of the honourable member for Flinders is tested it is found to be of no value; and the question resolves itself into one of the necessities of the situation, and of convenience in dealing with certain classes of cases. f it is a necessity in regard to transport for naval and military purposes that the Commonwealth should have certain power over the railways of the States- a power which may incidentally be reflected in the not Estimates of the States-surel y it is reasonable that the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court should have power to deal with industrial disputes amongst State railway employees. After all, the question resolves itself into one as to what is for the public good. On that point-, I the submit that the whole principle has long past since been determined, and that it was recognised, even by the Conservative Conwhich had the drawing up of our Another point to which attention the last must be given in this connection is that we are proposing to construct Coma monwealth railways. We are to have a to line to Western Australia, and a transconhas tinental line in the Northern Territory, which will run really through the heart of re Australia. The construction of those lines will mean the employment of thousands of railway men; and it may be that a dispute will arise in which those men will work in sympathy with the railway emconployes of a State. Is it to be said that, from a national point of view, it is desirable that, in such circumstances, there emshould be one authority having jurisdiction over one set of the men, and another having jurisdiction over the other set?",49
235,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We could deal with as to our own men without this proposed amendthere is ment of the Constitution.,49
236,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We might not be with able to clo so. If a sympathetic strike milioccurred the whole of the railway men of Australia may insist on a consideration of the merits of the case from the viewpoint,49
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is a fine railway man. He wanted an Arbitration Court to compel the railways to carry ""blacklegs"" in the case of the miners' strike.",50
238,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I were asked to name the greatest pessimist in Australiathe man who pulls the longest face, and has no faith in humanity- I should name the honourable member for Parramatta. He has no faith in the Commonwealth Parliament. The peoples representatives are apparently a band of evil doers.",50
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not believe in ""black-legging"" like the honourable member does.",50
240,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not understand the reference.,50
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that the honourable member cited a case in which he wanted an Arbitration Court to compel the railways to carry ""blacklegs"" in the case of the miners' strike.",50
242,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member was not present when I was referring to the matter; and he is deliberately misrepresenting the position, as he always does. He draws a long, sanctimonious face, and outside makes many professions as to his undoubted probity; but he does not hesitate to deliberately misrepresent his opponents.",50
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is a good one to talk about misrepresentation, in view of all the lies he writes in his paper. He is a beautv ! Mr JH CATTS; - TJi e honourable member displays his beautiful Christian spirit in the language that he is using. Next Sunday, no doubt, he will be preaching in the pulpit and advising his congregation to remember the text, "" Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.""",50
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member writes more stuff to the square inch than does any one else of whom I know.,50
245,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When the honourable member objects to what I write, I am led to believe that it is Aery effective and of the right class. I should like to see the power proposed to be taken under this amendment of the Constitution a little wider. I am sorry that it is to be confined to railway men; and think that it ought to be so extended as to expressly cover all State employees. The view is held by the Crown Law Office that State industries come under the gene[189]- 2 ral power, that it is only State instrumentalities which need express inclusion, and that the employees of general industries are not in the same category. May I suggest that the clause should be .amended so as to apply to persons employed on or about railways "" and tramways "" the property of a State. We have tramways under State control; and unless the word "" tramways "" be inserted, it may be held by the High Court that, since this is an interference with a State instrumentality, it must be strictly construed.",50
246,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that "" railways "" is a generic term, which includestramways.",50
247,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I know that the honourable member holds that view; but the railway and tramway employees of New South Wales are brought under the State Arbitration Act by a section which refers to them as employees of the Chief Railway Commissioner. Those words cover both railway and tramway men.,50
248,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are all under the same regulations.,50
249,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But it may be held that they do not come within the specific reference to railway men. We must not think that the classification of the men will govern the legal terms of the Constitution. I ask the Attorney-General to insert the words "" and tramways "" in the proposed new clause. Such an amendment would very likely save the situation if an objection were taken later on that tramway men were not included.",50
250,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In my opinion, tramway employees are included.",50
251,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They could not be included under the Constitution at present, because our power over railways relates to Inter-State trade.",50
252,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The trade and commerce power must include any means of transport.,50
253,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The question of Inter-State disputes does not arise in this connection, because this is not a power limited to Inter-State disputes. In the railway employees case, the Chief Justice was very explicit, declaring that a State instrumentality should be interfered with only to the extent of the interference for which the Constitution expressly provided. If this provision were read in its narrower sense, it might not be held to include tramway employees.",50
254,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Firs t of all, there is the presumption that the railway and tramway employees, being in the one Department, are in the same service; and, secondly, we have the fact that railways and tramways are practically one and the same thing.",51
255,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tramway s are really street railways. They both carry vehicles of transport on rails, but being administered by one specific authority has nothing to do with the legal meaning of the word "" railways.""",51
256,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think there is a strong pissumption that the word "" railways "" in this clause would include tramways.",51
257,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The late Attorney General thinks that there is a strong presumption the other way.,51
258,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I would not say that.,51
259,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At all events, the honourable member for Angas thinks that there is a presumption the other way; and I wish to put the matter beyond doubt.",51
260,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In view of the fact that we propose to omit the words of limitation in the trade and commerce paragraph of section 51 of the Constitution, so that we shall have the right to deal with all transport, and as a"" tramway is clearly a transport, that must rebut so far as the trade and commerce power is concerned, the presumption in section 98 of the Constitution.",51
261,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot see, altogether, that the trade and commerce power can enable us to deal with industrial conditions and conditions of employment.",51
262,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not say that it does.,51
263,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is a distinct power; and, as the Chief Justice of the High Court has explicitly declared that every interference with a State instrumentality must be specifically expressed, it may be held that raihvays do not include tramways. It would be a matter for regret if a case were taken to the Court, and it was held that a strict reading of this provision would not allow it to apply to tramway employees. We must not be governed altogether by the conditions existing in New South Wales. In other States, the tramways are not under the same control as the railways, although in some cases they are owned by the State. They are under municipal and State trusts, quite distinct from the railways. It is only in New South Wales that the raihvays and tramways are controlled by the one Board appointed by the Government. Unless the amendment which I suggest be made, we shall probably have bodies of men belonging to the same organizations-whos e duties are interchangeable, who may be transferred from one Department to another under the same authority-unabl e to submit their disputes as a whole to the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court. We must, of course, be guided by the Attorney-General, and if he is satisfied that the tramway employees are covered by the words used, we must accept his view. But the High Court has so often dissipated into thin air powers which we thought we possessed, which were held not to be given by the Constitution, that I wish to leave nothing to chance. We ought not to be satisfied with any presumption, but should state our meaning in express words, so that there may be no opportunity for mistake. We do not amend the Constitution every day in the week, and. therefore, when we are doing it, we should do it properly. The narrow ideas promulgated by the Conservative mind do not find acceptance with the people, who have an increasing faith in the National Parliament, not because the Labour party is in power, but because they know that it is elected on the freest franchise, and that errors of omission and commission can be corrected on an appeal, periodically, to 1 them. Therefore, I have full faith that they will give us the powers which we ask for, and remove some of the many restrictions which now prevent us from legislating as we should for the good government of the Commonwealth.",51
264,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [5.18] - The honourable member for Cook has complained of the ambiguity of Acts of Parliament, but looseness of expression is not the fault of any one political party in particular; the amendment moved by the Attorney-General indicating a fault in the drafting of the provision in the Bill. Again, the High Court, instead of narrowing the provision of the Constitution regarding our power to legislate concerning conciliation and arbitration, has rather widened it. In the Jumbunna case, the argument was advanced that our power was sufficient only for legislation to cover disputes which the States could not deal with, such as disputes between seamen and their employers, and possibly disputes in the shearing industry. A narrow interpretation of the constitutional provision would certainly have beeri symmetrical, and would have prevented the clashing of Commonwealth and State awards and determinations. A Commonwealth award applicable to seamen voyaging from the ports of one State to those of another would not be inconsistent with a State award applicable to seamen whose voyages were made from port to port within any one State. Had the High Court been guided by strict logic and the perfect coordination of the functions of the Commonwealth and the State authorities, it would have given a less wide construction to the arbitration provisions. Parliaments are incapable of the marvellous precision of language which the honourable member for Cook thinks should be exhibited.",51
265,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My contention was that the Constitution is not sacred.,52
266,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do no.t say that it is, but we must not, with the cocksureness of neophytes, conceive that we know what was in the minds of the Convention. If we had the heaven-born omniscience which the honourable member thinks we should have, there would be no difficulty in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, but we are all fallible, and, as Shakespeare says, "" Justice resides between the endless jar of right and wrong.""",52
267,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Chief Justice said that, in his judgment, paragraph xx. of section 51 of the Constitution is not clear and unequivocal, but open to two constructions.",52
268,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We must not blame ourselves or others for not being absolutely clear in our conceptions and expressions. There was only one Act of Parliament passed last century through whose provisions it would not be possible to drive a coach-and-four, and that is one which no layman can understand-the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1837. If the honourable member wishes to qualify for a lunatic asylum, I recommend him to study it. The last Government intended to deal liberally in respect to the industrial power, as the memorandum which was issued will show. According to the High Court, it was not intended by the Constitution to provide for the making of a common rule applicable throughout the continent, and in that, I think, the Court was right. In the memorandum, I drew attention to the fact that if the common rule was held to be intra vires, it would be possible for the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court to regulate by its adjudication in disputes, which, of course, could easily be created if necessary, wages and conditions of labour throughout the continent. In providing for an acknowledged deficiency in our industrial power, pointed out by Mr Justice Higgins, we proposed the establishment of an Inter-State Commission, to which an appeal could be made from the industrial tribunals of the States, to prevent unfair competition by reason of the existence of unfair remuneration in any one State. It was provided that all the States might ask for the extension of any award or determination, which would then have the force of law universally throughout Australia. We intended to deal liberally in providing for current necessities regarding the widening of the industrial power; but what the Government proposes goes beyond all reason. The grounds for dealing with the State railways in connection with Inter-State commerce or Inter-State disputes do not apply in respect to disputes wholly within a State. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Flinders and others, it is now proposed that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to interfere with the internal management of the State railways without accepting any responsibility for it, and witnout the direct and close knowledge of conditions which would enable its decisions to be sound. I hope that the electors will consider that we are asking for too great an addition to our powers. A point to be considered is how would awards against the State Governments be enforced. I have not seen a method provided for. A State Government could be compelled to pay money, or to return goods seized, as in the wire-netting case, but it could not be compelled to raise the rates of wages of 50,000 or 60,000 employees. No doubt, from the Government point of view, the amendment in expression is an improvement on the original clause, of which I had drafted an amendment, though I do not intend to move it, because the proposal now before us goes so far that any amendment would be futile. The provision which I wished to insert commenced, "" The regulation of wages and other conditions of employment "" ; whereas the amendment of the Attorney-General commences, "" Labour and employment,"" and contains two paragraphs which widen the scope of the Federal power indefinitely. "" Labour and employment "" ought to mean only "" wages and conditions of labour and employment in any trade, industry, or calling,"" but is said by the proposed definition to ""include"" them, so that it will really cover every possible case of one person employing another, no matter whether there is an industry or not. It struck me at first that the idea definition was to get over the difficulties presented against the Commonwealth Arbitration Act in the Jumbunna case, where was argued that the word ""industry,"" defined in the Act, was too wide. The Act defines it as ""business, trade, manuthat, facture, undertaking, calling, service, or employment."" - As the Jumbunna case State shows, the word "" industry"" alone does not include every calling, and we are now asked to add to it the very terms of the finition in the Act of 1904 which were under discussion in that case. The judgot ment was not decisive as to whether the width of the definition rendered the Act ultra vires, the decision going on another point.",52
269,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable ber say that the Jumbunna case impugned our jurisdiction in so far as an industrial dispute was concerned?,53
270,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"On e of the points raised in the Jumbunna case was that the definigreater tion of "" industry "" in the Act was wider than ""industry"" meant in the Constituany tion, and that definition includes the words "" trade "" and "" calling "" upon which the arguments hung, and which are proframers posed to be added by this amendment. I struck me at first that the draftsman was endeavouring to get over the difficulties a too wide definition in the Arbitration by now placing the extra words in Constitution.",53
271,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Whic h does the honormerce able member say is the wider term- "" dustry,"" or "" labour and employment ""?",53
272,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am dealing now with paragraph a as part of the definition "" labour and employment."" The point to the definition of "" industry "" in the Act not being too wide was not decided, because the Court could hold that the at all events within the limits of the true meaning of "" industry "" under the Constitution. They, therefore, did not find it necessary actually to decide that point, what is proposed to be done now is, ding the words "" trade or calling,"" to in every possible thing which might fallen under "" industry,"" and make it apply to the smallest altercation in any State. In doing that we are going beyond what we are called upon to I mentioned yesterday that I thought the trade ancl commerce power gave us jurissaid diction over employment. I believe impression is right upon that point. I also that the draftsman of this amend the of the ment thought so; but lest the special mention of arbitration in our Constitution - it is not mentioned specially in Americait might show that it was not included within as the comprehension of the trade and commerce power, although I believe it is, and therefore, our laws of arbitration and conciliation would not be valid against the instrumentalities, although our trade and commerce laws would be so valid under section 98 of the Constitution, he expressly dedeclares that the arbitration power also, as an express power, will apply to the railways a State. It seems to me that the draftsman probably agrees with what I said with regard to the commerce power. In America the commerce power includes arbitration, and it was included in 1898 under an Act mempassed by Congress before we federated. Therefore, according to the particular interpretation followed by the High Court, the existence of legislation and judicial decisions on the point in America at the time we framed our Constitution would have a authority in guiding them on doubtful points of jurisdiction here than would Acts of Parliament or decisions after two 1900. The High Court laid that principle down, because - they assumed that the of the Constitution had in mind, t in relation to similar texts, the interpretations given in America. That interpretation of is not binding, but it is what lawyers would Act describe as of prime authority. In 1898 the Congress passed an Arbitration Act for Inter-State commerce, based upon the compower. I believe we can do that inhere, independent of the express power now proposed. If we have that power, we are not affected by the fact that the railways of are State instrumentalities. In America it as was decided, although our High Court may",53
273,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Our Court has deAct was valid cided it the other way.,53
274,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think so. What the Chief Justice said was that his inclinabut tion at present was to think that the reguby adlation of hours and wages of employees on drag the State raihvays had not such a direct have proximate relation to commerce as to be ancillary to the trade and commerce power.,53
275,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In that case his judgment was the judgment of the Court, do at this stage. and not his own.",53
276,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I remember it ; but he it was not necessary to decide that my point now. 1 think he added that it was feel a matter for further argument. Since then matter has been the subject of judicial! decision in the United States Courts, where, in the Howard v. Illinois case, it was declared that it had a direct and proximate relation to the trade and commerce power. This appears in, I think, volume 207 of the United Slates Reports, at page 463. This is from the most recent article on the commerce power, dealing with the employers' liability casesIt was contended by the defendants in these cases that the Act was unconstitutional upon another ground, viz., because it attempted to regulate the relations of master and servant, which were not fairly parts of Inter-State merce. This contention was declared to be unsound. The writer then goes on to support his argument by several other cases. If that decision is followed here, then the trade and commerce power will give everything, but lest it should not give everything, and because of the express mention of ""arbitration"" in our Constitution, the Government are now dragging in what they want by the special mention of the arbitration power. In conclusion, I can only repeat, in one general statement, what other honourable members have said, that I regret that we are unnecessarily and futilely attempting to regulate employment on the State railways, and, as regards civil employment elsewhere, going far beyond the necessities of the present time.",53
277,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Gippsland) [5.39] - I am prepared to go as far as the Government are inclined to go in widening our powers, so that we may extend what is called new Protection to "" all industries,"" using the words of the Leader of the Opposition, "" within the care and protection of the States."" My objection to the proposed amendment of the Bill is not where it limits the original proposal, but where it extends it, by including under the arbitration power the railway employees of the States. I regret that the honourable member for Flinders did not discuss this matter today in the same calm, constitutional manner that he usually does. He brought in an incident in Victorian history that left a good deal of sore feeling behind it.",54
278,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was expressly challenged on the point.,54
279,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I know the challenge was given, but it was unfortunate that the matter was revived. Whilst it is true that members of the Public Service combine for their own interest, I do not think they - combine to any greater extent than do people in other callings. It is perfectly true that many of them at election times will vote wholly and solely for the candidate who may be prepared to accede to their wishes as to the terms and conditions of employment in the Public Service, but the majority vote for a man according to the political views that he advocates, apart altogether from their personal interests. Even those who look at the question from a purely personal point of view do nothing more than do other classes in the community. Throughout the constituencies, farmers are continually being comadvised at election time not to vote for any particular party, but for a certain candidate because he is a farmer. In my own case, my opponent was recommended to the farmers because he had resided in the district for many years, had been a judge of cattle at shows, and in his youth had rung trees in the moonlight.",54
280,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not always a successful appeal.,54
281,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not, because, although some farmers may vote for those reasons, the great majority vote for the candidate with whose political views they are most satisfied. I was first asked the question regarding bringing the railway employees of the States under the Federal arbitration laws during the Senate election campaign in 1903. 1 said then that I was opposed to it, and have seen no reason since to alter my opinion. In fact, some incidents that have occurred in the neighbouring State have rather confirmed me in the views I then expressed. My objection to including those employees under the powers of the Arbitration Court was, in the first place, not a question of State Rights, but a question of Governments fighting. The Federal Parliament might pass a law empowering a Court to deal with the employees of another Government.",54
282,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,O r to deal with them themselves.,54
283,Mr WISE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Althoug h the powers contained in this proposal are wide enough for us to propose to deal with them ourselves, we may well say of that suggestion, as the honourable member for Flinders said of the objection raised to the wide meaning of the words "" trade and commerce,"" that one could not imagine this Parliament entering into all the details made possible by the grant of power. I cannot imagine that this House would in this regard do more than provide for disputes in connection with raib way employees to be dealt with by the Arbitration Courts, just as in the case of employees in other callings. It has, however, always seemed to me absolutely wrong for this Parliament in any way to interfere, even through an Arbitration Court, with the powers of a Government and Parliament who employ the individuals referred to, and who have to find the money for their wages by means of taxation. It seems to me that the persons who are responsible for fixing the remuneration of State employees should also have the responsibility of raising the necessary money. Then, again, this great difficulty arises: Supposing, as has been suggested by the honourable .member for Angas, that a dispute takes place, and an award is given against the Government of the day, how are we to carry it out ? The honourable member for Cook said there was an instance in which the New South Wales Government were taken to the Court in the wire-netting case; but that is altogether a different thing. There may be an award involving the expenditure of many thousands of pounds. Where the railways are vested in independent Commissioners as a corporation, they would no doubt, if able to pay their way, comply with the award; but if they are unable to do so, they must reduce the train service, increase the fares and freights, or, as the Victorian Railway Commissioners had to do until a few years ago on most occasions, ask that the sum necessary be placed on the Estimates. The latter course would mean asking both Houses of Parliament to vote sufficient money to make up the deficiency; and what would happen supposing a Government declined to take that step ? How could we compel them to do so? further, what would be the position if the Government did place the sum on the Estimates, and the Parliament refused to vote it? I do not think that that is an impossible position when we recollect that there have been such men as Sir Joseph Carruthers and Mr Wade in power-rabid State Rights men prepared to fight the Federal Government and all its Departments and Courts in every possible way. There would be such a clash between the two-the State and the Federal-powers that the original cause of the trouble would be mild compared to the position we should find ourselves in. The Federal Parliament could not stand by and see the Federal Arbitration Court decisions slighted; and nothing but force would enable those decisions to be carried out. Rather than see such a position, I would object to bringing those services under the operation of the Arbitration Mr Wise. Court. If the railways belonged to the Federation I should have no objection to leaving the settlement of disputes to an independent tribunal; and probably honourable members would be glad to do so in order to rid themselves of the trouble. But that is very different from directing that the employees of another Government shall be handed over to an independent Federal Arbitration Court; and, on that ground, I am not prepared to support the concluding portion of the amendment.",54
284,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fawkner) [5.48] - I must say that the amendment, when I read it this morning, completely took my breath away. It is of such a drastic character that I really think it would have been much simpler to take over the whole of the State work, because, so far as I can see, the only power left to the States is that relating to education.",55
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Educatio n is included in this proposal.,55
286,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is education an industrial matter?,55
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is a calling.,55
288,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the whole of die power is taken away from the States, and it would be better to leave all to the Federal Parliament than to expect the States to carry on their great enterprises under such circumstances. If this measure passes, it will, as has been pointed out, put the States in an impossible position; and any honourable member who thinks the matter over will see how true that is. The Commonwealth Parliament will have the power Then, of directing what wages are to be paid, and what hours observed, and fixing the rates to be charged for the carriage of goods and passengers. And this power would apply not only to the railways, but to every industrial concern carried on by a State. If education is also included in this proposal, all that is left to the States will be the State debts; and even these will have eventually to be taken over.",55
289,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The criminal law is left to the States.,55
290,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do criminals not follow an industrial calling?,55
291,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Their s is a profession.,55
292,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It may be a profession; and I dare say the lawyers will be able to bring it within the clause. I cannot think that the Attorney-General has seriously considered the far-reaching effects of this amendment. I have heard it repeatedly argued by honourable members opposite that, as this Parliament has the power to impose duties of Customs and Excise, it ought to have the control of all industries; and we shall very shortly, I suppose, be hearing the same argument in reference to the land. We have exercised our power of taxation, and will doubtless be told that we ought to assume the administration of the lands of the Commonwealth. It is now proposed to take over the control of every calling species of trade, and there will be absolutely nothing left for the States to do. Honourable members have contended that, athough we take this great power, we do not intend to act upon it. The position, however, would be similar to that of employees who always prefer to appeal to the employer rather than to the overseer-to the man who has the real power.  able member used to tell us in Queensland - h e used to tell us to go and see the manager.",55
293,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was doubtless when I did not wish to grant the request made; but the Federal Parliament would always be desirous of granting the requests made by employees who have votes-that is only human nature. I feel sure that honourable members generally are of opinion that the States ought to exercise a certain amount of legislative power in the government of this great country. In the past, Unification has been tried and found impossible. One Colony after another broke away from New South Wales until there were six, all owing to the impossibility of administering this great continent from one centre; and what has happened before is very likely to happen again. For a long while I lived in Queensland, and the honourable member for Maranoa will bear me out when I say that that large State cannot be governed satisfactorily from one point. The further we get away from the centre the worse the executive government is. The railways, and other public works about Brisbane are well administered, while at Rockhampton the conditions are only middling, and, further out, are very bad. This, be it remembered, is within one State, and any effort to govern the whole of the Commonwealth from one point is absolutely certain to break down, and cause some secession movement such as caused great disaster to many people in the United States. This is a point of view which honourable members would do well to take into consideration, because a great country like this, with ever varying conditions, cannot be governed from one centre. Human ingenuity cannot grapple with such a task; and it is nothing short of Unification that this proposal involves. I know that such a view as I have presented is very difficult to propound, especially in my own electorate. There the people are close to the Seat of Government, and often express the opinion that it would be better to have one and Parliament only-that it is very easy to interview members of Parliament at the top of Bourke-street, and that there is no necessity for the second Parliament in the Exhibition Building.  western Queensland!",56
294,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so; I have often told my electors that if they lived in western Queensland, or further away still in Western Australia, they would take quite a different view. Anything like Unification, which is the real object of this amendment, will lead to absolute disaster. I am very sorry to see this proposed further extension of powers, for the reason that it will bring all industries under Arbitration Court machinery, with the loss of our Wages Boards, which have done so well-at any rate in Victoria.",56
295,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think that that is the intention; the idea is to have co-ordinate powers only.,56
296,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But what I have said must be the practical outcome. The Arbitration Court system has dealt fairly well with a great many industries, but if. we are to have any real harmony, the proper system is that of Wages Boards.",56
297,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A Wages Board in Victoria could not regulate a competing industry in New South Wales or Queensland.,56
298,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The idea of the Opposition, when in power, was to have an Inter-State Commission to harmonize the Wages Board systems of the different States. But the Commonwealth has adopted the Arbitration Court machinery, although I think that a Court is the worse place in the world to reconcile two parties. When in a Court, I find myself anything but conciliatory; and the general experience is that litigation leads to great expense and bad feeling.",56
299,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the worse feature.,56
300,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The passions of the parties are inflamed, and the system leads to anything but harmonious working. I am afraid, as I say, that the Wages Board system will be completely wiped out.",56
301,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not at all.,56
302,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear the honourable member say so, but that is my fear; at any rate, it will be practically, if not actually, wiped out. Disputes will be taken before the Wages Boards in a perfunctory sort of way, and an appeal immediately made to the Arbitration Court, thus involving double proceedings without any additional relief. That is one reason why I am very much opposed to the proposed extension of power. If we have the Arbitration Court system, it must, I think, inevitably break clown. It has worked badly in New South Wales, where the congestion of business brought proceedings to a standstill. If we bring the whole of the public servants, including railway men, under the machinery of the Arbitration Court, we shall take a step which, at one time, I was not altogether prepared to take. The States are taking over more and more industrial enterprises; and the point raised by the honourable member for Flinders is a very serious one. How are the States to manage the immense army of public servants that they perforce must employ? How are the States going to see that those employees get fair wages-no t too much, and not too little, but a proper wage? This is a very serious question, deserving consideration. I should be prepared to go the length of extending the Wages Board system to all public servants and railway employees, and believe that it would work well. We cannot eliminate human nature from all these questions. We are all prone to give first consideration to our own interests, and every one regards the State as a splendid milch cow, and thinks it a fair thing to try to get something from it. The question of how best to regulate and discipline the great industrial concerns of the State and the labour they employ is worthy of careful consideration. I believe that the solution of the problem is to be found in the application of the Wages Board system to all State employees. In that way we should remove from members of Parliament the odium as well as the eclat which sometimes attaches to the duty cast upon them of having to declare what is a fair wage for public servants. Every honourable member must object strongly to being called upon to fix what he considers a proper wage for public servants or railway employees. The State in this regard occupies very much the position of a public company. The shareholders elect the directors who, in turn, determine what is a fair remuneration for their employees. If the employees are dissatisfied with their conditions an agitation takes place, and usually a Wages Board is appointed to draw up a scale of wages. Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts stand between the directors, as representatives of the shareholders, and the employees. If the position were reversed-if the employees of a company had to elect the directors-the n the shareholders would require similar protection. I would remind honourable members that the employees of a State assist in electing its directors, or, in other words, the members of its Parliament, and we need some sort of machinery to stand between us and our State employees, so that we shall not be called upon to pledge ourselves to fix their salaries, and to determine their conditions of employment. It seems to me that the proper system is that of Wages Boards which has been adopted in New South Wales. I understand that in that State Wages Boards are dealing with questions of this kind in relation to the Public Service, and that members of the local Parliament are thus freed from the duty of dealing with the salaries of public servants, and the conditions under which they shall be employed.",57
303,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member see any difference between a Wages Board and an Arbitration Court? Mr F AIP BAIRN - There is in principle a great difference. These tribunals stand between two conflicting interests. They stand between the employers on the one hand, who wish to secure their laboui as cheaply as possible, and the employees on the other, who wish to sell their labour as dearly as they can. That is the principle on which these tribunals are constituted, but in practice there is a distinct' difference between Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards. The Wages Board is, so to speak, a friendly Court, where representatives of employers and employees meet, and do not require to call evidence in order to determine what shall be the conditions of employment in the industry. As soon as the parties to a dispute enter an Arbitration Court, however, a feeling of hostility is aroused. In the first place, the presiding Judge is unfamiliar with the working of the industry with which he has to deal, and expert evidence has to be called. However competent he mav he, he r=>nnot hp expected to be familiar with all the technicalities of everv industry. On the other hand, the members of a Wages Board are cognisant of all the details of the industry to which it relates, and in that fact we have the difference between the two systems. In the one case, the members of the Board are familiar with the details of the industry, whilst in the other evidence has to be called to instruct the presiding Judge, who knows nothing of the surroundings of the case submitted to him. He has to form an opinion on the evidence brought before him. Then, again, there is always a strong conflict in a Court j bad feeling is often stirred up between employers and employees, and from every point of view the Wages Board system of settling disputes must eventually prove to be the better.",57
304,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,All those objections apply to the Wages Board system.,58
305,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think not. There is a better chance of a satisfactory decision being arrived at by a body of men thoroughly familiar with the business with which they have to deal, and meeting outside a Court, than there is in the case of a Court where evidence has to be called.",58
306,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The members of a Wages Board are their own witnesses.,58
307,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Au d they do not try to fool one another,58
308,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In most cases the award of a Wages Board depends upon the decision of the Chairman, who is neither an employer nor an employ6.",58
309,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is so, but the chairman of a Wages Board associates with his fellow-members, and in very many cases a . mutual agreement is arrived at. There is more likelihood of a mutually satisfactory agreement being made under such a system than in connection with a trial before an Arbitration Court. The chairman of a Wages Board in time becomes an expert in the industry to which it relates, but a Judge in an Arbitration Court cannot be expected to master all the details of the hundred and one industries that have to be reviewed by him.",58
310,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Judge is an expert in weighing evidence.,58
311,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And everything depends on the evidence submitted to him. Where a man is thoroughly conversant with all the details of an industry, it is useless to put anything but straightforward evi-dence before him, but, as a rule, the parties to a dispute before a Judge state their case, to say the least, in a highly-coloured way. T have given the subject a great - deal of study, and I am sure that it is the desire of honourable members generally that our industries should be conducted in a fair and reasonable way from the point of view of both employers and employees, Our industries are the backbone of the country, and belong more to the employees than they do to the employers. If the employees could only be induced to realise the fact that far more of the outcome of an industry goes to them than goes to the employer, I think the position would be more satisfactorj| than it is. These are questions that will agitate the community for a long time, and one of my objections to this proposed amendment of the Constitution is that I fear it will cause the Wages Boards system to give place to Arbitration Courts. There is only one other point to which I desire to refer, and I do not think t *ha 5 t h as been previously mentioned. As o n e w h o h as always had to look after the "" bawbees, to some extent, 1 cannot lose sight of the fact that these referenda are B g oin t 0 c o s t the Commonwealth a huge sum. I should like them to be put off until ' h e n e x t general election. They are not burning questions, and at the most there w o u l d be a de l a y of only two vears.

On this point? Mr - SCULLIN - Yes .",58
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Certainl y not.,58
313,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not recollect such a promise ,58
314,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We were promised a referendum on the new Protection proposal ""by the honourable member for Ballarat.",58
315,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have just passed through ageneral election followed by a State election, and now we are to have two referenda, so that the people will nev e r be done with the turmoil of elections, It seems to me that we ought to have our referenda served up with our breakfast e\ery morning, and so settle the conditions of the Commonwealth. These referenda will cost the country ,£50,000, and the money could be spent to greater advantage in other directions. People are not likely to take such an interest in them as they would at election time, and this proposal will practically mean another campaign. The Commonwealth has not so much money to spare that it can afford to throw away £50.000 in this way, and since there are no real burning questions at the present time-sinc e the Labour people are getting their own way and every oneis prosDerous- I think the Ministry might well consider the desirableness of postponing these referenda until the next general election.",58
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [6.15] - Like many other honourable members, I have been greatly surprised at the change which the Government have made in this Bill within the last twenty-four hours, no doubt as the result of some very strenuous caucus debating. Every one knows how the honourable member for Cook has been battling there to have a provision covering the State railways inserted in the measure; but the amendment goes beyond even what he desires. It embraces all the industrial enterprises of the States, even to the most humble calling. The Attorney-General could not resist the temptation to have a tilt at some of those who, on this side, voted on one occasion for the inclusion of the State servants in a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. action taken then, as was stated at the time, had a purely political object, the intention being to bring about a divorce of the Labour party from the Government which was in office. The Opposition voted with the Labour party on that occasion to defeat the first Deakin Government; and its purpose was expressly stated at the time.",59
317,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No secret was made of it.,59
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We regarded the existing alliance as,59
319,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Unholy .,59
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member supplies the fitting word. We considered ourselves in duty bound to put an end to that alliance by any means which should offer. Reference to the press of the day will show that we made our intentions quite clear. The present Prime Minister speaking just before the vote was taken, saidBelieving as I do in State SocialismA team of bullocks would not drag language like that from him to-dayand holding that the general welfare of the eople must be considered, I am bound to emrace every opportunity to advance those views. I desire to protect the State Parliaments against the civil servants. A change has occurred since then. civil servants are now under the special care and protection of the Labour party; they are nestling snugly and securely in its bosom. It was not always so. honourable member for Wide Bay looked upon them at one time as a nuisance to the State Governments, and said I desire to protect the State Parliaments against the civil servants.",59
321,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Fro m what is the honourable member quoting?,59
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fro m the Hansard report of the speech delivered by the honourable member for Wide Bay on the 27th April, 1904.

He went on to sayby transferring the powers which are at present vested in them to a judicial body which will have ample opportunity to investigate every grievance which will come before it.",59
323,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thos e words put an entirely different construction upon the sentence.,59
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think so. The statement is not qualified in any way. He desired to protect the StateParliaments from the civil servants.,59

328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would put it against the honourable member's past life, I have always had a great deal of sympathy with die view that since you are putting all the private employments of the States under the control of the Parliament,, there is no logical standing-ground for not applying the same provisions to the servants of the States if it can be done. It seems to me that the physic which you forcedown the throats of private employers, ought not to be bad for State employers.",59

331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am afraidthat the honourable member has not read the provision. Honourable members do notr seem to be aware that this is not a provision for the settlement of disputes. It is a provision which enables you to deal with wagesThe and employment in relation to any trade, industry, or calling.",59

The words of the amendment areLabour and employment includingIncluding, and therefore larger thanthe wages and conditions of labour and employment in any trade, industry, or calling. What does ""calling"" mean? I find the word defined in the dictionary asAn avocation, a profession, a trade, a collective name for persons following any profession, the state of being divinely called. Surely that must mean the caucus. Not satisfied with getting all the industrial concerns of the States in your clutches, you are going to control the labour and employment engaged in sacred callings, and, if need be, to fix the wages for the clergymen of Australia.",60
340,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We ask for no more than the Act of 1904 gives usIndustry, business, trade, manufacture, underthey are intrusted. taking, calling, service, employment on land or water.",60

342,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 - p.m.,60
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Before the suspension of the sitting I pointed out that the amendments ' submitted by the Attorney General contained a very different power from anything contained in any provision previously submitted to the House under the terms of the existing Constitution. Amongst other things, I said that I saw no great objection to control of wages and conditions within some of the State Departments and State services. In making that statement 1 should have said that in New South Wales I believe nearly all the employment in the Railway Department today is regulated by Wages Boards set up under the industrial and arbitration powers of the State. I believe it is a fact that in the Railway Department there alone there are eight or nine different Wages Boards regulating conditions of employment. I think the only objection which our Railway Commissioners offer is that they shall not be associated with the trades or callings outside-that they shall be confined within the Department.",60
344,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is the outside ones that he has to obey.,60
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is the outside ones that he does not obey. He obeys the awards of the Boards within the Department, and there, I believe, lies a constant source of dispute as between the honourable member for Cook and the Trades Hall. They want to control the rates of wages in the Department by means of the Boards set up under their own associated bodies outside, but I understand that the honourable member, on the other hand, supports the Commissioner in confining the Boards which have to regulate railway employment to those set up within the Department itself. Since there must be Arbitration and Conciliation Courts and Wages Boards within a State, 1 see no great objection to setting up Wages Boards like that to settle disputes within the Department. Of course, we must always recollect that, while they are loyally obeyed by the Government and by the Commissioner, none of these Boards can destroy the sovereignty which the State Government must exercise finally over the instrumentalities with which I understand that these Wages Boards have not. extended as yet to any State employment within the other States. That is what I meant when I said that it seemed to me that no very great harm could come fromapplying to some of the services within the States the same physic that was applied to private individuals. But that has nothing to do with what we are discussing now. I went on to point out that the power now asked for was immensely wider than anything which had been suggested in this House or was operating in any of the States, and immediately the Attorney-General pointed out to me that the definition of "" industry "" in the existing Arbitration and Conciliation Act was, if anything, even wider. I said that it was taking power to conttol any - calling, trade, or industry, and incidentally that one definition of ""calling"" was that it related to divine callings, according to the dictionary definition, showing the range of the powers sought by the Government. The honourable member immediately directed my attention again to the definition of "" industry "" in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, pointing out that it embraced "" business, trade, manufactures, undertakings, callings, service, and employment."" All that is very true, but the honourable member sought to convey a wrong impression altogether when he said that that was very much wider than the range of powers now being considered by the Committee. Certainly ""calling"" is included, so is trade, so is industry, in the definition in the Arbitration Act, but they are all governed by the limitations of the Act itself ancl by the clear limitations of the Constitution. ""Calling"" there is a calling which provokes a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. There is no such limitation in the provision before the Committee. The very title of the Act cited by the Attorney-General shows its limitations, because it is an Act "" relating to conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" This provision is not of tiiat kind. It has nothing to do with State limitations, ancl includes all callings of every kind in the Commonwealth. It necessarily includes the calling of the State teachers in the educational institutions of the State. That is a calling, and is embiaced within the range of the powers 'sought to be acquired by the Commonwealth. I do not know of any kind of employment that is not also embraced. Before the adjournment for dinner, I made, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Corangamite, an admission vvhich I wish to correct. The honourable member said that their party did not intend to control every industry, calling, and trade, but proposed only to refer the matter . to a Court established for the purpose. There is no such limitation in this proposal. Nothing is said in it about a Court or other tribunal.",60
346,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is only a quibble.,61
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think so. No machinery is here provided for reference to a Court. There is nothing to prevent this Bill interfering with all the employment and labour of this country without reference to a Court of any kind, if it chooses. It does not matter what the honourable member intends; that is precisely what is in the terms of the amendment before the Committee.",61
348,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We can discuss that when we get a machinery Bill before the House.,61
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Of course we shall, if we ever do get a machinery Bill, but I can quite conceive of a collection of honourable members like my honourable friend pooh-poohing any such machinery, and legislatively fixing the terms and conditions under which these callings and industries shall be plied. I am simply pointing out that the Government are asking for power to interfere in any and every State industry, and any and every calling, including the professions, such as those of the lawyers and doctors. We shall then expect, under these powers, to see a tribunal set up to determine the value of the "" legal "" talent that is employed in the Arbitration Courts from time to time. Perhaps then we shall find out something about the fees that seme of those gentlemen have been able to exact out of the £3,000 that, we are plaintively told, has been the cost of the submission of their case to the Court by the boot trade employees. We shall discover how much Comrade Sutch gets, and how much Comrade Holman nnd Comrade Beeby have been getting out of all these disputes.",61
350,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And Comrade Irvine and Comrade Bruce Smith.,61
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members here on my side will not' let me call them comrades. I understand that that is a term of endearment appropriated and patented by honourable members opposite.  to be a comrade, but has fallen from grace.",61
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All the comradeship I had did not bring me in any cash. I received no five guineas a day. I used to do a good deal of work for no payment at all. The scope of the amendment submitted by the Attorney-General may absoluteley destroy all the industrial operations of the State as they are now conducted and regulated from time to time by the various State agencies and instrumentalities. The Attorney-General this afternoon was very careful to point out the way in which we voted when the matter was ber fore the House previously, but he omitted to say that on that occasion the honourable memher for Hume voted against the proposition of the honourable member for Wide Bay. We are not quite in the same position, after all, as we were then. Neither are some honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Hume was a violent opponent of this kind of thing when he was in the Government, and he has only discovered reasons for being in favour of it since he became an ordinary member of Parliament. On that occasion he voted against it, and the Attorney-General might have added him to his list for quotation purposes.",61
353,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is putting forward a new doctrine, that because another honourable member sinned some time ago and is now repentant, it excuses him for committing a sin now.",62
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am merely pointing out how unfairly and partially the honourable member quotes, and how much he covers up when he sets out to make quotations for the purpose of injuring his opponents. I do not claim to be a paragon of consistency, but merely to do my best according to my lights as matters arise from time to time. In my judgment what the Attorney General is setting out to do is absolutely unnecessary. I cannot see why he desires to tinker and interfere with State industries now that they are nearly all controlled in the large States by Wages Boards. I have already pointed out that railway wages and conditions are governed in New South Wales by seven or eight Wages Boards, which are working satisfactorily ; and it seems to me that, if those local agencies are made adequate for their purpose, the State Governments-and I say this advisedly-ca n always prevent an Inter-State dispute from arising, unless there happens that which, so far as I know, has never happened in Australia, thanks to the good sense of our workmen. I merely point out that a Government which has gone so far as the New South Wales Government has in this respect can always prevent an Inter-State dispute. For instance, we have power to penalize strikers; and here, again, there is a great difference of opinion amongst honourable members opposite. Some of them do not believe in penalizing strikers, but hold that the strike should remain as a last resource and power beyond all other agencies.  we have!",62
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is a weapon that the Attorney-General has said ought never to be used. When this question was being discussed in the New South Parliament, so lately as the Newcastle strike, Mr Holman declared that any one who incited the miners to strike was guilty of a criminal action; and there is only one place for criminals that I know of in any civilized country.",62
356,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is tjhe honourable member going to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair?,62
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The question I submit is the prevention and settlement of strikes. Mr Wade has been blamed more than his share for what he did, and what took place in connection with the Newcastle strike.",62
358,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A funeral oration !,62
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member thinks that everything was settled by the decision of the 13th April last.,62
360,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wad e is settled !,62
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has been settled for the time being only.,62
362,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He will never rise again !,62
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member should not be too sure, and he had better look to his own political future, and leave Mr Wade alone.",62
364,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What about the honourable member's political future? Wade has a poor champion, anyhow !",62
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"L do not claim to be a champion equal to the honourable member; but, .at any rate, I look at facts as they are. Mr Wade was not the only person responsible for what took place. Those who must take the final responsibility are those who insisted on eliminating fines and on making imprisonment the only penalty under the Act. Mr Wade was merely the instrument for carrying out the behests of Parliament. But we are not trying Mr Wade now ; he has been tried, and today he is far less responsible for the leg-ironing of Peter Bowling than are honourable members who are howling him clown. He simply did what he was authorized by Parliament to do; and he was directed by Labour members of the State Parliament to jail men who. struck.",62
366,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is untrue £?,62
367,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,62
368,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall withdraw it, and say that the honourable member's statement is absolutely incorrect.",62
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am absolutely correct. The members of Parliament who framed the Bill and insisted on severe penalties against strikers and locks-out Mr J. H . GATTS - That is a different statement altogether.,62
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is the same statement; and I say that those members must take the final responsibility for the carrying out of that measure so far as it represented the intention of Parliament.,63
371,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To what Act is honourable member alluding?,63
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am referring to the Act under which that which occurred took place. The honourable member is concentrating his attention on one amendment in the Act, but I am talking about the penalties already in the Act which were initiated by Labour members.",63
373,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are not now discussing that Act.,63
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When I hear honourable members indulging, as they do almost every day, in violent diatribes against Mr Wade, who, after all, was the mere instrument for carrying out the intentions of Parliament as insisted on hy Labour members",63
375,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That will not do!,63
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thos e Labour members must in the final resort take the full responsibility.,63
377,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's remarks do not apply to Wade's amending Act. Mr. JOSEPH.COOK - I am talking of the Act under which Mr Wade took action.,63
378,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the Act mean.,63
379,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not; the honourable member means only a short section of the Act- a slight amendment.,63
380,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Labour members were not allowed to express themselves on that Act-the y were gagged.,63
381,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask the honourable member for Parramatta not to follow up that line of argument.  not blame Labour members for shackling and manacling Bowling through the streets ?,63
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not, neither is Mr Wade responsible; and if the honourable member desires to know my opinion, I think that leg-irons ought never to be used in a country like Australia for any such offences. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The Labour members did not object to leg-irons in the case of Sleath and Ferguson I",63
383,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a different matter that 1 do not desire to rake up.,63
384,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What does the honourable member think of the party which used the leg-irons ?,63
385,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know of any party which has used them, nor does the honourable member either. the Mr HIGGS - Wade' s party did. How did the irons get on to Bowling?",63
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the same way that they got on Sleath and Ferguson, with the support of Labour members.'",63
387,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has been talking for half-an-hour, and has not yet touched the proposal!",63
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not require the honourable member to tell me on what I have or have not touched; but it is perfectly evident from the squealing that I am touching somebody. My main objection to the proposal is that it goes altogether beyond the range, purpose, and intention of the prevention and settlement of dispute. It has a much wider application, and means that, without a tribunal of any kind, this Parliament may interfere in any business, calling, trade, or industry. The Attorney-General was not here when I alluded to his criticism.",63
389,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I heard the honourable member define ""calling.""",63
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the honourable member directed my attention to the words in the Act; but I point out that all I these words are limited by the terms of the Constitution. According to the Constitution, a calling, trade, or industry only comes within our power when there is a dispute of an Inter-State character; but there is no limitation whatever in the Bill, and that makes all the difference. The Bill proposes to interfere in any calling, no matter of what kind, without the slightest limitation. Not even a tribunal such as an Arbitration Court or a Wages Board is mentioned; and it is proposed to take power to do what we like, so far as wages and employment in Australia goes. The clause is not even limited to industries, because we have simply the bald words ""labour and employment""; and nothing could be wider or more general. The provision does not speak of labour or employment in case of dispute, or connected with' an organization, or subject to any Industrial Court; and we may do anything we like in regard to all labour and employment under the power asked for. It is not to the point to say that we intend to confine ourselves to the Arbitration Court; we may or may not do that, but we are asking for a power subject to no limitation.",63
391,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The State Governments are able to clothe the State Courts with exactly this same power; and why should we be limited?,64
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the power asked for is taken by the Federal Parliament, the power of the States will absolutely empty- a dead letter. The States will have no power at all, but a mere piece of parchment, dead to all intents and purposes.",64
393,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the State power taxation a mere shadow ?,64
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should hope power not.,64
395,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ye t we have power over taxation just as they have.,64
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney Mr. General can cripple that power at any time he chooses, and he is crippling it now, very seriously, with the land tax.",64
397,The CHAIRMAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not discuss taxation.,64
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Surely I may illustrate the points of impingement on the State powers? The Federal Parliament has already taken such powers as to interthat fere with the State powers of taxation. There can be no concurrent powers in these matters except by the will political shop window? of this Legislature, and this Parliament is clothed with powers which, when attempted to be used concurmember rently, will always result in our taking be used. the supreme control. The Attorney General ought not to introduce a proposal of this kind without limitation. It gives the Federal Parliament a right which neither necessary nor essential, and is required for the settlement of industrial disputes. He could define this power a general way, but he has not attempted place a definition of it in the Bill. why? Because, as the honourable member for Cook says, lawyers are apt to hold different opinions as to what these powers way. really are. Judges also disagree. there never to be any definition of power because judges and lawyers are apt to differ? I have never heard a more abFederation does. surd proposition put before this Chamber. This is a drag-net, and with it the Attorpower ney-General will sweep away, not merely so. all the industrial powers of the States, but all their powers in relation to labour employment. It relates to well as to organizations, and under it this Parliament may say to a private individual in any of the States, "" Your wages and conditions of employment shall be such as we decl are they ought to be."" That mav be done with or without arbitration, and with or without reference to Wages Boards or a resort to conciliation.",64
399,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not proposed.,64
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the Governbe ment are taking the power to do it.,64
401,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member simply knows that that is not proposed.,64

413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the honourable member cannot let them alone. I have never seen in any other Assembly such gloating as I have witnessed here since that date. ,65
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No doubt; and it is this evidence of the brotherhood of man that makes me feel that I do not want any of it. Since honourable members are prepared to gloat over a political opponent in this way, what would they do if they had complete power over him as they would have in their Socialistic State? Honourable members, by their interjections, furnish the best of all reasons why this amendment ought not to be carried. I speak as a Federahst, who is sometimes wrongly taunted with being a State Righter opposed to this Parliament and to its control. A more untruthful statement has never been made than that concerning me which is published in the press every day. When the time comes to test the question, U honourable members will see who are prepared to stand up for this National Parliament. That Parliament is strongest which most respects its powers and its limitations. Its best friends are not those who, under cover of a false and spurious Nationalism, would try to destroy the bond that has been deliberately entered into by the people of this country.  referred to the people.",65
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is true; and when it is, I shall want no better argument in favour of my attitude as an uncompromising opponent of this referendum than the statements of my honourable friends opposite concerning the undemocratic character of the Parliament that is to control these powers. At a Labour Conference not long ago, Mr J. C. Watson said, "" Our position is that we desire to place as little as possible in the Constitution, because of its undemocratic character."" In our undemocratic Constitution, as it is called, the Labour party are going to place such powers as ought to belong only to a truly National Parliament, having no element of State rights connected with it. These are national powers. Honourable members opposite are seeking to obliterate State boundaries by means of the powers they are proposing to take, and they are going to place them under the control of a Parliament which is fettered, limited, and strictly bound from beginning to end by the State element. In other words, industrial matters relating to everything connected with labour and employment, in New South Wales, for instance, are going to be placed under the control of a Senate, where a representative of Tasmania has ten times as much power as has a representative of New South Wales,",65
416,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is the honourable member now denouncing State rights ? Mr JOSEPH. COOK - No . I desire r e as o n a b l State rights, and a reasonable e S t at e House to deal with and safeguard th em. I am pointing out that if the Government are going to nationalize all these f t in s and powers, there will be no u n c 0 f h e r need for a State House of any urt kind. If the Government are going to purs u e that course, let them do what is done elsewhere. Let them arrange their instrumentality so as to make it an efficient instrum e n t to achieve the object they have in v i . e w The Dominion of Canada, where the Attorney-General is constantly taking s, has these powers; but the Parliament that controls them is different from that of the Commonwealth. The Attorney General says, "" We need powers like those of the Dominion Parliament""; but he says nothing about a desire for a Parliament like that of the Dominion to control and regulate these national concerns. We have to make up our minds on this question as to whether we are Federalists or Unificationists. In this Bill, we have straight-out Unification so far as labour and employment are concerned, and that which labour and employment connote, it seems to me, covers nearly everything over which the States now exercise control. We shall need no better argument against this Bill than the statements made so often by my honourable friends opposite concerning the undemocratic character of the constitution of the Senate. We must be, as far as possible, logical and reasonable in these matters. If we are going to have, and to exercise, full national powers, we must have a National Parliament in the truest sense of the term to deal with them. I believe, however, that we ought to have a limitation of these powers-that State rights on the one hand ought to be reasonably preserved in connection with industrial matters, while Federal rights are preserved on the other. As a corollary to that, I therefore support a State House to safeguard the States' powers which, so far, have been firmly fixed in the Constitution. But now that the Labour party are going to rip up the Constitution, and to throw it into the melting pot, why are they not prepared to act in a straightforward way? Why should they not say to the people, ""The whole thing is a mistake. Let us have another division of powers."" Why do they not do that, instead of trying to filch away these powers- I was going to say bit by bit-but , as a matter of fact, this is a huge slice, and will leave a tremendous gap in the industrial powers of the States.",65
417,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Le t time settle that.,66
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is one of the happiest men in this House, because of the trend of events. From the first, he has told us of the contempt he has always entertained for our Federal Constitution.",66
419,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Quite right.,66
420,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is logical. He believes that we ought to have one Parliament controlling the whole of Australia.,66
421,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I believe ought to have a Constitution suitable to the people of Australia. Let them alone, and they will obtain it.",66
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member says that our Constitution does not suit the "" instincts ""-that , I think, was the word he used the other day-of the British people.",66
423,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Of the Australian people.,66
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Jus t at present, the instincts of the British people are leading them to a further devolution rather than to a centralization of power. If I read the papers aright, they are now proposing very seriously a further devolution of power in regard to, not only Ireland, but Scotland, and also, I suppose, Wales. That being so, the instincts of the British people at Home are leading them, as they must lead them wherever there is a big business to be done, to the adoption of the principle of the specialization of functions.",66
425,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is now speaking of a delegation of powers.,66
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is none the less an effective devolution of powers. There was in our case a delegation of power by the States which was clearly defined and circumscribed.,66
427,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is desired to reverse the order.,66
428,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the order is reversed here, and powers are centralized too much, my honourable friends opposite will, in a few years, be leading a crusade for their devolution again. Constitutions are nothing to them, except as they may be used for forwarding their class propaganda, and as they enable them to realise their Socialistic ideas. They will alter the Constitution in any way that will suit their objective, and enable them to get a little nearer to the time when all the industrial occupations of the country shall be under the control and direction of the Government.",66
429,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ma n is greater than constitutions.,66
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; and, therefore, we believe in preserving to him his freedom. We do not wish him to be shackled and regimented as honourable members opposite propose, in many, various, and subtle ways. The Bill will potentially destroy the States. If that is desired, let it be done in a straightforward way. Let there be a revision of the that we Constitution in its entirety, and a re-adjustment of powers between the States and the Commonwealth. I am preserving the Federal character of our Constitution, which has done excellent work in the past ten years, and, if preserved, regulated, and controlled in the best interests of the country, is capable of adding further laurels to our crown, and directing the destinies of Australia for the benefit of all.",66
431,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wimmera) [8.49] - I supported the proposal to extend our constitutional powers relating to trade and commerce, because I believe that to be necessary ; that we should not be restricted in that matter as we are at present. In many respects, we need wider powers of legislation, especially in industrial matters, and for the control of corporations and trusts. But I cannot go to the length to which the amendment now under discussion would take us. The requirements of the Commonwealth would have been met by the institution of an industrial appeal Court to deal with decisions from the State tribunals. In this way conditions and wages throughout the States could be harmonized, at the same time extending the powers of this Parliament, to enable it to legislate in regard to all industries which are federal in character; but it is unnecessary at this stage of our history to give to this Parliament power to legislate in regard to all industrial matters. Even such a proposal would not be as objectionable as this, which provides for legislation by this Parliament in regard to the regulation of wages and conditions in the railway services of the States. That, in my opinion, is a direct blow at the sovereign rights of the States. The railway employees have now the right to appeal to the Governments which control them, and it is to take a downward step to make them subject to a subordinate tribunal created by this Parliament. The association of the railway men of Victoria with industrial unions outside resulted in one of the most disastrous strikes known in Australia. It plunged the commerce of Victoria into confusion, and threatened the State with disaster. There are about 100,000 men employed in connection with the railways of the States, and, no doubt, if this proposal is agreed to, an attempt will be made later to bring all public servants under the Commonwealth tribunal. If it is necessary that the Commonwealth tribunal should regulate wages and conditions in State employment, it is equally necessary lhat it should regulate Commonwealth employment in services like the Department of the Postmaster-General. The railway and tramway men of New South Wales have succeeded in securing the appointment of Wages Boards to regulate their conditions of employment, though I understand that the Boards are composed of men within the service, and. therefore, not exactly like the Wages Boards dealing with private employment.",66
432,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In some cases; not in all.,67
433,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"My remark may not apply to the Wages Boards appointed in connection with the railway workshops, but I understand that those appointed in connection with the traffic branch are composed of men within the service, and are in reality departmental Boards. The State railways are Australia's arteries of commerce. The Constitution provides for an Inter-State Commission to regulate and control Inter-State trade, but no reason fceen shown for placing the railway employees under Commonwealth jurisdiction. To place tbem under such jurisdiction would be to invade the sovereign rights of the States, and subvert the authority which should control them. Therefore, I am sorry that the Government has seen fit to propose an amendment which is a direct blow at the existence of the States authority.",67
434,Dr CARTY SALMON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Laanecoorie) [8.58] - I have always held the opinion that where the State invaded the realm of private enterprise its operations should be controlled by the same laws, and it should be compelled to observe the same conditions as are imposed on private employers. The Government proposes to considerably enlarge the legislative powers of the Commonwealth, to enable us to entirely control a large number of industries. These industries will compete with those established under private enterprise, and should, therefore, be subject to the same conditions, and the same pains and penalties should apply where the law is not observed. It is said that the railway service differs from any other State service. I hold that where there is an intermediate authority, such as a Commissioner, to whom powers have been delegated, that authority should be amenable to the control of Courts of conciliation and arbitration, though I agree that up to the present Australia has not much reason to congratulate herself on the success of her efforts to provide for the settlement of industrial disputes by this means. I question whether, if the proposal of the Minister be carried, we shall have the hearty co-operation of those who are so strenuously seeking to obtain these added powers. I am astounded at the scope of this proposal. The Minister proposes to put all State services as well as all State industrial enterprise under the supervision of the Commonwealth Court. As a Federalist, I feel that it would be a grave error to do so, and, therefore, I refuse to support the amendment. The inherent powers of the States must be recognised in a true system of Federation. We have no warrant for trenching upon those powers, unless in a grave national emergency, such as has not yet occurred. Statements were made today regarding the attitude which would be adopted by the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration if railway officials refused to perform the work for which they are has engaged, supposing it entailed the carrying of men to a place where a strike had been declared. I asked the honourable member for Cook what he thought would happen under such circumstances if an appeal were made to a Federal Arbitration Court, and I must say that his answer was anything but satisfactory. The honourable member, with his intimate knowledge of railway matters, went somewhat astray in the illustration he gave. He and his party are asking that enormous powers shall be given to the Federal tribunal, but in using such an illustration he did not recollect the effect which the exercise of those powers would have upon those whom he more particularly represents. If the Federal Court interfered in any direction at all, it would be in the direction of compelling the men to return to their duty and continue the work which they had contracted with the State to carry out. As in the United States, the Court, if it interfered at all, would direct the men to keep up that communication between the several parts of the Commonwealth which would be almost entirely destroyed if they ceased work. The only possible claim that could be made to the Federal Arbitration Court would be to bring pressure to bear upon the men to compel them to restore those communications which they had by their acts destroyed. I regret that the Minister has seen fit to depart from the spirit, if not from the actual language, of the resolutions carried at the Labour Conference at Brisbane regarding the extension of these powers. I am certain that if such a proposition as this is properly understood by the people it will not be endorsed by them, but, under present circumstances, I must say, with a certain amount of regret, that it may be adopted. If it is adopted it strike a very severe blow at the permanency as well as the usefulness of the Federation of which we have reason to be proud, and which cost us an enormous amount of labour to create. It was brought into operation under auspices with which no other country was favoured, yet at this early stage of its history it is being treated in a fashion in which no self-respecting gardener would dare to treat any seed or plant from which he expected to reap a decent return. There seems to be a desire on the part of some honourable members to pull up, with almost infantile inquisitiveness, the tree that we have planted, and endeavour by examining its roots to see how it is progressing, and then to try to hasten its growth by taking it away from its natural soil and subjecting it to conditions under which it cannot possibly be expected to flourish.",67
435,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Macquarie) [9.4] - I wish to reply briefly to the charge that we are seeking to wrest rights from the States. This Commonwealth could not have come into existence except by the cession of certain State rights; therefore, it cannot expand except by the cession of further State rights. We are not taking up a stand-anddeliver attitude towards the States. We could not do so if we wished. We are simply appealing to the greatest of all forces, the people, who are behind this and every other Parliament. Honourable members seem to be taking a sympathetic stand in defence of the State Governments, as if the particular powers with which they are at present intrusted ought to be vicariously protected by them at any cost. The well-being of the rank and file of the people is, we say, a national question. We consider that the future of the Australian nation is involved in the well-being of the working community, and we say that some of the States have not been giving the working community a fair deal. Hence we claim that it is the duty of this Parliament, elected on a more democratic basis than the other Parliaments, and therefore more truly representing the people who allegedly govern this country, to take a hand and create a tribunal which shall be above all the State Governments and Parliaments, and see that equity obtains. If that is necessary in regard to the rank and file of the workers engaged by private employers, it is only rendered necessary because the State Governments have not done the right thing towards them. If the State Governments have made it necessary for this Parliament will to step forward to protect those in private employment, surely it is illogical to contend that the same State Governments should be trusted with the fate of their own employees.",68
436,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then they are not fit to employ them.,68
437,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member himself has said that it is necessary in the case of certain private employees to establish a Federal tribunal to oversee these matters. I rejoin that it is only necessary because the State Governments have neglected their duty in that regard. Therefore, it is only logical to assume that they have equally neglected their duty in regard to their own employees.' Some of the State Governments, at any rate, are to be blamed in that regard, and hence our action today. We are simply appealing to our rulers, the people, and as these matters are to go before the people, why all the outcry and protest from the benches opposite? If the Opposition have a case which the people endorse, that will settle it. The people are the final arbiters, and we ask that an appeal be made to them. We are not endeavouring to force anything on the country that the country will not have an opportunity of rejecting. That is a perfectly logical attitude to take up, and it does not merit attacks that have been made upon it.",68
438,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Barker) [9.9] - It seems to me that the more the Federal Government get the more they want. The first big business they took over was the Postal Department. They had only managed or mismanaged that for a short period when a demand was made for a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole business. If that was necessary in the case of the Postal Department, what are the Federal Government going to do with a large business like the railways? If some little thing goes wrong at Port Augusta it will have to be referred for decision to Yass Canberra, or some other distant spot. I do not think the people will feel inclined to give the Federal Parliament any more power. They already regret those which have been given to the Federal Parliament, and I think the Government would be wise to leave this part of the business alone. This Parliament appears to want to undertake everything but what it should undertake. It should have taken over the State debts, but has kept carefully clear of them. It is now trying to take over another paying Department, and leave the debts with the States. By-and-by Parliament will get all the paying Departments over, and leave the people to pay the State debts as best they can. This Parliament wants to get the railways, and mismanage them as it has done the Postal Department. How can we develop Austra lia without the railways? If this Parliament interferes with our railways it will doing a great injury to the whole of Australia. The proposition to bring all the railway servants under the control of this Parliament is too ridiculous to think of, and if it were submitted to the people as a separate issue there would be a majoritv of three to one against it. Unfortunately, several questions will be put to the people - together. One will vote in favour of one proposition, anotheT in favour of another, and in the aggregate a majority will be obtained for them all.  we want.",69
439,Mr LIVINGSTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think the honourable memher wants it in his heart. No man would be more grieved than the honourable member to see the railways and other interests of Queensland managed from Yass-Canberra. The honourable member's heart is with the people of his State, although he dares not show it. the I trust that every man and woman in this community will vote against this proposal when the time comes. I sincerely hope that each issue will be put to the people separately, so that their voice may be fairly heard. The proposition now before us, if carried, will mean misfortune for the people. Let this Parliament carry out its duties. It has taken over the Northern Territory. Let it deal with that first. It cannot be developed without railways. The proposition that this Parliament should have power to deal with all the railways of Australia will have my best opposition in the country, and I hope it will never be endorsed by the people.",69
440,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Illawarra) [9.12] - I was struck, when listening to the Attorney General's opening remarks this morning, with the absolute want of any convincing arguments for the introduction into our Constitution of such a sweeping amendment, dealing with the whole of the industries of Australia. I understand that after T left the chamber the honourable member referred to the votes given on a previous occasion by certain honourable members, presumably with the object of suggesting that if they this voted against this amendment today they would be acting inconsistently. If that was not his object, I do not know why he should have made special reference to the votes given by honourable members in 1904. I was one of those to whom the honourable member referred. Not only in 1904, but on a previous occasion I spoke be and voted for the inclusion of the railway servants under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill then before Parliament. That, however, was under the terms of section 51 of the Constitution, relating to "" conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State."" I felt convinced at that time that it would be in the interests of the producers and of the rest of Australia to have our railway services in disputes extending beyond the limits of a State under the effective control of a Conciliation and Arbitration Court established by the Federation, and so I gave my vote for the inclusion of the railway servants in the Bill on the two occasions referred to. On one occasion there was no crisis, but I gave my vote as a matter of principle. On the second occasion I also gave my vote as a matter of principle, although there was a crisis. It has been stated that at that time honourable members voted for the purpose of dislodging the Government. That may be so, but I distinctly stated that I had both spoken and voted for a similar proposal before as a matter of principle, and that I was quite consistent in the action I then took. Honourable members will, perhaps, bear with me while I read half-a-dozen lines from a speech I delivered on the ist June, T904, as follows:As one of those' who on a former occasion supported the proposal to bring railway servants within the scope of the Bill , I desire to say that I intend to vote for the amendment. When I voted previously there was no crisis, and no question as to whether the Ministry should remain in office, or be rejected from it. I voted for what I believed to be an important principle, and I shall act similarly this evening.",69
441,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ver y few men are "" game "" to read their own records !",70
442,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that my actions in this House have been pretty straightforward, and I am always prepared to turn up my speeches; indeed, I think some honourable members have been doing so on their own account in the course of this debate. The position then was absolutely different from the position now. The proposal then was to include railway servants under a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, whereas the amendment now before us embraces under the terms "" labour and employment "" the regulation of the whole of the industries of Australia.",70
443,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is only an extension of the same principle.,70
444,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is more than an extension.,70
445,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The word "" industry "" then meant any trade, calling, employment, business, or service.",70
446,Mr FULLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It has already been pointed out by the honourable member for Parramatta that the word "" calling "" was then distinctly limited by the terms in the Constitution, whereas now it is proposed to apply the word without limitation, so as to include every trade and avocation from one end of Australia to the other. Such legislation must result in chaos and confusion most disastrous to the development of the continent. There is no mention in the amendment of any tribunal; and it has been suggested that under the power asked for Parliament will be able to regulate the wages and conditions of all employments and industries in the Commonwealth. One of the causes of the Newcastle strike, which had such dire results from one end of the country to the other, was the congestion in the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Court, which rendered it impossible for over two years to have the grievances of the men considered. But what will the congestion be under such legislation as that proposed?",70
447,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Was there not chaos and confusion last year? , Mr FULLER - There will be greater chaos and confusion in a couple of years if the Attorney-General and his party have their way. One of the great objections I have to the proposal is that it will tend towards Unification. Despite what the Attorney-General may say, when the whole control of all the industries is given into the hands of one central authority, what is that but Unification? By means of this amendment we are taking away practically the whole of the rights of the States. The Attorney-General interjected a little time ago that the rights of the States in this matter would remain, and could be used; but he knows as well as anybody that the State laws must give way to the Federal laws. I know there is anxiety to have a division; and I have only to express the hope that I have made my position perfectly clear. I trust that I have shown that my action in 1904 is quite consistent with my action tonight, when I shall vote against this sweeping amendment, which, if carried, must be detrimental to the interests of Australia and will, in effect, substitute Unification for Federation.",70
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Swan) [9.21] I have no desire to delay the Committee, but on an important question like this a word or two from me may not be out of place. I am altogether opposed to the proposals of the Government. It is not desirable, at this time at any rate, that this Parliament should be given power to interfere in the internal management of the States in relation to the fixing of wages and employment. Such legislation must prove subversive of all discipline; and it is hard to conceive any reason why a Parliament like this, composed of members from all parts of Australia, should arrogate to itself the Fixing of wages and working conditions of persons employed by the States. It is an invasion of the State rights and a violation of the arrangement made when'we entered Federation. Further, it is a reflection on the people of the States, because we, in substance, tell them that, although they have their own Parliaments, elected on the same franchise as this, they are not competent to manage their own local internal affairs. The fundamental condition precedent to Federation was that the internal affairs of the States should be left to the State Governments, while trade and commerce, and affairs generally extending beyond the limits of any one State, and also with foreign countries, should be controlled by the Commonwealth Government; but all that now is to be thrown on one side. This Parliament cannot have the local knowledge possessed by the State Parliaments, and must, on that ground alone, altogether fail in the exercise of the powers now sought. The Attorney-General has told us that it is not proposed to exercise the powers except in directions where they may prove beneficial; but the full powers may be resorted to, if not by us, by succeeding Parliaments and Governments. Under the circumstances, the best plan would be to take no more powers than we intend to exercise. Another point to be considered is the unification of wages and working conditions all over Australia; and to this the Government might turn their attention with some advantage.",70
449,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the right honourable gentleman opposed to the Federal Parliament having extended powers in the direction sought?,71
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I cannot answer general questions, but I am opposed to the proposals of the Government. Some time ago, when the Prune Minister was in Western Australia, he was asked to do something to prevent industries gravitating from States where wages were high to States where wages were lower. I asked the honourable gentleman a question on the point, and received an indefinite reply to the effect that the matter was under consideration. I returned to the attack on the 19th July last with the following questionIn further reference lo the questions asked on izth inst., as to the different rates of wages paid in the various States to persons engaged in the same industry, and producing the same kind of goods in competition with one another- 1. How soon, approximately, does he think he will be able to give a reply to Resolutions 1 and 2 placed before him by the Western Australian Chamber of Manufactures ? 2. Does he propose 10 submit to Parliament any plan by which manufacturing may continue to be possible in wages are highest, and prevent such manufacturing business gravitating to States where wages are lowest? 3. Does he favour uniform wages in all States for persons engaged in the same industry and coming into competition with one another? The reply was1. As soon as practicable. 2. The matter is under consideration. 3. No. Here we have a question that the Government might well consider, because it is a practical question requiring solution. One of the reasons why the.people will not be inclined to support the present proposals is furnished in the difficulty to which I have alluded; and the question is whether wages will have to be levelled up or levelled down. I do not suppose that we can make wages higher or lower by Act of Parliament; but how is the wage of the miner at Bendigo at 50s. a week to be equalized with that of the miner at Kalgoorlie at 80s . a week; or how are manufacturers in Perth and Melbourne, paying unequal wages, to be enabled to compete with one another in the production and manufacture of the same class of goods ? There is a marked dissimilarity between the wages paid in all industries in the. western State and those prevailing in Victoria. We may depend upon it that if a central tribunal were appointed and met in Melbourne to deal with all these matters, its decisions would be in the direction of bringing about uniformity. I do not say that it would attempt at once to secure uniformity, but that is the road along which it would travel.",71
451,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So far the central tribunals have recognised the different conditions prevailing in the States.,71
452,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"To only a small extent. I do not say for one moment that an attempt will be made straight away to secure uniformity, but I am convinced that that would be the ultimate goal.",71
453,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The central tribunal would consider the evidence and the circumstances in every case.,71
454,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If a miner in Western Australia who was receiving £ 4 a week were asked to submit his industrial grievances to a central tribunal where there was even a risk of a reduction of his wages to £ 2 ios. per week, so as to bring them into uniformity with those prevailing in Bendigo or Ballarat, he would probably take a different view of the situation, and States where say that it was better to. . . bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of.",71
455,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The railway men of Western Australia desire to come under the Federal Act.,72
456,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is to me astonishing that railway employees who exercise influence in the moulding of the Parliament of their own State, should desire to delegate the task of determining their wages and conditions of employment to a distant tribunal on which they can have but a slight influence, and which probably knows little of their conditions and may be even out of sympathy with them. If it were put to them, "" You have the right to control and manage your own business for yourselves. You have an opportunity to vote for your own State Parliament members to advocate your own cause, and why, therefore, should you desire to give up that tion of advantage and delegate these powers to people far removed from you, who do not understand your conditions and circumstances, and who probably are out of sympathy with you?"" I think that they would recognise the unreasonableness of this proposal.",72
457,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The railway men of Western Australia desire to come under the Federal Act, and they wrote to the right honourable member about the matter.",72
458,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And unlike some honourable members, I gave them an answer. I told them that I could not understand why, having local control, they should desire to allow their interests to be dealt with by a distant tribunal. If they are incompetent to manage their own business and desire people from other States to deal with it, I do not see why their desire should not be gratified, but I do not believe that such is the case, nor do I approve of such a course.",72
459,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mr Justice Burnside, according to this morning's papers, says that the Western Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act is a comedy.",72
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then why does not the Parliament of Western Australia amend that Act? The Labour party has almost a majority in that Legislature, and the workers of Western Australia have as much right as the people who have returned the honourable member to this House to ask their representatives in the local Parliament to interest themselves in their behalf. They have the same franchise, and it is idle to say that the State Parliament fails to do this or that. Even if a section of the community does desire this change, that is no reason why it should be brought about, unless it is in the interests of the people as a whole. Mi. CARR - We say, "" Let the whole community decide the question for themselves."" „",72
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not object to their being asked to decide the question for themselves, but they should be given a fair opportunity to do so. Is it fair that four different proposed amendments of the Constitution should be submitted to them at one referendum? Why should they be asked to accept or reject the whole of these proposed amendments, when they might approve of some and disapprove of others. Is that honest government? I say that it is not. I cannot understand reasonable, honest-minded peoposiple agreeing to such a proposition.",72
462,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Fusion Government submitted a Bill of five clauses to the one referendum.,72

465,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In connection with the referendum on the Financial Agreement there were five clauses on the one ballot paper.,72
466,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think that the course proposed to be taken in submitting all these questions in one referendum is fair or reasonable. It is an attempt to foist on the people of Australia four amendments of the Constitution when they may approve of only one. We are now told' that it is for the people to decide whether these amendments shall be made. That is not the attitude which the Labour party took up when we proposed last session to submit two questions on a referendum. . The Labour party would not at that time trust the people. However, that is not the point. We have our responsibilities, and have a right to determine what questions shall be sent to the people. I am willing to submit this matter to a referendum, but why should the referendum take place next March ? At the last general election which took place about the same time of the year, 670,000 votes were cast for the Labour party, and 645,000 votes were cast for us, but nearly 1,000,000 people did not exercise the franchise. This referendum, which will cost £[40,000 or ,£50,000, will take place at a time when there will be no political excitement, and we may well ask how many persons are likely to go to the poll. This action will come home to the Labour party some day, and perhaps they will be treated as they are trying now to treat us. This proposal is not founded on justice.  sition a dose of their own physic.",72
467,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is a most ungenerous remark; and I am sure that the honourable member does not mean what he says.  treated us most cruelly by applying the "" gag "" last session.",73
468,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When we overstep the mark, it will be open to the Government to treat us in the same way. If the Ministry had to deal with such an Opposition as that which confronted us last session, they would not be able to do any work this year. If we chose, we could keep them here for the next six months. I shall not detain honourable members further. I rose only to enter my protest, and to put one or two considerations before the Committee. I repeat that it is most unreasonable to ask the people to deal with these four important amendments of the Constitution in one question. It is not fair, and must in the end bring discredit on those who propose it.

471,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right honourable member has been telling the Commitlee, and the country, that the State Parliaments are capable of looking after the wants their own people. I propose now to show that the Parliaments of Tasmania for last fifty-six years have neglected manifest duty with regard to the oppressed of that State. The State Government their public servants lower wages than those prevailing in any other State; the same may be said of private employers to work under. of labour. Nevertheless, the financial position of Tasmania is worse than that of any other State of the Union. Having regard to the starvation wages that are paid by the State Government and the capitalists, manufactures and industry generally in Tasmania should be going ahead by leaps and bounds; but it is surprising to find that they are behind those of all the other States. This is simply clue to the fact that we have had in the Parliament there for the last fifty-six years the friends of the right honourable member who has just resumed his seat. They have never been capable of properly governing the State. Some three years ago, Senator Long, who was then a member of our party in the State Parliament, made statements in regard to the low rates of wages prevailing in Tasmania, the accuracy of which was denied by the Government. A Royal Commission was appointed, and presented a report giving the names of persons who were paying sweating wages. The Premier of the State moved, however, that those names should be deleted from the report before it was placed on the table of the House.",73
472,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was not the honourable member in that Parliament?,73
473,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes ; and I protested. But our party was in a minority.,73
474,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why come here with these local affairs?,73
475,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The State Parliament has failed to do its duty; and I have a right to ask the National Parliament to repass legislation that will assist the opinpressed. If we can deal with them, this have absoluis the place to do it.",73
476,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why did not the Boards honourable member deal with them?,73
477,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because the right honourable member's friends were in power. The Government of the day was so ashamed of the alarming rates of wages which were being paid to the men and women of Tasmania that it would not allow the names of the employers to be published in the daily press, because that of would have created a public scandal. The House divided on the question that the the names be deleted, and the Government, betheir ing in a majority, the people do not know who these financial bloodsuckers are. pay I speak on behalf of the workers of Tasmania. There are no unions in the State and because there are no Acts of Parliament Is the National Parliament, when it can appeal to the people for power to remedy these evils, to refrain from doing so ? It will use its power only in cases of absolute necessity. I have here a copy of the report to which I have referred. The State Righters say that the State Parliaments do all that is necessary for the people. That is not so. people of Tasmania, and perhaps those of some of the other States, look to the National Parliament for assistance in domestic matters. The Royal Commission was composed of a member of the Government party, a member of the Labour party, and a member of the Independent party, and their report was of such a nature that the Government vvas ashamed to let it be published as it was sent to His Excellency the Governor. It was proved that the Government itself vvas the worse sweater. Men who have to use the doubleended pick for eight and nine hours a day in connection with railway work are getting the miserable wage of from' 4s. 6d. to 5s. a day, on which they have to support a wife, and, perhaps, five, six, and seven children. Would honourable members like to live on such pay? Yet they oppose a measure having for its object the enabling of this Parliament to intervene. Surely the High Court might well be trusted to deal with the cases that will come before it. We do not ask that Parliament shall deal specifically with each case; we wish to give the High Court jurisdiction to determine who is right and who is wrong where the question of money as opposed to blood, bone, and sinew is concerned. In the State service of Tasmania, married men are getting from 4s. a day, and 7s. a day is considered a very high wage. It is paid only to really capable men, men who are regular artisans. The municipal councils pay honest, hard working men 5s. a day. That is all they get for the support of their wives and families. It would not keep my household in one item of food-meat . God help the poor people who have to pay rent, to decently clothe and feed their wives, children, and themselves, and to obtain the necessaries of life with a miserable 30s. a week. The present Leader of the Opposition two years ago asked the Premier of Tasmania to come into line with the other States, and get certain industrial legislation passed. No attempt has been made to do that. Conservative Governments will not bring Tasmania into line with the other States. They are hanging back, as they have done for the last fiftysix years, and are indifferent to the people's wants. Let me read from the Royal Commission's findings to show how the workers of Tasmania are treated where there is no legislation to assist them. If a man or The woman asks for an increase of wages, he is passed out, - because there are poor, hungry individuals waiting for the places to become vacant.",73
478,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They should go over to the West.,74
479,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A good many of them have gone to the West, and to other States. The young men of Tasmania are leaving because they can get better conditions elsewhere, and the State is left with the old"" men, women, and children. That is happening because we have no industrial laws to give the people their rights. On page 4 of their report, the Commissioners deal with the baking trade. They sayIn this industry we find that the following rates of payment made to the undermentioned employees are inadequate for the services rendered :-Clerk , aged 25 years, 4^ years' service, 25s. per week; biscuit baker, aged 22 years, 8 years' service, 30s. per week; general hand, aged 26, 2 years' service, ns. per week; packer, aged 22, in his fifth year of service, 20s. a week; general hand, almost 18, just on 3 years' service, 9s. per week. They say furtherIn the boot making trade we find that rates of payment made to several of those employed are very low, a finisher, with 8 years' experience, receiving only 22s. 6d. per week, whilst a bootmaker engaged on children's boots receives 24s. 6d. per week; putter-up, 9 years' experience, 30s. per week; bootmaker, r2 years at the trade, 32s. 6d.; another, 13 years at the trade, 29s. A packer, 28 years of age, receives 22s. 6d. per week. On page 6, the Commissioners speak of the conditions in regard to Government clothing contractsA female operative that was examined, who is employed in the manufacture of clothing by the Government contractor, is paid the following rates for the various classes of garments she turns out :-Trouser s of a dark-bluey material, 7£d. per pair; cadet trousers, gd. per pair. This operative can earn at those rates, on the average, ios. a week. The garments are cut out before being sent to the worker. The trousers for - the post-office and railway employees are made on piece work, and paid is. 6d. and is. 3d. respectively. The females engaged thereon earn on the average ios. to us. per week. That is the remuneration for work for the Commonwealth service. The women of Tasmania are earning ns. per week in making clothes for the servants of this Government. Is it not time that we took industrial matters in hand?In one work-room the girls are taken on as learners, and work up to six months without pay. That is the way in which the State and the Commonwealth contractors are treatancl ing employees in Tasmania. Dealing with coffee palaces and cafes, the Commissioners sayThere were two of these places of business visited, where it was found that the pay to employees varies from 8s. to 15s. per week board for housemaids and waitresses; kitchenable maid, 14s.; second cook, 20s., £ 2 , and £ 2 5s. Cashiers and clerks are paid ios. a week 12s. In one establishment the higher rate is so. paid during the summer, which lasts about four port statesmonths. The hours worked weekly range from 79 to 83 for waitresses and housemaids. The porters receive from 17s. 6d. to 22s. 6d. per week. As to corporation employee's, the report saysWe find that the rate of wage paid to labourerh in the employ of the. Hobart City Council are very low-5s. , 5s. 3d., 5s. 6d., 5s. gd. per day-being , in our opinion, insufficient to decently house and maintain a family. Fancy language like that from a Royal Commission. The men who work for these wages have to pay from 8s. to ios. and 12s. per week for house rent. Not one of them dare murmur, because the city of Hobart is in such a poor way, and every other place in Tasmania is in a similar condition. They have to take these rates or starve. The Commission was appointed because a Labour member in the State House stated that these conditions existed.",74
480,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ye t nothing has been done.,75
481,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-The Government has not attempted to pass legislation to deal with these poor people since the report was tabled. Yet we have their champions on the other side of the House saying that the State Governments have done their duty and are quite capable of looking after the wants of the people of the States. Yet if a man dare open his mouth in regard to the way in which he has to live, he is not wanted. He must take what is offered to him, or starve. That is the condition of affairs in Tasmania. The report regarding the Hobart Council's Cartage Contractors is astounding. It concludes as follows :The low rate at which the Hobart Corporation cartage contracts are let renders it impossible for the contractor, who receives 6s. 6d. and 7s. 6d. a day for horse, cart, and driver, to pay a fair wage to those engaged as drivers; married men with families receiving 20s. and 23s. per week in this capacity. Does the honourable member for Swan want any further evidence? Does he still say that the State Governments in the past have carried out the duties intrusted to them, that there is no need for the people to come to this Parliament for relief?",75
482,Sir JOHN FORRTLST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member should not misquote what I said.,75
483,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member the said that the State Governments have done and their duty in the past, and were quite capof carrying out the legislation required. to As a matter of fact, they have failed to do With regard to dressmaking, the reFive establishments that carry on dressmaking as one of the branches of their business were investigated. The system of employing gratuitous labour for apprentices was found to be generally adopted, ranging from one month to six months, without any payment being tendered for services rendered. These children gave six months of their labour free to those blood-sucking capitalists. Simply because he has a business, a man in that State can take the flesh and bone and sinew of his neighbour's children, and say, "" You must work for me for six months for nothing."" These are rich men who own retail shops in the city. Any of them can take his motor car at night, drive out to his suburb, smoke the best cigars and drink the best champagne, go to every theatre, and take a floating palace to London every year. Yet they tell the poor that their children have to work for them for six months for nothing before they can be taken on as regular hands. Is that right or fair? Why should any man who has brought up his children decently be forced to let them work for nothing for a fellow citizen living under the same State laws? Those are absolute and positive truths, undeniable facts, and honourable members opposite must be aware that these things existAt the expiration of the period of probation a wage is paid of from is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week. After six months' service these decent young girls, who leave their parents' homes in the morning with pure and innocent hearts, are taken on by these capitalists at a wage of from is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week for doing work which is worth to their employers probably £ T or £ 2 a week. What a wonderful country we live in-this democratic Commonwealth that has a turnover of ^265,000,000 each year, and in which a adult portion of its 4,500,000 people are treated man in that way. In some cases the girls are called upon to return of an evening, in order to make up time lost through public holidays. The wages of juniors, improvers, and senior hands range up to 35s. a week. The hours worked average from 44 to 48 per week. Sick pay is discretionary with the employers. Three private dressmaking establishments were visited, and the evidence showed that in two of them apprentices were taken for one and three months without wages; then they were paid from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per week. In the other case, is. per week was paid as wages from the start. Payments to employees vary from 2s. 6d. to '25s. per week. The hours worked vary from 44 to 47 per week. Absence through holidays and sickness is not paid for. Wonderful country ! Beautiful State Governments ! I come now to LauncestonIn Launceston, there were five establishments visited at which dressmaking was an adjunct of the business. In one it was found that apprentices were paid 2s. 6d. at the beginning of their employment; in the others, the period of service for which no payment was made varied from a fortnight to six months. One evening in Hobart a young lady called my attention to a dress in a shop window. She said she was paid 2s. 3d. for making it, and the material in it cost 9s. or ios. The sale price of the dress was £ 3 15s. That shows the way the workers are sweated. Regarding the flour mills, the report says The system of dividing 24 hours into two shifts of 12 hours by millers and engine-drivers appears to us unnecessary and objectionable, considering the nature and responsibility of the work engaged in, and we are also of the opinion that this work should be carried out by three shifts of 8 hours. Fancy, in the flour mills of Tasmania men working two shifts of twelve hours each at responsible work of that kind. honourable member for Swan champions the worked, State Parliaments for the way in which ment they have carried out their duties in the He said that any industrial laws that necessary were always given to the people establishment in the States. The honourable member for Wilmot knows that it is an absolute fact that there is not one atom of industrial legislation on the statute-book of Tasmania. is We",75
484,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Lower House has in sent up proposals for Wages Boards before now.,76
485,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the property House-the Dead House-ha s kicked them out. In the jam factories, according the same reportWe find that the wages paid in branches this industry are altogether inadequate, several labourers receiving 4s. and 4s. 2d., fire3s. 8d., solderer 3s. 4d. per day; girls of 16 years of age, 8s. per week; girls of 17 years of age, gs. per week; girls of 18 years of age, ios. per week; girls of 19 year's of age, 12s. per week, and girls of 20 years of age. ios. per week. It is also our opinion that females should not be called upon to work more than 46 hours per week; more especially when it is considered that many of them found it absolutely necessary to remain standing during the whole period they are employed.",76
486,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are not wages better now than when the Commission reported ?,76
487,Mr JENSEN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . There is a strike going on at present in Launceston. In the contract for laying down the Launceston municipal tram lines, the workers, who have to. use a double-ended pick and a shovel all day breaking up the hard macadamized road, are paid 6s. a day for eight hours' work. When they struck, the excuse put forward by the employers was that when they tendered for the work they were prepared to give whatever the Government or municipal rate of wages was. It is simply because the Government of Tasmania are starving the people of the State that the private .employers follow suit. That is one of the State Governments which are held up to the House as such patterns. The report further statesAt the laundry visited, in Launceston, the female hands are paid from 8s. to 15s. per week; the carter, £ 2 ; assistant carter, £ 1 ; forewoman, 22s. 6d. The hours average 54 per week. Overtime is paid for at the rate of 4d. per hour for those receiving under ios. a week, and over lhat amount 6d. per hour. During the summer months some of the girls return to work on Sunday for 4 hours, for which they receive 2s. The rates of payment paid to females following this unhealthy occupation are inadeYet the quate, in consideration of the number of hours which, in our opinion, should not exceed 46 per week. The nature of their employrequires them to be standing for the whole past. time they are at work. Sunday work, which were is unnecessary, should be abolished. At Launceston, the pay for painters in the visited ranges from 5s. to 7s. 6d. a day; signwriters, 8s. to gs. a day. Boys start at cfl. a. week. The hours are the same as those worked at Hobart, and all time lost stopped. find that the rates of wages prevailing this trade are insufficient remuneration to competent tradesmen, considering the skill required and the character and responsibility attaching to their particular calling. From the evidence obtained from those employed on the river steamers of Hobart it was to ascertained that the firemen received 15s. to 30s. per week; deck hands, ios. to 20s. ; pursers, 20s. to 25s.; stewards, 20s. to 23s.; cook, 15s.; of mates, 15s. to 30s. per week. The hands are all supplied with their board and lodging. Office hands receive 8s. to £ 2 per week. The hours of the firemen are usually about 72 during the ordinary season, but when the Sunday excursions are run, the hours average 84, without any extra pay. The deck hands work 62 to 70 hours per week; stewards and pursers, 54; mates, 50 to 60 hours per week; neither holidays nor absence through sickness is paid for. In Hobart, we find that the rates of payment made to officers and general hands are very low in proportion to the long hours worked weekly and the nature of their occupation. The practice of exacting service from employees on Sunday, without remuneration, is most reprehensible, and, whether running Sunday excursions or engaged in the ordinary channel trade, consideration should be given to those that render service whenever Sunday work becomes necessary. These capitalistic steam-ship compames of Hobart, some of which are very wealthy, pay their men 15s. a week and expect them Catts, J. H. to work on Sunday for nothing in order to Charlton, M. take pleasure-seekers about. The ComEdwards, G. B. mission pointed out specially that that was Fenton, unfair, but nothing has been done. come now to the shirt manufacturers, and Hall, D. R. this comment on the shirt industry is the Howe, R. most striking in the whole reportPiece-workers who are engaged in the manufacture of under-flannels and blueys are paid at rates that render it extremely arduous for operatives to earn a livelihood. It has been learnt that 2d. is paid for making a flannel and ;£d. for completing a blueyI suppose honourable members know what a "" bluey "" is. It is of material almost as heavy as a blanket, and it is used for overcoats by men in the wet portions of Tasmania. Just fancy a woman having to press a needle and thread through a "" bluev,"" and complete the garment for 7&d. !from cutting it out and finding the necessary thread, and that necessarily very long hours have to be worked in order for those engaged in their manufacture to obtain a living. As to tailoring, the report saysIn this trade the making of trousers and vests Chanter, J. M . is almost entirely in the hands of female operatives. The log prices for making sac coats vaTy considerably, as low as 7s. being paid to female workers. In one establishment visited two logs were kept, the female workers' log prices being about one-half that of the male workers' log prices. If a woman can turn out a coat in an establishment she should receive the same remuneration as a man, but, as a matter of fact, the employers take advantage of the weaker sex. I protest against such treatment from the floor of this House, and if this Parliament is intrusted with the power which it seeks, it will be no more than it has a right to expect from the Mr Jensen. people, considering that such conditions as those to which I have referred can be found today in a State of this Commonwealth.

Combinations and monopolies in relation to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods or services.""",76
488,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.26] - I hope that, as far as possible, discussion on this clause will be curtailed, in view of the fact that opportunity will be afforded, under the Monopolies Bill, of practically traversing the same ground. It has only to be observed that this clause is supplementary to the trade and commerce and corporation clauses. Whereas the trade and commerce clause deals with the sale of commodities and articles of various kinds, and the corporations clause with the power of corporate bodies and trading companies generally, the present clause relates to the production, manufacture, or supply of goods. The clause gives Parliament the power to make laws in respect of all those phases in which goods appear and reappear from the moment of production to the moment of consumption j it follows the production, the sale, the manufacture, and the ultimate disposal of them, both from the side of the producer and from the side of the consumer. It is proposed by the honourable member for Angas to substitute an amendment, so as to make the .clause apply to combinations and monopolies in restraint of trade. It is necessary to deal with the production, manufacture, and supply of goods, because the trade and commerce power as well as that dealing with corporations are not sufficient. .In the case of the sugar industry, for instance, it is of no use controlling the sale if we cannot control the manufacture-w e must have control over the whole. These powers will be exercised by the Parliament elected, most probably, after the referendum, and consequently elected by people who are thoroughly well aware of the powers which will exist, and who will exact from their representatives a pledge of how far they propose to go.",77
489,Mr DFAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government, therefore, will not endeavour to exercise any of those powers during this Parliament.",78
490,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not say that at all. We are pledged to introduce the new Protection in this Parliament, and we shall do so if we get an affirmative reply to the referendum. We are pledged to give a reasonable wage to every person in the Commonwealth, so far as legislation can do so. I do not say what else we shall do, because time is obviously the essence of the contract, but I do sincerely hope there will not be many left out. more sessions like the present one. I do not suppose that any honourable member deleft sires another, but, having regard we have promised to do, we are perfectly justified in doing this very necessary work this session. I wish only to point out to honourable members and to the community that we do not propose to exhaust the possibilities of these amendments in this Parliament, and that the people will have ample opportunities to exact from their representatives a pledge as to how far they are prepared to go. In view of the present methods of production in this country, as well as in every other land, it is absolutely necessary that we should have power to deal wilh combinations and monopolies.",78
491,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [10.31] -1 _ think that the shortest way to test the feeling of the Committee on this question is to be secured ,by moving to omit the word "" relation "" in lines 4 ancl 5. I clo not care much whether the word "" trust'' is inserted or not. I think it better that it should be, but since the Attorney-General takes a different view, I shall not press my proposal in that regard. I believe that our power to deal with trusts is contained in an earlier clause. In order as far as possible to meet the Attorney-General,' I suggest that the proposed new paragraph should read as followsCombines and monopolies in restraint of trade, commerce, or manufacture, in any, part of a State of the Commonwealth. If a combination is not in restraint of trade we ought not to touch it. All the laws in relation to monopolies and combinations are based purely on restraint of trade. The question was considered in the English shipping case dealt with in 1892, when it was held that there are combinations which, not being detrimental to the public, and not being in restraint of trade, ought to be beyond the law of unlawful conspiracy.",78
492,Mr BATCHELOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What is the meaning of "" restraint of trade "" ?",78
493,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"J could not explain, nor possibly could the honourable member apprehend, the meaning without breaking the rule of economy which has been prescribed by the Attorney-General. As the clause stands, power will be taken to suppress any combination, irrespective of whether it is or is not in restraint of trade.
