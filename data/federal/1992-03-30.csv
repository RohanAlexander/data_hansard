2,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Tourism and Minist<-r for Resources, Mr Griffiths, is overseas on Government business this week. In his absence, questions on resources should be directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, and questions on tourism should be directed to·the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Family Support, Mr Simmons. NA",10
3,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister be informing President Sullarto in their meeting next month that Australian aid is linked to Indonesia's observance of internationally recognised standards of human rights?,10
4,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia has made its position on human rights clear over a long time. It made its· position on human rights clear again after the massacre in Dili. We expressed our objection and our abhorrence at that occurrence to the Government of 1Jldonesia, but the seriousness with which that issue has been taken by the Indonesian authorities---"":their response, the response of the President, their response in relation to the military officers who were engaged in the execution of those orders-has been, as far as the Government is concerned, a credible response. I think that view has also· been shared by the world community. I am going to Indonesia.,-as the former Prime Minister was going there-as .a visitor, as the Prime Minister of Australia, from a country in the ne-r neighbourhood. I will naturally be raising issues of concern to us, including human rights. I see the visit as an opportunity to build closer ties between Indonesia and AustraIiainboth trade and commerce. In the past Australia has not made its aid policies conditional upon precise r arrangements, what the Leader of the Opposition calls human rights arrangements.",10
5,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are they linked or not?,10
6,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-;.It is not linked, has not been linked and will not be linked during the visit. I look forward to the visit to meet the Indonesian President and members of the Government to try to improve both the commercial trading and general, social and cultura11inks between Australia and Indonesia. Consumption Tax",10
7,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Treasurer seen reports of a study which claims to show that the introduction of a consumption tax would boost economic activity by some $7 billion? Can the Treasurer advise the House whether, . on the basis ()f these claimed benefits, the Indonesia Government is reconsidering its position on the introduction of such a tax? What are the Government's intentions on this matter?",10
8,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see a press report this morning about a study by Dr Michael. Porter and Mr Andrew Chisholm which purports to show the benefits referred to by the honourable member for Fisher. I do not think this report, although it is reported in terms which suggest that a consumption tax would have a major beneficial effect on Australi/l, actually contains any joy for the . proponents of any such proposal. Mr Reith-Obviously it has got you worried.",10
9,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It has not got me worried. Mr Reith-It has got you up at the first question. - SPEAKER-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,10
10,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It ought to have you worried. We have had a string of commentaries on the possible implications of a consumption tax in Australia, and .this is just another in the long line which raise- serious reservations about. this whole proposal. It is another of the GST cheer squad to come out again raising real and fundamental questions about whether or not this is a practical proposal for Australia and, certainly, whether in the context of the Opposition's policy it could ever effectively be introduced. What this study says-as, indeed, other studies have said before-is that, if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflationary impact of a consumption tax, 'GDP actually declines'. So, if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflationary pressure coming from the introduction of a consumption tax, GDP actually declines. What on earth are we trying to achieve? Something which is based on an 'if'-a gigantic 'if'. Mr Chisholm goes on to say: If the Opposition's policy is well designed, won't need a wage rise because they will be compensated for the effects of a GST by the tax cuts. But ifhere we go with 'if'the trade uriions don't perceive that workers have been properly compensated, then there's going to be a problem. This is a gigantic problem. It is a problem which leads to a reduction' in GDP. The will withdraw that remark. authors of this study are not the first who have come up with this hair-raising warning which the Opposition seems intent on turning aside. It is not interested in these warnings, because it is not the first time it has had them. Dr Murphy from the ANU said that if-again, this word 'if'-wage increases were obtained to compensate for the inflationary effect of the GST, GDP would be 4 per cent like that? lower within five years. Here we have a policy about which warnings are becoming daily more intense: that if we cannot keep the inflationary conseorderquences out of the wage system GDP will actually decline. The Opposition says, 'That is okay, because we have a wages policy'. Search as we might for some reference to wages policy within the Opposition's documents, within the 800 pages what we find is this-, Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. We do not mind the Minister conon tinuing with exposing our policy",10
11,Mr SPEA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ERWhat is the point of Kooyong order? Mr Thckey-I want to draw your attention, as I have on a number of occasions, ding order 142. The Minister was asked, 'What are the Government's intentions?'. So far we have just had another diatribe",11
12,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Mr Thckey-I am sorry, Mr Speaker, I have not finished my point of order.",11
13,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Get to your point of order. Mr Thckey-My point of order is simply this: the Government has said it will never have a goods and services tax,11
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable workers member for O'Connor will resume his seat. Mr Thckey-Are you saying I cannot continue my point. of order?,11
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Thckey-Is that what has happened to democracy in this place?,11
16,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member ' Mr Thckey-I will withdraw it if necessary. ,11
17,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Kooyong will remain silent.  .,11
18,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member the for Kooyong will resume his seat. ,11
19,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order raised by the honourable member for the O'Connor, there is no point of order.  of order. I would simply like an explanation as to why there is no point of order.",11
20,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been asked to rule the point of order and I have ruled on the point of order. If the honourable member for wants to dispute that ruling, he can do so in the forms of the House.  to stanif you give me the reason.",11
21,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Kooyong intervenes in such a way again, I will name him.",12
22,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Search as we may for some reference to the Opposition's wages policy, we find a little over half a page out 800 pages; yet it has the cheek to say that the centrepiece of the coalition's economic policy is industrial relations reform. Here is half a page of it out of 800. What we know is that this whole proposal is built on sand unless we can deal with the inflationary consequences of this introduction. Mr Downer-No, a 3112 per cent increase in real wages.",12
23,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,12
24,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is basically a boffin's policy, an impractical policy, based on a gigantic 'if', unless we believe that the compensation package is in fact a fair one and one which should be accepted by ordinary Australians. Of course, what we know is thisMr Reith-You have not got it right.",12
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting. Mr Reith-You are struggling. This is terrible.,12
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.,12
27,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a result, 70 per cent of wage and salary earners in households would be worse off. Those earning about $25,000 a year would be $7.50 worse off; those on $38,000 a year would be $8 a week worse off. Here we have incontrovertible evidence that in fact people are going to be worse off as a result of this introduction. What is clearly said by this study, again on top of the Murphy study, is that unless one can convince workers that they do not have to maintain their real wages to compensate for this introduction, the impact will go into wages and GDP will fall. What is the point of such a policy if all one wants to do is contract the economy to actually reduce the size of the Australian economy by 4 per cent? I think this study suggests that if anyone should be thinking again it is you, Dr Hewson, and your colleagues over there. East Timor",12
28,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the of Prime Minister. Is it his Government's view that the issue of self-determination for East Timor is effectively closed and, if so, why?",12
29,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,For many years it has been the policy of both parties on this serious question that· it is effectively closed. It was effectively closed by the actions of the mid1970s. What Australian governments over the period since then have sought was a set of arrangements which brought harmony and a political settlement in Timor and which operated effectively between the Government of Indonesia and the peoples of East Timor.,12
30,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your policy?,12
31,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not remember the Opposition of today-the then Government of the day which governed Australia in the critical years from 1976 onwards-advocating that policy, so you have no credibility whatsoever in asking a question like that.",12
32,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,12
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The House will come to order. There is far to,o much noise. Honourable members of the Opposition will cease interjecting. Employment Opportunities  to the Prime Minister. I ask: what action is the Government taking to improve employment in Australia and, further, what factors could adversely affect these targets?",12
34,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I did not hear the first part of the question.,12
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Could the honourable member repeat the question?,12
36,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,12
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is far too much noise. If honourable members on my left continue to interject, Ministers will not be able to hear the questions.  the Prime Minister. I ask: what action is the Government taking to improve employment in Australia and, secondly, what factors could adversely affect these targets?",12
38,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has, over a long period, been very successful in increasing rates of economic growth and employment in Australia. Over the period 1983 to 1990, we have seen a net 1.5 million jobs created. In the Government's One Nation statement we see a role for the public sector in promoting growth to bring Australia from recession to recovery and to strengthen that process. As well as that, we have seen a change in relation to the structure of Australian industry to make it more supple, to make it more competitive to give it a greater chance to trade competitively in the world, and to layout a stronger and more viable foundation for employment over the period. It seems that the Government and the Opposition have different policies in relation to tariff protection and mdustry restructuring, but the Leader of the Opposition attempts to portray our policies as being not distinct. In fact last week, on 26 March, under the heading, 'Keating destroys his credibility on tariff reform'Opposition members-Hear, hear!",13
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
40,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,the Leader of the Opp'osition said: The Prime Minister's attempts to portray his tariff policy as distinct from the Coalition's is pure dis information. . . Dr Bob Woods-Absolutely.,13
41,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, how come the Leader of the Opposition, in his reply to the March 1991 statement, said: I congratulate himthat is, the then Prime Minister for his move in this direction, although he will still have 25 per cent protection in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and 15 per cent protection in the auto industry by the year 2000. How come he made the distinction then but sought this week to say that there was no distinction, that it was disinformation on my part?",13
42,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You were caught!,13
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
44,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How come he said in a press statement on 10 March 1991: Or will it allow us to establish an industrial structure that will not need tariff protection by the year 2ooo? How come on 12 March 1991, the honourable member for Barker, when asked, 'You applaud the moves on tariffs reductions, do you?', said: I do, but you will note that we said that these tariff reductions, both in general and in the automotive and TCF, should come down to negligible levels by the year 2000. Now, this Government won't quite get there, although he will still have 25 per cent protection in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and 15 per cent protection in the auto industry by the year 2000. The Opposition was happy to make the distinction then, but were not happy to make it when I was in a tyre factory in Victoria.",13
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,13
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,13
47,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The· Leader of the Opposition has tried to claim that I said one thing and then did another. In the statement on 12 March 1991 which was part of the Building A Competitive Australia, I had this to say on page 2.2: Today's Statement completes the program announced in the Economic Statement of May 1988. It completes the program; that is, the end points 25, 15,5 and zero were the completion of the program. A day after the statement, I said on the Haydn Sargent program in Queensland: So if you take clothing and footwear, that tax is going to be down from 35 to 15 per cent. .. In other words, that's at the end of the section; that's at the end of the phase down. I went on to say: because it's got to be phased. This started in the package of 1987-88 and the phase-in will complete in 1997 and the year 2000. I also made the following point to the honourable member for Barker in the House of Representatives on 17 September 1990: The shadow Minister has an objective of a zero tariff level by the year 2000, as I understand it. The average level of protection increased during the seven years of the Fraser Government. This Labor Government has reduced protection levels. But make decisions about whether we want industries. For instance, we want a car industry. We know that a car industry will not function at zero protection levels, but apparently those opposite believe that at a zero level of protection a car viable. It will not. The Opposition is really saying it does not want a car industry. I went on and made it very clear in further references in that answer that I did not believe a zero level by the year 2000 in cars was desirable or achievable. I made it obviously and patently clear. The tariff levels which obtained were these: in 1983-84 the effective level with respect clothing was 222 per cent, falling cent as a result of the March 1991 program. For clothing and footwear it was 227 per cent, down to 50 per cent. That is in the Industry Commission report, if honourable members· bother to look. With respect to vehicles, it has fallen from 250 per cent to 36 per cent. Mr Speaker, you will see a graph in the Industry Commission's report which, the same period, shows a falling level protection under this Government but rising durmg the period of the Fraser Government when the Leader of the Opposition was the principal economic adviser. I table interest of honourable members a photocopy of that graph. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition as an adviser to a former Treasurer did not decrease tariff protection but actually increased it during the Oppsition's period in office. We brought it down to per cent for textiles, 15 per cars, 5 per cent for general manufacturing and zero for DC preferences, announced it, said it was the end of the sectionMr Ruddock interjecting Mr Taylor interjecting",13
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Groom will cease interjecting.,14
49,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And then the Leader the Opposition really by a process of disinfQrmation tries to say that my attempt to portray the tariff was not distinct from the coalition's, even though he blackguarded the former Prime Minister the day after the statement, saying that the Government still had 25 per we cent for clothing and footwear and 15 per cent for protection for the auto industry",14

73,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. On the subject making distinctions, last year on 14 March you said that the TCF and motor vehicle industries were having a loaf behind the tariff",15
74,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Exactly.,15
75,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You said, 'If they're non-competitive and can never be competitive we're better off without them'. You also said that protection was a monkey on the back of every exporter.",15

82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question comes from rebuild a party which built the tariff wall and then took no steps to dismantle it. When I said that tariffs were a monkey on the back of and Australian efficiency,. of course they were. But I remind honourable members that the effective rate of protection for clothing in 1983-84 was 222 per cent. As a result of the March 1991 program it is 52 per cent effeccent tive protection.

87,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On motor vehicles, the sion figure was 250 per cent in 1983-84, a 36 per cent effective rate of protection at the end of the 1991 plan-that is, 1996-97. But you are saying that, unleSs it is zero, it is of no value; unless it is zero, anything that I have said about these massive, poisonous levels of protection is invalid. What an absurd conclusion to try to draw! I picked you up on 17 September 1990 when you were going around industry groups talking about zero protection for motor The reason I did not make more of it was that reductions' . Senator Button rang me and said, 'If you continue to point to MCLachlan's this the Toyota company and the other car companies thinking of investing in Australia won't'. So, in deference to the interests of getting that $400m plant in Victoria, go on with you in the House of Representatives. I took you on once and that was it. Ignorance is bliss. The honourable member is wandering around saying, 'Let's have zero protection levels by the year 2000. Let's not wonder whether or not we might actually snuff out a state of the art plant which will the Australian motor vehicle industry. Let's not consider the Falcon replacement by Ford. Let's just, in our ideological obsession blank laziness, point laziness-and having never touched these tariffs in the pastcheaply one-up the Government by saying zero'. We spent 10 years getting those 250 per levels down; you have the cheap zero as one-up. Those opposite say, 'Oh no, we'll cent. one-up them by saying zero'. We are supposed to say, 'Oh, isn't that brave; isn't that unbelievably hairy chested'. You have done nothing over the years-including the fatal years when you had the chance to do Opit between 1976 and 1983. You actually increased protection. Then you, having been the principal adviser to that Government, seek be listened to, with credibility, about tariffs. When you say you are going to take 15 per cent to zero we are supposed to say, 'Oh, aren't you brave'. The fact is that you are irresponsible. The Leader of the Opposition said the other day . that, by saying this, I had put back the discuson rationalist policy in this country. That falling to was his claim.",16

92,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If, the Leader' of the Opposition wanted genuine bipartisanship and to help on this subject-when the Opposition has provided no help for 30 years on the subject-he should have said, 'We will adopt the Government's phase-down program and reserve the right to review it in the year 2000'. That is no problem. But he has to be the cheap one-upper. He puts the zero in. He does not want any consensus, bilateral discussion or bipartisanship. He just wants the zero. Then he runs around saying how pure market they are, how purist they are, when, in fact, this Government had to deal with all of the industries and labour all the discussions with the various sectors of industry and the unions to get these path-breaking tariff reforms. BecaQse we take them to 25, 15, five and zero, we have a rebuke from the Leader of the Opposition to the then Prime Minister, saying in the House: . . . although he will still have 25 per cent. .. in the TCF industries and 15 per cent in auto in,dustry by the year 2000. He was quite happy to make the divisive distinction then; but it is very unhappy for me to make it at the South Pacific Tyres plant. We removed the.quantitative restrictions on the auto industry and clothing. Quotas were . sold backwards and forwards through the seventies and early eighties. We would see them advertised in the Sydney Morning Herald. We could go and buy so many quota imports from certain people who were awarded them. Do you know what the rate of protection is with quotas? Infinity. That is the rate of protection while quotas exist. Who wiped all quotas out? This Government did. We fought in the GATT to wipe them out on agriculture.

101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for MitchelL,17
102,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It did not put together a lobbying operation-the likes of which have never been seen on agriculture. It could not even get agriculture onto the GATT agenda. Yet you have the hide to continue to ask us about quantitative restrictions in agriculture by other countries. Of course there are quantitative restrictions, and we want to knock them down. That is' the whole point of the GATT. But nothing detracts from the opportunist statements that you have made about tariffs and seeking to gamer to yourselves some kind of marks as people interested in economic efficiency to highlight differences between the Government and the Opposition when it suits you, and then suggesting, when I refer to those differences, that I am engaging in disinformation. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong and the Ministers who were part of the front bench of that Government between 1976 and 1983 have not a shred of credibility on tariff reductions-not a shred. The Australian public ought to take absolutely no notice of their statements because they go to water, like they have always gone to water, in the face of the first whiff of grapeshot. Goods and Services Tax: Effect on Employment",17

107,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will render a severe disservice and· damage to this country.. It is true that the Opposition parties are proposing a GST and have recently pamphleted the people of the Australian Capital Territory-I presume, amongst others-with a pamphlet entitled Fightback Australia!. The first point it makes is that two million jobs would be created by abolishing seven unfair taxes and rebuilding business. These are the two million jobs which the Leader of the Opposition said was a guesstimate which came out of an economic projection which did not even model the GST. The GST which actually replaces the seven taxes so referred to was not even modelled. The Leader of the Opposition said in his media statement of 27 February: Fightback was not-repeat not-modelled. Therefore, the two million jobs which he described as a guesstimate on his part are now claimed at the top of the pamphlet, and claimed in relation to the GST which replaces the seven taxes, even though he says that the GST was not part of the modelling exercise and that Fightback was not modelled. In other words, the pamphlet is a fraud. It goes on to say at point 6: Customs Duties to be ABOLISHED. As Australian industries become more cost efficient both local and imported goods will be cheaper. of In other words, the tariff goes and customs duties are abolished-this is one of the seven a points of the unfair taxes to be removed, the very removal of which the Opposition said that I was engaging in disinformation about , last wt""'k at the South Pacific Tyres factory. This week, the Leader of the Opposition has it as a principal pomt in this pamphlet. How duplicitous and dishonest can you be? When . get around to the rest of it, the pamphlet one talks about the GST-and you can hardly find economic GST-Growing Stronger Together. It does not say 'Goods and Services TaxGrowing Stronger Together'; he will not even admit to what it is. Then it says: the Wholesale Sales Tax, Fuel Excise ... Payroll . .. abolished... some prices will stay the same, others will rise marginally with GST. In other words, the picture is that some will go down, some will stay the same, but a couple will go up. That is the sort of picture, In fact, the Treasurer pointed out recently in a ministerial statement on the GST that estimated price effects of the Opposition's package by the Treasury on food produ-ts gen-rally will be 8.9 per cent overall. products will increase by 9.6 per cent, cereal products will increase by 9.2 per cent and fresh fruit and vegetables by 10.1 per centI hardly marginal! This is the dishonesty of this pamphlet. We would have an overall 8.9 per cent increase in food, taking all the Opposition's into account. Yet this pamphlet has you saying that costs will rise marginally with GST. The GST is described as 'growing strong together' - not a goods and services tax. Then it claims two million jobs will be all. created, which you say were not modelled. It is a hoax. What can any member of the public believe of this other than that it is a hoax document? You say that two million jobs come to order. were picked out of a hat. You refer to seven unfair taxes-taxes which will be replaced a GST. Yet you say that the GST was not 2.2: modelled to produce the estimate of two million jobs. Talk about lying straight in bed! Brother! How do you do it with these sort of things? There is the picture of the Leader of. the Opposition. What about you, Goody-goody? day after: The Leader of the National Party also has his picture on the back.

I said this to Haydn Sargent the So if you take clothing and footwear, that tax is to be down from 35 to 15 per cent. In other words, that's at the end of the section; that's the end of the phase down. This started in the package of 1987-88 and the phaseing will complete in 1997 or the year 2000 as a result of the second stage announced yesterday. Leader of the Opposition is stung by the fact that he knows he is running a policy will knock jobs out by their thousands like in Melbourne and in Wills.

120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,19
121,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This Government embarked upon a programmed reduction in tariffs from those 250 and 220 per cent levels on a phased basis to end-point reductions of 25, 15, five and zero, which, as I said in that statement: . . . ends forever Australia's sorry association with the tariff as a device for industrial development. In other words, the wall is down. I went on: By turning its back on tariffs, Australia will be further propelled in its quest for international and efficiency. But it did not mean wiping out the Toyota investment of $400m with a zero tariff; it did not mean wiping out the broadloom TCF industries and those apparel industries which can survive at 15 per cent, because the Government studiously and carefully made assessments about the protection phase down they could bear. The fact that, with your cheap one-upmanship, your cheap shot at the zero tariff with no more thought than a click of the fingers, and being the opportunists that you are, you put the zero in and think you are going to get some public remarks on it. That just simply shows that not only do you not know about these industries, but also you do not care about them. You are quite happy to try to score, as usual, a cheap shot, but without doing any of the hard work that would ever put you in a position to get within shooting distance of zero. Social Welfare Benefits",20
122,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Social Security: when will the recently announced increases in some social welfare payments be made? Would the Minister also be prepared to comment on the adverse consequences in the current economic climate if social welfare payments were reduced?,20
123,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, some of the announced increases are already in place in relation to extending the availability of rent assistance to those singles under 18. In addition, the other payments will be made. this week in relation to family allowance. They were decisions made before any Wills by-election was announced or considered. They were part of the February statement, designed, above all else, to inject an impetus into this economy. That is the prime purpose of those one-off payments of family allowance. Of course, the follow-up payments in relation to the family allowance supplement are intended to provide a continuing increased support for low income families in this society. But what we hear in contrast to what this Government is doing are proposals that there should be massive cuts in social welfare. I understand that there has been a proposal that trade there should be a 30 per cent cut in social welfare payments. I understand that that originates from the Liberal candidate for Wills, Mr John Delacretaz. I find it inconceivable that any figure in public life in this country could make a suggestion of a 30 per cent cut in social welfare payments. I gather that he is also in favour of sending all unemployed migrants back home. I gather that he is also inclined to axe the subsidy paid to some riyal duster company which employs disabled people; that should be cut off too. This gives us a real insight into the type of candidate put forward by the Liberal Party in Wills. . I have noticed no effort whatsoever to distance the Liberal Party from this candidate to repudiate these kinds of views. Of course, that is not that surprising. In many ways the Fightback package is a sophisticated version in a number of areas of the rather crude comments made by the Liberal candidate for Wills. Look for instance at unemployment benefits. If you follow the man from Wills, you could cut the social welfare benefit to the unemployed by 30 per cent. That would reduce the payments to those on Job Search allowance by $84.60 a fortnight. That is what a 30 per cent cut mearis-$84.60 a fortnight. Or, of course, you could do it in a more subtle way-you could change the eligibility for Job Search groups. That may sound a bit far fetched, but when you read Fightback, you realise that that is exactly what the Opposition proposes for many of the long term unemployed; that is, they will have their unemployment benefits cut off after nine months. Mr Broadbent-Not true!",20
124,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought we would get that kind of nonsense, so I refer to what your spokesman on social security said. Senator Alston said-and without any qualification whatsoever I quote him: People looking for work will be paid the Job Search allowance for nine months. That is the end.",21
125,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, and then the rest.",21
126,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will go on with what he said, because it might interest the National Party: People looking for work will be paid the Job Search allowance for nine months. They should use their own resources first and once they run out of their own resources, they claim for soci!il security. That is, they should become destitute before they can apply for social security. They should use their own resources first-tell the farmers that. Your own spokesperson makes no equivocation about cutting off those payments after nine months. That would cut out some 90,000 unemployed. Therefore, you would have a massive cut-not the crude 30 per cent of the candidate for Wills, but a very effective cut-in social welfare benefits by changing eligibility. You could do exactly the same with the family support arrangements. Mr Delacretaz would suggest that you cut that by 30 per cent. Or you could, as the Opposition does in Fightback, change the eligibility rule for the sole parent's pension; that is, remove the pension as soon as the youngest child turns 12. That would mean 30,000 parents being cut out of that benefit. Again, it is a subtie and more sophisticated version of what the candidate for Wills is saying. I·am not sure that the candidate for Wills even understands that family allowance and family allowance supplement are all part of the social welfare net, but if we started cutting family allowances by 30 per cent, if we reduced them by $6.20 per child per fortnight, a family with three children would lose $18.60 per fortnight. If we started cutting our family allowance supplement provision, that would mean a cut of $25.80 per fortnight for children under 13, and for children between 13 and 15 it would meanMr Cadman interjecting",21
127,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! If the honourable member for Mitchell interjects again I will name him.,21
128,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sorry, Mr Speaker; some of the heckling interrupted me. Let me just make plain to members of the Opposition the effect of their cut. For children under 13 it would mean a cut of $18.20 per fortnight; for children between 13 and 15 it would mean a cut of $25.80 per fortnight. I would remind the candidate for Wills that those sorts of cuts would affect some 11,000 families in Wills. Of course, the Opposition is more subtle and sophisticated than that. What it is saying is that it will change the eligibility rules for the family allowance. All the rules about income that will apply in relation to families are not quite clear from the Fightback! document but, taking the most conservative view, it would mean that some 190,000 families across Australia would be denied family allowance. That would mean that about 1,000 families in Wills would simply go off family allowance as a result of the Fightback proposals.· I think the Wills electorate is beginning to realise that Mr Delacretaz is very much a supporter of the cuts proposed by the Leader of the Opposition-cuts which would destroy and slash the safety net for social welfare that we have provided in this country. Tariff Protection Dr HEWSON.:.. - My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will recall his statement to John Laws early last year to the effect that protection is a tax. Will the Prime Minister now confirm that tariff protection ofc1othing and footwear increases tax on the average Australian household by over $300 per year, and that the effect of this tax falls most heavily on the poorer households? How does the Prime Minister justify this additional tax and its heavy impact on the poor? Mr - EATING-lt was 227 per cent; it will fall to an effective rate of 50 per cent.

So far we have seen nothing from you. You have had an opportunity' to exercise executive responsibility to this country.

135,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Under our policies we have led the industry to rationalise from 13 models in 1984 to six models in 1992. With massive export growth throughout the whole of the 1980s, average production incre-sed from 28,000 units per model-a run of 28,000 cars-to an average of 45,000 cars per model; and exports increased from $370m at the beginning of the 1980s to over $1 billio- this year and are rising strongly. That has been the enormous difference: from 13 to six models, from a run of 28,000 to 45,000, and from $37Om of exports to $1 billion. From 1977-78 to 1982-83, investment in the automotive' industry grew by minus 1.6 per cent per annum. Under us, it has increased by over 10 per cent per annum. That is the restructuring which this Government has conscientiously undertaken. We have seen that rationalisation of models and efficiency. We are seeing it in the clothing, textiles and footwear industry. For people who have never raised their finger to lower tariffs, who cannot produce a document or authenticate one effort on their part, who sat there frozen for seven years with these high tariffs around our heads, poisoning the culture of our industries, poisoning the practices of Australian management, to then say that if it is not zero it is nothing is to point to the extremism and shallowness which I think are part and parcel of you and your policies.

141,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"While the Prime Minister is firing on all six cylinders, I have a question for him as well. Is the Prime Minister aware of recent claims that attempts to place apprentices in work in Melbourne are failing? If so, will he outline to the House what the Government is doing to provide more opportunities . for young Australians through education and training?",23
142,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Dunkley made that claim last week. The One Nation statement includes an extra payment of $2,000 for each additional firstyear apprentice whom employers take on in 1992 and an increase in the initial craft payment to $3,500. This measure is expected to encourage an additional 9,000 first-year apprentices during 1992. The One Nation package includes a doubling to $2,000 for 1992 of the incentive to employers of all trainees under the Australian traineeship system who commence after 1 January 1992, which is expected to encourage an additional 10,000 trainees in 1992. It includes $5m to provide a wage subsidy to employers of second-year apprentices at risk of retrenchment. Some 3,200 young peopJe are expected to be helped by this measure. Before the One Nation statement, the Government extended other measures which will add some 7,000 young people who can expect to be helped by those changes. Last week the honourable member for Dunkley asked this question: Does the Prime Minister know that this groupwhich is called Inner Northern Group Trainingnow has more than 250 out-of-work apprentices on its books? Today I received a letter on this subject from Inner Northern Group Training Ltd, which I will read to the House: Dear Sir, On Thursday last, the 26th of March, you were asked a question by Me F. Ford, member for Dunkley. The question asked whether you were aware of the existence of my company, Inner Northern Group Training Ltd, which he erroneously stated had '250 out-of-work apprentices on their books'. The fact of the matter is that we have more than 150 apprentices on our books who are employed. We do have a register of apprentices made out-of-trade by other employers: but not by us. Those out of work apprentices are not 'on our books'. We keep this register to assist our speedy placement of them when we find additional positions... Furthermore, for the last two years we· have consistently averaged placing another 80 apprentices per year, (nearly 7 per every month) in employment. After taking our graduations into account, we have increased our numbers of apprentices and trainee employees from 107 at 1 July 1990to 152 today. Not only have we increased our number of apprentices and trainees; we have also expanded a career advisory service and we are also running pre-employment courses. This misrepresentation of our company's performance alone is sufficiently galling to my Board and Staff, but it has already had commercial repercussions for""us, with a number of our clients phoning us to ask us if the company was 'in difficulties'. Such rumours, which are totally unfounded and lacking in substance, can lead to clients deserting our successful organisation. This, however, has not been the worse impact. We are currently nearing completion of sensitive negotiations with our entire industry to provide services to their training organisations. These negotiations involve both a trade union and an employer association. Due specifically to this question being asked by the member for Dunkley, anxieties have been expressed to us about whether we have the capacity to fulfil our obligations in the proposed agreement. It goes on to say: We do consider that as you were the recipient of the question, we need to inform you both of our intense anger at the member for Dunkley's action and more importantly of the facts of the case. . We shall be contacting the Leader of the Opposition on this matter seeking an apology and a complete withdrawal of any implications regarding our company's trading position and/or level of performance. The extent of the damage which has already been done is hard to ascertain, \Jut rumours spread quickly and do damage irrespective of the facts. This is because it is presumed that parliamentarians have access to accurate inside information. Obviously this is not always so, as our example proves. It is signed by Paul Martin, General Manager. Again, this is another cheap shot by the Opposition in this campaign for the by-election in Wills. Mr Hand-He would not know where Wills was.",23
143,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Dunkley, obviously not knowing the facts, asked this question in the House and has now been seriously and comprehensively rebuked by the owner of this business, who has now called for an apology and a withdrawal. I hope the honourable member for Dunkley obliges him. It ranks with the tariff proposals of the Opposition. It is hurting people. Those opposite will resort to any obfuscation to make a cheap political point. Whether it is an easily grabbed zero in the tariff schedule, or whether it is this fallacious claim by you, fact is that you have been shown up to be the fraud you are by the owner of the business.

I suppose none of those things are genuine reform, but the mickey mouse policy of reducing the excise on petrol is genuine reform? Could the abolition of payroll tax at the expense of the doubling of the inflation rate ever be genuine reform? I suppose those hundreds of enterprise agreements now being negotiated in the workplace by unions and employers could not be genuine reform? I suppose that the 10 per cent reduction in unit labour costs the of 1983 and the attendant increase in profitability over the period is not genuine reform, but what is genuine reform is this Mickey Mouse package which turns up under the guise of a goods and services tax, a consumption tax, which is about changing the lives of every Australian by this disruptive tax on the way they live and the things which they must buy for themselves.",24
149,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the theory of it?,24
150,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'The theory of it', he says. That question says so much about the Leader of the Opposition; that is, the wideeyed theorist Captain Zero: zero inflation, zero tariffs, zero growth, zero employment and all the other things. Opposition members-Captain Recession!",24
151,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,24
152,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If it is not in a textbook, then that is it. But if we asked in the 1970s how to actually get the. protection levels down, how to laboriously produce that falling red line in the levels of effective protection in Australia, it could not have been found in a textbook, I can tell you that. It had to come from creativity, talking to people, and a bit of good old fashioned courage, which those opposite never had. So now they ask me the threadbare question, 'What about the theory of it? If the theory says zero, why don't you go to zero?'. I suppose any of us could have said in the 1980s, 'Listen, if tariffs are zero, that is it. Bad luck. Adjust yourselves. Do your best'. What we would have had would have been massive lay-offs in industry, enormous disruption and, in the end, a reversal of the policy and no change. That is the difference between the Government and the Opposition. The Government, steadily, sure-footedly, carefully and conscientiously evaluated these industries and made the changes. In fact, what we see from the Leader of the Opposition is simply the adoption of a theoretical target with no . practical or sensible application to the real economy and the people who live and work in it. The question says more' about his view of economic and political life than I could have said in 15 answers to questions. . Tertiary and Further Education",24
153,Mr ELLIOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employinent, Education and Training. Have there been any attempts to estimate the resource requirements of TAFE and the training sector for the remainder of this decade? If so, what is the Government's response to these. estimates? Is the Minister aware of any alternative proposals relating to the resource requirements of the TAFE sector? What are the Government's intentions in this regard? Mr BEAZLEY..,...I have seen estimates, and they are commonly accepted estimates, about what is required to bring vocational education and training expenditures up to acceptable levels in this community. They were made last year by the Finn committee and were consistent with earlier projections by .the Deveson review of training costs and award restructuring. They recommended that the annual cost expenditures of TAPE. and tra'ining should rise between $800m and $1 billion over 1991 levels by the end of the decade; that is, in each year, somewhere between $800m and $1 billion ought to be spent if we are to achieve acceptable levels participation in vocational education. The One Nation package offers progress right on target for achievement of that expenditure. It offers full Commonwealth responsibility for the funding of vocational education and training, the establishment of legislated guaranteed training or funding and growth totalling $720m over the 1993-95 triennium. That rate of growth, as I said, is on a trajectory to achieve the Finn Committee projections. There is an alternative proposal from the Opposition in its Fightback! document. It has the temerity to tell us in the main document that the reality is that this Labor Government spends too little on the education and training of young Australians. Further on we are told that the Liberal and National parties will: respond to the sentiment of the Deveson and Finn reports and provide an additional $520m for TAFE over the rest of this decade to fup.d growth, opportunity and world class skills; That is not $520m per annum, that - s $520m in total that the Liberal and National parties will be prepared to provide over the rest of this decade. If that is going to be the Opposition's objective, and were it to get into office, instead of achieving close to the $800m to $1 billion by the end of the decade it would merely be falling some $900m short. But there is more to it than that because other elements of the Opposition's policy are likely to impact on expenditure outlays in vocational education and training. Then we come to the position it adopts on general purpose payments to the States where it says it will reduce it by 5 per cent. Currently the States are spending on vocational education and training $1.5 billion per annum. Dr Kemp-Look at the States' role. Why don't you get it right.",25

In effect, what the Opposition's $75ql becomes is $75m to replace of the $75m that the States have been required to spend.

168,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have had. occasion to refer to the simian visage of the honourable member for O'Connor as he jibbers and twitters on the back bench. I think we can all take it. Getting back to the points on zero achievement in relation to expenditure .on vocation and educational training, this is what the Opposition had to say about zero title achievement on vocation and educational training. The coalition leads into its policy by stating that educational training 'is the gift of the present to future generations'. So the gift of the ,Opposition to future generations. is zero. When it opens that gift box, it is going to have to live with the cardboard around it because all that will be contained inside it is no gift but air and an IOU. '",26

170,Mr BRADFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a for you. I ask you: are you awareI , that· people are still smoking in Parliament House despite the ban you imposed last year? Is it a fact that you are consideriilg the installation of smoke detecting devices in honourable members' offices? If not, what action do best you propose taking to protect non-smokers working in Parliament House and the health risks imposed by passive smoking?",26
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and.Ethnic Affairs to suggests that I should reinvoke the death penalty. I would have thought that some that members, including myself and the honourable member for MCPherson; might have thought that those who were smoking imposing that upon themselves. The position that the President and I have taken has been one that has caused us to take action because of a judgment that was held in the court and a number of other industrial judgments which have shown that there is significant danger to our employees caused by passive smoking. We have been advised by our officers that we have a duty of care to those employees. We have therefore determined that there will be no smoking in Parliament House.",26
172,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What happens if the High Court overrules it?,27
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I think it would have been for the same reasons and on the type of advice we received that the Public Service Commissioner, I imagine Qn behalf of the Government, decided that there would be no smoking in buildings which the Commonwealth has under its control.  this building, and neither are you.",27
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Kooyong is· really trying the Chair today. If the honourable member for Kooyong interjects again, I will name him. The President and I took that decision and we determined that the people who work in the parliamentary departments should be covered by the same regulations as people in the Public Service. However, it is a bit harder do that with honourable members and senatprs. I think it should be mainly a matter of peer pressure. As I have said to honourable members in the pa-t, I can understand. that smokers have great difficulty giving up their addiction, but I think that we, as employers",27
175,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the great freedom wing of the New South Wales Labor Party.,27
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members of the Opposition hope to come to government, and would be the employers of the Public Service if they did. We should not adopt an approach that could be said to be hypocritical. If we require our employees not to smoke while they are on duty, then I think it would be wrong-it should be wrong-for us to have one rule for them and one rule for us. It is, however, really a matter of peer pressure. I do not think there is any control which the President and I can have over members and senators who wish to smoke. We do have control over our employees and our employees are disciplined if they smoke in the building. I say to honourable members and senators that we might be doing ourselves a disservice if we say that we will have one rule for our employees and a different rule for ourselves. But that is a matter for their judgment. The President and I have had advice from our officers that we have a duty of care to our employees and that, if we did not act upon that advice, we could be liable under the occupational health and safety legislation. So we have taken the necessary administrative decisions and we hope that members and senators might apply the same rules to themselves as we have applied to the people who are in our employ.

This matter is discussed frequently in this Parliament. The honourable member has the responsibility to state where he has been personally misrepresented and, having done so, he has the right to deny it.

Mr Beale-It would take too long.",28

224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member may proceed.,30
225,Mr REITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"It arises out of information provided to the House by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in Question Time last Thursday, in which he made remarks regarding a possible appointment to a board of directors of the Australian Taxation Office by the Opposition, a policy matter for which I am responsible. The Treasurer said: I suppose the Opposition would be placing on this board the enemies of the Tax Commissioner . . . The coalition has obtained the advice of a number of leading accounting firms as it prepares to implement and finalise the drafting details for the GST. Last week;end these people were also at a seminar organised by the Tax Office. In some cases, they were the very same people giving advice to the Tax Office, at the Commissioner's request, and they were there at a cost to the Tax Office at $300 a night at the Burnham Beeches Country House. It was, firstly, a misrepresentation of the Opposition and, secondly, a slur on a profession that has been happy to provide advice, on an apolitical basis, to both sides of politics. The Treasurer ought to withdraw his misrepresentation and his slur. Mr Beazley interjecting",30

In this particular instance think the honourable member is required to provide evidence of the fact that· he was alluded to by the Prime Minister. My recollection of the events-we are now testing recollections against each other and not parliamentary record-is that he directed that remark to the Leader of the Opposition and to challenged the Leader of the Opposition to table where he had brought that in. If the honourable member for Barker has been the House. misrepresented in this place, it is easy for him to demonstrate that because he is able a parliamentary record which states it. is choosing not to do so. Until he does, he ought not to be permitted to make a personal explanation on the basis of it.",31
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,My recollection is that the matter went beyond the question of record. The honourable member Barker is trying to correct that. I will hear,31
242,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Your memory is correct, Mr Deputy Speaker; the Prime a Minister did go beyond that. He included 'you' in a communal sense and, in fact, on several occasions last Thursday pointed to me. So the criticism was general. I would like to you through this, Me Deputy Speaker. In 1979 I said these statements about tariffs: of the It is a tax on imports. raises the price of an imported article to allow the Australian competitor to raise his price . . . It puts up the price of his car, machinery . . . It increases overall the cost structure. For the year 1975/76 we have estimated the cost on the rural sector at $1168 million. It put up the cost to farmers by. Mr BEAZLEY - Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise '.point of order again. Even if the Prime Minister said 'you' generically-and I do not recollect that ever being said""':-'he had plenty to say about the honourable member for Barker. We on this side of the House have in understood for a very long time tJtat the member for Barker has been committed to zero tariffs. I go back to my original point of order that he has not demonstrated where he has been misI represented. He has demonstrated that he has had a long running opposition to tariffs. We are prepared to accept that on his part.",31
243,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I understand the that the honourable member for Barker. is simply establishing that he has been opposed tariffs in the past. I believe that he has now established that. He ought now to juxtapose that against where he was misrepresented in,31
244,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have not. The to Leader of the House may well have by now. If I did not in the past, he certainly has in his last explanation.",31
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I think you have - tablished your point now in tenus of your record.,32
246,Mr MCLACHLAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"At that time we established that the subsidy equivalent was $11,600 per fann. All of those arguments had been put long before the Prime Minister ever got onto that band wagon. NA Economy: Victoria",32
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Bruce Beale) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The disastrous collapse of investment employment in the State of Victoria caused policies of the Prime Minister and his Victorian political allies. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",32
248,Mr BEALE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"All Australians are aware that the policies of this State was worse Government have had a disastrous 'the nation'l) economy, givi,ng us the worse recession for 60 years. But nowhere have fault those policies had a more damaging effect than in the State of Victoria. On Saturday week, the electors of Wills in Labor's heartland will have an opportunity judgment on the perfonuance of the Keating Administration. Incidentally, I thought it truly ironic that, in the protection of this Parliament today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should say to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), 'You don't want to debate me on this', when the Leader of the Opposition has called on the Prime Minister again and again to go to the electorate Wills and to debate him on economic and any other issues. Mr Costello-Why won'the go?",32
249,Mr BEALE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He will not go because he is scared. He knows what will happen. An Opposition member-He wants the protection of privilege.,32
250,Mr BEALE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. Here are some familiar names: Pyramid, Tricontinental, the Victorian Economic Development Council and WorkCare. Ask anyone what these names represent and they will say that they represent the collapse of the Labor Government of Victoria. Here is another name. The State Bank of Victoria-an old and respected institution in that State-is gone; destroyed by the Cain Kirner governments with the assistance of the man who is now the great mate of the (Mr Victorian ALP, Prime Minister Keating. A couple of recent headlines tell the story. The headline in last Saturday's Weekend Australian reads 'Cain, Kirner and Victoria's and Lost Decade'. The Sunday Herald-Sun was a by the little more colloquial; it said 'We've had enough, Joan'. The article states: Labor has crushed Victoria's spirit as well as its chances of swift recovery from the recession. We went in first, we are likely to come out last. Here is another one from the Australian of 11 February. The heading reads, 'Kirner admits it's been a slide'. It states: The Premier of Victoria, Ms Kirner, yesterday celebrated 18 months in office by conceding the off now than when she took over effect on from Mr John Cain. But Ms Kirner said it was not her Government's ... Victoria is worse off than when Premier Kirner took over 18 months ago, but it is not to pass her Government's fault. This matter of public importance for discuswas sion today, the disastrous collapse of investment and employment in Victoria caused by the policies of the Prime Minister and his Victorian political allies, is timely because this week marks the tenth anniversary of the Labor Government in Victoria - a government generally regarded as being the worse in of Victoria's history and among the worse in issues Australia's history. It is a commentary on the Prime Minister's great flexibility that in its dying days the Victorian Government has a new best friend-the Prime Minister. He throws out his free trade policy, he suddenly becomes mistyeyed over Asia, which he hardly knows or sees, and he finds friends among his old enemies in the Victorian Labor Party. He is indeed the flexible man.· What is the record of this Victorian Government, which is now so pally with our flexible Prime Minister? The unemployment numbers are revealing. When Cain and Kirner came to office the unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent, compared with the rest of Australia at that time of 7.2 per cent. The unemployment rate in Victoria is now 12.3 per cent, compared with the rest of Australia-as at the February figures-at 11.3 per cent. We all know that those numbers are phoney. For example, if a person gets an hour's work once in a while he or she is excluded from the official unemployment figures. The unemployment rate is partly a reflection of a dramatic decline in investment. Overall, Australian business investment dropped 13 per cent in the December quarter and is expected to fall further during 1992. Investment creates jobs, yet in Victoria both private sector and government investment have fallen. In an extraordinary display of irresponsibility, the Victorian Government has increased current spending and allowed capital spending to fade away. This has happened because the public sector unions threatened the Government with disruption and its members with the loss of their preselections. To ensure an increase in public sector salaries and conditions, the unions then offered the carrot in the form of preselection donations. Premier Cain boasted of cranes on the Melbourne skyline while investment in manufacturing and in export industries was declining and leaving the State. The result of the Victorian Government's policies has been lower economic:: growth for the Cain and Kirner governments and for the rest of Australia and lower investment and higher unemployment. Incredibly, the Victorian Government has managed a prodigious increase in government debt. The Paul Keating debt prize, of course, goes to the Prime Minister. But what the Prime Minister has done to our external debt, Cain and Kirner have done to Victoria's internal debt. No-one truly knows the extent of the Victorian Government's debt obligations beCause the books have been hidden, manipulated and subjected to a series of creative accounting practices. But this debt could be as high as $60 billion and the young people of Victoria will be paying <;>ff this debt for the next two generations. The debt situation is a savage commentary on the policies of the Prime Minister and his Victorian political allies. The Prime Minister, Mr Flexibility, will leave us a foreign debt of $180 billion and Premier Kirner will leave us a Victorian State debt of $60 billion. Premiers Cain and Kirner will also be leaving us something else-and that is a trail of destruction in our public institutions. A decade of ALP Government has politicised the Victorian Public Service in a way not seen since Federation. Those who have been promoted by Labor through politiCal influence are commonly known in the Victorian Public Service as the - comrades' .. These comrades have demoralised many experienced and dedicated senior and middle officers in the Victorian Public Service. This blatant playing of politics-the promotion of party hacks and the persecution of those in the Victorian Public Service of an independent mind-probably has no equal in the history of public administration in this nation. The Cain and Kirner governments have created two nations-not one nation-in their public service, and it is a sad and nasty legacy for all Victorians. The Victorian public service huge payouts, phoney settlements and inflated expenses have plagued the Victorian people in recent years. It is clear that a basically honest public service has been infiltrated by racketeers, aided, abetted and encouraged by an incompetent ministry. Furthermore, the Federal Government-the Keating Government and Treasurer Keatingmade a major contribution to the debacle in Victoria. The Federal Government created a climate which gave encouragement to spend up at the height of the boom. The then Treasurer Keating applied a money supply crunch which has flattened Victoria's manufacturing base. The Nissan motor car company has closed; General Motors has basically moved its manufacturing operations to South Australia; and, as reported last week, the Ford Motor Co. has made huge losses in the Keating-inspired recession. It was interesting to see the prime Minister refer today to the fact that Ford has to make a decision in the next couple of years about whether it will use a new Australian model or an overseas designed model. It is interesting that the Prime Minister should be making that observation at a time when Ford has just been decimated by his economic policies. There are many other problems in Victoria that have led to the collapse of investment and employment as a result of Federal and State Labor Party policies. The docks are half empty and still unproductive. The Victorian railways are still riddled with outdated work practices and rackets. The State Electricity Commission is over-manned, indifferently managed and crippled by work rorts. It is a sad commentary that there is still significant resistance by the unions in the State Electricity Commission of Victoria to the contracting out of State Electricity Commission operations to the private sector, which would result in huge savings. The teacher unions are now in control of the Victorian government schools and the syllabus, with a decline in standards, a in literacy and a decline in numeracy that has led the vice-chancellors of some of Victoria's tertiary institutions to speculate on whether entrance examinations to those institutions would be appropriate. In the eastern suburbs region, at the demographic centre of Melbourne, there is disintegrating infrastructure and declining public services. It is ironic that the one bright sign in Victoria's economic mess is a shift towards corporatisation, privatisation and contracting out, lJnfortunately not because the Government sees these as ways to improve productivity and international competitiveness, but rather because the State is broke. The damage caused to the Victorian economy by Federal and State Labor governments has been disastrous, but it can be repaired. The first prerequisite is a change in government in Victoria and a change in government federally. Confidence will never be restored in Victoria while we have State and Federal Labor governments, and confidence is a necessary prerequisite for the return of investment and the creation of jobs. The second prerequisite is the implementation of the policies annunciated in the Fightback package: in particular, labour market reforms to achieve more productive and rewarding workplaces; a major overhaul of the taxation system, including the abolition of existing taxes which discourage business investment and exports; a national savings strategy; reductions in government waste and inefficiency . Mr Coslello-That sounds like a Fightback.",32
251,Mr BEALE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I said that what is needed for Victoria and Australia is the implementation of our Fightback package, with its labour market reforms to achieve more productive and rewarding workplaces; a major overhaul of the taxation system, including the abolition of existing taxes which discourage business investment and exports; a national savings strategy; .reductions in government waste and inefficiency; privatisation and contracting out; an improvement in our education system; and a realistic immigration program. These policies are essential. Before the end of this year the Kirner decline Government will be gone and the Cain Government will be just a horrible memory. Shortly after that, this Federal Government and its leader, Mr Flexibility, will also have been dumped by the people of Australia. Then and only then will the new governments in Victoria and the nation be able to reverse the disastrous collapse of investment and employment in Victoria caused by the Prime Minister and the Labor Government in that State.",34
252,Mr WILLIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The speech we have just heard would probably have been better delivered in the Victorian State Parliament rather than in the Federal Parliament. Anyone listening to the speech, which was basically a diatribe against the Victorian Government, would be interested to know that, despite all that was alleged by the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), employment has grown much faster in Victoria since the Cain and Hawke governments came to office than previously, before Labor governments came in. We have had infinitely faster growth in employment. Let me say, particularly for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Reith), that over the whole period when the Fraser Government was in office-71f4 yearsthe growth in employment in Victoria was 5.8 per cent, a growth of 63,000. In the period since the Labor Government came in federally, employment in Victoria has grown by 300,000. This represents a growth in employment in Victoria of 18 per cent, compared with less than 6 per cent under the Fraser Government. The Opposition is saying that things are terrible in Victoria, that there has been a particularly bad economic record but, had there been a continuance of the employment growth in Victoria at the rate that it was under the Fraser Government, there would be 220,000 fewer people employed in Victoria now. There would be 220,000 fewer if the Fraser Government employment growth rates had continued through to the present time. There has been a vastly different employment scene in Victoria. There are 220,000 more people employed than there would have been if the Fraser Government employment growth rates had continued. Let us acknowledge that Victoria and all parts of Australia have been through hard times in the last 18 months, but let us also bear in mind that the rate of growth in employment in this country-not just in Victoria but all through it-has been vastly greater under this Government than under the previous Government. Despite all the employment loss in the last year and a half, we still have growth rates which are three times greater than the employment growth that occurred under the previous Government. In Victoria, which has been particularly . adversely affected by the recession, it is still the case-there is a vastly greater number of people employed, 220,000 more, than would have been the case had the Labor governments not come to office. That is a starting point to try to get the comments of the honourable member for Bruce into some perspective. Of course, the irony of his address to the House today is that if the Opposition were in office it could hardly be expected that there would be any improvement in Victoria. In fact, Victoria has e Mr been affected in some respects by the recession more than the rest of Australia because it has more protected industry. It is being affected not just by the recession but also by the structural adjustments more than most other States. In that respect, of course, it can be expected to be feeling the pain a little more. What would the Opposition be doing to assist if it were to get into office now? We have been through the protection debate in recent times in this place, including Question Time today, and everyone in this House is now very much aware that if the Opposition were to get into office federally it would embark on a course which would see that the motor vehicle industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industries would be subject to a much faster rate of adjustmentthat is, a faster rate of loss of protectionthan would be the case under this Government. Even though we are instituting a substantial reduction in protection for those industries, it would happen even more quickly under the Opposition. That, of course, raises real questions about whether there would any such industry left. Two major companies in Victoria-Toyota and Ford-have made it clear that, despite the protection regime that is being imposed on them by the present Government, the investment programs that they are prepared to institute are substantial. In the case of Toyota it means going to a new plant at Altona, where it will build a world-class facility which will be able to produce the new model Camry in a way which will allow it to be exported. Mr Beale-And Corolla?",34
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Bruce has already spoken. He shall not interject.,36
254,Mr WILLIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And Corolla, but particularly the Camry. It is being built particularly for the Camry, and the Camry will be exported to other countries. So it is building a major export industry-a world-class facility, a state-of-the-art facility. It is investing in this state-of-the-art factory in Victoria because of various assessments it makes about the future, included amongst which is the protection regime projected by the present Government. As was said at Question Time, the fact that Opposition members were running around talking about reducing protection to zero imperilled that investment decision. If they had been in office telling the world that there would be zero protection, we can certainly assume, I think pretty rightly, that investment would not have· gone ahead, because instead of 15 per cent at the end of this decade there would have been zero. To get to 15 per cent, protection must be reduced at a rate of about 2'12 per cent per annum; this year it goes to 35 per cent, reducing by 2'12 per cent per annum for eight years to 15 per cent. If it were zero, that rate of reduction would be about 4.4 per cent per annum, which is a much faster rate of reduction in protection. I suggest that companies would simply say, 'It is just not possible for us to make productivity improvement at that rate and certainly imperils our investment much more. Even if it might be possible, it is obviously much more questionable; therefore, it is just not worth the candle. We will supply Thailand or South East Asia with their Camrys from Japan or from some other facility, but not from Australia'. They would not invest here. What we did was lay down a protection regime that was designed to strip away that degree of protection which was unnecessarily high, but at least leave a level of protection that would give us a good industry which was efficient by world standards. The case of Toyota proves that that is what is happening. It is getting a world-class factory to produce a state-of-the-art car which can sell on export markets. It is getting that because it asseSses that with the overall· protection regime in place, the investment is viable. Most likely it would not make that assessment if it was zero. That would make the increase in productivity much faster than is otherwise the case. In assessing what increase in productivity is necessary to keep up with the reducing $420m protection regime, companies have to take account of the fact not only that they need to keep up with that reduction in protection but also that competitors, or plants in other countries which may be frqm the same multinational company, are increasing their productivity rapidly as well. What we need is a much faster rate of productivity growth than simply that which is coming from the reduced protection regime if people are going to stay in the game and make the investment viable. that The Opposition in this place would have imperiled that investment-it did imperil it, even from Opposition. What could we expect if it were in government? The same is also true for Ford, whose Broadmeadows factory is located just outside the Wills electorate. It has committed itself to an investment of $800m in the next five years, 60 per cent of which, according to the chief executive, Mr Nasser, is for new ventures; that is, not just for maintaining the current facilities and updating them as generally required, but branching out ii}to major new areas of new products or new quality of products, and basically expanding and improving the business. Would Ford be doing that if it had zero tariffs by the year 2000, which would obviously make that major investment much more dubious in terms of giving a return to the shareholders? Of course it would be much more loath to make that investment. In those circumstances there would be a much-reduced Ford factory in the Broadmeadows area and a much-reduced level of employment possibilities for the people of Wills-many of the work force of the Broadmeadows Ford plant coming from the Wills electorate. Honourable members opposite would have instituted a tariff regime which would have meant that in respect of the Toyota plant in Altona, the Broadmeadows plant, and the Geelong plant, which is the other major facility for Ford, also in Victoria, new investment would most likely not have taken place; yet they stand here and parade themselves around as though through bringing in a GST they will be able to produce some miracle in Victoria. We all know that that is total nonsense. It has been proved time and time again since the GST package was brought down that the two million jobs are just a pipedream; that there is no substance in it whatever; that it is a total deception of the Australian people to talk in those terms; and that all that Opposition members have to offer the Australian people is a level of protection which would mean that in key areas such as the vehicle industry there would be far fewer jobs. This situation applies also to the TCF industries, which are very significant in Victoria, particularly in the Wills electorate. There again we would see a much faster rate of reduction of protection by the people opposite, taking it to zero by the year 2000, meaning no protection at all for clothing, textiles and footwear and that the 25 per cent and 15 per cent rates that we have said would apply would not be there. All those firms would be going out of business at a much faster rate or not bothering to restructure, because it is impossible-the task is too great. They would be giving up the ghost and walking away-which under our program many of them will not do, given that there will be a substantive protection regime available by the year 2000. That gives them an incentive to try to make it, and some certainly will make it. They will make it very well and may even get into exports. The proportion that make it would certainly be far less if there was zero protection, because they would see the task as too immense and too perilous for their shareholder funds. The whole thing is about what is an achievable rate of reduction in protection. We are not saying we think good protection is great or terrific. The point has been amply made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-I simply reiterate it-that it is about the rate and pace of change. We are saying that there comes a point when we have to institute a rate of change which industry can live with. Those opposite would simply give a rate which would be disastrous for those industries and, effectively, wipe them out in this country and have disastrous employment effects in Wills and Victoria generally. This Government in its One Nation statement has seen fit to take various steps to try to give this economy a kick-start to get economic growth going again. We are looking at a slow and patchy recovery. We brought in the One Nation statement to give that recovery a kick along, and various elements of that package will do that. Some of them will have particularly important effects in Victoria. The standardisation of the gauge between Melbourne and Adelaide, the improvements of the Melbourne-Sydney line, the $20m for the upgrade of the Dynon rail terminal and the $5m to connect the port and the rail terminal will all give Melbourne a transport hub second to none and give Victoria, and Melbourne,the chance to become a major centre for growth through having such a major transport hub facility available to it. That involves significant improvements in productivity in the way in which not only the rail system operates, particularly in the Dynon terminal, but also in tenus of the rail practices which are instituted by the rail unions in operating the system. Unless those improvements are forthcoming, that investment will not be forthcoming. There is also major development for roads in Victoria, the western ring road particularly. A major investment by this Government of $75m is helping to develop a road which will be uniquely important in linking a series of interstate highways; directing a lot of traffic easily from one highway to another without its having to go through the centre of Melbourne, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of that system; and also upgrading the international terminal and building common user facilities at the airport-both of which will improve Melbourne Airport and make it a more attractive facility. This One Nation statement is very much about giving this economy a kick along, getting back to the kind of employment growth rates we have had in the past, and, in the process, ensuring that by various infrastructure improvements toria is given a real chance to maintain major growth in the 1990s.

255,Mr ANDREWS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I 1980s. suppose it is a temptation for all governments to compare themselves with past eras. That what we have heard in the early part contribution to this debate of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis)-comparing the record of the Hawke-Keating Government with that of the Fraser Government. But there are some more pertinent details that one ought to in mind when· comparing records of governcompared ment, because the reality is that governments can only be judged on. the basis of their era, when they are responsible for the policies that are put in place in the nation. If we look at some of the statistics and record which .relates to the era of this Government, particularly to the Cain and and Kirner Labor Government years in Victoria, which this matter of public importance is about, we see a disastrous situation. For example, in the rest of Australia during the period of the Cain and Kirner governments in Victoria, growth in jobs was 19 per cent, whereas in Victoria it was just 13.9 per cent. In February 1982.the unemployment figure Victoria was 6.7 per cent, while in the rest Australia it was 7.2 per cent. By February 1992 this year, in Victoria it has blown out 12.3 per cent, but in the rest of Australia, starting from a higher base of 7.2, it is only 11.3 per cent. Mr Ronaldson-That \is devastating.",38
256,Mr ANDREWS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On any estimate, as the honourable member for Ballarat says, that is devastation in the State of Victoria. If we look at economic growth over the period 1980-81 to 1990-91, we see growth in the rest of Australia of 3 per cent per annum, yet in Victoria we see economic growth at the rate of only 2.5 per cent per annum. They are the statistics about which the Cain and Kirner governments in Victoria ought to be judged, not a false comparison with any other era. week or so ago we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) trying to make a comparison between his years and the Menzies years. In his comparison he conveniently failed to quote the figures which, on just about every Viclevel of economic performance in this country, showed that the economic performance in the 1950s exceeded that of the This is the sort of nonsense that we get,and it is the first point, the first plank, in is the argument of the Minister for Finance of the when addressing this major issue. Let me tum to some other statistics that relate to Victoria: jobs have been lost at the rate of 3.5 per cent compared with 1.1 per cent for the rest ·of Australia; unemployment bear has risen at the rate of over 30 per cent with 22 per cent for the rest of Australia; the number of unemployed people own between the ages of 15 and 19 looking for their first full time job increased by 73 per cent in Victoria compared with just 49 per the cent in the rest of Australia; the number of unemployed people between the ages of 15 19 looking for a full time job has risen by 51 per cent in Victoria compared with 22 per cent Australia-wide. One could continue to quote these statistics which, figure after figure, point to the devastation in Victoria. If we look at retail turnover over 12 months to January 1992 as an indicator of economic performance, we see that in Victoria it has in increased by just 3 per cent whereas in the of rest of Australia it has increased by 5.3 per cent. The number of new dwellings approved to has increased in the rest of Australia by 15.4 per cent, but there has been a decrease in still Victoria of 3.3 per cent. New vehicle registrations, another indicator of economic performance, have increased in the rest of Australia by 4.4 pet: cent and there has been a 1.8 per cent increase in Victoria. Over the. 12 months to September 1991 there has been an increase in social security beneficiaries of 45.4 per cent in Australia, which is bad enough, but the figure for Victoria is 82.6 per cent. This is the great State that was handed on to the Cain and Kirner governments and the devastation that has been wrought. The Minister then turned to the tariff A debate. The Prime Minister has been endeavouring to juggle the ball all week trying to decide whether he is an economic rationalist or the great protector of industry. He does not quite know what he is, although he can stand up shamelessly in the Parliament and sQmehQw claim to. be bQth. HQpefully the eCQnQmic writers will perceive that he is still an eCQnQmic ratiQnalist. I supPQse he wants the people in the electQrate Qf Wills to. see that he is the last Qf the great protectiQnists. The Minister talks abQut FQrd and TQyQta. He cQnveniently talks abQut building a new plant fQr TQYQta, but he Qught to. have mentiQned that two. Qther plants are gQing to. be clQsed dQwn. If he talks to. any Qf the WQrkers who. happen to. be at TQYQta, they will say quite clearly that the number Qf jQbs available . in the future at TQyQta will be decreased. We have built this great new plant, but at the Qf clQsing dQwn two. Qther plants and at the CQst Qf further jQbs in the future; When we talk abQut FQrd, we see that there has certainly been SQme special pleading by it and Qthers in the mQtQr industry. Last year the managing directQr Qf FQrd, Mr Nasser, said that, even with the existing tariff refQrm, the program CQuld force FQrd to. clQse dQwn. Of CQurse, it has nQt clQsed dQwn, even with the existing prQgram. NQW he says that the zero tariffs CQuld make new investments hard to. justify. He says that is assuming nQthing else changes in tQday's cQnditiQns. The 'nQthing else' is the nQthing else that the GQvernment cQnveniently dQes nQt wish to. qUQte. In mentiQning prQductivity, did anyQne talk abQut micrQ-ecQnQmic refQrm? We talk abQut tariff reductiQn as if the Qnly way in which we are gQing to. increase prQductivity is to. build new railway lines and new roads. It is the new .prQgram o-the three Rs: rQads, plus railways equals redQvery. GQvernment members shQuld go. and sell that to. the people Qf Wills. It is simply nQt Qn. Even if we have the brightest, best and straightest new'railways in the cQuntry, if we do. nQt have microecQnQmic refQrm and we cQntinue to. have the uniQn practices that exist in this CQuntry, and particularly in VictQria, then we will nQt make any difference at all. We are trying to. disadvantage industry in this cQuntry. The great difference between Qur PQlicies and the GQvernment's PQlicies is that we are prepared to. tackle bQth sides Qf the problem, nQt simply the tariff problem alQne. Of CQurse, we willnQt hear any mentiQn Qf that from the Prime Minister Qr from the Minister fQr Finance tQday. One CQuld go. Qn and CQmpare what has happened in VictQria with the rest Qf Australia Qver the years Qf the Cain and Kirner gQvernments. When Mrs Kirner came to. PQwer she said that she was gQing to. start afresh and that the Party was dumping JQhn Cain because Qf financial mismanagement under him as Premier. But 18 mQnths later we have the Premier cQnceding that the State is WQrse Qff than when she tQQk Qver as Premier. We nQW have a situation where CQst investment cQntinues to. drQP in VictQria and people are leaving the State in drQves. That is an interesting statistic. At the end Qf JQhn Cain's time as Premier, 897 people were leaving VictQria each mQnth. The mQnthly eXQdus Qf VictQrians has nQW jumped to. 1,349. VictQrians are VQting with their feet and gQing elsewhere. We heard the Qld truism, 'Nero. fiddled while RQme burned'. TQday Mrs Kirner is being phQtQgraphed while VictQria is being raped. That gives a whQle new meaning to. video. PQrn. We have a disastrQus situatiQn in VictQria. If the Prime Minister was right and it was a lack Qf PQlitical will Qn the part Qf his Party at the time that led him to. jettisQn the CQnsumptiQn tax, and if the ecQnQmy required the measures which he says he tQok to. prevent it Qverheating, then he is nQW in a PQsitiQn to. implement all that he fQught fQr then. But the slightest electQral test Qn the hQrizQn is Wills. This seat is nQt gQing to. bring the GQvernment dQwn; it is Qne seat. The GQvernment is still gQing to. have quite a reasQnable majQrity even if.it lQses Wills. But what happens? At the first puff Qf the breeze, the first electQral test fQr the Prime Minister, we are scrapping PQlicies. We are running away as fast as we can from tariff refQrm nQW, if that is what we are to. believe the Prime Minister is saying. We are nQt sure what he actually means and what he will say after the Wills by-electiQn, but he is running away frQm that just as he ran away from the cQnsumptiQn tax. The reality is that we have a Prime Minister who. will do. and say anything anywhere, any time in Qrder to. protect the Qne jQb that is important: his job as Prime Minister. The reality is that Victoria is in a disastrous situation. Nothing in the latest statement has done anything to help Victoria, except for saying, 'We will bring forward a few of the policy initiatives in terms of capital works expenditure'. The reality is that Victoria is broke. We do not know the size of the total debt of Victoria and it will be up to the Liberal-National Government, when it comes to office, to ascertain the size of the debt in Victoria. It is a disastrous situation. (TIme expired)",38
257,Mr OKEEFE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This afternoon we have seen a spectacular example of crocodile tears for Victoria. When have those opposite ever come into this chamber and raised any of these concerns about Victhis toria, except when they are trying to score some cheap points in a manufacturing area such as the electorate of Wills? In the past three years, every time the Government has taken steps to try to manage the restructuring process, particularly for the manufacturing industry, in the State that is most hit restructuring, those opposite have opposed every one of those measures and said that they are not going far enough. When have they ever come into this chamber and athad tacked the banks for not passing on the, interest rate cuts to small business and to manufacturing business in Victoria? I defy any single member of the Opposition to table a statement that he has made anywhere attacking those banks for failing to pass on those interest rate cuts to businesses in Victoria. It has not happened. When once did those opposite ever support the interest rate reductions? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has continually been on record from 1988 until now opposing every single interest rate cut, saying that the Government was weakening at the knees. When once did those opposite ever support interest rate cut, let alone attack the banks not passing it on to business? seeing here is a dose of crocodile tears brought on by straight electoral opportunism. It is not going to take' those opposite answer anywhere. When the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) started off this expose, he talked in particular about the State Bank of Victoria and the fact that the Commonwealth Bank had to bail it out. Yes, of course this happened, and no-one liked it happening. But let me go on to the real reason for it and look at the Liberal Opposition's alternatives to it. The real reason for the collapse of the State Bank in Victoria can be taken back to one decision and one decision alone-the failure of the Cain Government to reject philosophy that it should allow the State Bank to take on a merchant bank; that it should allow the State Bank to engage in the normal commercial activities of the private banking sector. Had the Cain Government taken the advice to keep away from this privatisation nonsense, private sector commercialisation nonsense, the State Bank would not have got itself into the situation it got into. How does it come to be that the Commonwealth Bank is in a position to pick up the State Bank of Victoria, and whatever else may come to it down. the track? It is in a by position to do that because the .Federal Government rejected the very same advice. The Commonwealth Bank was not allowed to take on a merchant banking arm. The bank a defined role in the economy, a public sector role, and it was kept to that role. What is the proposal coming forward from this crew on the other side of the House? More of the same! Privatisation is the idea: 'Let us now take the Commonwealth Bank and sell it off to the private sector', the very same whiz-bangs that led the State Bank down the road. Let us look at the ideological star of those opposite in Victoria, Mr Elliott. He is the one who drives their policies in Victoria. Let us look at what he has managed to achieve. He has managed to put the political party of those opposite in tatters. He has managed to wind up the brewery, and it an has had to get rid of him. Elders has had to for get rid of him. He has even managed to stuff What We are up my football club! So this sort of ideologically driven private sector drive that those opposite say is the for Victoria is in fact more of exactly the same thing that the Victorian State Labor Government should always have rejected. That will be my criticism of that Government - its failure to reject the sort of drivel that these people opposite are still coming forward with. Let us look at some of the alternatives coming on deck from the Federal Labor Government. The last speaker for the Opposition, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), was attempting to down-play the initiatives announced in the One Nation statement relating to transport reform. Nowhere in Australia does anybody stand to benefit more from the tying together of the national rail system than Victoria, with the National Rail Corporation bringing the rail network from Brisbane to Melbourne and from Perth to Melbourne. Nowhere in Australia does a city and a people stand to benefit more than will Melbourne from the sensible tying together of the waterfront, the airport, rail and road in the way that the $5OOm that we have now put on the table will do. Nowhere in Australia are there more benefits. The Opposition had 30 years to do something about six different State rail systems and six different State waterfront authorities, and now would even take the one Federal structure, the Melbourne airport structure-the major growth and job centre built around decent planning, decent social policy and education facilities-and flog it off to whoever wants to buy it. It is the major growth centre in the north-west of Melbourne where there will be 20,000 people working by the year 2000. What is the magic answer of those opposite to that? It is to flog it off to John Elliott and his crew. I tell them now that that would happen only over my dead body; I make that as clear now as I can do. Finally, what is the proposal of those opposite for Victoria? It is, as they say; to abolish seven little taxes and, instead, to bring in one great big one called the GST. I will have a little wager with any member of the Opposition who wants to take me up on this: I guarantee that within the next two months the leader of the Liberal Party in the State Parliament of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, will be running as far away from the consumption tax as he possibly can. He will be unloading himself of this because he knows that Victorians will not cop it. I saw a very interesting little brochure which came out of Queensland the other day. A picture tells a thousand words. On the front page it had a wealthy family saying, 'Thank you, Dr Hewson. Thank you for the $15,000 cut in the 'cost of our car' - it was a Ferrari. They thanked him for the $10 a bottle off the price of their imported French champagne and for the tax deduction for their private school fees, and all the other things that are in the brochure. I turned over the brochure and on the other side there was the ordinary family thanking Dr Hewson for the 15 per cent that will go on their corn flakes, the 15 per cent that will go on to their school kids' clothing, and the 15 per cent that will go on to all the sorts of basic things that they buy - even the milk on the breakfast table to go on the corn flakes. There it was. He. is what I call 'Professor Add a Tax'. We should not be calling him Captain Zero in here but Professor Add a Tax. What the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to add one great big tax to our economy. I tell those opposite right now that Kennett will be running from it at a million miles an hour. In fact, when my National Party colleagues start to work out this nice amorphous thing about scrapping petrol taxes and instead having a road users charge, and when all these country councils which they represent suddenly find out they are going to have to lift the rates-as the Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), well knows will happen-to pay for the roads, because somebody has to pay for them, they will be running at a million miles per hour from this package. It is all very well for those opposite to come into this chamber, to seize on the difficulties in Victoria at the moment and to weep crocodile tears for Victoria. But they have not put forward one single constructive proposal in the last three years relating to Victoria. In fact, they have opposed every single measure. They have never once criticised the banks for failing to pass on the interest rate cuts to small business in Victoria. Now, because of the imminence of the Wills by-election, they choose to seize on this as a cheap political point scoring session. Those opposite are going into the most dangerous thing of all-this big talk down of Victoria's prospects at the very time when major organisations such as Toyota are starting to look seriously at major investment in Victoria; major value adding investment is being considered for Victoria and those opposite are trying to talk it down. That is the worse sin that they can commit when they know that Victoria needs what is beginning to happen. They are trying to talk it down because it does not suit their political objectives. There is a place in this House for some fairness and honesty and for those opposite to recognise that they have a responsibility not to walk around talking down investment in the Victorian economy.

260,Mr COSTELLO,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Higgins) (4.26 p.m.)During the decade of the 1980s, as a result of a surge in the availability of credit and a surge in the money supply and as a result of a . long bull run on the Australian Stock Exchange, a climate developed in Australia where companies were able to highly gear themselves to levels not thought prudent previously and engage in an aggressive takeover strategy on the Australian stock market. We saw the advent of the leveraged buy-out; . we saw the advent of junk bond financing; we saw it great deal of press interest develop in activities of the business community; and we saw business magazines tout a great deal of this activity as the wave of the future. Some of their predictions in retrospect look very bad now. A great deal of glamour was to the . created around this activity. Some of that activity made existing companies more lean and more efficient because a threat that they could be taken over. But there was a degree of that activity which used takeovers basically as a security to borrow tariff more money where money was borrowed on the strength of the share price and where takeovers had to keep going in order to keep the bankers at bay. Some of those companies that involved themselves in that activity as during the decade of the 1980s were in fact basing their share price on glamour, hype, and easy credit, and, when circumstances changed and the Australian stock market turned down, some of those companies of honourable were caught short. If we invest on the stock market we know we are taking something of a risk. We know adwe are investing our money in return for profit by way of dividend, or capital gain by way of movement of share price. I suspect that investors accept that. What they do not accept and what they have every reason not to accept is that their moneys will be used for the personal gain of those operating the companies. They do not expect and they have every right not to expect that their money will be fraudulently taken from them. We use a lot of technical terms when it comes to activities on the stock market. We use terms like 'ramping', 'warehousing' and all sorts of technical terms. When they are all boiled d9wn, these activities can be described . in much more sunple terms such as 'fraud' and 'theft'. Fraud or theft committed by somebody with a white collar is no different in character from fraud or theft committed by somebody who breaks into a house. Investors who put their money. into those companies were entitled to expect that they were going to be protected against fraud; in some very notorious cases they were not. There were also, of course, creditorspeople who traded with some of these companies, who sold goods or sold the servicewaiting for payment, who as a result of collapse have not received that payment. They have given their goods or service and the company has gone down before payment. They find that they have lost their goods or their service and never received recompense for it. I believe what galls those creditors and investors is when they see themselves out of pocket as a creditor or an investor and they go without as a result and yet they see some of those who were operating those companies living very well, thank you very much, without showing any financial strain whatsoever because of the collapse of the company, without going without the necessities of life in the same way as the creditors or the shareholders are, and who seemingly appear immune from the processes of the law. This galls the basic sense of honesty of Australian citizens, and they have every reason to be galled. They have every reason to be galled when they tum on their television and they see somebody living high on the hog, overseas, while they are living in straightened circumstances at home, they having lost their money, and the person overseas seemingly having kept the proceeds or having kept the directors' fees or having kept the fees that came out of the management company that advised the public company on highly remunerative terms. It is not just the injustice of that situation; it is the basic lack of confidence it gives to Australian investors, the people whom we want to encourage to invest in Australian equities, the basic lack of confidence that if one puts one's money into the stock market one is going to be protected against fraud. Let me make it clear: nobody says to a person, and nobody should ever believe, that if he puts his money into the stock market he is safe from risk. He will never be safe from risk. When he puts his money into a company, he invests in the hope of a profit by way of dividend or a capital gain by way of the movement of share price. But he is entitled to be protected against fraud. As we look back over that decade, we can think of a handful of cases of high profile people who seem to be still doing very well and have not been brought to justice. We are entitled as a parliament to ask why. Why is that the case? Why is it that people who come readily to mind do not seem to have been brought to justice? I should make it clear that, until somebody has been brought into a court of law and been convicted on the evidence that has been brought into the court of law, that person is innocent. I am not saying that all those people are guilty. What I am saying is: why have we not brought the charges into the courts? Why have we not had the opportunity to bring those charges and to hear the evidence in a court of law, the proper place? As we look back, we do see there were some obvious failures in relation to corporate administration over the last five to 10 years. Firstly, the funding for those who were -. enforcing the law was inadequate. There is no question about that. Now, with the advent of the Australian Securities Commission, that funding has been improved, and the improvement of funding to the Australian Securities Commission has the full support of the Federal Opposition. Secondly, there was the opportunity, with six State regulators and one national regulator, for those various regulators not to take full responsibility as a result of the overlap of functions, and it was not uncommon for somebody to say, 'It is not our fault; it is their fault'. Where we had six State regulators enforcing laws against companies operating across State borders it was possible for none of those agencies to take responsibility. Therefore, Parliament decided there would be one national regulator. The Federal coalition supported that. The idea of one national regulator, accountable to one national parliament, was that there would be accountability. If there were one regulator, we would know who to blame if things went wrong. We would know who to congratulate if things went right. If there was one parliament which had responsibility, that parliament could take responsibility. It is in fact incumbent upon this Parliament to take responsibility in this area, just as it is incumbent on the Australian Securities Commission to take responsibility. The Australian Securities Commission announced some 18 months ago that it had a hit list of 16 cases that it was actively invesseeming tigating. I think it was unwise to announce what those companies were, but it announced them some 18 months ago. It issued a progress report in February 1992. It said that, of those 16, six have resulted in charges before the courts; in two, investigations have been completed and no charges are appropriate; in three of the others, there was some civil proceeding. But that still leaves eight outstanding. The Australian Securities Commission said in respect of these eight cases that briefs have either been delivered to the Director of Public Prosecutions or will be delivered. It is incumbent upon us as a .Parliament to show some interest in those briefs. We are responsible, as is the agency, and we ought to make it clear to the public that we are interested in· the . completion of all investigations. We do believe it is important to complete these things as soon as possible and to bring these matters before courts of law if that is appropriate, or to close the files if it is inappropriate. But, after 18 months, there is still a way to go. The funny thing is that when charges have actually been brought before the courts there has been a good success rate. The Chief Justice of Western Australia spoke at a conference in this Parliament recently. He said that in that State three charges had been brought against directors under the old section 229. He said that in respect of those three this charges there had been three convictions. So there would be no trouble with the courts enforcing the law; the trouble really is getting the charges into the courts. I will not brook the argument that the law was not good enough and that was why prosecutions have not been brought. We had a lot of law throughout that period-we had about six inches of law. The problem was not that we did not have enough laws; the problem was that we did not enforce the laws that we did have. If we take our eyes off the main game-the main game being enforcing the laws against those who may have transgressed them-we will continue with this long running saga of companies which are subject to complaint and investigation never to have those investigations finalised in the proper place, a court of law, in accordance with justice, which the public is entitled to expect. It needs to be borne in mind, as this Parliament confronts the issue of amending corporations law again, that amendments to the corporations law as it now stands are not for the purpose of bringing to justice those who offended during the 1980s. They will have to be brought to justice wider the laws. as they stood then. The proposals which we have before us are not to have retrospective effect. I believe, in relation to those laws and in relation to that small band of notorious persons, that the laws as they stood in the 1980s were adequate. The question is to bring the charges. The important thing is to make it clear to the public, the Australian Securities Commission and the Government, that progress is expected and that the chapter of the 1980s must be closed under the laws of the 1980s I make that clear at the outset because we are now talking about amending the privilege against self-incrimination under the corporations legislation. It is important to note that in this debate we are talking about amending that prospectively. No-one can incrimination. stand up and claim that this Bill will make prosecution of the notorious promoters of the 1980s easier. It is not retrospective, and congratulate the Attorney-General on that. It will apply only if people are required to produce books or make statements under the provisions of the ASC Act or the corporations law after the coming into force of this Act. The people whose names are on our minds and tongues when we talk about the corporate crooks of the 1980s have, of course, been subject to investigation. We know that from the press release of the ASC, at least. That investigation has taken place under the law it currently stands. It has been conducted under the current law and, as a result, changes in this Bill will not apply to any of those investigations or charges. No-one can pretend-I hope no-one who speaks subsedone quently in this debate does and I do not accuse the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) having so pretended for one moment-that this Bill is directed at past events; this directed at future events. The privilege against self-incrimination an ancient one. It is part of the presumption of innocence. A person is presumed innocent and the presumption of innocence means that a person should not be held or questioned an effort to get him to convict himself. person should be presumed innocent and should be at liberty until evidence comes munity. forward from external sources to warrant his guilt being tried in a court of law in accorAustralian dance with justice. . Secondarily, the privilege against selfthat incrimination is a protection against overon bearing investigators. If there is no protection against self-incriminaticl, investigators could be tempted to hold people in the belief that they ask enough questions they are sure to an incriminating answer sooner or later; that, worse still, if they put enough pressure on the person, sooner or later they get a confession. The abhorrence to that kind of overbearing investigation is the same abhorrence of torture, which was so popular in medieval times to secure confessions. It as a result of that abhorrence that the common law recognised the privilege against selfIn Australia we recognise the privilege against self-incrimination where a person is I 'charged with murder, rape, assault, kidnapping or hijacking. But we do not recognise it, of course, for breach of the corporations law. Currently, for the purpose of administering the corporations law, the Australian Securities Commission can require the production of documents, it can call a person in, it can require a person to take an oath, it can require . a person to answer any question and there is no privilege against self-incrimination. A person can be called in for failure to as lodge a company return, for 'example. In that case, in regard to the privilege against selfincrimination, a person has fewer rights than if he or she were arrested for murder or rape. The law does circumscribe what can be with the information which is gleaned upon such an investigation. The law says that of the answer cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings or proceedings for a is penalty-which I will refer to generically as criminal proceedings or quasi-criminal is proceedings. That is sometimes known as use immunity. The current law also goes further. It says that information which is selfincriminatory cannot be used to gather other in incriminating evidence for admission in A criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. That he is sometimes known as derivative use imThe procedure would be as follows: the Securities Commission can require a person to come before the Commission and person can object to answering a question the grounds of self-incrimination. Where the answer is in fact self-incriminatory, that person has to give it. It is fully admissible in if civil proceedings. It cannot be admitted in get criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings, nor or can it be used to gather further evidence which could be admitted in criminal or quasiare sure to criminal proceedings. The question here is whether derivative use as the immunity should be abolished-that is, whether the information can be used to gather is other evidence which is admissible. To that, the coalition says no. The privilege against self-incrimination is an ancient principle. not a privilege to be given away lightly. It is a protection of the citizen from the state. When it was given away in the Australian Securities Commission Act, it was given away on certain terms. Those terms were that the statement itself could not be used in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings and derivative evidence from that statement could not be used in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. It is now proposed to take away one of those safeguards, which whittles down the privilege against self-incrimination. If we pass that proposal, we give a green light to use incriminating statements to get further evidence which would be admissible and further evidence which, if obtained, would mean that the incriminating statement has led to incriminating evidence. Although the originating statement could not be used, information and evidence derived from it could be used and, in practical terms, the protection of the originating statement will be so much the less. The prosecution will be able to make out a case from the accused's mouth-not with the accused's words, but with secondary evidence obtained as a result of the accused's words. The starting point will be privileged, but the end pomt will not be. It is said that this will make convictions easier, and no doubt in some cases it could. But so could a lot of other things. Taking away the presumption of innocence could make getting convictions easier; admitting hearsay evidence in a criminal trial could make getting convictions easier; abolishing the standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt could make getting convictions easier. But that does not mean that we do those things. This is a question of analysing justice and balancing rights. In this case we come down in favour of the ancient rights-the rights against self-incrimination and the individual's rights. The proposal in the Bill is not the norm in countries that we like to compare ourselves with. For example, it does not apply in the United States, where there was successful prosecution of Boesky Milken and Co. That country has an absolute privilege against selfIt is incrimination. It is protected by the fifth amendment and a doctrine far wider than derivative use immunity; it has a doctrine of transactional immunity. This matter was looked at by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. It is a matter on which one can come to honest opinions both ways. I concede that. Indeed, on that Committee there were both Government and Opposition members who did come to different conclusions. I prefer the view quoted in that report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that is put at 2.3.6, where the Standing Committee 'clearly considers use immunity and derivative immunity as essential complements to removal of access to privilege by legislation'. Indeed, I would like to endorse the recommendation-although the reasoning appears a bit convoluted-of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation that in this particular case there be derivative use immunity in relation to statements, although it was not enamoured of . immunity in relation to the production of books. There has been some loose talk around that current law allows an offender to walk in, produce records and then achieve an immunity from prosecution. Clearly, that is not the case under the current law. That person must be the subject of an investigation; the person must· claim privilege; the person must actually produce documents which would selfincriminate; and then that person would be protected from evidence that he or she, in fact, produced the book. Under the current law, it is the fact that the book was produced which actually cannot be admitted in evidence in a criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding. It is not the book itself; it is the fact that the book has been produced. The book itself is not covered by the current statute. I agree that there should not be a privilege-which is sometimes called a use privilege-against self-incrimination on the production of the book. This Bill also proposes to abolish the use immunity on the fact that books are produced, and in that the Government has our support. The part of the Bill that does not have our support is that which proposes to abolish derivative use immunity in relation to the making of answers, statements or-which is effectively the same thing-a record of interview. Clearly and plainly, no-one would support a situation where somebody could privilege drop books on the investigator and thereby to achieve an immunity. The fact that books are produced should be able to be led in evidence this Bill. in a criminal or quasi-criminal trial. Once the books themselves are led and the fact that they have been produced by the accused be led, the books themselves can become evidence, and they are very potent evidence in the case of corporate crime because books show the money trail. Once we produce the books of a corporation or its banking records and can see where the money went-through the books, into the bank accounts and out again-we have, generally speaking, the best kind of evidence that we can get in relation to corporate crime. We will support the amending of the current law so that one can introduce as evidence in a criminal or quasi-criminal trial the fact that somebody produced a book. We will fully support that. One can produce that book, rely upon that book and rely upon derivative evidence in relation to that book. That is part of the amendment that is being moved.",42
261,Mr KERR,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,That is not in the amendment you will move.,47
262,Mr COSTELLO,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"We will not support that part of the Bill which abolishes derivative immunity in relation to statements and signing records. There is another part of the Bill which wer will also support. It is that part of the Bili which clarifies what is at the moment somewhat vague in the law; that is, whether a corporation has a privilege against selfSecurities incrimination. I am not talking here about directors or officers; I am talking about whether ABC Pty Ltd, as a corporation, can claim a privilege against self-incrimination. This Bill clarifies that and says that there no privilege against self-incrimination corporate person, not an individual. We will support that. As I have already explained, privilege against self-incrimination is an individual and personal liberty; it is there to protect individuals-natural persons. Corporations are fictional persons, if you like; they are not individuals. So we should clarify the law and we should provide that a corporation, as a corporation, cannot claim against self-incrimination. In relation the clarification that self-incrimination does not apply to corporations, we fully support In relation to that part of the Bill that says that a document produced under section 68 can can be admitted and the fact that it was produced can be admitted in relation to criminal or quasi-criminal charges, we will fully support it. That part of the Bill which abolishes derivative use immunity in relation to statements and so on in quasi-criminal and criminal proceedings we will not support. In the committee stage I will move an amendment to take that part out. Will the Government accept that amendment, by the way?",47
263,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,No.,47
264,Mr COSTELLO,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Government will not accept that amendment. As a result, it will be necessary for us to vote against the second reading, as we do not support the Bill as it currently stands, and move to amend the Bill in the committee stage. Let me make it clear that the law, as it currently stands, has not been tested. So much was clear from the report of the Joint Committee. It has, therefore, not been shown that it has prevented any prosecution. The Bill use takes away an ancient privilege. It gives further powers to the Australian Securities Commission, which already has more powers than police would have against an individual charged with murder, rape or other criminal charge. It will be quarantined in operation against notorious offenders. The Australian Commission already has unfettered the power in civil actions. It can use without restrictions self-incriminatory statements in civil actions. The Australian Securities Commission has already indicated that it intends is to move increasingly towards the use of civil for a actions in any event. I believe that the long term answer to the corporations law is to quarantine civil and criminal actions, even if it takes building a Chinese wall. within the ASC: one part full self-incriminatory powers to take civil actions and another part recognising the protection of individual liberties to take the criminal actions. Such is the case in United States, for example, where there two bodies, the Securities Exchange Commisuse sion and the US Justice Department. In the interim, where there is one commission with alternative causes of actions with enormous powers intending to rely increasingly on civil powers as well, we are not of the view whittling down the privilege against selfregulation. incrimination further is necessary and we will move amendments in the committee stage to make that clear.",47
265,Mr KERR,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I regret that in this debate my contribution will be suggest that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is incorrect with respect to the policy that ought to by this House and, more importantly, misNeither understands the impact and effect of the has amendments that he proposes to move. This debate has come before us after a very long time. We have become increasingly case concerned about the enforceability of the person in: corporations law. The debate takes place in an environment where many Australians are extremely disturbed about the low level of standards which have manifested themselves in corporate management throughout this country. It is an environment where those charged with the responsibility of enforcing the corporations law have told this Parliament, through submissions to its committees on repeated occasions, that without the amend particular ments which are being moved by the Governamendment ment through this Bill, they are handicapped and have their hands tied behind their back in the duties we have given them to discharge; that is, to enforce that law. Today we came into this House, the Government having responded to those submissions and following two recommendocument. dations-not by the corporate policemen by two committees which this House esonly tablished with the Senate: firstly, the Select Committee on Corporations Legisprovides lation, known as the Edwards Committee, which considered this matter before the States using changes to the corporations law were implemented and, later, the report of the Joint full Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities-on this specific point. Both those the joint committees recommended to the are Government that we move to eliminate the immunity doctrine. But then we have the . Opposition popping up, like the evil genie out of a bottle, again protecting the shanks and the sharks and being unwilling to face up to the challenge that has been set out for it by that those who are responsible for corporate Let me just go to the question of the law. The honourable member for Higgins says that he would facilitate books that are produced to the ABC being made part of real evidence. to That is. not the effect of the amendment that the honourable member has circulated. Indeed, in proposed subclause (3), he has be followed suggested this language: the statement, or the fact that the person signed the record, as the case may be, nor any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record, as the may be, is admissible in evidence against the (a) a criminal proceeding; The books of a company are both documents and things. Plainly, the amendment which is to be moved by the honourable member would have precisely the opposite effect to that which he purports to support in this House. What he is doing is simply disingenuous. It is plainly a false premise to come into this House and say that he supports a proposition and then to move an which is directly contrary to that end. He comes before us and suggests that a long tradition of civil liberties is being flouted in this regard. Let us examine that proposition. Prior to recent changes, the corporations law never included such a use immunity In fact, it was added against the but recommendation of the Edwards Committee recently. The honourable member for Joint Higgins suggests that the United States a model where the Fifth Amendment prohibits steps such as this, but the United has, as a result, had to adopt a number of measures far more intrusive into civil liberties, far less accommodating to those sorts of values that most of us in this House would wish to have in terms of the enforcement of corporations law. One only has to look at the system of plea bargaining-the way in which civil penalties are traded off against criminal penalties; the wire-tapping; the various other techniques that are used in intrusive investigation which we would not countenance in this country-to suggest that all has to develop because a framework of effective investigation is precluded by the sorts of barriers that are set up under the United States constitution. We do not have any such constitutionally inherited restraints and, indeed, the Opposition opposed any such constitutional amendments. Let us go to the most comparable country where there is a corporate law frameworkthe United Kingdom. Years ago the United Kingdom moved to abolish the very same alleged privilege that the honourable member for Higgins still clings to. Why did the United Kingdom do that? So that it could enforce the corporations law against the corporate shonks. The Guinness prosecution depended fundamentally on having evidence available to the prosecutors derived from compulsory examination of company directors. Did that evoke from those defenders of the common law-the judges in Great Britain-any great outCry? Would we expect that they expressed themselves in outraged terms? Let us look at what was said by the trial judge: . .. those likely to be questioned under that statutory regime are those whose responsibilities under the Companies Act and at common law in relation to shareholders funds and the integrity of the market are reflected in the privileged position they have. It is not asking too much, in my judgement, to impose limits on their civil rights, Parliament has done by an obligation to answer questions in circumstances where those answers may be used in criminal proceedings against them. That even goes much further than the changes proposed by the Government. In Britain the answers themselves can be used in prosecutions. In this case all we are asking is whether the material that is derived from an examination - for example, the very books that the honourable member for Higgins concedes should be admissible-can be used. At present, we have the absurd situation where, in the proper discharge of its responsibilities, the ASC may have a suspicion of some irregularity. It calls before it a person charged with the management of some company or another and says to that person, 'We do not know whether you have done anything that is wrong, but we suspect that there may have been some wrongdoing in your management. Could you produce the books?'. That person then says, 'I claim privilege but, here, I produce the books'. Presently that is thought to preclude the use of the books in prosecutions-and not thought frivolously; it is thought on the advice of the Crown's senior advisers. The amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Higgins does nothing about that point. If I can move on to a point which is crucial to this debate, we have to consider the very premise being suggested by the honourable member for Higgins-that there is some reason why it is improper to use material which is discovered by reason of an examination by the ASC. A very different framework applies in company law from that which applies in most other areas of criminal investigation. It is the kind of regime that applies in law societies throughout this country. The honourable member for Higgins and I are both members of the legal profession which entitles the Law Society, if it suspects any wrongdoing on our part, to call us before it and to examine us as to our alleged misconduct. If there is any material arising from that examination from which a prosecution is to be brought, that material can be used. Why is it that in professions such as the law we as sanction our own loss of the right of protection against self-incrimination? It is because we are a trusted profession, because we put the interests of the community above those of our own membership, and because people dealing with our profession have an entit1ement to regard us as putting the interests of the community in front of our own. We do have a privileged position. So our internal regulation, our internal management, does not allow us to treat ourselves as if we are no different from murderers, as if we are no different from rapists or as if we are common cheats. Because of our privileged position, we subject ourselves to a regime of regulation and scrutiny above that of the ordinary citizen. So too is the case among people who place themselves in positions of special responsibility in the corporate world. In evidence before us a leading witness, Mr Santow, gave three reasons why in his opinion corporate crime is unlike conventional crime. He said firstly: the immediate victim, the company, is an inanimate legal fiction often controlled by the perpetrator at the time, unlike the human victim of theft. There is therefore typically no human victim with direct familiarity with the circumstance-so that the prosecution is forced to rely on the perpetrator for evidence. Secondly, he said: for this reason and because of the complexity of the facts documentary evidence is essential. But it is only useful if it can be identified and explained by the perpetrator and by other enquiries yielding other evidence not precluded by derivative use inum :ty. He continued, thirdly: unlike ordinary theft, the accused has generally exploited the privilege of carrying on business with limited liability using the public's money, either as shareholder or creditor. I cannot but agree with those remarks. Mr Justice Rogers, of the commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, recently argued that the officers of a company voluntarily entered a privileged legal position which carries with it an obligation, in event of failure: to explain what happened, why it happened, what. was done by the executives in carrying on the business, even if the disclosures mean that criminal, liability may be proved against the making the disclosure. Again, that is a proposition with which I no disagreement. It seems to me this is circumstance dissimilar to the regulations govern the legal profession. In entering into the profession, we voluntarily subject ourselwas ves to a set of ethics and rules of conduct set us apart from and beyond the ordinary citizen, who is entitled not to have anyone require of him an answer to an allegation theft, rape or fraud. But we, as professionals who voluntarily enter the profession of law, subject ourselves to a stricter and sterner regime. Why is it not so with persons entering into the responsible positions of management of companies? Why should we not expect stricter standards from the people who are, as Mr Justice Rogers says, responsible for the management of companies which have in their hands substantial public moneys, in which people have invested their futures, or in which they have lost substantial investments-people who voluntarily gain the benefit of the very substantial advantages that incorporation provides? Why should we not expect of them also a higher and different standard? In my view, the answer is plainly that we should. If somebody becomes a company director, in my view that person is placed in a very different circumstance from that of an ordinary citizen. The corporate structure brings with it substantial advantages, the most important of those advantages being the right of limited liability. Limited liability prevents the debts of a company being carried through to become the debts of those charged with mismanagement. Because of that, companies can go broke without personal financial damage-unless a person has given a personal guarantee-to the individuals in its management. There are very substantial risks of abuse if we do not have a good regime against fraud and against ill-conduct on behalf of those charged with the management of our major companies. In that regard, I agree entirely with the conclusions of the majority report of civil, or the Joint Statutory Committee on Corperson porationS and Securities. The Committee argues that there is a balance in this area have given the evidence of the ASC when it came not a before the Committee and argued that a that numbet of investigations had been impeded, that its manner of conducting investigations being thwarted by the present legal that framework, and that change was necessary to give it the capacity to be an effective corporate regulator. The ASC was backed up by of a number of very substantial witnesses from the legal profession and from the business community. Therefore, in my submission· it is peculiar that, there having been two inquiries of this House in which both parties have been represented, both reporting majority findings in favour of provisions of the kind now being moved by the Government, the Opposition now places itself decisively on the side which will still permit evasions and legal fictions stand in the way of effective corporate policing. The amendments proposed to be moved by the honourable member for Higgins place us back where we have no need to go. There is no reason why Australia should shy away from the kinds of proposals moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). They are substantially milder proposals than those which have been adopted in the United Kingdom. They are proposals which balance the interests of the community with those of individuals charged· with corporate management. On this point, although a corporate manager will have the right to have his statement absolutely privileged and not able to be used in criminal prosecution, if his statement leads on to other material being found that material can be used. We should not have the absurd situation where, in the course of giving evidence or responding to a requirement for an investigation under the ASC, a person charged with corporate management raises an issue which leads investigators to documents or to some physical evidence which then cannot be prQduced in court because it flowed from its being found out of that examination. That is an absurdity; it leads to injustice; it leads the law being seen as merely a matter of advantage to those in positions of high corporate responsibility; and it leads to the law being seen in a very poor light indeed. So I commend the proposals that the Attorney has presented to the House and urge that they be supported by both this House and, later, the Senate.",48
266,Mr MOORE,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"This is the third time. I have made an attempt to speak on company law; I have only managed to get to two minutes on the other occasions, so I thought I would try to say a few words in the broader sense as well as on the matter at hand, the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill. At the present moment we are suffering from a sense of disappointment at the way in which company law has been admihistered in Australia, a sense of great disappointment at the way in which the ASC, the great white to hope of Lionel Bowen and the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), has operated since its implementation. As a consequence of that, I am indebted to Bill Beerworth, who is a member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. I will just quote from him as to the procedures by which reform or amendments come about, 'as seen by a practitioner but a non-member of parliament. He said: 1. A decision is made that a ""reform"" is necessary. The decision is often based on a report or investigation. 2. A team from the Attorney-General's Department sorts out the policy internally and obtains a draft from the Parliamentary Counsel. Usually, parts of the report are jettisoned because they do not appeal for one reason or another. 3. A Bill is introduced and enthusiastically recommended by the Attorney-General (or other responsible Minister). He thereby obtains a vested interest in its passage and his ego and reputation tend to be on the line. 4. Inevitably, an unrealistically short time is allowed for what is euphemistically called ""consultation"". This is usually extended if the matter at hand is completed and there is sufficient complaint. 5. The Attorney-General (or other Minister) tends to resent any criticism and redoubles his determination to push the ""reform"" through Parliament. to Commentators and critics are dismissed as misguided, reactionary or politically motivated. 6. Submissions, representations are carefully acknowledged and compiled, but given short shrift. 7. The Legislation is guillotined through Parliament. Hear, hear to a lot of that! He also goes on to make this observation: . I know from my own experience on the Advisory Committee that there is in reality very little opportunity to comment and disagree, and disagreement was taken to be ignorance or evidence of negative attitude. That is pretty strong stuff from a member of the Advisory Committee. It reflects, I think, pretty much on the process of reform. Something that I consistently quoted to the Government in the past when the legislation was being brought in is that there is really very little to do with reform; there is a great deal to do with centralisation, the old concept of a grab for power. Prior to the 1989-90 Bill coming in, requests for reforms or amendments were deferred. Mr Bowen objected to them. He did not want amendments at that stage; they were all put to one side. His view was that we must have the new grand design. And we got that. The amount of $8m was quite deliberately chafed off the NCSC, and $120m was put into the ASC. It has a great set-up! But we now look for results from it. The Chairman of the ASC, Mr Hartnell, is publicly on record as saying he is disappointed iliat it has not got results. He got the money. He is very pleased that he has the best computer system in the world. Having got the best computer system in the world, what are we. going to do with it? We are going to require proprietary companies to lodge reports half-yearly. Who are the stickybeaks and what is that all about? There is no necessity for that, except that it fits in with the total build-up of the bureaucracy in this area. I hope that we might be able to avoid those extra costs to business and avoid that extra incursion into privacy within an area. The objects of a proprietary company are that, though generally small. They are generally of a minor nature in business. If they are above a minor nature, anybody dealing with the proprietary company who does not get a personal guarantee from those concerned has not exercised due diligence. Because of that due diligence, we are going to enforce upon the oper-tors of these companies, presumably, the reqUlrement that they put up an enormous amount of money to go into these areas of registration.",51
267,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,Where is this legislation that you are talking about now?,52
268,Mr MOORE,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,I am talking about the proposals that the Attorney has around and relate to these issues.,52
269,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Oh, proposals!",52
270,Mr MOORE,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,They are part of the ones that ought to be discussed more.,52
271,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,They are.,52
272,Mr MOORE,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Yes, but people outside make comments on these things. The Business Council of Australia, the great supporter of the Attorney's scheme, has now turned on him because he is not listening to it. The advisory committee which the AttomeyGeneral set up is telling him things that he does not want to hear, so he turns off. That is what is gqing on in the game. He does not take any responsibility for it. Beerworth says in this document, 'The consultative committee is ignored'. What does one expect? In effect, what we forecast would happen when the new legislation was brought forward is precisely what has happened. The agenda of company law in Australia is now run from the Federal Attorney-General's Department. Canberra is a long way from Collins Street and Pitt Street and the operators of the nation. While that state of affairs persists, while the chief advisory committee is offside and while· the Business Council us offside, we are going to have continuing problems. Amendments to company law are not things that have to be brought in overnight, but they have to be made with consideration,· consultation and understanding of the problems at hand. If not, we will always have those problems. More importantly to the matter at hand at the moment",52
273,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,Good.,52
274,Mr MOORE,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"It is good because if things have been guillotined through before there is never time to catch up. I wish to refer to what is proposed in a general sense. I think the proposals put forward here do have some merit. I have always held the. view that in corporate life, if one accepts the responsibility of being a director in a corporation, one is in a special position of trust. The use of immunity has been stretched to the limit in a lot . of cases. I am aware of certain individuals who have acted in corporations in which the law has been taken to the line-in my view, over the line. No-one has been prepared to take those particular corporations on because of the weight of money involved or because of the reputations at hand. Some very big names are involved in what I am referring to. We as an opposition have a constant policy of encouraging savings,and I hope that we as a nation have a policy to encourage savings, to encourage 'investment, to encourage private investment. To do those things we do not want to have the constant underswell in the nation outside among the ordinary investorsnot just the professiorial investors but the ordinary investors in Australia, those referred to as the mums and dads in the press these days. They must be able to feel that people will act as their trustees in some respects. Far too often, a lot of corporate directors and executive management, and those who fill both positions, act in their own interests before they act in the interests of the corporation-and therefore the individual. There are many examples of that. That has, done Australia enormous harm. It does the investor enormous harm., It has really only been in recent times that some of the superannuation funds of major institutions have blown the whistle on some of the activities that have taken place. There is no doubt that some major corporations feel themselves above the interests of their minor shareholders, and therefore the minor investors have to take a role. There is no doubt that in some medium sized corporations, both industrial and mining, the tendency has been for some of the directors and/or executive directors to regard that as a wholly personal operation. The costs involved and the use of corporate money in those companies has been handled in such a way that an attempt has been made to make it look as though that money really is the person's money rather than the corporation's money. As a consequence, there is a lot of merit making those sorts of people, if they choose to pick up the benefits, wear the liabilities. The time will come when, unless governments are prepared to look at those responsibilities, either institutions or individuals will have to be prodded into it or we will run the real risk of shutting out the smaller investor, except as a punter, in the investment forums of the nation. Why should he be interested in taking a long term view of corporations if that is generally regarded as the way corporations go? He is better off down at the racetrack and getting a result on the spot rather than putting his money into a corporation where he cannot trust the people concerned. So I see some particular benefit in that. I also listened to the previous speaker when he spoke about the way in which people get around the Fifth Amendment in America. I am well aware of the Guinness prosecutions in Great Britain. That was a hallmark case in itself. I am also aware that here currently the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 empowers the Commissioner to disregard the question of civil liberties almost totally. He can demand evidence and books and use them. Under the, Trade Practices Act, but not quite as forcibly, the same thing broadly applies in relation to corporate maters. The Queensland Wire case was one in which a lot depended on the evidence which was extracted in the iIiquiry. I now move to some of the things that occurred in recent times. In the case of the Interwest iIivestigation, when it was sought to interview Mr Avram he personally sought to be examined under section 19 of the Australian Securities Commission Act so that he could get some immunity. Therefore, the ASC ,backed off. Much the same thing happened in relation to some inquiries into Occidental ,Life, Regal Life and Qintex, to mention a few. On top of that we have the case of the Bond Corporation, where there was an inquiry under way but it was made known to the people concerned that, if that was to occur, some of the witnesses were quite prepared and willing and able to arrive with car loads of boxes of documents to dump on the inquiry. As a in consequence, that was regarded as not a way, and the ASC called a halt to further hearings in that particular area. That indicates to me ' that the processes of investigation are being impaired in this area. It also raises, in my mind, whether the ASC ought to have a criminal as well as a civil responsibility. If we completely cut away the criminal aspect of the ASC and restrict it to civil actions, and sharpened up the act of the DPP in these areas, we might be able to proceed at a faster rate and get a far better result than we are currently getting. I think those aspects ought to be looked at as part of the changes that we are now considering. What is being proposed at the moment is really only a bit part of the process rather than a complete look at the whole. There are problems when we centralise things the way we do. I recall the Rothwells problems when Lionel Bowen was Attorney-General. Day after day in Question Time. I used to ask the Attorney-General why, under section 291(2), he would not investigate Rothwells. Of course, as time went by we found out. Those sorts of things do become uncomfortable when we have so much of the centralisation here; Ministers will have to answer those questions. It will not be good enough to say that a report has been furnished on a matter or that it is not our responsibility. These problems will occur in that case. In conclusion, a lot of the amendments that have been put forward in company law are piecemeal; they are not part of the overall picture. As a result of the way in which the Bill was introduced, we are going to have ongoing amendments that should have been dealt with in the past, that should have been thought out at the time. As a consequence, we are getting more and more black letter law that, like the Income Tax Assessment Act, will become somewhat unrelated down the trail. Further investigations will produce pressures to tighten this or to adjust that, and these amendments will create a lot more difficulties within the companies of Australia. There is no doubt that there is a lot of dissatisfaction. Outside people do not understand Australians why we have not been able to come to grips with the relative crimes that have occurred. It may be trivial to say it, but in 1989 Victorian police figures showed that the cost of corpodefrauded rate fraud cases was nearly $350m, whereas ordinary crime and armed robbery was $3m. Yet we are negligent, in my view, in chasing these matters. The Government has not delivered on company law. It has been a disappointing performance. That is now acknowledged by its great supporters in this area. I hope that in the years that lie ahead, and the many amendments that lie ahead, we will see greater effort and determination put into this matter.",52
275,Mr MELHAM,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill. I suppose the first question someone might ask is: why is someone who practised as a public solicitor and then as a .public defender for more than a decade in New South Wales rising to support a Bill that limits the privilege against self-incrimination of witnesses before investigations and hearings initiated by the Australian Securities Commission? The answer to that is fairly simple. I have a particular view when it comes to white-collar crime and I will start with the views that I expressed in my maiden speech on 11 September 1990. They .ring as true today as they did then. I said: The 19808 has been a decade of excess and wasted opportunities. We have seen the unprecedented accumulation and concentration of wealth, all in the name of free enterprise. The irresponsibility and damage caused by corporate cowboys is just now becoming apparent. The high flying entrepreneurs of the 19808, who prospered at society's expense and proceeded to flaunt their new found wealth, have either disappeared or are in their death throes. Society does not mourn their passing but is burdened with their funeral expenses. Australia cannot afford to be taken on a roller-coaster ride with mavericks who are concerned solely with,their own interests. Yet these corporate cowboys have the audacity to claim that they are working in the national interest, that their interests and the national interest are somehow one and the same. Their empty rhetoric has been exposed for what it is. I went on to welcome the coming into being of the Australian Securities Commission on 1 January 1991. I said: No longer will corporate excesses be tolerated. have underestimated the cost of corporate crime to our nation. An individual who steals $20 is dealt with more severely by the legal system than is a company which has deliberately its shareholders and the Government of millions of dollars. It is obscene. . . In my opinion, the legislation was flawed at . the time, because it created an inequity in the legal system. Criminal justice principles should be applied equally to all kinds of offences but are inappropriate in relation to corporate crime. I am of that view for the same reason as the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities stated in its report at paragraph 4.8: The nature of corporate crime also distinguishes it from 'ordinary' crime. The perpetrators of corporate crimes are generally exploiting the privileged position they occupy; they may be the only people with actual knowledge of the crime; there is no clear victim. . . and much of the evidence will be in the form of records kept by the perpetrators. It is my view that protections appropriate under the general criminal law for an. individual who is statistically likely to be poorer, less educated, less sophisticated and less able to obtain first-class legal representation are not indispensable in terms of the balance of interests for corporate offenders, who tend to be well educated, adept at concealing the evidence of their crimes and well versed in the relevant law, with access to the most expert legal representation. The minority report says this in relation to the balance of public interests: There is a balance to be struck between the public interest in bringing lawbreakers to justice and the public interest in preserving the rights and liberties society affords its citizens. Where that balance is set is crucial to the sort of community - e live in. In terms of corporate law, the balance comes down on limiting the privilege against selfincrimination, because it has been demonstrated that we have smart lawyers rolling in with their accountants, manipulating the law anc;l, in effect, giving themselves immunity from prosecution. It is interesting that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has not really been able to answer a number of questions raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), in his second reading speech on this legislation. I want to quote some of the things the Parliamentary Secretary said in his second reading speech which need to be addressed. He said: The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions; the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud, have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions as the 'use immunity' prevents the admission of evidence of the fact that a particular person produced a particular document, and the 'derivative use immunity' protects evidence gained as a result of answers to questions. . . pursuit of remedies for the protection of shareholders and creditors may prevent successful criminal prosecutions, while major suspects whose evidence could uncover other serious offences calling for wider inquiries tend to _ be questioned narrowly, if at all, because the ' derivative use immunity provisions would allow them to escape conviction and punishment. ' What is the Opposition's answer to that problem raised in the second reading speech? The Parliamentary Secretary went on: It is also possible for persons to exploit, quite consciously, the immunity provisions by claiming that answers may tend to be self-incriminating, then making a full confession, thereby ensuring that no evidence will be admissible against them in criminal proceedings. What is the Opposition's answer to that? That is the basic problem. It was interesting to listen to the speech of the honourable member for Higgins, because he would have us believe that this Bill was, in effect, changing the ground rules for the corporate crooks-the offenders-of the 1980s. Exactly the opposite is true. Unfortunately, when the Australian SecuritieS Commission came into force on 1 January 1991, the ground rules of the 1980s were changed to the advantage of the corporate crooks. What we are seeking to do in this Bill is go back to the law as it applied during the 1980s so that they can be prosecuted under the law as it then was. How do we go out into the community and defend the fact that the corporate crooks of the 1980s are escaping prosecution because. of legislation that came into effect on 1 January 1991? It is indefensible. For the honourable member for .Higgins to suggest that because this is not retrospective legislation, the corporate cowboys and the corporate crooks of the 1980s will not be able to be prosecuted as this legislation will not apply to them is a misreading of the situation. I think he needs to check his law books and get some decent legal advice, because this Bill returns the law to its position during the 1980s. The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions have categorically stated that they have refrained from examining some of the people who they suspect committed criminal offences in the 1980s, because of the problems associated with derivative use immunity. Once we amend this law, we will go back to the law as it applied in the 1980s, the particular individuals will be able to be examined, and the law as it then was will be applied to them. So those who are examined after the enactment of this legislation, notwithstanding that the offences occurred in the 1980s, will be able to be dealt with in a court of criminal law on the law as it then was. I suppose it does not really surprise me that the Opposition jumps up in the Parliament today and defends its 'class' mates. What we have here is a privileged position for whitecollar criminals. I do not need the honourable member for Higgins coming into this place and lecturing me about white collar crime, and ordinary crime, and the consistency of it. There is no consistency. The statute books are riddled with inconsistencies that show class bias against working class people. It is a different piece of legislation that deals with someone who breaks into a house out of necessity to feed himself or his family, and the legislation that we have on the books that deals with corporate criminals who rip off shareholders and the community for millions of dollars. Corporate crooks are treated much more leniently, and derivative use legislation is a bonus to them. All a perpetrator of a serious white-collar crime from the 1980s needs to do is roll into an investigation with the Australian Securities Commission, have a smart lawyer, and set himself up to being immune from prosecution forever and a day. It is just not on. For the honourable member for Higgins to come in here and talk about overbearing investigations, and equate what the police do in police stations with what the Australian Securities Commission investigators do with white-collar criminals in the company of their lawyers is an absolute nonsense. I do not get up here lightly today to support this legislation. I have given it some consideration. In my view the balance comes down in the public interest. The charade that occurred in the 1980s cannot be allowed to pass, with people being allowed to 'get away with it' through legislation that was only introduced on 1 January 1991. It has far more reaching consequences than was anticipated when it went through the Parliament. It is my understanding of the situation that the legislation would be checked over time. It was not ever felt that that legislation would remain as is forever and a day. It was acknowledged that there would be weaknesses in the legislation, and this is a glaring weakness. I anticipate that other speakers will bring some of the inconsistencies of this particular piece of legislation to the attention of the House. I do sympathise with the minority report of Senator Barney Cooney and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) in terms of the principles that they enunciate. I say to the House and to others that we are dealing with a special case. Serious corporate fraud perpetrated by white-collar criminals is in a special category. We hear about deterrence effect. The trouble with white-collar crime is that it goes undetected for a long time. It is not like a simple break in or a robbery where we know about it within a very short time and we know that there was a victim. The victims of corporate crime may take years to come forward or years to discover the crime that took place. What we need are really special provisions in relation to it. We need to be able to say that this is a special category we are dealing with or we cannot be taken seriously. Day in and day out, when I was appearing in the criminal courts, I was told about the deterrence effect. This legis-ation is the greatest deterrence to white-collar criminals that this Parliament can introduce. The clear message will go out, 'You can bring in your lawyers and your accountants, but you are not going to get away with it if you are discovered.' The legislation as it stands at the moment allows white-collar criminals to set themselves up with a defence for life. We really need to look at that very carefully because we will have a situation where the main perpetrator the crime will come in, cooperate with the Australian Securities Commission, be the informer, and then the secondary offenders and the small fish will be the ones who are picked up in the wash. That is an obscene situation. I do not need the honourable ber for Higgins coming in here and lecturing me and saying that what we are doing is overturning centuries and centuries of traditions in relation to corporate offences. We are not. What we are overturning is something that came into being on 1 January 1991 and is fatally flawed. It sets us up as a government, as a parliament, to ridicule and mockery ordinary people in the community. It guarangested, tees that if the corporate cowboys of the 1980s play their cards right and get the legal advice, they will be immune from prosecution. They are laughing all the way to the bank, and all the way to their overseas holiday places. It is not a situation where people should be treated 'equally' before law because the law is unequal. This legisdirectors lation that we are seeking to amend gives white-collar criminals special privileges that do not attach to those charged with break, enter and· steal, with murder, with ordinary crimes of \dolence or ordinary crimes against property. White-collar criminals under this legislation have had privileged legislation that enables them to get off the hook. I am not surprised that the Opposition comes into this Parliament and opposes this particular section. It is consistent with the class of people it purports to represent. I do not have much reservation in rising to support this Bill because, on balance, I think it is the right thing to do. think it strikes the right balance. That is what we need to sit back and have a look at. I can get up here and argue the civilliberpractices ties point of view and the defendant's point of view, but it would be irresponsible to do so because it is not in the broader public interest. It is just not on to take that fine, neat; eloquent little legal point because the community that is going to suffer. It is who are the community's representatives who will pay in the long term. I want to send of message to the corporate c!'Ooks of the 1980s. I say to them, 'We are not finished with you yet. We are going to seek you out, and if we catch you, you are going to the criminal courts. You are not just going to get a fine, and you are not going to get away with it memscot-free'. (TIme expired)",54
276,Mr MCARTHUR,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,I rise to speak on this matter because of my interest in the .role of directors of public companies and the problem the legislature has in legislating for honesty in these matters. Obviously the question of the rples and responsibilities of directors of public companies is very complex. As the honourby able member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has sugdirectors occupy a position of trust as a director of a public or private company. right There was a quotation in Saturday's Age which I think covered my concern. It reads 'Costly law suits scare potential board directors'. My worry has been that the legalities all surrounding the activities of directors of the public companies would be such that those who act in an honest manner will be scared off from taking responsible positions in public companies because of their concern that they might be caught up in a prosecution not of their own choosing. The main thrust of the speech of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was that all directors were corporate criminals in the 1980s.,57
277,Mr MELHAM,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,They were potentially.,57
278,Mr MCARTHUR,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Potentially. I suggest that most company directors, both in the private and the public arena, are honest and try at most times to conduct the affairs of their companies in an honest fashion according to the law as they understand it. That is I the background of my interest in the whole matter. Obviously it is a fairly complex legal argument and involves some long, traditional which are now being overturned. The central argument has raged through the latter part of the 1980s, and continues, as to how the Australian corporate regulators should treat those directors whose conduct is it is known or thought to be against the law. we Should they be gaoled, is a civil action the most appropriate, or should any enforcement a agencies use both powers? Other speakers have raised both those issues. Is the use of called kangaroo courts or star chambers justified given that many others are often adversely affected by the actions of directors, or should the many responsibilities that go with both public and private company directorships be recognised by affording various protections under the law in an attempt to ensure that Australian society does not deter its most competent persons from taking an active role as directors in the execution of. company affairs? The Bill before the House continues the ALP's long held belief-and the honourable member for Banks supported it-that the ills of society can be cured or, at worse, substantially minimised by additional regulation. The Bill removes immunities that cover a basic tenet of criminal law, the right to remain silent. Presently, under the corporations law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, there are two protections available. The first concept, use immunity, prevents the admissibility of evidence that has been obtained by either oral examination or the production of virtually any business records provided that the witnesses claim that these statements or records might result in selfincrimination. ' Derivative use immunity places the onus on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an item of evidence has not been obtained as a result of information subject to use immunity; in other words, that this information is not a direct or indirect consequence of use immunity or secondary evidence. There does not seem to be much argument that use immunity should be abolished in relation to the production of documents, and I agree with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who is at the table, and other speakers about this. It is critical to note that the Act is not retrospective and hence will largely not cover the activities of the entrepreneurs in the last decade that have been the subject of much public scrutiny. The last speaker spent most of his speech discussing those particular individuals. One of the favourite techniques of the Bond Corporation has been to have the documents tabled at an investigation by the Australian soSecurities Commission and then to claim the documents will tend to be self-incriminating so that the Australian Securities Commission is unable to mount a criminal prosecution linking the previously produced records with the individual concerned. The amendment to abolish immunity currently available under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 in relation to documents would make it more difficult for prosecution to be avoided. The move to abolish derivative use immunity under both the ASC and corporations laws for the spoken word demands much greater attention in' my view. It must be remembered that witnesses under both the ASC Act and the corporations law are compelled to give evidence. Here we are talking about a fundamental concept of criminal law, the presumption of innocence until proof of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt is established. Ending what is an effective right to remain silent is a contentious and major step under this proposal. Both the ASC and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions claim that the present law greatly restricts their ability to launch successful criminal prosecutions against company directors. I note that there is some disagreement emerging between these two bodies, with the DPP's Director, Mr Michael Rozenes, suggesting that corporate wrongdoers should not escape merely because they wore white shirts and carried .expensive briefcases. By contrast, the ASC's Chairman, Mr Tony Hartnell, is of the' opinion tha-, if the ASC is I perceived as an organisation whose speciality is criminal prosecution, there is no long term future for it. These comments strike at the very heart of the debate. Is it appropriate that the powers of a statutory body such as the ASC are further extended beyond what is normally applicable in criminal trials for matters such as an allegation of murder? What should be the appropriat- balance between the protection of a director's rights as an individual and complying with the law? The roles of directors must be examined. Directors are responsible to shareholders and must comply with reporting and disclosure requirements laid down by both the corporations law and, in the case of listed companies, by the stock exchange. The perfonnance of directors is scrutinised by financial journalists, government and interest groups. Directors may be subject to criminal s-ctions. Indemnification for their actions is difficult and, even where available, insurance premiums have skyrocketed, a cost which adds to the overheads incurred by most companies, and the quotation that I took from the Age last Saturday indicated the movement upward of these insurance premiums. It can be seen that directors have onerous duties, whether they be in private or public corporations. The effect of companies and securities legislation must be to ensure that markets work efficiently and ethically. But this should not be at the cost of making the most able and most talented within the Australian community reluctant to take on the stewardship and directorship of Australia's major companies. Both the courts and the legislature have developed concepts that recognise that capital has to be efficiently organised. The protection of limited liability ensures that the whole of a person's capital is not put at risk through participation in what could be merely a passive investment. Australia should be giving some consideration to whether there are any worthwhile elements in the so-called business judgment rule operating in the United States whereby directors who make informed business decisions in the best interests of their company are protected, whether or not that judgment later is shown to have been vindicated by events. This defence to a civil action is not unlimited, with courts refusing to extend it to where there is proof of fraud surrounding the decision. It has also run into some problems in the United States where courts have failed to recognise that there are often many inherent bars that reduce actions against company directors. Having said that, the principle has some worthy elements. Australia faces many problems in attracting foreign investment. There have been some claims that Australia is reg-rded as being too soft on corporate criminals and that this acts to deter foreign investment. I believe that other factors such as management of the economy are far more significant. If overseas investors do not perceive the Australian process of policy making to be delivering certainty, they may be reluctant to be long tenn investors. Australia needs to move away from the idea of black letter law-which the honourable member for Ryan alluded to-which sets out in minute detail what should and should not apply. As the Chairman of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, Mr David Kelly, recently noted, this trend has imposed great costs on the business community, but many of these laws, including those under discussion today, have not been fully tested in the courts. This literal approach seems to date from the time of Sir Garfield Barwick in the High Court, when the Income Tax Assessment Act was interpreted in a very strict way. I think we need to move away from this idea, and there is an alternative method of legal resolution available. Fuzzy law, which sets out in general principles the standards expected of company directors, has much to recommend it. The adoption of fuzzy law will guide courts away from technicalities and towards substance in law. The Bill before the House today, because it removes the right to remain silent in some cases, effectively imposes a strict code of conduct on a small group of individuals and therefore is moving away from what is desirable. One of the strongest arguments for not abolishing derivative use immunity in relation to the spoken word is that the ASC must not become a latter day star chamber. In its short life span the ASC has shown itself capable of monitoring some individuals' lives closely. Whilst I make no judgment on the merits of the case, I note that former Elders Resources director, Mr Geoff Lord, was charged with alleged offences under the acquisition of shares code in December 1990. Over the next 14 months, prior to the charges being dropped, Mr Lord was in the media spotlight fairly constantly, to say the least. Too often if legislation is not perceived to be working there is a tendency to go in for overkill. I think some of the problems the ASC is facing could be solved by the disallowance of immunity in respect of documents, and other speakers have supported that view. The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions regard it as vital that witnesses cooperate. The attitude of the Premier of South Australia, as expressed in a submission to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporation,s and Securities, is: ... witn-es frequently would not cooperate if their evidence was likely to be self-incriminatory ... primary concern is that any amendments to sub-sections 597(12) and 68(3) may result in increased levels of non-cooperation... will only further restrict the ability of the ASC to pursue its regulatory responsibilities. . . Australia has slightly over 870,000 private and 10,000 public companies. The Securities Commission has so far commenced only 61 prosecutions after investigating some 200 matters. The debate should really hinge on business ethics. Abolishing the derivative use immunity will not result in better ethical standards in Australian business life. This education process really has to start before and at school and in the home, but education authorities must stress to teaching staff at primary, secondary and tertiary levels that probity in personal lives has to extend to the business world. Before the Government moves to remove the protection against self-incrimination for non-voluntary statements, it should be very careful. Although the ASC speaks of a poisoned chalice because of its supposed inability to undertake criminal prosecutions, I think that the estimated $71m allocated to the ASC enforcement activities against the extra $41m the previous year tells a slightly different story. . I do not really think the Government adjudges allegations of corporate crime to have more serious consequences than an allegation of murder and, therefore, I believe that derivative use immunity for oral statements should be continued. The law will be out of balance if by this Bill an accused murderer had the right to remain silent but then, when at a later stage he was said to be involved in a corponite scam, he lost his right when under examination by the Australian Securities Commission. Altering this currently afforded protection will not result in the entrepreneurs of the 1980s being treated any differently, as the Bill is not retrospective, nor will it serve to promote a spirit of cooperation between governmental agencies such as the ASC and the private sector that ultimately funds such agencies' activities. Business men and women must not be said to have less civil rights merely becaUse they swap roles from Mr John Citizen to Mr John Citizen, Director of ABC Pty Ltd.",57
279,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992 and to support the endeavours of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in this respect as part of the ongoing reform process in corporations law to make our corporations law more relevant. In this respect, the evidence provided by. the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities is important, and certainly the evidence given by the Australian Securities Commission to that Committee is important. That is, we have a process by which the ASC, having been in the field for some time, is now saying to the Government, 'We believe this is a more appropriate way to go in terms of dealing with this question of .use immunity and derivative use immunity'. I have heard the Opposition on this, and I think a focus is needed in terms of the. experience of corporate law reform in Australia. I say this to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) with the best of intention: when we originally began this process of removing the cooperative scheme, his colleagues were a bit reluctant to come to the party in terms of a national scheme. There really was this notion that it should be left to the States, and we ought not be dabbling in this area. I must say, to be fair, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) ultimately came i to see the sense of the move towards the Australian Securities Commission, but it was a pretty slow process and there was a lot of lobbying that went on from some of the States arid certainly from the State of Queensland. We ought not be surprised at some of the speeches that get made here from time to time. Those speeches were really saying, 'We do not think the Commonwealth should be in this business'. The reason why I have a particularly' strong view about this, of course, is that I come from Western Australia where I am SUbjected to two pressures: firstly, probably a fair amount of corporate abuse of shareholders and taxpayers generally and, secondly, a very substantial lobby that was mounted by a Western Australian industry group that really said, 'We don't wantany part of this new move towards the ASC'. We did hear evidence in Perth in 1989, probably the most hostile environment in which evidence was taken in that process. But I find when talking to the same people in Perth that they are now firm advocates of the Australian Securities Commission. In fact, one of the gentlemen who led the group and worked with one of the major law firms in Perth recently delivered a paper in which he said how happy he was with the current circumstance. That is not to say, of course, that everything we do must therefore be given the nod and said of it that there is no problem. I want to just focus on that issue because this has not been a circumstance of easy birth. There was an enormous misrepresentation that w-nt on in relation to the establislunent of the ASC, including the Australian company numbers matter. This was supposed to be part of an overall conspiracy. We ended up with the League of Rights involved, in fact. The attempt to bring Australia into the 1990s in terms of management of corporate law and the proper conduct of corporate law enforcement has been a process much troubled and not without a few hurdles. I am pleased to say, having gone through a lot of difficulties in this process, we are now much better placed to go into an improved area of corporate law reform. I think this element is very central. The reason I· say that is that, when one looked at the particular issue that is being addressed here, the fact that evidence is taken in a hearing, there was nothing to stop some of the more prominent people-and names come to mind: Mr Bond, Mr Connell and Mr Skase-going into one of those hearings, simply dumping a lot of documents and subsequently claiming privilege. Incidentally, I think we have some difficulty in Western Australia in relation to our own royal commission because of the spread of the hearing at the moment. I wonder what will transpire in terms of future proceedings in jurisdictions other than the royal commission. That is an issue that we as a community need to address-the interaction between the royal commission and what may be subsequent proceedings; all of which is very necessary in order to restore some public faith. The honourable member made the point about there being no retrospectivity. There would not be because, fundamentally, even if we had the most shiny case, there is no way we could convince some of the luminaries in the Senate to ever see the sense of what we are trying to do. This is a fairly shiny case, but I know that we cannot convince some of the luminaries in the Senate of the sense of our position. That would be a matter fraught with some difficulty. I note the Opposition has signalled its intention to move an amendment, and that concerns me because, if we are going to get ambushed in the Senate again on a bit of sensible corporate law reform, I would not be encouraged. This process is not an easy one. I heard the honourable member on this question of what people in the business community might want-black letter law versus fuzzy law. Frankly, what one finds is that there are two views put very strongly. Quite clearly, corporate practice is not determined only by corporate law. This is absolutely correct. There are many other factors that must enter the scene. The second consideration is that, if the law itself is a bit uncertain, then we do get this complaint from people: 'Look, we want to know whether we are acting inside or outside the law'. It is a very cut and dried position. That is going to be an ongoing debate. There is not a Solomon'S answer, frankly. I much prefer to have a situation of clearly stated black letter law accompanied by, from the point of view of the ASC, certainly practice notes which enable practitioners in the field to know how they should be operating and, secondly, a substantial attack upon business ethics where we do need to lift the game. We are not talking here about a lot of innocents abroad who suddenly find themselves before a hearing of the ASC and then perhaps subsequently before a criminal proceeding. We are talking about people who in some cases set out very deliberately and very coldly to remove money from sharethe holders and from the public at large in a very substantial way. We are not talking about people who just stumble into something. Then there is the further retort that perhaps we ought to be wary of directors. I quote anecdote that was given to me in Melbourne about a very prominent person receiving phone call in which he said, 'Dh, yes, yes, yes. I would be more than happy to be a guise director'. The conversation went on, at end of which the person said, 'Incidentally, who am I talking to?'. What that clearly indicated was that the person was quite happy to throw his name in and become of a company without really taking on board what he was being asked to do, et cetera. I do not give the name because it would be improper. The point is that, if one is going to be a director of a company, one is talking about something quite serious. The Attorney General, who is at the table, knows that, when I talk in this place as I do from time to time about vicarious liability of directors of football clubs in relation to actions taken by players on the field, I am talking about matters that they also ought to be serious about. We do not want to see the Essendon Football Club being made bankrupt by the actions of some of its players on the field. But that is another debate for another day. I know the fate of the Essendon Football Club certainly does trouble the mind of the Attorney-General, as it troubles many of us. We take the position that being a director is not something one ought to take lightly. Upon talking to people in Perth-many of whom are directors-I have been very impressed by the fact that, as a re-ult of this improved attitude towards corporate law, people are now taking the business of being a director more seriously. That can only be good because in the end we will have people who will commit themselves more actively to the business of assisting in the proper outcome of company practice in Australia. I support that very strongly. We will not be advantaged by going back to that murky past which we have all just escaped from. I will . give an example. Look at what happened to the Stock Exchange second board in Perth. In end it was lucky if six companies traded out of 120 listings. Basically, it was closed down, firstly, because there was so much malpractice; secondly, because the economy generally was not functioning and capital an raising was very difficult; and, thirdly, because it became a joke. Quite frankly, it a became a system of allowing people to remove money from the public under some or other. I was quoted as saying that all the people needed was a glossy brochure and a computer, and they were a high-tech company. People took money from the public and, in some circles, people were foolish enough a director to promote this activity. I hope we have learned from that. I am sure this matter is before the House because wellinformed people from the ASC and the Joint Comniittee are telling us that we really do need to make some reforms. That brings us to this question, and that is why I have spent a few moments on the background to this matter. We are talking about something quite substantial. If the Australian Securities Commission is to have a prosecutorial role, it has to be able to get evidence. If we are talking about people coming to hearings and being required to provide answers, we are usually talking about the Australian Securities Commission having formed an opinion that there is.a matter worth investigating. It will not go up and down the high streets of the various cities looking for matters willy-nilly; this is a matter for very serious consideration and deliberation. When I served on the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, I was concerned that we were not giving the ASC enough power to go about its investigatory role. I know that others in the AttomeyGeneral's Department were saying at the time that we did not want to overarm the ASC. My colleagues from the Opposition parties and my own Party were similarly concerned about that. But I guess I was more bruised than most, having seen what had happened to the capital raisings in Perth. I was very much of the view that we needed a strong ASC; not so that it could abuse its power, but so that it would be able to do its job. Again, I return to this point: when one talks about the ambit or coverage of actual prosecutions, one is talking about a minority of the total number of players in the market in Australia. I say that because we looked at the question of - draising and the issue of prospectuses. Quite frankly, when we pruned all of that, we realised that imposing great burdens on companies such as BHP would be a waste of time because they were never going to try to defraud the public in relation to fundraising. So we had to keep a sense of balance about this. I heard what the honourable member said about this question of balance. Basically, the ASC is saying that if this use immunity privilege is still there, it cannot really pursue the question of prosecuting corporate fraud properly. I think we have to take this decision. If we are serious about having a proper structure of corporate law and a system in which we can prosecute breaches of the law, then this notion of use immunity has to be dealt with as it is dealt with in these amendments. People will come back and talk about the common law situation. My response to that, quite immediately, is that we are not talking about the normal conduct of events in the community; we are talking about people who, by definition, are better informed and are players in the game. I use those words deliberately because, equally, one does not normally apply the law to players in other games, such as football. In that case, we do not apply the external laws so readily, because the people are particular players in the game; otherwise some of our footballers would be subject to quite serious assault charges. They are not, in the circumstances, because the benefit of the doubt is given and it is argued that they are playing within the rules. In this case, we are talking about players in the game who are informed about the game. Quite frankly, one of the difficulties in terms of corporate law in Australia is that in the past some of those players have been somewhat ahead of the NCSC and the old system of corporate law enforcement. So, in my view, we have really learned a lot in terms of the way we ought to be managing corporate law and we are suggesting here that we should make this necessary reform. One of the things that have troubled me immensely in looking at the Bond matters, which have been much debated around Australia, is the concern that there has been a use of money from the Bond Corporation to hinder the process of proper law enforcement. So we end up with the depleted resources of the corporation being used by the principals of that company for the purpose of simply delaying the process of law enforcement. In the end, people in the community say, 'Look, what's the point?'. One of the things I have noticed over time is that we have a very low level of equity holding in the Australian community. That occurs because when people venture into shares they often get their fingers burnt. We really have to be quite .serious about this; if we want people in Australia to become shareholders-and I am one who strongly believes in that; I believe it improves the overall depth of the capital market and the information base of the community-we have to say, 'Your money is safe in certain circumstances'. It can only be safe if there is proper corporate law in place in terms of fundraising and if there is proper corporate law enforcement in terms of breaches of the law so that people can make' informed judgments. That is why I think we have been behind the game so much in Australia. Certainly, in the past the Opposition put forward the argument that this was a matter for the States. I am glad that is not being raised still, because it became a tiresome old argument which was used to obstruct a whole lot of matters which ought to have been dealt with. In summing up this matter, I am suggesting that if we want to go ahead seriously with corporate law enforcement, we need a proper system. The ASC needs to have the capacity to conduct investigations and to use that evidence subsequently in criminal proceedings if they come to fruition. People have said to me in conversation that it would be their preference to go into a hearing and simply dump all of the documents, knowing that they cannot be used again. They are not fictitious conversations; those points have been made to me. If that is the case, how will the people out there feel? Will they think there are two sets of laws? There is one set for the white-collar criminal, who can get off; but if a person happens to be caught trying to shoplift in the local delicatessen, he or she will probably receive a substantial penalty. That is the view of the community at large, and I hope the Opposition is not trying to suggest that there ought to be two systems of corporate law. I think that is the issue. Unless the ASC can proceed to prosecute, then we are really hampered. We are talking about two different classes of people. Mr Costello-You are the one talking about two systems: the privileged and the non-privileged.",60
280,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"The honourable member was not listening to the speech; that is the trouble. I do not think Opposition members listen enough. We are talking about two categories of people: the well-informed players in the game, as distinct from the public at large. That is very clear. We are saying to people in this circumstance, 'You are players in the game; don't try to use this as a subterfuge to avoid being prosecuted'. I have heard the speeches by Opposition members about this; I know what the Opposition line is. But I hope that the Opposition comes to realise that it has to address the reality of this issue. I conclude with only two other remarks. I think we have to look seriously at whether or not we can always pursue corporate cases in jurisdictions-in commercial divisions of supreme courts, perhaps-or whether we need a well-informed panel to hear these cases. The big difficulty is that very often cases ought be put up, but the volume and technicality of the information may well be beyond the current processes. I think that is a concern we have to examine.",64
281,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,The Guinness case was a jury.,64
282,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Yes, the Guinness case was a jury; so there is some hope, I guess. The second point is that at the end of it all, when we have heard the speeches-and I know that we will hear them in the Senate-we have to say that we have had a history of corporate abuse in Australia, nowhere more evident than in my home State. In the circumstance of that corporate abuse, we are saying that we ought to make these amendments. I believe that they will improve corporate law enforcement in Australia.  rise tonight to speak in support of the Corporation Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill. The amendments contained in this Bill are an important aspect of the continuation of a reputable and effective Australian Securities Commission and corporate laws generally. I hope that our colleagues opposite would agree that these changes are necessary in creatin- a regulatory body which can competently investigate and prosecute corporate offences, though I understand their differences at the final point on how these particular proposed laws would apply. \ The inappropriate evidentiary requirements in corporate offences imposed by the immunity from self-incrimination are, of course, the main focus of the changes suggested here. The nature of privilege against self-incrimination is embodied in the ancient and historic common law. In Cross on Evidence it. is stated: The rule is that no one is bound to answer any question if the answer thereto would, in the opinion of the judge, have a tendency to expose the deponent to any criminal charge, penalty or [in a criminal case] forfeiture which the judge regards as reasonably likely to be preferred or sued for.  They are mutually exclusive terms. If he is going, I am going back over here.  most objectionable, Mr Deputy Speaker. In its to present form the Corporations Bill allows for two forms of immunity-use immunity and derivative use immunity. A recent report by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities entitled 'Use Immunity Provisions in the Corporation Law and the Australian Securities Commission Law' describes the two forms of immunity as thus: At hearings conducted under both Laws the right to silence is removed. The legislation explicitly removes the right to answer a question or provide a document on the grounds that to do so may tend to incriminate the person so doing. However persons are then indemnified against the consequences of giving evidence by making oral evidence, and, in the case of s.68(3) of the ASC Law the signing of the record and the production of a document, inadmissible in any criminal proceedings (other than for perjury) and, in the case of s.68(3), civil proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. This is described as use immunity. It goes on to say': The sections go further and indemnify the person against the use of evidence gained indirectly from ""leads"" provided by answers to questions or documents produced to the investigators. This is described as derivative immunity. It is at this point .that problems occur for the regulatory organisation. The Australian Securities Commission and the DPP have both conveyed to the Joint Committee the cJifficulties that arise. I served on this Committee. I will quote its evidence: The practical effect of this is to place insurmountable obstacles in the way of successful criminal prosecutions. In the interests of preserving the assets of a company or otherwise minimising the loss resulting from mismanagement or fraud the ASC will seek to act quickly through civil actions in the first instance. The ASC is concerned that by using its powers to compel evidence in order to seek civil remedies it will be prevented from obtaining admissible evidence which could be used in subsequent criminal prosecution. If we are to maintain the integrity of the securities markets, we believe that we should retain the option to use both civil and criminal remedies and that it is inappropriate that our investigation, in order to bring forward a civil remedy, should, of necessity, jeopardise criminal prosecutions. If this country is to improve its status in the international market, it is important that we maintain a highly effective and competent regulatory system. Last week we discussed the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill 1992 which promoted such international cooperation. This Bill, along with the present amendment Bill, plays an integral role in the over-ll strategy to improve Australia's ability to maintain a high profile as a respected and honourable competitor which is capable of controlling and reducing the level of fraudulent activities in our markets. Our overseas counterparts have already revised their corporations law so as not to contaminate their ability to investigate and prosecute .corporate offenders. As the international financial markets unify with a lowering of political and geographical boundaries, the need to create an effective regulatory body becomes paramount.",64
283,Unknown,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.  birthplace of the common law privilege against self-incrimination, the privilege has been removed in corporation matters by the Companies Act 1985. The investigation of the .most serious corporate crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Serious Fraud Office. Interestingly, in Cross on Evidence it was stated: Because the effect of self incrimination rules is to deprive the tribunal of relevant evidence powerful arguments are required to justify their existence, and the tendency of the modern law of evidence has been to reduce both their number and their scope. In Australia we need to consider the changes occurring overseas as the integrity of our own regulatory body, the ASC, needs to be maintained and not inhibited by immunity barriers. At present the Commission's important objectives-firstly, to maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of companies and of securities markets and futures markets in the interests of commercial security, reducing business costs and the efficiency and development of the economy; secondly, to maintain the confidence of investors in the securities and futures markets by ensuring adequate protection of those investors; and, thirdly, to takwhatever action it can take and is necessary in order to enforce and give effect to national scheme laws-are clearly being inhibited by the present immunity regulations under the Australian Securities Commission law and the corporations law. The benefits of such a commission at this stage, as was the situation in the last case relating to the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulations Bill, are worth recalling. They are, firstly, a single substantive law for all matters governing corporate, futures and securities activities; secondly, accountability to a single Minister and Parliament; thirdly, uniformity of administration through a single administrative unit with Australia-wide coverage; and, fourthly,· a uniform administrative law regime. I submit to the House that the benefits of that commission are also being hindered. The Commission, like its international counterparts, focuses on reinstating certainty in the domestic markets and regaining confidence for this country in the international arena. Without confidence, which is a vital component, the whole strategy becomes endangered and the prospects of a regression to the policies of the 1970s impedes our future. In the Commission's own words: ... if we are left with s.68(3), [we] will tend to seek out very specific civil remedies where we can use the evidence which we obtain in the exercise of our power, but there win remain the fact that there is no other criminal prosecutor who will be preparing the criminal cases, and our conduct may be jeopardising those cases which should be brought before the courts It went on to say that it: . . . creates a difficultly so profound . . . that an examination of those who are suspected may have committed an offence should not take place until it is amended. That is a very powerful indictment of the law as it stands .that was put in evidence before the Joint Committee. This perspective of the difficulties which are emerging from the constrictions of the present laws is also reflected in the public's perception of the viability·and success of the ASC. The Premier of Tasmania amplified this issue when he expressed the following concerns to the Joint Committee: This Government believes that there is a growing feeling of cynicism in the Australian community at the way in which corporate criminals are able to use their vast resources to frustrate the legal system and in many cases, avoid liability. This is exac.erbated by the public's perception that the legal system is designed to assist these people in their endeavours. . The market crashes in the 1980s, the demise of the corporate giants and their effect on the economy and individuals form a rather distasteful depiction of the ramifications of illfavoured finilncial and corporate transactions. Naturally members of the public have inauspicious perceptions of the power and potential. harm of fraudulent and inefficient corporate transactions. The term 'corporate cowboys' has a dubious connotation which symbolises the present perceptions of the Australian public about the high riders who disregarded the rules. We all realise that perceptions play an important role in the confidence of an individual and a nation. If the present viewpoint expressed above is maintained, I submit that it will be increasingly difficult to muster overseas approval when internal perceptions are so sceptical. Consequently it is important for these changes to be incorporated in the legislation. However, when discussing changes to immunity, it must be emphasised that the aim is not to completely abolish this ancient privilege, but to minimise its obstructive influence. The proposed amendments provide for the removal of the derivative use immunity available to witnesses giving evidence under compulsion in investigations under the Act and, for the witnesses who have produced a document under claim of potential self. incrimination, of the use immunity currently available in relation to the fact of that production. The proposed amendments would also deny to bodies corporate the benefit of any use or derivative use immunity proceedings under the Act, since these would be available only to natural persons. The proposed amendments are not expected to have any financial impact on government expenditure. In this situation, we would receive maximum benefit from the Commission's ability to ensure effective investigation and prosecution of corporate offences without any financial outlay. We in this House all have an onus upon us to protect the rights of the individual. The rights of the individual must always be paramount in our society. It is the Parliament's job to protect those rights. In terms of individual rights it also needs to be remembered that individual shareholders and, indeed, groups of shareholders also have rights, as individuals and as a collective group. As a member of the Committee, 1 had some very serious reservations about some of our recommendations that have led to this legislation and 1 laboured long and hard in my thought processes about them, until the last recommendation when we considered that at present we are left with the unpleasant situation where a person who has detailed information on complex transactions of an offence which has been committed or concealed may use the present immunity laws under the Corporations Act 1989 to make a full confession of the crimes for which he or she may not be prosecuted and 'leads' may not be J]sed. It cannot be contested that this does not evoke a barrier to the performance of the Commission's aims and objectives. In that respect what has finally, largely met my concerns are the words on 26 February this year of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), in the second reading speech of the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill. In particular, he said that these amendments will be reviewed after five years of operation, this being in answer to the Committee's view that there should be a five-year sunset clause, the former mode of operation being preferred to the latter in terms of the crucial nature of some prosecutions and their lead-up to trial. The honourable member for Makin also gave a commitment that the operation of these new laws will be monitored and an interim review will take place after 12 months. 1 for one will be very interested to see months time what will be learnt from such a review. I am sure that the people at the ASC, and indeed the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his Department, will be continuing to monitor these changes in the law. It is important that the mechanisms of the States are charged with that responsibility and that we in this Parliament ensure that we take the time to make an overview of them as well. In conclusion, 1 believe that the amendments before us today are a progressive and important step in streamlining Australia's approach towards regulating its financial sector and providing this nation with a sound basis for performing in an efficient .and respected - I stress 'respected'-manner in the international arena. I wish to commend these amendments to the House. I am sure that the Opposition will acknowledge the importance of these amendments for the future integrity of the ASC and the nation's financial markets in the international arena.",65
284,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"In closing the second reading debate, on the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) 'Amendment Bill 1992, I am aware, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and others in the House are, that amendments are to be moved in the committee stage by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). There may be some matters arising out of that stage which 1 will address then, but, in closing this debate, 1 propose to touch on most of the matters in the foreshadowed amendment. 1 thank those members on this side of the House-the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and the hon their support. It is interesting to consider that the honourable member for Denison, the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Barton have all had considerable experience on committees dealing with corporate law matters, and the honourable member for Banks has a particular interest in all matters involving the law. 1 will deal with what the Bill is about, in 12 because there may be some confusion. This Bill does no more and nothing less than remove the derivative use immunity which came into operation on 1 January 1991. It returns the law to the same position as existed prior to that date. The removal of the derivative use immunity was recommended by the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report of November 1991. This report was referred to by the honourable member for Barton· who indicated that he had some reservations about it. That does not make him unique. We all have some' reservations about these matters because it is a matter of balance. That was a matter which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, touched on in your contribution, as did the honourable member for Banks. I do not think that we on this side of the House need any lectures on· civil liberties from those opposite. Although the removal of the derivative use immunity was· recommended by that Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in November last year, the problems it raises were foreseen much earlier by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. In its report back in 1989 that Select Committee concluded, although without following it through in its recommendations, ' that the derivative use immunity should be removed. As has.been canvassed tonight by speakers on both sides of the House- it is well known that both the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions say that it is preventing the effective investigation and prosecution of offences under the corporations legislation. .The Government agrees that its removal is required to prevent it defeating the purpose of the national scheme laws. Put simply, that is what this Bill is doing. During the debate tonight we had some contributions from the other side of the House which ranged fairly wide and just touched on this issue. There were contributions, firstly, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) ,and later the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). I will deal with the honourable member for Ryan first. He expressed concerns about various matters-he, of course, being a very late convert to the nationalist scheme, and almost the last of the Mohicans in his hanging on to the old, failed cooperative system which served this country so appallingly for so many years. So his contribution was not all that surprising. The honourable member fpr Ryan quoted from the Australian Financial Review of 24 March which reported a speech of Mr Beerworth, but for some reason he said that Mr Beerworth was supposedly a member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. If he is, it is news to me. I have not read the honourable member's speech, and I do not know whether he represented that Mr Beerworth was on the Advisory Committee, but I can assure the House that he is not and he never has been on that Committee. Nevertheless, Mr Beerworth's criticisms were trotted out. One has to remember that Mr Beerworth was one of the tp.ost vehement critics of what we refer to as generally drafted, or in some cases fuzzy, law in the prospectus provisions of this legislation.,Those provisions were drafted in general terms and the business community indicated that they could not understand them. This is somewhat relevant to the matters raised by the honourable member for Corangamite. One carmot win with the business community on this issue. If one gives them black letter law, they say, 'That is too difficult and there is too much of it' but, if one gives them general principles law-or fuzzy law as it is sometimes referred to-as happened in the case of the fundraising or the prospectus provisions, .they complain again. Mr Beerworth was one of those. Of course, in looking at that prospectus provision which made people liable for misleading statements or omissions from a prospectus, he completely ignored the fact that that sort of legislation has been around since 1974. Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act has virtually the same by applications as section 995. Section 995 was inserted only to make all the law clear on its face. It has been there since 1974 but then, when that provision came in, they found it very difficult to understand. I just make that point to indicate how hard it is to please that community. In respect of the matters raised more substantively by the honourable member for Corangamite, I will quickly remind him about the matters which are causing such terrible problems to people in the corporate area. The first Bill we passed dealt with insider trading-a fairly insidious operation---and noone complained about that. In fact, it was supported by the Business Council of Australia, which provided clarifying amendments which we adopted. The next Bill was on the consolidation of group accounts. After the experience of one well known company, I am aware of no-one who opposed that. The other one involved some technical amendments to the fundraising provisions, which also did not cause anyone any problems. The question of unlisted property trusts was another one. I now tum to the matters raised by the honourable member for Ryan-not by the honourable member for Corangamite-when he was talking about continuous disclosure. That is merely a paper which has been put out for members of the business community to have a look at. If they want to come forward with constructive criticisms of it that is what it is there for. They are invited t- do that. We recently put out a draft exposure Bill which involyes such things as loans to directors in which we are basically saying that it is not a ?ad ide--it is probably a good thing-if one IS lendlllg money to oneself and it is the shareholders' money, to tell the shareholders. Occasionally it might not be a bad idea if one says to them, 'Do you mind?'. That is the sort of legislation which has caused everyone to become quite hyped up at the moment. All I am saying is that, if that is too great a burden to place on the directors in this country when they are not dealing with their own money, I think there is something radically wrong. In respect of the matters raised by the honourable member for Higgins, going more specifically to this Bill, he made the point that there is currently nothing to prevent a document that is produced by a person being used against the person. That is where I think we part ways on this matter, and that is why the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. The ASC argues that the derivative use immunity prevents the use of such documents. It is worth pointing out the normal investigation process that we are talking about here. Firstly, one does not know where the books are. That is the normal position. So normally one has to ask company officersthat is, one has to examine them-otherwise one does not know who to direct the notice to produce to. If one does not know where the books are, it is not much good asking someone who does not have them to produce them; Secondly, company officers would commonly claim privilege for virtually every answer they give at an examination. Whether they bring the books with them and produce them or just tell the ASC where the books are, there is a very strong, arguable case that the production of the books is a direct or indirect consequence of the person making a statement to the ASC. There is no doubt about that. The ASC was able to convince the Joint Committee of the strength of that case. That was the point that the honourable member for Barton made. It was on balance but, listening to all of the information that was put forward, at the end of the day the - ommittee said, 'Yes, what the ASC is saying IS correct. We do not want to be protecting people from prosecution in these sorts of circumstances' and they in fact accepted it. That was what the Government wanted, and that is why we are moving to amend the law in the way that we are. The honourable member for Higgins touched briefly-he did not make a big issue of it-on the fact that the principle against self-incrimination is not I;lbrogated in the United States of America. It is very different in the United States; it has a very different investigating regime for a start. Although we had a bit of a dissertation on the history of civil liberties, it is worth mentioning to the honourable member for Higgins that the constitutional position in the United States is considerably different from the position here. Whenever we on this side of the House have suggested that that ought to be improved in terms of constitutional amendment,' we have got a decent belting around the ears from those opposite. Coming back to the type of investigation, Boesky and Milken were two cases that were cited by the honourable member for Higgins. The success of both those prosecutions was largely due to the ability of prosecutors to use plea bargaining. The honourable member for Higgins can correctly say that that goes on here, too. Mr Costello-Of course it does.",67
285,Mr DUFFY,CORPORATIONS LEGISLATION,"Of course it does. I concede that, but not to the extent that it does in the United States. In the United States there is a tendency to have agreement for lesser charges against what I would refer to as the smaller fish if they agree to testify against the fish. There is bargaining with the big fish to then plead guilty to even more serious charges. That is exactly what happened in one of the matters the honourable member for Higgins cited, the Boesky case. Again, I am not saying that because it happens there it should happen here, but, it is not as if Australia is doing something very odd here. In the United Kingdom, which is a closer model as far as we are concerned in the company law sense, not only has it got rid of derivative use immunity but it has also gone to a further stage of saying that the answers can be used. We are not suggesting that. But the United Kingdom has, in fact, got to the stage, with a very similar company law structure to ours, where derivative use immunity has gone. The honourable member for Higgins pointed out that the measure is not retrospective. That is correct; it is not. He then raised the point about what will happen with some of the corporate bandits of the 1980s as this Bill will apply only from when it is passed by the Parliament and not retrospectively. He was not suggesting that it should be, which we can see from his amendment. Nevertheless, there was no suggestion of that at any stage. But the offenders of the 1980s could still dealt with under this legislation. That would depend upon whether or not they had been examined. If they are examined after the enactment of this legislation, they could well be caught by this legislation without the legislation being retrospective. In fact, the reasons that it may. be necessary for this legislation to be passed is that it could be necessary to have successful prosecutions not only prospectively but also in relation to some of the matters of the past. That will depend on whether or not examinations have taken place. As I have indicated, this matter has been examined at great length by parliamentary committees of various political persuasions. One of those committees, the most recent committee, in fact had a difference of view on it. We had on that committee Senator Michael Beahan from the Labor Party; Senator Austin Lewis from the Opposition; the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton); bigger the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford); the honourable member for Denison, who spoke earlier in the debate tonight; the honourable member for Ryan, who also made a contribution; the honourable member for Barton; Senator Campbell; Senator Cooney; and Senator Spindler. The honourable member for Dunkley, Senator Campbell and Senator Cooney dissented from the majority report. I can understand that difference of opinion but, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech, this matter goes back further than that-back to 1989, when a recommendation was not made but it was quite plain what the Joint Committee felt about the matter. The Government considered it at length, considered it after matters were put to it by the DPP and the ASC, and did not come to the conclusion quickly or, for that matter, easily because all of the matters raised were taken into account. As I said earlier, I do not need to sit here and be told about civil liberties. It is a matter which concerned me when I first examined it, but it is worth noting one short example because it sums up what we are about. Take the case of a Mr X, who gets secret inforbe mation about the activities of a company which can be known as company A. That· company is about to make a very profitable takeover, and Mr X informs his stockbroker, a Mr Y, and tells him 'to purchase 10,000 shares in company A for him and another one of 10,000 shares on behalf of company B, of which Mr X happens to be a director. The scene is set for a killing, of course, for Mr X and for company B. Mr Y, the stockbroker, knows that it is insider trading, but he cannot resist the easy buck and grasps the opportunity. The announcement is made, the stocks of company A rocket, Mr X and company B make a huge profit on paper, and the ASC then investigates. Mr X claims privilege under section 68 and hands over his file, which implicates himself, Mr Y, the stockbroker-the friendly stockbroker in this case-and company B. What happens after that? Mr Y and the stockbroker are both convicted; company B is fined; and Mr X""':""""the Mr Big-who worked it all out, knew exactly what he was doing, walks away. Members of this Parliament and the public had better understand that he walks away because of the amendmeQt which has been moved tonight by the Opposition. If this amendment is passed, Mr X in this case, because he claims privilege under section 58, hands over his papers to the ASC, implicates himself and others, is not convicted, and walks away.

309,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"I move: (1) Clause 4, page 2, omit proposed subsection 68(3), substitute the following subsection: ""'(3)Neither the statement, or the fact that the person has signed the record, as the case may be, nor any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record, as the case may be, is admissible in evidence against the person in: (a) a criminal proceeding; or (b) a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty; other than a proceeding in respect of: (c) in the case of the making of a statement-the falsity of the statement; or (d) in the case of the signing of a recordthe falsity of any statement contained in the record."". This amendment does not affect subsection 68(2), as proposed by the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill, which allows the production of documents .and evidence as to the production of documents to be admissible in criminal and quasi-criminal proceedings. The amendment goes to subsection 68(3) and preserves derivative use immunity in relation to making statements and signing records under the provisions of section 68-the basis for which I outlined in my speech on the second reading. The last example from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in relation to company officer X and stockbroker Y was a very long bow indeed. After producing everything, Mr X would still be liable to full civil action. So after hancJing over his file, Mr X would still be liable to have that file produced as PAIRS evidence in criminal proceedings and to have the fact that he produced the document admitted as evidence against him. The offence could be proved very easily without any selfincrimination at all, because all that would need to be proved is that he had information that was not reasonably available. The fact that the shares were purchased could be proved from independent sources. The offence of insider trading-a very wide offence, as the Bill is now drafted--'could be made out quite easily. We are arguing about derivative use immunity. In the example from the Attorney General there was no derivative evidence at all. He was saying that he hands over his file and claims privilege. He did not, in his own example, say that the handing over of that file led, directly or indirectly, to further evidence . which, by reason of the preservation of derivative use immunity under our amendment, could not be admitted. In his example it was the direct material that was handed over under the section in response to the request-or whatever-that could not be admitted. Under this Bill, even a statement made by Mr X could not be admitted. What we are arguing about here is not the statement itself, nor the document itself-which would be admissible under new section 68(2), which we agree to; we are arguing about derivative material from statements or signing records. There was no derivative material from statements or signing records in his own example. That is why I said his own example was completely false-and it was. The opporThe tunity that was taken on a completely false basis to say that this amendment would prevent the conviction of Mr X, whereas the failure of this amendment would secure the conviction of Mr X, was completely wrong. I have put forward the reasons why the Opposition has moved this amendment. Our position is that the Bill should be reconthose sidered and the amendment should be aling lowed. The Attorney having indicated would not allow the amendment, we voted against the second reading. We now renew our request by moving this amendment and whole. indicating that if this amendment, together with our other amendments, were passed, we would have no objection· to this Bill. We support the rest of the Bill which goes to no privilege against self-incrimination for corporate person and, as I indicated before, the fact that a·person has produced documents being available as evidence-that is, the abolition of use immunity in relation to documents.",73
310,Mr DUFFY,NOES,"I have very little to add to what I said in the second reading debate, except to point out once again that, when we are talking about derivative use immunity, as the honourable member for Higgins (Mf Costello) knows, we are talking about the situation in which a person is prevented from using anything obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of answers. What we are now proposing is, firstly, that the use immunity-that is, that a person did produce documentsgoes; secondly, that the use immunity for the documents themselves goes; and thirdly, that the derivative use immunity-that is, where a person is prevented from using anything obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the answers; that is, the flowthrough-goes. That is where we seem to have an absolutely fundamental disagreement, and that is why the amendment is not acceptable. Amendment negatived. Clauses agreed to. Clause 7. .

312,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus Bill which covers a whole range of different amendments to different defence Acts, many of which are of a quite technical nature. What I propose to do is talk about those aspects of the legislation which I believe are of greater substance. Some of my . colleagues will be taking up in this debate range of other issues that are of concern the coalition in the broader area of the adActs ministration of the Department of Defence and the Australian defence forces. The two major aspects of this Bill which I want to discuss tonight are, first of all, the provisions which repeal the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Tercan mination Act 1973. The decision by the of 1903. Government to repeal those two Acts goes back to the controversy which surrounded the commitment of Australian troops to what became known as the Gulf war-a decision which was strongly supported by this side the House. In retrospect, I think Australia look back on its contribution to the Gulf war, albeit a small contribution, as one that it with a great deal of pride. It is a contribution that won the overwhelming support of the Australian Parliament. I am sorry to say it did not win unanimous support, largely because minor groups in this Parliament-one member of the House of Representatives and the sort of rag bag of greens and Democrats and so on in the Senate-decided for rather cynical political reasons, I would have thought, to oppose contribution to the Gulf war. One of the perhaps less honourable things that happened during that debate-if we could call it a debate-about the Australian involcommonsense. vement in the Gulf war was the emergence of a campaign by the Australian. Democrats. They claimed that the Government was actually seriously contemplating introducing . conscription for the purposes of providing additional resources for Australia's contribution to the Gulf war. When we actually reflect on the contribution that Australia made, it is to believe that anyone could have taken seriously that proposition that came from the Australian Democrats. Really, it was one of the more stupid scare campaigns that I have seen in this Parliament. It was perhaps not as stupid as some of the economic scare campaigns we are seeing at the moment as the Government desperately .tries to cling to office, but all the same it was a pretty stupid scare campaign. What the Government has decided to do in a response to that-and we do not particularly to criticise it for this-is to repeal those two that I referred to in order to phase back any commitment that can be made in Australia to conscription in the event of war. What this legislation does not do is preclude altogether conscription in Australia. There is no proposition that the Government is putting forward to that effect, because conscription still be carried out under the Defence Act On that first point, the coalition does not oppose the decision that the Government has made, and we would simply make the point of that the scare campaign that was run by the can Australian Democrats just about sizes them up. I do not think one needs to elaborate any made longer in this country on the issue of the credibility of a political party-if we could call that rabble a political party-such as the Australian Democrats. Mr Bilney-Hear, hear! Mr DOWNERI know the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel would feel very strongly about that, because he himself was saved from a vicious assault by ex-Senator Janine Haines at the last election by, that I think one would say guardedly, the common-sense of the electors of Kingston. Their common sense does not extend to enough of them voting Liberal, but they have some The second aspect of this legislation that I want to refer to is that it revises part IV of the Defence Act, under which conscription can take place. It addresses the issue of conscientious objection to conscription, which is obviously a very important issue. One aspect of this part of the legislation is that Government proposes in this Bill that any proclamation that there should be conscription requires the prior approval of the Parliament of Australia. That is a proposition that we on this side of the House are happy to support. Section 60(1) of the Defence Act provides that conscription can only take place when Australia is under attack, or is subject to an invasion of a broader sort. What the Government does in this Bill is amend that section to ensure that there is provision for prior parliamentary approval to be given. Rather curiously, the Government proposes in this amendment that that prior parliamentary approval should be given at least 90 days before the proclamation comes into effect. The coalition will be moving four different amendments during the committee stage, which I assume will now take place tomorrow. I will come back to our reasons for moving an amendment in relation to that 90day rule because, although it is not particularly the most offensive thing that any Government has ever put forward in this Parliament, it seems to us to be a superfluous provision added into the legislation. This amendment to the Defence Act effectively gives the Parliament a power of veto over the Executive on the whole exercise of conscription. As I said earlier, we regard that as appropriate for a range of reasons. First, consistent with the commitment we all have to democratic processes, when a major decision of that kind-really a decision which would be, to say the least, a very controversial decision-is made by the Executive on behalf of all the people of Australia, it is only appropriate that the pinnacle of this country's democracy, its Parliament, should give approval to that decision. Secondly, looking at it from another side, if a government were to proceed with conscription without the broader support of the Australian community and, in particular, without the support of one of the two major political movements in this country, I submit that that would be little short of a political disaster and might even invite military disaster as well. In a circumstance where Australia were subject to attack or invasion and there were the a need for conscription, it is hard to believe that in such dire circumstances the Australian people would rise up against it or one of the major political parties would oppose it. I find it hard to believe that that would happen. Nevertheless, there have been times in our history when conscription has been not exclusively a party political debate but a major political debate. The best example of that without doubt were the conscription debates of the First World War. There is no doubt that those debates and the two referendums that were associated with them were a debilitating exercise for a country which was in,the midst of making its own contribution to a truly ghastly war. Therefore, what this legislation proposes makes a great deal of sense in that, if conscription were to take place, it would take place only with the approval of the Parliament and, in reality, by a virtual consensus of the Parliament. I do not doubt for a minute that, if a Labor government-if there ever is to be another Labor government-were to decide that conscription was necessary at a time when Australia was under attack or invasion, in those circumstances there would be a fairly strong degree of support from this side of the House. I have to say that I am not so sure what would happen if the situation were the other way around. But I have to make the point that, if in those circumstances a coalition government wanted, to introduce conscription in order to help with the defence of our country, and the other side of politics decided to go out in the community and oppose that strongly, it would make it very hard for us to proceed with that conscription, because we would divide the country well before we achieved our military objectives. Of course, that is the last thing we would want in those' circumstances. Some people have argued against this particular provision on the grounds that it would take too long for a government to make a decision on conscription because one would have to call the Parliament together, conduct a parliamentary debate and so on, and also that it weakens the flexibility of, the Executive to make these types of decisions in the midst of a military contingency. But I have to say that it would take quite some time for the call-up to take place, for the troops be· trained effectively; therefore, I think the argument about the length of time is probably a fairly superfluous argument. As I said earlier, we do believe that this proposition-which does not seem to me to have any foundation in common sense-that there should be a 90-day provision in relation to parliamentary approval, really does not bear any relevance to the exercise; the legislation would. be considerably neater if that were to be excluded from it. The second aspect of this revision of part IV of the Defence Act is that this Bill repeals the discriminatory aspects of conscription. Honourable members may almost be amused to hear that the Act limits conscription to males-that is pretty discriminatory-and to British citizens, excluding Aboriginal Australians. Quite rightly, the Government has decided to tidy up the Act by bringing it into line with the 1990s rather than 1903 when the Act was first introduced. The Government has repealed those particular discriminatory provisions and provided for conscription to apply to a resident of six months standing aged between 18 years and 60. I still have 20 years to go before I am free of the dangers of conscription myself, although I think the contribution I would make to the national defence as a soldier would be somewhat arguable judging by my performance in the cadets when I was at school. Maybe one does not have to have one's kit clean in war, and that would be my one advantage if that were not the case. The third aspect of this change to part IV of the Defence Act is the issue of conscientious objection. Here the Government is tightening up the provisions for conscientiou. objection. The Bill defines more clearly the term 'conscientious belief'. It establishes the right for a person to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation, and I will come back to that. It clarifies the· distinction between exemption for service in the ADF and exemptions from duties of a combatant nature. It establishes new tribunals to determine claims of conscientious objection; it provides guidelines for the operation of these tribunals; to and it provides for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate legal system. At the moment section 61(2) of the Defence Act states: For the purposes of this section, a conscientious belief is a conscientious belief whether the ground of the belief is or is not of a religious character and whether the belief is or is not part of the doctrines of a religion. The Act does not endeavour to define the meaning of conscientious belief beyond that, so this Bill gives greater definitional clarity to the term by repealing section 61(2) and adding instead: ... a person is taken to have a conscientious belief in relation to a matter if the person's belief in respect of that matter; (a) involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong whether or not based on religious considerations;and (b) is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and (c) is likely to be of a long standing nature. The coalition welcomes and is happy to accept those particular aspects of this Bill, but with the one exception-the decision by the Government to include in this legislation a provision for conscientious objection in the case of a particular war or warlike situation. To be frank, we really do regard that proposition as one which is unacceptable. I refer to a submission that was made in 1985 to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the issue of conscientious objection, in which the Returned Services League of Australia made this point: The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature. The whole debate about whether one can be a conscientious objector to a particular war is really a debate that revolves around whether one feels that such a so-called conscientious objection can be an objection only of a political nature. Our view on this side of the House is that, effectively, that is true. On that particular point we certainly agree with the proposition put forward by the RSL. We will be moving in the committee stage some amendments to have that particular reference left out. Our view is this: if one is a conscientious objector, one is a conscientious objector to war. There are provisions which the Government has quite rightly tightened up to establish whether somebody is a conscientious objector. But on what basis could people object conscientiously in the case of a particular war? Surely it could be only on a political basis; surely only on the basis that they believe that loyalty to our country, nationalism-which has become a bit of a vogue word in Australia; it was a vogue word in Germany and Italy in the 1930s, but it has become a vogue word in Australia in the 1990s-in its truer and more fundamental sense, is something that applies only partially in this country. We do not think that is appropriate. We do not think people can say that, if a particular country decides to invade Australia, they object on some so-called religious ground; they are of the same religious conviction as the invading force but do not have a broader objection to the whole idea of fighting to defend their country; or they decide that the country that is invading Australia and for which conscription is required to defend their country is tiot· such a bad country after all, and what other objections could people have. It seems to me, in truth, that the objections we are going to have are really more likely than anything else .to be of a so-called religious nature, that is, that they have religious affmity with the invading force. History shows that just because we are of the same religious conviction as somebody else does not mean we will not go to war against them. It is hard to imagine any particular creed in the world which has not involved two peoples or two countries of that same creed going to war with each other. Our view is that at the end of the day this is a test of loyalty to Australia, that Australian citizens' fundamental loyalty in terms of the issue of nationality should not be a compromised loyalty, that it should not be something that is expendable in certain particular circumstances that arouse certain emotional or religious feelings in those people. We will not support that particular provision of this legislation, and I will talk more about that during the committee stage of this Bill. I make one other point in relation to that issue: if we were to include that provision in this legislation, if we were to be in such an unfortunate circumstance that we needed conscription to defend Australia but we enabled people to opt out on the basis of the particularity of that invasion or the nature of the country invading Australia, all we would get is an absolute flood of people claiming to be exempted from conscription on presumably all sorts of fairly spurious grounds. It is either a conscientious belief-that is, a belief against the whole issue of conscription and war-or they do not have that belief at all. It is one or the .other. It should not be a test of loyalty to Australia, which is curiously what the Government in this amendment is making it. I want to make one final point in this debate which is relevant to the Bill but is of a much broader nature. It concerns the discussion that has been taking place in defence circles over the last few months about the coalition's Fightback program. I make the point and hope the Minister will take it on board: we do not want the Department of Defence or the Australian Defence Force in any way whatsoever to be politicised. Indeed, I think we would all agree in this Parliament that it is extremely important that the Department of Defence or the Australian Defence Force never be politicised, for a whole range of different reasons. What has been circulating within the Department of Defence-not all of the Department but some of it-is something which is described as a defence economic brief, dated 19 February 1992. What this defence economic brief does in one short but not very sweet section under the heading 'Goods and Services Tax' is make the claim that the GST proposed in the coalition's Fightback package would be levied at 15 per cent and charged on the supply of goods and services in Australia and on the importation of goods into Australia; in essence, it is a value added tax where the full brunt of the tax falls on the final consumer of goods and services. There is no problem with that; the document seems to have grasped that detail. The document goes on to say-and I must say this is outrageous - that the possible impact on defence could be considerable. Oh really! Could it be? If exemptions were not provided, the impact 'on defence based on the 1990-91 outlay could be in' the, order of $740m. That is what is said in the defence economic brief, dated 19 February and circulated in some parts of the Department. This is ambiguous indeed because it says 'if exemptions were not provided' and then it refers to the $740m figure which the Minister and others are doing their very best to continue to promote. What does the Fightback document say? It says this: The public sector is taxable if the goods or services are provided in the course of commercial activity. Def(fnce basically is not commercial activity. There are aspects of it that are, and I will come back to that, but basically it is not a commercial activity. Goods and services are zero rated. I think the authors of that document would know what 'zero rated' means. I know the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) know what it means. They are zero rated if they comprise a regulatory activity or are of a non-commercial nature. Section 5.4.3 of the Fightback! document lists as examples government services such as defence and law and order. What we actually say is that defence will be zero rated but not defence industries, because the interesting thing about defence industries is that the Government's own figures produced by the Treasury in its attack, so-called, on the Fightback program show that defence industries would be a massive $90m better off as a result of the introduction of the Fightback program; $34m better off as a result of the abolition of the payroll tax; $33m better off as a result of the abolition of excise; and $45m better off as a result of the abolition of the wholesale sal(fS tax. Mr Bilney-Me Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have been extremely tolerant because I am fascinated by what the shadow Minister is saying. Is this particularly relevant to the Bill?",75
313,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Mr Hollis)The honourable member for Mayo has, I think, made the point in respect of the defence economic brief quite well. Perhaps he could return to the Bill before the House.",79
314,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Me Deputy Speaker, thank you for drawing that to my attention. You have asked the Minister in this note that I now have before me where you could get a copy of the defence brief. You say it seems to make good reading. This is your view, Me Deputy Speaker. The Minister has just passed me the note. I make the point, Me Deputy Speaker, that you are an honest and honourable man. You will, I know, refute the totally erroneous and utterly malicious claims that have been made in that brief because you have the intelligence to understand how the Fightback program would work and would not tolerate",79
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,We will get back to the Bill before the House.,79
316,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Me Deputy Speaker, you appear to have a peculiar interest in the remarks I have been making because you have been sending from the chair notes to the Minister about this document. I am not sure that I am on weak ground here, Me Deputy Speaker. You may wish to talk to the Minister about this later. I do not have a great deal more to say because some of my colleagues will canvass other issues during this debate. In the committee stage I will come back to the concerns we have about this particular Bill and the amendments that have already been circulated in my name. We can examine in much more detail the issues that the Government has built into this Bill in relation to the 90-day period after parliamentary approval for conscription and, more importantly, its view that we can conscientiously object to any particular war. Other than those particular concerns we have, we support this legislation. There are some very sensible provisions in it. There are some things that I strongly support. There are those two objections we have to it and there is the issue which I am sure the Minister will be willing to take up and give us an answer to when he winds up the debate, which I assume will be tomorrow, in relation to the defence economic brief of 19 February 1992. I do not think the Defence Department should be politicised. I think it is very wrong for effort to be made to politicise it. Debate interrupted. NA",79
317,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",80

319,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I do.,80
320,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Please proceed.,80
321,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"During Question Time today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) claimed that I had misrepresented the situation of Inner Northern Group Training in Coburg. The Prime Minister claimed that I had damaged the company. In fact, it is his deliberately engineered recession-the one we had to have-that has damaged the apprentices which this company",80
322,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member for Dunkley should not debate the issue. He should just get to the point where he claims to have been misrepresented.,80
323,Mr FORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In my question last week I said that this group had more than 250 unemployed apprentices on its books. This is absolutely correct and it has been confirmed by the company today. Inner Northern Group Training is a great organisation which is working under very adverse conditions. I commend its success and did not, and would not, reflect on its endeavours. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed.  retary to the Minister for Defence) (9.21 p.m.) - I am pleased to offer a few comments about the Defence Legislation Amendment Bi111992. It seeks to do a number of things: revise provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection; enable the appointment of Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) to the Defence Housing an Authority; tidy up legislation providing for defence retirement benefits and home loan assistance schemes; and repeal obsolete retirement benefit provisions. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) pointed out, conscription has been a controversial issue in Australia-particularly for us on the Labor side. It has been said that in this Bill we are liberalising, if you like, the provisions for conscientious objection to which the honourable member for Mayo has raised some fundamental objections. I would like to place the debate in the context of past experience. For example, during the Vietnam conflict-which I think most would agree was the most recent controversial example of the defence forces being sent overseas, with conscription a major issue within the community-only 0.13 per cent of eligible males actually exercised their democratic right to lodge conscientious objections. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may think that I have made an error, so I repeat that the figure was 0.13 per cent. The point was that that conflict took place in Vietnam-it was external to Australia-and it was a conflict about which the community was very deeply divided. If that is the case in terms of an external conflict, we have to try to come to some assessment as to its likely impact if we are talking about conscription in relation to defending mainland Australia. I should also place on record the views of many of those conscientious objectors about. the Vietnam conflict. They said that, if it had been a question of defending Australia, they would have had no hesitation. So I certainly commend the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) on that issue. The other matter we ought to take into account when we are considering this legislation concerns the likely scenarios in terms of Australia's need to respond to credible threats. Whilst people are rather overjoyed at the outbreak of peace, or the demise of European communism, and the prospects for world peace, it is true that this may add some pressure in tenns of regional conflicts. But, no matter which way we look at those conflicts, it is hard to paint a picture of a real threat mainland Australia. In tenns of the defence of Australia, manpower is an extraordinarily important issue. I suppose the other issue is that of munitions; which is also very relevant. It is particularly relevant in terms of the ADI site at St Marys. I wish to quote some comments of the Premier of New South Wales about the AD! site at St Marys. On 26 October 1991, he said: The ADI site provides a unique opportunity to in place model infrastructure which encourages composite and environmentally sustainable proach to new urban developments in Sydney. In the spirit of true bipartisanship, I acknowledge the wisdom of those words. Sadly, the Premier seems to have changed his mind rather dramatically. Whilst I will not read onto the record some of his more recent comments, I think it is fair to say that he done a total backflip based on the decision set up a munitions factory in Benalla in Victoria. The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, has already placed on record the fact that this was a unanimous decision by a completely independent board. In fact, the chairman of that board, Russell Fynmore, made that observation in a letter to the Premier. It is rather disappointing that have these comments by the Premier of New South Wales. Not only did he see it as model infrastructure-and I say this with some feeling because it is in my electorate-but also there was, on normal planning guidelines, the potential for the generation of 8,000 jobs associated with the industrial land that will accommodated on that site. I conclude my remarks about the ADI site by saying that I welcome the observation the honourable member for Mayo, who said that we ought to have a bipartisan approach to defence. I agree with that. I also agree thesentiment that we ought to check some of the disappointment that we might understanI dably feel when, in a fair game, we lose the decision for our State. ADI has five other locations in New South Wales and some 3,000 employees. Indeed, as the Minister hints in his response, it is even contemplating to establishing its corporate headquarters in New South Wales. As far as New South Wales is concerned, we have lots of opportunity to work with it-particularly in tenns of developing the Newington site which the State Government is very keen on for its Olympic bid. I commend the honourable member· for Greenway (Mr Gorman) who, as chairman of an advisory committee on HMAS Nirimba, this morning brought before the Government put the proposal of his committee, the colleges of a TAFE, the University of Western Sydney and apthe schools to establish HMAS Nirimba as a unique educational precinct. These things-whether it is ADI at St Marys, land for the Olympic bid at Newington, or establishing .a unique educational precinct in the electorate of Greenway on the site of HMAS Nirimba-need common sense has from all sides and, most importantly, cooperto ation. The Premier is now trying to suggest the contamination that was always at the site and nuclear waste are reasons why he has . done this backflip. That was known when he made his first statement; it is certainly known now, and we are addressing those issues .. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence. With regard to the Bill, I support the proposals which the Minister has brought we to the House. We have made some sensible changes to tidy up some anomalies. In tenns of conscientious objection, let us look at the record and try to see how many people we may be looking at. In the most recent worse case scenario-the Vietnam war, which was external to Australia-we were talking about be 0.13 per cent. I commend the Bill to the House.·",80
324,Mr SHARP,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"In the of debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill tonight I follow on the heels of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), with who has represented the Opposition's views on this matter in his usual articulate fashion. will comment briefly on the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Chifley and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  made the oft quoted call that comes from the Government at various times that there should be a bipartisan policy on defence. This is something that we would all agree with in a perfect world. We would all say that there ought to be bipartisanship on important matters· such as defence. I note that, whenever there is a call for a bipartisan approach on Government matters, it usually comes at a time when the Government is in deep trouble and is looking to the Opposition to be very magnanimous and to look at the broader concerns of - he communhy, whilst in the next breath it is being parochial and political on some other issue and bagging us about the head. Whenever we hear the words 'Let's be bipartisan', we are always extremely cautious because we often have good grounds to believe that the Government is trying to. wriggle out of the difficult position in which it finds itself in the hope that we will give it an excuse to get out of it. The debate tonight has been interesting. As one would expect, the previous speakers have stuck strictly to the legislation. I intend to stick strictly to the legislation, as has my predecessor, the honourable member for Chilley, this evening. Therefore, I will talk about a number of very important issues which feed off the subject of change in the legislation tonight. The bulk of the legislation deals with conscription and the way in which the Government proposes to amend certain legislation about conscription. Conscription is an issue which is very firmly etched in my memory. As a young person in my teenage years during the Vietnam war days, conscription was a subject of intense discussion. I was first aware of it at a tender age, in my early teen years. It was a subject that just would not go away. It was a subject where one could find no definitive argument, either right or wrong. It was an argument that one eventually fell back on. based on emotional beliefs rather than on logical or other beliefs. Any changes to conscription are often fraught with emotional argument and emotional concern. Conscription is about compelling people to do things that they would not ordinarily want to do, such as having to take up arms to defend their country in circumstances that will put their own lives .at risk. It is an issue that we have to treat very seriously in this House and the Opposition treats the matter in that light. This legislation .enters the Parliament at a time when we are discussing Australia's involvement in Cambodia. Later this week-I think on Wednesdaythe Prime Minister (Mr Keating) proposes to bring down a statement outlining in some detail our involvement in the Cambodian United Nations peacekeeping forces. This is an important debate for us because it will see Australia re-entering the Asian area with its troops on the ground. We have not done this since the Vietnam war days. For that reason we need to be very careful about Australia's involvement in Cambodia. We hope that our involvement will be only what it is currently outlined to be; tH.tt there will be no further increase in our role in Cambodia; and that the circumstances in which we find ourselves in a year's time, or however long it may be, will not turn out to be vastly different from what we expect them to be today. We do not want to see Australian troops become involved in an arms conflict in Cambodia where their lives are being more than just threatened as members of a peacekeeping force and where they may become involved in substantial military activity. We do not want them to be in that situation. I think all of us would be prepared to accept that we have a responsibility as members of the international community to participate in peacekeeping forces around the world, particularly those in our region. We have to be extraordinarily careful that we do not get into the Vietnamlike circumstances that we were once in over this issue in Cambodia. During the Vietnam days conscription was the subject of a great deal of protest and a great deal of disunity within the Parliament. Part of the reason for that was due to the fact that there was not a consensus within the Parliament for conscription to be enforced. In this legislation we are trying to ensure that there is a consensus within the Parliament before conscription is enforced in Australiaif those circumstances where conscription is required ever occur again. The amendments to the legislation have merit. Before a government commits itself to conscription, 1 think all of us who believe in a parliamentary system and a democracy would want to see the Australian Parliament debate the matter and have a consensus view on it so that if conscription is required it is enacted with full consent, the majority view, of both Houses of the Parliament. This legislation is designed to achieve that. It is on those grounds that the Opposition bases the bulk of its support on the Bill before us tonight. Other matters which concern us have been outlined by the honourable member for Mayo. They relate to conscientious objection, which is an issue that no doubt occurs whenever conscription is enforced. There are legitimate reasons for people to be conscientious objectors in times of conscription. However, we believe that the way the Government is setting up these particular amendments will lead to tremendous divisions within our community and tremendous problems for us in the future. We take the view that it is fair enough for a person to have a conscientious objection against war. When our country is at threat, though, there is an opportunity for these people to have a conscientious objection to being involved in a war, even if it is war that puts at risk the defence of this country. However, we do not believe it is fair or right for people to have objections to some wars, but not to all wars. In other words, person says, 'I am happy to go to war as a member of the Australian military forces if we are going to fight these people, but I am not prepared to go to war as a member of the Australian military forces if we are going to go and fight these people', that creates tremendous internal division within Australia. With the amount of migration Australia has, this could open up divisions on race and religion in the future. Certain Australians are called up may not be prepared to participate because they may be required to be involved in some sort of military activity against their former countrymen or members of their own religion. We believe that this type of division could occur as a result of the Government's legislation. For that reason we will be moving amendments to the legislation. When we talk about Australia's military forces, it is important for us to realise that conscription is not an excuse for inadequate military forces in times of peace. 1 think the best military force that Australia can hope to the have is a full time, professional, volunteer military force. There is no doubt at all that this is the best way to go if we have to defend our country. The experiences we saw recently in the Gulf crisis where the American forces and those of the allied nations were teamed up against Iraq in Kuwait, proved that all the people who participated in the Gulf crisis on our side of the fence were much more effective than the conscripts who made up the bulk of the Iraqi forces involved in the dispute in Kuwait. It shows us that the best type of defence for a country is a full time, professional, well-equipped, well-resourced, well-trained volunteer defence force. We must keep this in mind when we talk about issues such as conscription. It is sad to see, though, that over the last few years under this Government our full time, professional defence forces have been reduced in their number, and that leads us to a great deal of concern. Last year the Government proposed to reduce the size of our professional military forces. Off the top of my head, the Army, for example, has been reduced by about two battalions. It is down from six battalions to four battalions. Once if a again, if my memory serves me right, during the Vietnam war days 1 think we had 12 battalions involved in the Australian Army, and now we are down to four. We are reducing the size of our Australian defence forces. Whilst 1 know that when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is sitting at the table, gets up to speak later he will put forward the view who that the establishment of the Ready Reserve is more than enough to overcome the reduction in the full time standing Army, 1 believe, and many others would also join with me in that belief, that that is an inadequate response to reducing our defence forces. When we talk of conscription, we must always remember that it is essential to have that full time volunteer force ready at any time to service Australia. The track record of this Government in its management of our military forces is not one to be proud of. The former Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), in his time in charge of our defence forces was involved in the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities which was to hail a new era in Australia's defence forces. Unfortunately, that Dibb report has been basically sabotaged by this Government's approach to the funding of our military forces. I know that the Minister is going to take a point of order, so in order to avoidMr Bitney- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think the honourable gentleman knows what the point of order will be; it is that the Bill is a fairly specific Bill. I have been exceedingly tolerant in not raising any objection to the remarks he has been making. But I suggest that he might now come back to the BilL",81
325,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Order! I understand that there has been a wide-ranging debate. I take the point that the honourable member for Gilmore should come back to the matters contained in the Bill.,84
326,Mr SHARP,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are right; it has been a wide-ranging debate. I made the point about the contribution· from the honourable member for Chifley. from the Government side. We did not take a point of order on him. However, I understand the Minister is keen to get us back to the main part of the Bill, so I shall do that. The Opposition will support this legislation, subject to acceptance of the amendments that we propose. We believe that those amendments are very important indeed for the proper and successful implementation of this Bill. We do not believe in allowing people to be conscientious objectors based not solely on their support, or lack of support, for their involvement in a war, but on a lack of support for a particular type of war-be it, as I said before, for racial reasons, religious reasons or even political reasons. For example, I could be a dyed in the wool socialist and Australia could be involved in a battle with another socialist run country so I, therefore, could choose not to defend my country simply because we were in the process of fighting a comrade socialist country. That is not sufficient reason in our book for a conscious objection. It is our belief that people should be prepared to defend our country against all comers. I note the Govermhent has run out of speakers, so I am sure the Minister will not mind if I just proceed to talk a little further on some of the matters that I hoped to raise. Just to make the most of the opportunity, I go back to the matter of the Government's poor track record in the defence area by pointing out to the Government, as did the honourable member for Chifley, the situation with the Newington arms depot in Sydney which, hopefully, is to be the site of the new Olympic Games village.",84
327,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Order! The Minister who is sitting at the table has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that it is a closely held debate. I hope that the honourable gentleman does not range too broadly in his comments. MrSHARP-I shall not range any broader. I am responding to the remarks of the honourable member for Chifley who spoke earlier on this subject. There is nobody from the Government side to follow me and I am sure that the Government would not want the embarrassment, if I were to sit down now, of having no further speakers, so I shall continue. I would like to say that this is a very important issue for my electorate. Jervis Bay, near Nowra, is in my electorate. Of course, this wi-l be the site of the armaments depot when the Government has the courage to make up its mind as to what on earth it proposes to do on this very important issue. The armaments depot currently at Newington is in the heart of a residential and industrial area where, if anything were to go wrong-as I am sure the Minister would understand-it would be an. absolute catastrophe. It is essential that the Government get on with the job and make a decision, as it promised it would do by Christmas of last year, to construct a new armaments depot in Jervis Bay so that the people at Jervis Bay will have that boost to their economy that they so desperately need at present. The Shoalhaven region is looking forward to the 200 or so jobs that will come with the construction of the armaments depot. We are looking to the couple of hundred million dollars that will be injected into our local community. We are looking forward to having the number of very good citizens whom the Navy has given us in the past being expanded by the addition of a couple of hundred extra personnel moving into the Shoalhaven region when the Newington armaments depot is finally closed down to make way for·a safer and more efficient armaments depot in Jervis Bay. Mr Bilney-Hear, hear!",84
328,Mr SHARP,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I put those points. I thank the Minister at the table for saying 'Hear, hear!'. He knows the area very well. He might possibly volunteer to be the chairman of one of my National Party branches in that part of the world upon his retirement. I know he is looking forward to that. I conclude by saying that this is an important debate-one which we on this side of the House are prepared to support with the proviso of those amendments that the honourable member for Mayo has so eloquently outlined.",85
329,Mr BRADFORD,DEFENCE LEGISLATION," This is, indeed, an important debate. In fact, from my perspective, any time that we talk about defence in this Parliament is important. To the extent that tonight we are dealing with legislation that impacts to some degree on that very controversial topic of conscription, I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution as one of the very few conscriptees in this Parliament. In fact, I think there are only two who were victims of the system that existed post-1964. I am reminded, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you were a victim of one of the earlier systems of conscription. I would like to make my remarks mainly on the subject of conscriptiOn/national service. To do so, I want to review and put into context the historical background to conscription as we see it today. Current thinking about conscription is inevitably coloured by our most recent experience of it: the national service scheme which became law on 24 November 1964. That was a selective conscription for two years full time service, set against the backdrop of the war which was going on at that time in South Vietnam. In reality, however, conscription has been an important issue in Australia since Federation. Since then it has divided Australians. One of the main objects of Federation was the provision of an adequate defence for the continent. The Constitution conferred power over defence to the Commonwealth, and the Defence Act, amendments to which we are, in part, dealing with tonight, was amongst the first pieces of legislation considered in the new Parliament. The Defence Bill was first· introduced in 1901. It provided for compulsory military service in time of war. It was strongly supported by one William Morris Hughes; however, at the time he was almost alone in the Labour Party in his support for that particular proposal. The debate raged for some few years until 1903 when the Defence Act was passed, providing that the Commonwealth could compel men, to fight for their country in times of war, but only at home and not overseas. Alfred Deakin's Government introduced a Bill in 1909 for compulsory training in Australia, which went through with little opposition. I spent many hours reading the debates that have ensued on that subject of conscription over the years. It is interesting to read what Billy Hughes said at the, time: I know of no better method-I know of none half as good-of toning up physically and morally, and even industrially, the people of this nationhe was speaking of conscription. . . men speak of war and peace as if war were the greatest curse that afflicted humanity, and peace a thing that could be had for the asking. Men who cry peace when there is no peace are enemies of peace. There is but one way by which any man or nation can get peace, and that is by being ready for war. Billy Hughes said those words. When he said those words in 1906, I do not think he realised the significance of what he had said. In my view, those words are as true today as they were then. There was considerable resistance to the Deakin scheme. At one stage, some 5,732 young men were imprisoned for failure to comply with the regulations that existed at the time. Australia was not ready for war when it broke out in 1914, it had a divided a1111Y. As the war went on Australia suffered enormous casualties in Europe; 28,000 Australians were killed or wounded in Europe in 1916. So pressure was put on the Australian Government by the British Government to provide replacements and reinforcements for our troops who were being so severely affected by the war in Europe. Hughes, now Prime Minister, pressed for immediate conscription for overseas service. He was rebuffed on two occasions as he went to referendums. They were close results; but he could not get the support of his Labour colleagues. He went to the people and the people, in both referendums, refused to give him the right to conscript for overseas service. Compulsory training ended on the election of the Scullin Government in 1929. This Government lasted until 1931 when Lyons, another Labour renegade, came to office under the banner of the United Australia Party. Frank Brennan, who had been Labour Attorney-General previously, criticised expenditure on defence in 1936 with the following words: I cannot find anywhere any person outside of our mental institutions who is prepared to say nation is threatening Australia with invasion. At the same time he described Japan as 'a little friendly nation'. Once again, because of the many sentiments that were expressed commonly in the Labour Party at the time, we were ill-prepared for the outbreak of war in 1939. As in 1914, we had a divided army. Menzies, the Prime Minister at the time, reintroduced conscription for service within Australia. This was later extended to service beyond Australian territories. Shortly afterwards when the Labour Party came to government, it attempted to amend the Defence Act by setting geographic limits to the areas where conscripts could serve. On the eve of the German invasion of Russia, Curtin declared that the Labour Party was 'irrevocably opposed' to the Menzies proposal to conscript for overseas service. Soon Curtin was to become Prime Minister. When he became Prime Minister he faced some entrenched opposition to conscription for overseas service. The names of Calwell and Ward feature prominently in the debates at the time as they clearly, in my view, attempted to undermine the war effort. Calwell, Ward andothyrs of their ilk were more concerned about the class war in Australia than they were about the world war that was going on around them at the time. To them, clearly in the debates, conscription of wealth was more important than conscription of men. Curtin consequently was faced with a split in the Labour Party, exactly as Billy Hughes had faced in 1916. On 24 November, the newspapers ran headlines like 'Federal crisis on conscription. Labor Party may split'. Curtin, to his credit, went as far as he could, constrained by the radicals in his Party. Conscripts were not to be sent north of the equator. In other words, we had the rather unusual situation where a conscript might die fighting in Portuguese Timor but not in British Borneo. Australia, incidentally, required the Americans to defend Darwin while we were not prepared to fight for the Philippines. Debates at the time were invariably heated. There was great emotion on both sides. One that any is quite moved when reading some of the debates. For instance, G.J. Rankin, a UAP member and a former Major-General, in one of the debates said of a Labour member, J.8. Roseven: If the Japanese landed at Newcastle the honourable member would grab the fastest car he could find and would make off in their direction as fast he could to offer himself as a quisling. National service was introduced by the Menzies Government in 1949. Until 1957 this was a universal scheme for a limited time involving al- three services. It was abolished completely in 1959. It is interesting that in almost every year between 1945 and 1959 there was very strong support in the community for a national service of some sort. Community support rated as high as 88 per cent of the population and never dropped below 69 per cent in any of the polling that I could find. So there was very strong support for a fonn of national service at that time. In 1964, to get back to where I started, Mr Menzies announced the two-year selective scheme, with which most of us in this place are most familiar. The 1966 election was one of a number that were fought on the issue of conscription. The 1966 election was between Prime Minister Holt and· Leader of the Opposition Calwell. Mr Calwell promised, and in his policy speech he made great flourishing remarks-as best he could I suppose-to abolish national service and bring the conscripts home. He lost the election on that issue and others, again. Of course, he is famous for having lost numerous elections. Having put that little bit of history in my remarks tonight, I want to put in context not only my thinking but also the thinking of many Australian people on this legislation which makes some fundamental changes to the Defence Act. I ask: what does this ex. perience, and particularly the experience in Australia with the issue of conscription between 1901 and 1972, tell us in 1992? More than anything else, and I do not say this lightly because I have read the information, it points to the deficiencies the Labor Party has consistently shown in its handling of de(ence. Time and again, it was dominated, has been dominated and maybe is dominated-I will not go that far in deference to the Minister Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table-by radical left wingers. Even when it had leaders-and it did have leaders-who were prepared to make decisions in the best interests of the country, the Labor Party failed. In his second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) said-and I am rather suspicious of exactly what he meant by this: The Government's view continues to be that conscription couldI emphasise the word 'could be justified when Australia is directly threatened. What does 'could' mean? How do we interpret 'directly threatened' because that is the important phrase? What does it mean? How does one interpret the direct threatening of Australia? How close does that threat have to be geographically? To what extent are we talking about a threat to Australia? The mechanism that the Government proposes is fraught with difficulties, in my vi'ew. Imagine a parliament where the Australian Democrats have a significant influence if they represent the sorts of positions they appear to have today in respect of defence and a number of other issues. I would be aghast at the prospect of having a House of Representatives with a significant number of Independents; certainly, Independents with the sorts of views that I have heard the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) expressing. The recent Gulf war highlighted and continues to highlight the major deficiencies in AQstralia's defence preparedness and capabilities. We were clearly not prepared to react other than superficially in the Gulf war. I do not think anybody denies that. We now have a new three-Anny policy. We should hilVe learnt a lesson from 1914 and 1939. From my reading of it, from every perspective we had a problem with a divided Anny. There were constant problems in having two annies; not only military problems but also social problems. But now we have three annies in Australia. I do not know how it is all going to hang together. Mr Bilney-I raise a point of order, Mr for Deputy Speaker. This has very little to do with the Bill.",85
330,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Rubbish. Mr Bilney-What are we talking about? We are not talking about conscription.,87
331,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I am listening very carefully, and the honourable member for MCPherson has been talking about the history of conscription and now he is moving on from that point. I think he is still in order at this stage.",87
332,Mr BRADFORD,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was, I suppose, taking the opportunity within the broad context of this debate, although the Bill deals with amendments to the Defence Act, to make some fairly broad comments about defence. I am happy to close in a little bit, if that is a concern. But I to challenge the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel-and I am glad that he is here to listen-with some of the concerns that I, and I think a number of us on this side, have about where we are going with this whole broad subject. We now have the proposal to allow homosexuals to remain in the services, and I just wonder what is coming next. Then I look at the perfonnance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As he is of the right age, I am wondering what he was doing during the Vietnam war. I do not want to cast aspersions on him in any way, but we saw recently how far he was prepared to go to thumb his nose at tradition in attempting to rewrite the history of the war in Malaya and Singapore. The facts there were, of course, that despite an intense war in Europe and the Middle East Britain still managed to provide larger forces in Malaya than Australia did. Many of our British cousins suffered as our Australian soldiers did as POWs. The British worked alongside Australians on the Bunna Railway, and they also died there in their thousands.",88
333,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,Order! I think the honourable member is now straying a little bit further from the point.,88
334,Mr BRADFORD,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will move off my criticism of the Prime Minister and perhaps keep that for another day. I was looking for an appropriate opportunity to put the record right in tenns of what he has said about that matter. Getting back to conscription: if the Government really wants to do something for the young people of Australia whom it has hurt so badly, it should seriously contemplate reintroducing national service. I have had personal experience with that. If we are talking about conscription, then why not seriously contemplate, rather than gearing it down, in effect, actually gearing it up? Currently 30 per cent of young Australians are unemployed. I believe that there would be very good reasons why it would be better for young people to be conscripted than languishing on the dole. I think that there should at this time be a serious investigation of a number of options in respect of conscription. want I am not frightened to talk about it in this place at all. It seems to me that it is the sort of subject that people want to run a mile from. There are options other than direct military service, although I would say that that has a lot to commend it. There is an Anny auxiliary corps, a peace corps-type alternative or a civilian national service corps for employment on national projects. Perhaps it is time to seriously contemplate the conscription of all 18to 25-year-olds who have been unemployed for a certain period. Besides providing motivation to gain employment, it would provide a whole range of skills and could offer significant benefits, both financial and other, upon discharge after a period of service. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence in allowing me to canvass a lot of these issues fairly broadly. Unfortunately, we do not get enough opportunities in this Parliament to talk about defence. I have been disappointed in the two years I have been here at how few opportunities there have been to talk about what I think is a very important subject. Directly related to the legislation: I share the concern that has been expressed on behalf of the Opposition in respect of conscientious objection. I suppose there is a sense in which one could justify conscientiously objecting to one particular war and not another. Unfortunately, once again our thinking on conscription is so much influenced by the Vietnam experience. That, in a way, is unfortunate because that war, as it went on, became an unpopular war. The debate will go on for years perhaps as to what extent Australia was in any way at threat. There are a lot of people who held the view at the time-and the Government of the day certainly held the view-that we were acting very much in Australia's interest by being there. I shared the view at the time that there was a genuine reason for us to be there. As time went by, it became controversial. The fact that national servicemen, as they were called at that time, were serving there also formed part of that controversy. However, in my own'experience once again, not a great number of national servicemen, if any-there probably were some-were sent there agai-t their will. In my experience, any national serviceman at the time who did not want to go to Vietnam was provided with a way out. That might have been more difficult for those who were serving in infantry battalions and who had been trained with the battalion, but generally, national servicemen who were serving with battalions and other units that needed to train cohesively and who had any particular concern about going to Vietnam were identified very early and were posted out of those units. Tonight I have tried to put the whole question of conscription into context. It has been an issue since 1901. It will continue to be an important issue. In many respects our thinking of it, purely in terms of the Vietnam experience, is misleading. There were reasons why people conscientiously objected to service in Vietnam-perhaps because they did not agree with that particular war-but I think, as other Opposition speakers said, it sets, a very dangerous precedent for us to take the view that people ought to make that decision to conscientiously object to one particular war rather than another. I do not have any particul- or real problem with the concept of conscientious objection. I believe , that people can feel that way. (Time expired)",88
335,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I commend the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) for what has been an excellent analysis of the obligations of national service and conscription. The reason I' intervened before in suggesting that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr BiIney), who is at the table, is quite wrong in trying to narrow the base of this debate is that, as we all know, the subject of conscription and the extent to which individuals in our society may be called on to serve their country in the 'armed forces is probably one of the most fundamental that can be debated in this chamber. It is of no use debating a piece of legislation of this character on a non-broadcasting night and pretending that, because of that, there is no reason for us to look at why the legislation is before us, when and under what circumstances conscription might be enforced and what changes may flow from the changes that we are now debating. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has found, the rocky road to Damascus a la the by-election in Wills is a pretty treacherous path. We have heard how he is changing his attitude on tariffs. Even if this legislation may have had its genesis in the Gulf commitment and in undertakings given to the Australian Democrats, it is really not for that reason alone sufficient for us to just think we can look at the very narrow issue of this Bill and determine in what circumstances young Australian men and women can be sent to their death in the future. That is what this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is about. It is a fundamental piece of legislation and a demonstration of the power of the state against ,the individual. I am fascinated at its timing. One of the consequences of the changes pursued by Labor has been the extent to which it has spent a great deal of mOiley on equipment and has sought to fundamentally reduce the human capacity 9f the services to provide what many of us believe is an adequate defence response. Let me just look at adequate defence response. To me, adequate defence response is to provide a sufficient deterrent so that we need never send Australians to war. What the Government is doing is not looking at the way by which it can provide the positive element in this Bill; it is looking at the negatives. It is trying to set up a parameter where, having failed in providing sufficient attraction for a voluntary, service, it is looking at conditions whereby it is going to handicap an obligatory service. I want to look at a couple of the implications of it. The Bill contains three parts relating to the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, the Defence Housing Authority Act and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act. While I do not in any way deny that there have been significant benefits out of the Defence Housing Authority, I believe there are better ways to give some added benefit to service then and women by encouraging them to buy their own homes. I am not too sure that having an authority is the right and correct way to do that. All this does is provide another representative. The Defence Force Assistant Chief (Personnel) will probably be able to make a contribution, but all we are doing is getting more bureaucracy. Whether it is in the Defence Housing Authority or anywhere else, we have to start reducing our bureaucracy, not augmenting it. Whatever this Government does seems to add to the costs of everything we do. But let us put that aside and come to the nub of the Bill. The nub of this Bill relates to conscription. There are parts of these changes which all of us in our right minds would endorse. We certainly need to look at the conscription classes. They are anachronistic; there is reason to change them. We need to look at the way those who. are going to apply for conscientious objection should be judged in the conscientious objection tribunals. Those provisions are okay. The repeal of section 61(2) and the provision of a definition of 'conscientious belief' I think are satisfactory. It enables the people to know exactly what we mean by a conscientious objection. But conscientious objection and conscription need to be put in their context. The Labor Party needs to understand that it has had leaders such as Billy Hughes, who was prepared to actually change sides in this place on this issue. It needs to be understood that this Bill goes. to the core of the nationalism that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is suddenly finding is his new light on the hill. I believe that Australia's sanctity anq the preservation of our nation and its national interests are pre-eminent to the responsibility of government and of government concerns, but I am equally concerned that in looking at this legislation we seem to be coming to all those compromises that the Labor Party has made almost a profession. If it is not the factional compromises,it is bending over backwards to accommodate the Democrats: 'If I scratch your back, you will scratch mine; if I give you this, you will give me that vote'. Frankly, I have just about had enough of it. Australia is in an appalling state and, as far as our defence capacity is concerned, this legislation hamstrings the defence forces yet again. Nobody wants conscription. Nobody wants to fight a war. But, as I have said, my idea of a defence force is a defence force sufficiently strong, sufficiently capable, sufficiently well-structured, sufficiently wellarmed, sufficiently well-provisioned that we can be self-sufficient-and there is no doubt abo-t it; 'under Labor we are not-and nobody would want to attack us or intrude on our national interests. It is in that climate, all other things having failed, that I accept. that there are circumstances where, if the nation is under threat, we may need to call on the services of those who do not see fit to volunteer. Nobody likes requiring people to serve, but this Bill is so handicapping of a future government that, if it should want to call on them, I wonder whether our national interest will be protected. What are we after? Do we want to deter an aggressor, and how do we do so? We make sure that the government is able to respond if it needs to. This legislation does not give us that flexibility. There is this ridiculous period when everybody has to be consulted. I do not know whether the Minister or the Government has ever understood that, if a country is under threat, it is under threat. I thought the words themselves demonstrated that. If the Minister likes t9 go back to the second reading speech, or if he has a look at the Bill, he will know that the restraints are such that the proclamation for conscription can only follow, as stated in section 4(1) of the Defence Act: . . . any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack on, Australia by an enemy or an armed force; What did he do? He said, 'Look, I am terribly sorry, we cannot respond, we have ninety days-three months'. What the devil is he on about? What is going to happen in that 90 days? Meanwhile he is going to find that his nation is overrun, his country· has been completely overwhelmed by the invasion. Let me repeat: . . . invasion of, or attack or apprehended attack Australia ... I do not know. Government members scratch their heads and go back to academic land and they think, 'Gee, he might be an enemy'. We have had all this business of thinking that we are going to have 10 years notice or some period of graceMr Bilney-Ian, we'd send you.",89
336,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I would do a damn sight better than my friend opposite, the way he approaching the subject. It is ridiculous. It no use just saying, 'We have to pretend that we are not going to have conscription or the Democrats might not support us'.' The ridiculous Minister for Defence Science and Personnel is sitting at the table where the Minister-had we a decent one-would sit and exercise his responsibility on behalf of the nation. Mr Bilney-We would expect you to Defence support us.",91
337,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I do, if the Government produces measures that are sensible. I have identified several parts of the Bill which endorse, but it is those bits that are ridiculous that make me suspect this rocky road to Damascus a la the by-election in Wills that spoke of earlier. A period of 90 days is absolutely stupid. It cannot be endorsed, cannot be accepted and it does not make disadvantages sense. 1t has to go. But it is not only the 90-day bit that worries me. Has the Minister ever heard of saying an enlisted soldier, 'Look, I am terribly sorry, we have an attack on us from Kamaria. We have an exercise called Kangaroo '92, and we war. have developed a fictional enemy called Kamaria'? To my mind Kamaria virtually force. epitomises all of the nasties. It does not matter that it looks like an inverted Tasmania and it is stuck in a place where there is land mass; what it does is reflect a conceptual enemy. The Minister's proposition suggests that people would say, 'Okay, I have been called up. What the hell do I do about it? Those Kamarians are nasty folk. I could not possibly object to them wanting to come over to my country'. This is a double whammy. They are given 90 days to reflect while we through this ridiculous process of on, tation, then we say, in any event, 'It doesn't matter. If you don't like that particular enemy, sit back, then you don't have to fight'. Mr MCGauran-If you like them.",91
338,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I am sorry; the honourable member is right. The honourable member describes it so well. 'If you do like them, if you have a cuddly feeling for that particular enemy'-it just does not make sense. If the Minister wants to be classified as the master is of the absurd, he should proceed with this is legislation as it is at the moment. I am quite prepared to endorse those parts of the legislation which are sensible; those parts which are should be deleted. If they are not deleted, the rest of the legislation will be Prime thrown into vivid contrast. But it is not just that. I have said in other places that I am very concerned about a number of things that are happening in the Force, and one is the extent to which the commanding officers, the people wearing a purple uniform or the uniform of their distinct service, have a capacity to command I do their forces and to maintain good order and discipline among those who are responsible to them. We all know the difficulty in military I service, and many of us feel very sad at the plight of many of those who are serving at the it moment. There is no doubt that there are in some of the restrictions that Service life entails, but it is important that there is this concept of command and control, to that the concepts of military authority and discipline are maintained, even though they might be anathema to a peace force in time of As I have said before, I want a deterrent I do not want Australia ever to have to be involved in a war, but I recognise that, with the bipartisan support of members of this no House, we have been involved in peacekeeping roles over a number of years. There are circumstances where again, although· God forbid, we may need to have the commitment of Australian forces to defend our national sovereignty or to defend against those who seek to intrude upon it. In that climate we have to make sure that we maintain the go discipline and the authority of those who are consulat the head of the armed forces. At one stage I thought of inserting into the definitions within clause 4 of this amending Bill a definition that ensured that there was no doubt that the Chief of the Defence Force and the chiefs of each of the individual services had their own capacity to ensure, for example, that there was no question of the human rights and equal opportunities legislation intruding on the exercise of that responrespond sibility. Certainly, when that legislation is before this Parliament again, I will seek to ensure that no legislation like that intrudes the capacity of the chiefs of the Defence Force to exercise their command. As in this whole field of conscription, we have to make sure that chiefs of staff and other people defined in this legislation-for example, the new definition in this legislation includes the vice-chief of the Defence Force - have the capacity to exercise their authorithis ty. We cannot have pieces of legislation, such as the human rights and equal opportllllities legislation, intruding and preventing them exercising their responsibility. That relates homosexuality and all those questions must come back to the responsibility of those who are wearing a uniform and are called to exercise their prime authority. Conscription is no different. Of course, in our society we have to provide exemptions; for example, the definition, more precisely, of the term 'conscientious belief'. When I first rose to speak I identified those partS of these changes which I think are good. I think the idea of setting up these tribunals is good, but for us to go as far as this legislation does at this time raises doubts. To produce the ridiculous in talking about 90 days notice and in providing objection for a particular war and then to undermine the authority of the chiefs of staff, as the Minister at the table has by statements he has made about the obligations of the human rights and equal opportunities legislation, casts real doubt on the capacity of the Australian Defence Force to maintain that deterrent capacity which is fundamental to ensuring that it can undertake its prime role. This Bill is not just a superficial piece of legislation. That is why when I rose I commended the honourable member for MCPherson. He and a number of other honourable members, including yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, have been conscripted at a differe-t time, in a different way and for different reasons. I hope that, as time passes and circumstances change, conscription will never again be necessary. I understand that the Government, in its concern to try to placate the Democrats, felt that now was the hour to to its Gulf undertakings, but I do not think the result is what we want. I hope that when the Minister reflects on this legislation on he might see fit to delete those parts to which the Opposition so strongly objects. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) identified those parts in which we are going to seek deletions in the committee stage. This should not be a measure in which there is a partisan difference between the sides of the Parliament. I know that within Parliament those who have served as conscripts may feel even stronger than those of us who were members of a governinent . which introduced national service at the time to of the Vietnam war. They may feel differently that from those members of the Government looking at this in a climate in which they are on trying to placate those waiTing factions of which we see and hear so much. The legislation is a bit more· fundamental. It is about human beings. It is about the ultimate obligation that service in the uniform of .Australia, the uniform of the Queen of Australia, provides. I respect those men and women who serve Australia. I respect their dedication and, above all, .the fact that so many of them joined. voluntarily. They offer something all of us need to reflect on: they are prepared, as a result of their service to Australia, to offer their lives, should it be necessary, for the sake of the preservation of those qualities which are fundamental to everything that this Parliament represents. Accordingly, if we are to introduce any form of co-cription which removes that voluntary element, it requires deliberation and consideration, but not ridiculous compromise. To my mind, those two matters-particular war objection and the 90-day notice-make an absolute farce of the pieCe of legislation which is fundamental to the freedom of every Australian. I hope that the Minister will reflect on those and see fit to have them deleted before they go before the Senate. Debate (on motion by Mr Taylor) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Bilney) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Toowoomba Royal Show-Fightback' Package",91
339,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"For four days last week, the Toowoomba Royal Show saw 60,000 people pass through the turnstiles of one of the largest annual agriculthe tural shows held outside the capital cities. It was a credit to one of my constituents, the Royal Agricultural Society of Queensland President, John Blakeney, and to his busy committees, who ensured that, despite the extent of the rural commodity downturn and unparalleled drought conditions over the last couple of years, provincial and rural Australians were able to show what can be achieved for themselves, for their families and for the nation with substantial commitment and industry. The $lOm Glenvale purpose-built showground complex is a continuing credit to all those who have been involved in its development over the last seven years. Justifiably, Toowoomba can be proud that it has one of the most attractive, modern, well-designed and functional show grounds in the country. I salute John Blakeney and his team, together with all those on the land, without whom none of it would have been possible. I am sure that in 1993 we will see another great spectacle. On behalf of the people of the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley and the many thousands of interstate and overseas visitors, I take the opportunity to thank His Excellency Sir Walter Campbell, the Queensland Governor, for gracing the show with his presence last Thursday and for officially opening it. To him and to Lady Campbell I express my regret at not being able to be there because of parliamentary duties in this place. I also wish them both a long and satisfying retirement after they leave Government House in Brisbane later this year. They will be missed by many in all walks of life. I salute them as gracious vice-regal representatives, as wonderfully hospitable Queenslanders and as great Australians. Last Friday also saw the agricultural technology forum in the showground. I congratulate the chairman, Royal Agricultural Society of Queensland Vice-President and sixth generation grain grower, David Stirling, and his committees on a stimulating and successful concept in this, its second year. Well known financial consultant and newspaper correspondent, Noel Whittaker, and Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) were guest speakers at that forum. My parliamentary Leader's address on the Fightback economic reform package to over 2,000 people in the open-air family theatre was the highlight of a great day. Despite the recent scaremongering diversions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), it is clear that their views will be rejected in the bush now and when we next go to the polls. Country people have had this Government's broken promises and rural disinterest and see Fightback as the only viable U-turn in policy reform if we are to avoid the depths of the Argentinean road to economic ruin and to climb back to our previous international standing. Whereas the· Prime Minister's One Nation statement remains an unfunded con job, I say to those opposite that not only is Fightback funded; it stands for equity, efficiency, productivity, performance, less tax and jobs, . jobs .and more jobs. Earlier today in this place, the Prime Minister referred to my Leader as Captain Zero. All I can say to the Prime Minister and his Government is that if the description were accurate-which, of course, it is notMr Downer---':'Zero unemployment.",93
340,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Exactly, 'Zero unemployment' - I prefer that. That expression would be readily attributable to the Prime Ministerthat is, Major Recession, as distinct from Captain Zero-the self-confessed architect of what this nation had to have.",93
341,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight more in sorrow than in anger. I refer to what we have seen in Australia in the last few weeks in the kind of racism that has emerged, particularly in regard to the New South Wales police and also in an incident in Townsville involving the Queensland police. Now we have an even more horrifying incident in which the Queensland Young Nationals describe Aborigines and various other groups in society as parasites. It has forced the Courier-Mail, which in 100 years has had only one pro-Labor editorial-and that was in 1989 prior to the Queensland election-to suggest that Queensland Young Nationals were part of the Ku Klux Klan-as indeed they are. It is disgraceful, despicable behaviour, and it is racism and redneckism of the very worse order. Jake Smith, who happens to be the subject of the editorial, said that he believes all this is simply part of a plot of the unionists, parasites, Aborigintl$, single mothers and the not-so-genuine unemployed. That is quite extraordinary, given that it has been the National Party which for so long has sought goveniment handouts and has sought a whole range of government projects. This was the party that had very many people with their fingers in the till within the Queensland Government. What this public racism exposes for all of us as Australians is the inherent racism that is there. Sadly we have yet to see Mr Borbidge andhis National Party, and its coalition partner, the Liberal Party, dissociate themselves from this. We can only assume that it is these kinds of racist, extremist views which the Opposition parties are about. Not only are they about that sort of racism and despicable behaviour",94
342,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,94
343,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"This is the absolute truth. It is there. The other side of the coin is that we see Mr Borbidge and his Nationals also attacking unions. So not only now do we have Aborigines, unemployed and sole parents as parasites and people to be treated in a despicable manner, but we also have unionists. They are people who are working Racism as a· group to ensure that equity and equality are part of the work scene. It is quite extraordinary that the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) talks about the Fightback package. He comes from a town which I happen to know fairly well, as I was born there; a town which has one of the lowest per capita incomes in Australia and the very highest incidence of family allowance. We see people in Toowoomba demanding these sorts of things. But no, we still see the National Party and its partners in the coalition pursuing this kind of treatment of people, continuing to argue in favour of it and continuing to suggest that this is the way in which Australia and Australians should behave. It is absolutely and totally blatant racism at its very worse. Nobody in this House should condone· it, and no member of the Australian public should condone it. I think it behoves all members of the Opposition to look very carefully at what those members of their political parties are saying on their behalf. All of us in the community find it horrifying, disgraceful, despicable and disgusting. It is all of those things to suggest that a person, simply because of the colour of his or her . skin, should be treated differently from the rest of Australians. It definitely cannot and must not be allowed to continue. As a community, we must be separated from racism and prejudice. We on this side of the House look to the creation of one nation in which all of us can stand with equality and dignity before the law. We cannot be part of a community which is divided and in which racism and prejudice are allowed to be publicly acknowledged through the newspapers, through the airwaves and, indeed, by a major political party.

344,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,"Higgins) (10.35 p.m.)I would not normally concern myself with replying to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), a failed Victorian politician sent to Canberra to become a failed Federal politician. However last Thursday, in a scandalous, defamatory attack during the appropriation debate, he stood up here under cover of parliamentary privilege and launched allegations against the President of the Victorian Liberal Party, Mr Michael Kroger, and his firm and other people who are engaged in legal work with him. If those allegations were made outside this ,House, he would have received a writ. To the honourable member for Melbourne Ports I say, 'Go outside this . chamber, read out your speech, and we will make sure the journalists are there to hear Mr Simmons- Mr Speaker, I understand under the Standing Orders of this House that if a member is making comments about another member, he is required to do so by way of a substantive motion.",94
345,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member for Higgins is going to launch an attack on the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, he should do so by substantive motion.",95
346,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,I will take that up at Question Time.,95
347,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member for Higgins is only going to make some passing remarks, that is in order.",95
348,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,"I am complaining about a smear by association on the Victorian President of the Liberal Party. Bear in mind that Mr Kroger is not a member of this Parliament and is unable to come here and defend himself. The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) ought to show some concern for the rights of people outside this Parliament as well. It was said that Mr Kroger had, by retaining an inquiry agent to investigate matters down at the Camperdown abattoir, committed some kind of wrongdoing which warranted his resignation as President of the Victorian Liberal Party. Mr Hollis- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it is the practice of this House that if one member is going to attack another, he does the courtesy of informing that member so that that member can be present in the chamber and reply if need be. I wonder whether the honourable member for Higgins has informed the honourable member for Melbourne Ports?",95
349,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,There is no point of order.,95
350,Mr COSTELLO,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Kroger in fact retained a licensed inquiry agent. He is licensed under Victorian legislation administered by the Victorian Labor Government. He was entitled to do so. It is nothing but smear by association to say that because that person had matters in his past-notwithstanding that they were in his past, they did not warr-nt the removal of his licence-it was it' . improper in some way to retain him. It was not improper to retain him. Mr Kroger was singled out for a vicious attack in this House for one reason only, and that was that he held office in the Victorian branch of the Liberal PartyThe honourable member for Forde talked about the rights of people that she says are being infringed in Queensland. Mr Kroger was dragged through the mud in this House for no other reason than his political views. That is why. He was not here to answer for himself. He was not here to be able to stand up for his rights. If the honourable member for' Forde is concerned about human rights, and if she wants to do more than just posture, she can stand up and she can complain about matters like these. The fact is that a man bought the Camperdown abattoir-and I went down there myself-and tried to operate it. He gave jobs to 70 people in the town of Campeidown. Picketers turned out to try to close that factory down. They were succesSful and they closed it down. They abolished 70 jobs. I suppose the honourable member for Forde is proud of that. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports can come in here and defend that because 70 jobs were abolished in Camperdown. Some of the worse harassment possible went on in that picket line. Yet the honourable member for Melbourne Ports chooses to come in and defend that action. Some of the worse comments imaginable were made and some of the worse sexual harassment imaginable was committed agaiIJ.st a female solicitor down on that line. The honourable member for Forde can talk about feminism. She can talk about rights. Why does she not come in when she sees real sexual harassment and name it? Why does she not come in when she sees real jobs abolished and complain about it? But the honourable member for Forde and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports sit here behind the cover of parliamentary privilege attacking people for their political views, attacking them without faces, and attacking them in a way in which they cannot defend themselves. We will defend them. We will defend their rights if they cannot defend their own. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports ought to be ashamed of himself for his conduct.",95
351,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Oxley) (10.40 p.m.)The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) should be ashamed of himself for not warning the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) that he was going to carry on as he did in this chamber tonight. I would like to follow on from the remarks of the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) because I too was appalled, as all members of this House ought to be, at the rantings and ravings of Mr Jake Smith from the Young Nationals in Queensland on the weekend. Firstly there was the article in the Sunday Sun on the weekend, and the matter has been carried a bit further today. It is certainly disgraceful, and all those opposite should publicly stand up in this place and dissociate themselves from it. This sort of thing cannot be tolerated in our society, and nor should it be. The editorial that the honourable member for Forde referred to earlier degenerates into a tirade against what Mr Smith describes as 'parasites'. He says: Over the last decade of socialism from Canberramore of this 'reds under the bed' stuff that we used to hear from a former Queensland Premier- . the Labor Government has sold out in favour of supporting our Treasury's greatest parasites: unionists, the Aborigines, the single-mothers the not so genuine unemployed. It is not surprising that a member of a party that introduced the most regressive anti-union legislation in Australia should hold such a view of trade unionists. Nor is it surprising that a member of the Queensland National Party should be so racist as to describe Aborigines as parasites, or that a member of a party which has never distinguished itself by its commitment to the underprivileged should describe single mothers and the unemployed in a similar manner. The point about the whole episode is that, based on the record of the National Party in these areas, Mr Smith felt comfortable in making such blatantly racist, sexist and antiworker remarks in the official newspaper of the Party's youth wing. I should say right Racism wing, because that is what it is. Honourable members should also be aware that these remarks occurred in an issue of the magazine which carried a picture of the Queensland Leader of the National Party, Mr Rob Borbidge, on its cover. An endorsement of the magazine by Mr Borbidge was also contained in the issue, in which he said that the magazine-and cop this: . . . serves as a vital communication role for the party and deserves your support. Rubbish it does! The Queensland Opposition Leader later tried to distance himself from the remarks, saying that the views expressed in the newsletter were not necessarily those of the National Party. But it makes us all wonder, does it not? Such a disclaimer by the Queensland Opposition Leader is, of course, of little substance because, if the National Party were a party with any coriunitment to combating racist and sexist attitudes in society, a person such as Jake Smith would have no place in the organisation if he made such a comment. It should sack him. Far from backing away from his earlier statements, Mr Smith later w,ent on to make further outrageous statements on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. He is reported in today's Courier-Mail as being in favour of abolishing the Party's Aboriginal affairs policy altogether. The article reports the that, in a speech to the Central Council and meeting of the Party, Mr Smith said: . . . Aborigines represented less than 1 per cent of the population but had a separate Minister and Government Department . . . people were sick and tired of having a special policy for Aborigines. That is quite incorrect, as we all know. Mr Smith clearly fails to understand the unique p.osition .of Ab.origines in Australian s.ociety and Australian hist.ory as the .original inhabitants .of .our c.ountry. That a member .of a maj.or p.olitical party, which. is fast bec.oming irrelevant-I sh.ould n.ot use the w.ord 'maj.or'Mr Simmons-It is .only a min.or party.",96
352,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"It certainly is min.or in m.ost cases. That a member .of such a party c.ould be s.o appallingly ign.orant .of the c.onditi.ons faced by Ab.original .Australians is disapp.ointing at a time when the need f.or a bipartisan approach t.o Ab.original affairs is str.onger than ever bef.ore-and s.ome .of the reas.ons have been referred t.o earlier t.onight. .Recent media c.overage .of the problems in relati.ons between Ab.origines and p.olice sh.ould lead t.o a c.ommitment from all p.olitical parties t.o the pr.ocess .of rec.onciliati.on between Ab.origines and n.on-Ab.original Australians. If this process is t.o be a success, I h.ope that the views expressed by Jake Smith are n.ot widespread in the Queensland Nati.onal Party. Once again, I call up.on h.on.ourable members .opp.osite t.o distance themselves from it. Sadly, th.ough, based .on the Nati.onals' past rec.ord in Ab.original affairs and s.ocial welfare, racists such as Mr Smith are quite justified in feeling right at h.ome in the Queensland Nati.onal Party. Once again, I call .on all th.ose .opp.osite t.o distailce themselves from it. The h.on.ourable member f.or Maran.oa (Mr Bruce. Sc.ott) and the h.on.ourable member f.or Parkes (Mr C.obb), wh.o are in the chamber t.onight, sh.ould stand up and distance themselves fr.om it. They sh.ould take s.ome acti.on against this bl.oke in their .own Party. They sh.ould thr.ow him .out .of the Party. There was a bl.oke .on a jury in Queensland wh.o came from this same group. They are all . the same. If th.ose .opp.osite c<;>me fr.om the same branch they want t.o make sure that the y.oung pe.ople they are bringing up in .our s.ociety have a c.ompletely changed attitude, because the .only way we are g.oing t.o change the attitude .of Australian people ab.out the Ab.original people is f.or th.ose .opposite, in the Nati.onal Party particularly, t.o wake up t.o themselves, stand up t.o be c.ounted, and start d.oing s.omething ab.out educating .our y.oung people in particular. That is where it has t.o start. I call .on th.ose .opp.osite t.o stand up t.onight and diss.ociate themselves from th.ose y.oung people in the Y.oung Nati.onals wh.o are pushing this line. . Department of Veterans' Affairs",97
353,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"Last week I raised in the adj.ournme-t debate the questi.on.of an 87-year-.old Changi veteran fr.om my elect.orate wh.o had been refused the right t.o private treatment f.or his medical problems at a l.ocal level. He is an 87-year-.old man, bedridden f.or m.ost .of the time, with an 80-year-.old wife wh.o .obvi.ously c.ould n.ottravel the distance required t.o get t.o the repatriati.on general h.ospital in Sydney. I described the situation .of this man and the reply that I received from the Department .of Veterans' Affairs. I h.oped, as I said in that c.ontributi.on last week, that the Minister f.or Veterallii' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) would .override his ministerial bureaucrats and all.ow my c.onstituent t.o be treated l.ocally. The Minister came int.o the HHouse and, unf.ortunately, said n.o, he w.ould n.ot d.o anything like that. He raised this matter t.o a p.olitical level by saying that we .on this side .of the HHouse had v.oted against legislati.on that he had introduced int.o the HHouse last year which w.ould have ·all.owed, he said, the integrati.on .of repatriati.on general h.ospitals int.o the general h.ospital system. The reas.on that we v.oted against that legislati.on was a very clear .one: it did n.ot give clear rights .of access t.o veterans in a way which was unequiv.oca1. It was .opp.osed by the RSL thr.ough.out Australia. Theref.ore, it was entirely proper that the Oppositi.on took .the line that it t.o.ok. In reply, the MWster said that he w.ould take every .opp.ortunity t.o bring h.ome t.o people, when they brought individual cases t.o his attenti.on, the fact that we had .opp.osed that legislati.on. Well,.he was true t.o his w.ord. I have already menti.oned this case t.o the Minister this afternoon. It is an as.olute disgrace that a Minister .of the Cr.own sh.ould turn a situati.on like this, in which an 87-year.old Changi veteran needs special treatment, into a political football and use this man to blackmail the Opposition into changing its attitude towards the legislation which the Minister introduced into the House. He said that he would do that at that time. It is a situation which I find very regrettable, because I have a lot of time for the Minister concerned. But the fact that this Minister and this Government would use an 87-year-old Changi veteran as a political football indictment on the state of politics to which this Government has brought the Australian population.

354,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"I listened with some interest to the speech made recently by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in defence of Mr Kroger.

When those matters were broached with him on a radio station, he said, 'They are just like traffic offences'. Are embezzlement, impera Federal <;>fficer and larceny just like traffic offences?

As I said in my spe-ch, Mr Kroger was just happy to say that it was all false. There is not a single fact that I raised in my speech last Thursday that Mr Kroger was concerned to publicly deny. Why did the honourable member for Higgins, who is Mr Kroger's close confidante, not come into the House and say, 'On this fact Holding is wrong. On this fact Holding is wrong.

The fact is that the Labor Party and the trade union movement in Australia have never forgiven Mr Kroger, the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) for the work that they did outside this Parliament in turning around industrial relations in Australia.

Mr Les Scott interjecting",99

382,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,"That is why they have never quite got over what happened in 1986, and every available opportunity is grabbed by the troglodytes on the other side to put the boot in on the issue of industrial relations. Those opposite come in here with their craven concern for the alleged improprieties of the actions of the Victorian President. They are perfectly prepared to drag up the past record of an individual. What has happened to their gentle, nurturing concern for civil liberties? Are they seriously saying that criminal record of every man and woman in Australia, once they have served their debt society, should be forever held against them? Are they prepared to apply that standard to everybody with whom they come into conthey tact? Are they prepared to do that? Are they prepared to apply that standard to everybody with whom they associate? Are they prepared to say that? If those opposite are not prepared to apply that without let or hindrance, without exception or discrimination, then they are all condemned as hypocrites, especially the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, for having raised this matter. The simple truth of the matter is that honourable member for Melbourne'Ports has attacked the Victorian President of the Liberal Party because he holds that office and because of what he did in 1986. In so doing, he has made himself yet another lackey-along with the Prime Minister of this country-of one the most notorious unions in this country's history. No union has done more to destroy the jobs of Australians during this recession in the State of Victoria than the meat workers union under the leadership of Wally Curran. If ever a union set out to systematically destroy the livelihoods of young Australians, destroy the competitiveness of an industry, make it impossible for primary producers survive and make it impossible to run a profitable .abattoir anywhere in Victoria, was that mob, .led. by Wally. entered into an ideologically illicit union with the present Prime Minister to deliver-.

All I can say is that, in some senses, badge of honour for Mr Kroger to have been were usedattacked as he was in this Parliament by the the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. It indicates just how it continues to rankle with to members of the Labor Party, and those who support the rotten, uncompetitive, discredited industrial relations system in this country, that go on attacking a man who did a great deal outside this Parliament, as others did inside this Parliament, to turn around the industrial relations debate in the 1980s.

He knows full well the problems associated with the integration of the repatriation hospitals into the State system. He knows full well who is playing politics with the private patients scheme. It is not this side, it is not the Department of Veterans' Affairs; it is those on that side. The honourable member is guilty by his own response here this evening when he said that the RSL is opposed to integration. Nationally, it is; but the honourable member does not even know what is happening in his own State. The RSL in his State voted for integration. That is what the honourable member should remember. Not only the RSL, but also the War Widows Guild nationally, 47 out of 48 Legacies, the Australian Veterans and Defence Service Council, the TPI nationally, and the Koreans and South East Asians all support hospital integration with special qualifications.

Who are the guilty people? Those opposite should tell the veterans community why they are opposed to the private patients scheme, because they will not give the veterans community a private patients scheme. I will leave it at that. The honourable member for Warringah and I understand his sympathy for the veterans community. There is a lot of sympathy on this side of the House as well. There is only one way the honourable member will help his 82-year-old constituents to be able to be treated by their own health services in their own communities; that is, by giving them the private patients scheme.

403,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (l) , $6.71 million has been allocated for the Literacy and Learning Program under the Australian Language' and Literacy Policy for 1991-92. (a) The Literacy and Learning Program has two elements under which program funding will be directed to different areas of need: the Literacy and Learning General Element will provide support ($5.71 million for 1991-92) for a range of strategies to facilitate the development of literacy and learning in junior secondary years of schooling; and the Literacy and Learning National Element will provide support ($1.00 million in 1991-92) for the development of a range of strategies to facilitate the development of literacy and learning in the early years of schooling (K-3). (b) (c) Under the Literacy and Learning General Element, Commonwealth funds will be provided to States, including Victoria, in the form of block grants. The allocation is determined by the number of disadvantaged schools in each State. State Ministers are responsible for allocating funds to ANS'YERS TO QUESTIONS specific proposals relating to government and non-government sectors within the State. Under the National Element, Commonwealth funding will be provided to government and nongovernment education authorities in all States and Territories for collaborative developmental projects, which will improve literacy and learning in the early years of schooling (K-3). 'nJ.e projects referred to in points (b) and (c) of question 1 are examples of developmental projects that could be eligible for funding under tht< National Element. The management of National Element funds has been assigned to the Curriculum Corporation. The Curriculum Corporation, whose membership includes representatives of Victorilm as well as other States' and Territories' education authorities, will facilitate the development of collaborative project proposals and monitor and co-ordinate the activities funded under this element. The Curriculum Corporation will then be responsible for. the production and distribution of materials for national. use. A small amount of funds may be set aside for research and development activities and these would be subject to the usual tendering processes. (2) Senator Tierney was supplied with a breakdown of the budget allocation for the Australian Language and Literacy Policy as he requested. I attach the same information for Mr Charles by way of background. (a) Further details with respect to how and where funds will be spent on programs under the policy are given below in summary form: a boost to adult literacy through funding for State TAFE and adult education sectors ($11.51 million in 1991-92), a Commonwealth program of literacy in the workplace ($2.0 million in 1991-92), and, Commonwealth support for literacy for jobseekers ($21.0 million in 1991-92). The new Workplace English Language and Literacy program, operative from January 1992, is administered and funded jointly by my department and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, in consultation with the Department of Industrial Relations; additional funds of $10.68 million for adult ESL, through the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP); additional funding of $5.0 million from 199293 rising to $10.0 million in a full ESL Program (General Support Element), to ensure that school systems meet the ESL needs of their children; a new program (total cost around $5.15 million in 1992-93) to provide an incentive to systems to encourage students to continue studying selected languages to Year 12; an additional 30% of funds for the Ethnic Schools Program, bringing the total to $9.4 million per annum, with new administrative arrangements to encourage greater involvement from systems; national funding for innovative projects in adult literacy and in languages other than English for children ($2.5 million each year). Support for children's literacy innovative projects will start in 1992-93 with $0.38 million, rising to $0.48 million in 1993-94 and $0.53 million in 1994-95; funds for public awareness associated with the policy and to promote the use of plain English (0.5 million in 1991-92, decreasing to $0.4 million in 1992-93); and funding of $1.75 million in 1991-92 for an Aboriginal Languages Initiatives Program which will address measures for language maintenance and development. Punding of $2.63 million in 1992-93, will also be provided for Aboriginal English literacy and language education through the Aboriginal Education Policy in the 1993-95 triennium. (b) Administrative guidelines for service delivery under these programs have been finalised in consultation with State and Territory authorities and other Commonwealth departments which are involved in the implementation of the ALLP. Most programs and program elements are being implemented from 1 January 1992. Australian Traineeship Program (Question No. 1273) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: (1) How many persons (a) in each State and (b) in the Geelong region have participated in the Australian Traineeship program. (2) What was the total cost of the program in each year of its operation.",103
404,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable year for the member's question is as follows: (la) The numbers of participants in the Australian Traineeship System, by State, since inception to 30 June 1991 are: ACf-2,305 NSW-21,81O VIC-8,594 QLD10,348 WA-4,383 SA-4,238 TAS-2,OOO NT-771 AUST-54449 (lb) 103 young people have participated in the Australian Traineeship System in Geelong since its inception in 1985. (2) The total cost of the Australian Traineeship System in each year of its operation is: 1985-86-n.a 1986-87-$21.5m 1987-88$28.6m 1988-89-$40.7m 1989-90-$37.8m 1990-91-$35.Dm Leaded Petrol (Question No. 1284) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: (1) Is the concentration of lead in petrol sold in Perth 0.84 grams per litre; if so, (a) is the level elsewhere in Australia between 0.3 and 0.4 grams per litre and (b) why is the level in Perth so high. (2) Has the National Health and Medical Research Council and Australian Environmental Council set a lead level standard of 1.5 micrograms per cubic metre; if so, does the level in Perth exceed that standard. (3) Has it been recommended that the lead level standard be lowered to 1 microgram per cubic metre, in accordance with the objective of the World Health Organisation (WHO). (4) Do lead levels in areas of urban Australia exceed the level referred to in part (3); if so, will the Government ensure that the WHO objective is met in all Australian cities and that .lead concentration in petrol is reduced to ecologically sustainable levels and if so, when.",104
405,Mr HOWE,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a to b) The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has advised that by agreement with BP Refinery (Kwinana) Pty Ltd in July 1991, the maximum concentration of lead in petrol is 0.65 grams per litre with an annual average of 0.60 grams per litre. This is intended to be reduced to 0.4 grams per litre by 1996. The Western Australian EPA advises that regulations are being introduced to fonnalise this agreement. In other parts of Australia published information indicates that lead concentration in petrol varies from 0.3 grams per litre (Victoria) to 0.84 grams per litre (Northern Territory). (2) The National Health and Medical Research Council has recommended an Ambient Air Quality Goal for lead of 1.5 micrograms per cubic metre, three month moving average. The Western Australian EPA advises that this level has not been exceeded in the central business district of Perth since August 1991. (3) The level mentioned is that recommended by WHO for Europe. The National Health and Medical Research Council has agreed to commence a review of the Ambient Air Quality Goal for lead. (4) Yes, intennittently at some sites in major urban centres. The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment between the States and the Commonwealth will mean, amongst other things, the establishment of a National Environmental Protection Authority whose responsibilities will include the development of a national approach to setting environmental guidelines, standards and goals and the associated protocols. This prOCess will provide the basis for establishing national air quality standards. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Question No. 1298) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 25 February 1992: (1) What funding has Australia provided to UNESCO in each year since 1988.

(6) How does AUstralia rate UNESCO's perfonnance. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Mfairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia has provided the following funds to UNESCO in each financial year since 1987-88: 1987-88 ' A$5,914,983.14 1988-89 A$4,628,829.59 1989-90 A$5,451,006.28 1990-91 Paynient deferred to 1991-92* 1991-92 A$5,162,870.59' *As part of the 1990-91 Budget deliberations it was agreed that the 1990-91 payment of Australia's contribution to UNESCO would be deferred until July 1991. Funds will continue to be' paid in July of each financial year and the payment of Australia's 1992 payment will be made in Julyi.e. in 1992-93 financial year.

The impact of this decision was effectively to increase the allocation provided to the Major Programme Execution and Services Item by US 1,500,000. The decision taken at the General Conference specified that this amount was to be financed from unspecified savings from within the total budget. As these savings had not been identified by the Secretariat at the time of publishing the Approved Budget it was necessary to include, for accounting purposes, the negative amount of US$I,500,000 under the Item ""Reserve for Draft Resolutions"". This amount will gradually disappear from the budget as savings to fund the US$I,500,000 are identified. (4)(a-b) The amount under UNESCO's budget item ""Major Programme Execution and Services"" is US$229,136,7oo or 51.5% of the total approved budget for 1992-1993. There are also a range of items under the section General Policy and Direction which provide support for the initiatives and directions of the Major Programme. These include the costs associated with the General Conference and the meetings of the Executive Board. The total allocation for overall administration by UNESCO was US$138,583,6oo. This amounts to 31.2% of the total budget for 1992-1993. (5)(a) The performance of UNESCO is not monitored directly by the United Nations General Assembly because of restrictions in the mandate of the General Assembly. The General Assembly would defer on matters of administratidh and policy to the UNESCO Executive Board which is elected by members to administer the organisation and to the UNESCO General Conference which meets every two years. The assessment of the performance of UNESCO is therefore in the hands of its members. (b) Australia conducts a biennial review of Australia's participation in the UN, UN Specialised Agencies and the Commonwealth which is submitted to the Government. A review of UNESCO is undertaken along with other UN Specialised Agencies. 18,215,700 29,561,000 47,776,700 444,704,000 (6) Australia has been a strong advocate of the need for UNESCO to streamline its administration and management and to provide a greater proportion of its budget to major programme sectors, especially education, science and tec-ology, and communications and to enhance its activities in the Asia and Pacific Region. We have pursued this through our participation in the General Conferences of UNESCO and the efforts of our mission to UNESCO in Paris. Separately, Dr Peter Wilenski, while, Ambassador to our UN Mission in New York, has been a member of a review team evaluating UNESCO Secretariat reform. The latest review, contained in a report of 15 January 1992, has commented positively on steps taken to re-structure and improve the professionalism of UNESCO on a range of staffmg issues; on delegation of financial authority to programme areas; and on decentralisation of personnel and functions from Paris. The review considers that while administrative reform is now on track, a determined effort will still be needed to institutionalise this so that it becomes the natural working process of the organisation. The election of Ron B.O. Jones, MP, to the Executive Board will give Australia considerable scope to participate in the continuing reform process of UNESCO.

(4) Will cases of human rights violations in Zimbabwe be examined; if not, does the Australian Government's role in foreign relations in Africa involve selective morality. Mr Kerin-The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Australia is committed to the universal observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights. Human rights concerns are taken into in the foreign aid program and each situation is considered on a case by case basis. For example, the provision of aid to Burma was suspended on human rights grounds and, after the . events of June 1989, aid to China was severely curtailed. Australia's aid and human rights policies share the overall objective of seeking to improve the situation on the ground for the ordinary citizen. The Government considers that a direct and inflexible linking of aid to the human rights performance of .recipient countries can be counterproductive and may further disadvantage those most in need of assistance. Human rights and development were prominent issues at the CHOGM meeting in Harare. At the conclusion of. the meeting, all Heads of Government pledged, in the Harare Declaration, to work with rertewed vigour to extend the benefits of development within a framework of firm respect for human rights. (2) Human rights issues were discussed between Prime Ministers Hawke and' Mugabe at the. CHOGMmeeting in Zimbabwe. . (3) No. These cases.arose some years ago and, while the circumstances are a matter of concern to Mr the Australian Government, little purpose, would have been served in taking them up at CHOGM . with the Zimbabwe Government. Mr Malumisa has not been heard from since the 1984. It is widely presumed that he is dead. Mr Stuttaford lives in South Africa. He has solicitors in Zimbabwe pursuing his compensation payment. (4) The Australian Government has an active policy of raising with foreign governments credible reports of human rights abuse worldwide, wherever they might occur. In the past three years, the Australian Government has raised 1266 such cases throughout the world, including 302 cases with countries in Africa, including Zimbabwe.
