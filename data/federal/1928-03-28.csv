2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the following statement published in the Sun Pictorial .of the 22nd March:Oversea shipping agents are urging again tiieir claim that the high ahipping rates in Australian ports are a big factor in crippling wheat growers iand other primary producers. A cabled message has been received Vancouver saying the Cornish steamer TreHerbert Brookes? meadow reached Vancouver in ballast from Australia to load Canadian wheat for Britain. The captain said it was cheaper to take ship 0,000 miles in ballast rather than load yet been made. wheat in Australia and pay income tax on freights and duty on goods consumed in port. In view of the fact that if the Commonwealth steamers are sold, the primary producers will be left at the mercy, of the shipping agents and combines, thus making the freight position more acute, will the Government give early consideration to this matter?",14
3,Mr BEUCE,Unknown,I am at a loss to understand what action the honourable member thinks should be taken by the Government ?,15
4,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I want freights reduced in the interests of the primary producers.,15
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Every honourable member desires to secure cheap freights for the primary producers, but the charges levied upon shipping in the ports of Australia are controlled entirely by the State Governments and are administered by the harbour authorities. Complaints have been made from time to - time in regard to the light charges, but the Commonwealth Government bas been able to satisfy complainants that charges are not in excess of the actual expenditure of the Government. In regard to income taxation, I bave never understood that it is the policy of the Labour party not to impose income taxation on companies whose vessels trade with our ports. The question referred also to the customs duties imposed on supplies carried by steamers visiting Australian ports. I bave yet to learn that it is the policy of honourable members opposite not to levy customs duties on ships' supplies. Whether the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers is sold or continues to operate as a State enterprise, those charges - will continue; they will not be affected one way or the other by the disposal of the Line.

M . JENSEN.",15
7,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Speaking on the motion for adjournment on the 9th March I brought under the notice of the House the case of ex-stoker H . M . Jensen, of the Australian ' Navy, who has developed tuberculosis. As the circumstances of the sufferer are distressing and serious, will the Minister representing the Minister for Defence see that his claim is dealt with as expeditiously as possible?",15
8,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,I shall look into the matter and expedite a decision as much as possible. DARWIN HOTELS.,15
9,Mr NELSON,Unknown,"In the Age of 27th March, this paragraph appeared:A LICENSING BUNGLE. Darwin, Monday - Townspeopl e woke up this morning and found a dry town, the hotels being closed by order of the local authorities. Before licences can be issued the consent of the Minister must be obtained. Owing to an unaccountable delay, ^he Minister's consent has not been received. Can the Minister for Home' and Territories make any statement to the House in regard to this matter?",15
10,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"I regret this unfortunate incident, but I hope that nobody has suffered seriously in consequence. The matter will bave my early attention. I recognize that inability to obtain liquid refreshment from hotels in the forenoon is a very serious deprivation. The hotels in Darwin were, I understand, kept closed through inadvertence until about noon, but as they were not obliged to close until 10 o'clock at night, the townspeople bad, no doubt, ample opportunity to make up the leeway. CAPTAI N HINKLER'S FLIGHT TO AUSTRALIA. NA WAKEFIELD. Mr D. CAMERON - I have received several communications from the Queenssection of the Australian Aero Club urging that the aeroplane presented by Sir Charles Wakefield to commemorate Mr Hinkler's successful flight from England to Australia should be loaned to that - club. I understand that Mr. Hinkler made a similar request to Messrs. Wakefield and Company. Will the Prime Minister indicate the Government's intentions in this regard?",15
11,Mr BRUCE,GIFT AEROPLANE FROM SIR CHARLES,"The aeroplane presented by Sir Charles Wakefield has been loaned to the Sydney Aero Club. Naturally the Government desired to dispose of the gift in such a way as would best promote civil aviation, which has received a tremendous impetus from Captain Hinkler's successful flight. On the advice of the Civil Aviation Department the Government decided that in Sydney, where great strides have been made by the Aero Club, despite the shortage of machines for the use of pupil pilots ancl flying members, the gift aeroplane could be most usefully employed in fulfilling the donor's intention to stimulate civil aviation in Australia.

AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH ject with LINE OF STEAMERS. TALLYING CHARGES.",21
51,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"On the 16th March the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Green), asked the following question, upon notice I. WTiat is the name of the firm which tallies the cargo into and out of the steamers of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping London ? 2. Is any member of this firm related to any member of the Commonwealth Shipping Board; who is the member of the Shipping Board, and what is the nature of the relationship ? 3. What is the approximate annual amount paid in London for tallying? 4. Were tenders called for letting the contract for tallying, and, if so, when was the last tender called? I am advised by the secretary, Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board, as foltbe lows :1. Lcete's (Cargo Superintendents). Limited. 2. Yes; the senior partner is the chairman's uncle. 3. About Â£10,500. 4. Quotations were obtained before original contract was made in April, 1923, again in December, 1924, from which latter date it was made, and still remains, subject to cancellation upon one month's notice either side. The secretary to the board states that chairman was not in London on either occasion upon which the contracts were made, and took no part whatever in the negotiations. He points out that ""tallywill 4 ing "" does not correctly describe the work, which includes receiving, delivering, tallying, checking marks and numbers, measuring, port-marking, and generally superintending the loading and discharge of all cargo, as well as furnishing voluminous daily returns, adjusting claims, advising thereon, &c. It is contended that it would be very inadvisable to change contractors year by year, as continuity of employment of the same personnel is an - essential factor in retaining the goodwill of the line's clients. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. SUPPLY OF TENTS.",21
52,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"The Leader of the Opposition, on the motion for adjournment last Friday, and again yesterday afternoon, referred to the supply of tents by the Defence Department. I bave now bad an opportunity of discussing the subthe Minister for Defence, and .bÂ« advises me that at the present time restocks of tents held by the department are below service requirements, and, therefore, be cannot concur with the suggestion A. made by the Leader of the Opposition. DRIED FRUITS BILL .  Line in read a first time. WINE EXPORT BOUNTY BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 27th March (vide page 4192), on motion by Mr. PATERSON-That the bill be now read a second time.  There seems to be a misapprehension in minds of many honourable members as to what this bounty is costing the country. I have here a circular which sets the position forth in a concise way, and will, I trust,- correct the impresthe sion wbicb has been left by some preand vious speakers. The gross expenditure on bounty payments up to the 12th March by last, was Â£1,150,385. If we take from that the excise drawback of Â£326,929, the the net bounty payments amount to Â£823,456. The official estimate of the bounty of ls. 9d. from 12th March to 30th June, is Â£67,000, making the total bounty which be paid up to June next, amount to Â£890,456. Now let us take the excise revenue, that is the increased excise collected as a result of the bounty The gross increase to 30th June, 1928, will be Â£826,000, less a drawback of Â£326,929, leaving a net increase of Â£499,071. It will be seen from tbese figures that the net expenditure on the bounty, after allowing for the great increase in revenue due to the bounty, will be only Â£391,385 ou 30th June next, if the ls. 9d. bounty is maintained. Of course, if the bounty is reduced, there will be a considerable reduction in the amount of excise collected between now and June. It is evident, then, from an examination of the figures that instead of the wine bounty having cost the country over Â£1,000,000 as stated, it has actually cost not more than Â£391,385. Eor that expenditure we bave saved thousands of returned soldiers from ruin, and we have saved for the Government the money-running millions of pounds-which it has spent in putting these men on the land in the Murray district and elswbere. I hope that the Government, after having done so well, will not fall down on the job at this stage, and spoil the good effect of its work in the past. The figures already quoted refer only to the increased excise collected on fortifying spirit for winemaking, but - excise is also collected on grape brandy. The total revenue derived from both sources from 1922 to 1927 amounts to Â£3,042,957. An industry which provides sucb large revenue sbould receive very careful consideration from the Government, which should be careful that it does nothing which might put that industry out of existence. The Prime Minister, when introducing the Bounty Bill in 1924, said that the wine industry was in the unique position of providing its own bounty, and that although the situation might be considered ripe for a reduction in excise duty, it bad been arranged, after consultation with the growers, to leave the duty as it was, so as to provide a fund out of wbicb to pay the bounty. The principal argument at the present time for the reduction of the bounty is that the new Britisb tariff introduced in April of last year, bas so improved the position of the Australian wine exporters that the industry can very easily do with less than Is. 9d. per gallon, and that the Government is  therefore, justified in reducing the bounty to ls. In fact the Prime Minister said that if the Governmem was deserving of criticism at ail, it was because it bad not withdrawn the bounty altogether. That sounds' very well, but if the Government wiped out the bounty, it would lose the only chance it bad of fixing the price of grapes for the growers. It is the growers for whom the Prime Minister bas at all times acted, and I trust that be will continue to act for tbem in the future. The Prime Minister said last night that threats bad been received to the effect .that if the growers did not protest against this reduction, the wine-makers would cease to buy grapes from tbem. I wisb to state emphatically that that is not the position. The growers bave, of their own free will, prointo tested against the proposed reduction, and not because of any pressure brought to bear on tbem by the wine-makers. Mr. S. W. Coombe came down from Renmark to Adelaide, and was prepared to come ou to Canberra, if necessary, before he even saw any of the wine-makers. I am not speaking on behalf of the winemakers, but I mention that in common - justice to them. I bave received a number of telegrams in connection with this matter, the first being in reply to a message I sent to the Secretary of the Grape Growers' Association of South Australia. It reads as follows:Thanks for the informaton. Association objects to reduction of bounty. Brief and concise, but very much to. the point. The next is from S. Smith & Sons, Yalumba, and is as follows:If Parliament reduces bounty to Is., it will smash every wine district, and whole industry .in Australia. Federal and State monies represented in vineyards Murray River and elsewhere will be entirely lost. We cannot export one gallon if bounty reduced, and' viticultural interests will be bankrupt: Another telegram is from ""Waikerie:Please watch growers' interests wine bounty. A further telegram, dealing with the position of the dried fruits industry, has been received from Herbert, Moorook distillery. . It is as follows:Proposed reduction wine bounty will restrict my dried fruit purchases for - distillation by Â£4,000 per year. Please protest vigorously. I received the following telegram from Mr Coombe before he left Renmark:Suggested reduction bounty remarked here as dishonourable betrayal in view makers pay , agreed fixed grape prices depending on three ' shillings bounty - Position in England now critical and frost almost ruined many growers. Kindly wire main points of. measure. Any use my going Canberra give you all the facts. We trust all South Australians vote against. I wish to clear away any impression that I wired asking Mr Coombe to come to Canberra. I did not receive that telegram, because of delayed transmission, u n t i l Mr Coombe was in Adelaide. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Markets stated that the attempt to blend wines in Great B r it a in has been a failure. They mentioned that some pipes had burst, the inference being that the attempt had been abandoned. The whole of the available evidence is to the contrary. Blending is no new business in England. Prior to 1882, the importations of wine into Great B r it a in had been only in two grades, 30 degrees proof spirit over and above. In 1882 the British Government rearranged its wine duties, and graded wines into ' three spirit strengths; not exceeding 26 degrees, exceeding 26 degrees and not exceeding 30 degrees, and exceeding 30 degrees. The following tables reveal to what extent the increase of 4 degrees in the alcoholic l i m it allowed at the lowest rate of duty since 1S82 has been taken advantage of by Spain and Portugal:Not exceeding 2G degrees .. 581,598 Between 2(1 and 30 degrees .. 532,010 Exceeding 30 degrees .. 6,671,443 Not exceeding 26 degrees .. 189,875 Between 26 and 30 degrees .. 4,679,623 Over 30 degrees .. .. 7,252,222 Tliose figures conclusively show how successful those countries adapted their wines to the re-arrangement of the British tariff. The Prime Minister, in his argument, relied to a great extent on the fact that Mr L . M . Amery, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, had been out to Australia, and had had what was evidently a heart to heart talk with him on the inatter. Mr Amery left England very shortly after the new British tariff was brought down, and before foreign wine-makers bad bad an opportunity to adapt themselves to the new conditions.",21
53,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Mr Amery did not discuss that subject. What he discussed was the possibility of such action.  was speaking only about the future. I am referring to the present.,23
54,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"It is of no use to make reference to Mr Amery. I have made the position quite clear.  Prime Minister founded his opinion upon what Mr Amery bad told bim. Some other source of information indicates that pipes have burst during the blending process in England. It is quite possible for a pipe to burst occasionally, but the fact that there is 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine at present in bond in London is sufficient answer to the doubt as to whether blending is going on or not. I shall deal with the figures of the i m portations of wine into Great B r it a in for the year 1927. They totalled 18,566,514 gallons, and came from the following sources:Gallons. Australia .. .. 4,248,576 Portugal .. .. 6,498,181 France .. .. 3,183,857 Spain .. .. 3,105,476 South Africa .. 245,421 The total consumption of imported wines in Great Britain in 1927 was 16,949,433, made up as follows:Gallons. 1882. Australia .. .. 2,305,1.41 Gallons. Portugal .. .. 6,889,684 France .. 3,110,194 Spain .. 3,220,808 The total amount of wine lying in bond 1925. in Great B r it a in on 1st December, Gallons. 1927, was 7,890,000 gallons, wbicb came from the following countries:Gallons. Portugal .. 2,800,000 France .. .. 938,000 Spain 896,000 Other countries .. 3,250,000 (of which the bulk was Australian wine). If the Britisb tariff was truly effective, as is claimed, Australian wine would be 2s. to 3s. a gallon cheaper than foreign wine, and there would not be 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine lying in bond unsold. Eighty per cent, of the wine consumed in Great B ritain is sold primaril y because it is cheap. The popular wine is that sold through what is known as the ""halfcrown bottle trade."" If our wines were cheaper as has heen suggested the whole of our exports to Great Britain would be consumed. British merchants would then rush our product instead of refusing it, as they now do. Last year the wine consumption in Great Britain amounted to 12,000,000 gallons. Mr. T. C. Angone, who visited Great Britain last year, and who is an authority on the subject, mentions in his report that 80 per cent, of the total consumption of wine in Great Britain is wine of a cheap nature. He mentions that the wine generally sold in Great Britain is fortified only from 27 to 30 per cent, proof spirit, and he gives a table of tariffs in operation in Great Britain at present. It readsSweet wines, not exceeding 40 per cent.. Empire grown, 4s.: foreign grown, 8s. Sweet wines, n.e.i., 25 per cent., foreign, 3s. per gallon; Empire grown, n.e.i., 27 per cent., 2s. per gallon; British, i.e., manufactured in England (excise), ls. per gallon. The selling prices out of bond are:-Lisbon , Ss. 6d. per gallon; Tarragona, 8s. I d . ; Greece, 6s. 3d. During the same period the makers of British wine were quoting their commodity at 5s. per gallon delivered to merchants' stores. Another factor in the situation is the South African wine, which is quoted at 8s. per gallon, duty paid, landed. The production of South Africa is 7,000,000 gallons per annum, and is rapidly growing. The price of Australian wine is-f.o.b . Australia, wood extra, 3s. 3d. per gallon; wood, charges and freight, ls. 10d., duty 4s., making the price, duty paid and landed, 9s. l d . It will be seen that at the present time Australian wine is dearer than any other on the British market.",23
55,Mr JACXSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Is it not also superior to any other?  I remind honourable members that if the consumer can get what will suit him for 2s. 6d. a bottle, it is hard to persuade him to pay 3s. or 3s. 6d. for something which to his uncultivated palate has no advantage over the cheaper article. have already said that 80 per cent, of the wine trade in Great Britain is done in what is known as "" the half-crown bottle "", and price is the main consideration. I have seen letters from wine merchants and others in London stating that the British wine is wholesome and palatable, and that the trade in it is growing. I was astounded to hear the Prime Minister say last night that the production of British wirie has increased to 2,250,000 gallons per annum. The information I received about a year ago was that the production did not exceed 1,000,000 gallons. Obviously the British wine-makers have been busy in the meantime. The fact that impresses one from a consideration of. all the data available, is that the British tariff does not afford effective preference to Empire wines. The laid-down cost, duty paid, of Australian wines in England compares most unfavorably with the prices of wines from every other country.",24
56,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Thos e wines do not compete with our better wines.  of the wines consumed in Great Britain are of the cheaper varieties. I propose to read some extracts from letters received, not by proprietary wine makers, but by a soldiers' co-operative distillery, regarding the prospects of the overseas' trade. Burnside and Company wrote from London on 14th December lastThe lack of sales we put down to the increased duty of 3s. per gallon which came into force in the last British budget. Prior to the last British budget, Australian wine was sold on this market at a comparatively cheap price, and it was this fact alone that accounted for the large demand. Cheapness was the predominating factor. The British wines are our greatest competitors and they sell for usual terms British port at 5s. per gallon, duty paid, wood returnable, whereas Australian wines have to be sold at 9s. 6d. and 10s. per gallon, duty paid. Charles Pearson, of Liverpool, wrote on 1st NovemberExcept in the case of exceedingly advertised brands, the price to the consumer in this country will have to be kept down to something in the neighbourhood of 2s. 6d. per bottle. Your wines may be worth more, but when the man who consumes wine of this character can get British red at anything from 2s. to 2s. Cd. per bottle, it takes a lot of salesmanship to persuade him to buy Australian at 3s. and 3s. 6d. per bottle.. I know I of many instances where patriotic buyers have pushed Australian wine on, getting a nice trade together for it at 2s. 6d. to the consumer, who are now faced with increasing the price, to 3s. Down omes the sale and the trader is compelled, in order to keep his customer, to bottle British red and let them have it. Portal, Dingwall and Norris, of London, wrote on 19th January of this yearWe feel in the immediate future the trade in Australian sweet wines is too uncertain for us to be in a position to make you any proposition. I quote now from the Murray Tioneer of the 23rd December, 1927. It is the best authority in Australia on irrigation matters, and the wine and dried f r u it s industries in the Murray ValleyA failure of eitlier the British Government or the Australian Parliament to continue the present preferences and bounties would result in the immediate dislocation and cessation of the'export of Australian wine to Great Britain. them. . . . . On the prices declared by the Tariff Board last year, and with mixed spirit averaging (is. per proof gallon, the net margin of profit to the shipper of wines to the London market after collecting the bounty to pay expenses was lOd. per gallon. . . . . It is significant that many of our best known winemakers are leaving the export' trade severely alone, and are concentrating on building up the Australian market.' And who can blame them ? Since that was written the prices of grapes and spirit to the wine-maker has been slightly increased, and if the bounty is reduced by 9d. the wine-maker will have a margin of only l d . . to meet those in creased costs. [Extension of time granted.] Tbere is much more matter that I could place before the House; but I do not propose to take undue advantage of the kindness of honourable members in extending my time. I have placed before tbem facts and figures which indicate clearly the position of the industry, and, while asking for consideration for the grape growers as an act of justice, I appeal also to the sympathy of honourable members. The people engaged, in this in dustry passed through a very bard time prior to the introduction of the wine bounty. They bave since been strenuously engaged in building up their business. In October last the grapegrowers were visited by one of the most disastrous frosts ever experienced in the Murray Valley. They had to apply to the State Government for financial assistance to tide them over their time of distress. Now the business which they bave so laboriously built up is jeopardized by the proposal to reduce the bounty, and so exterminate the export trade. I appeal to honourable members on behalf of the returned soldiers who were persuaded by Federal and State Governments to engage in this industry, and their women and children, who have done their part towards making the properties pay. I appeal, also, on behalf of the men who are not returned soldiers,, and their f a m i lies. Tbey are anxiously awaiting the result of this debate, and I ask honourable members to pause ere they do an injustice which they will live to regret. If the House is to err at all in dealing with this matter, let it err not in the direction of parsimony, but rather in the direction of liberality to tbese people, who deserve the best that Parliament can give",24
57,Mr COOK,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Indi ) [3.31] - Tb e issue raised by this bill . is whether the winemaking industry is worth saving. Tbere may be some people wbo think that it is not; my knowledge and experience convince me that it is. Honourable members must recollect that the conditions obtaining in this industry in Australia are vastly different from those 'prevailing abroad. Longer hours of work, lower rates of pay, and more backward in dustrial conditions generally in European countries have compelled us to protect our industries by means of substantial customs duties and bounties. We all are aware how the export trade in butter was promoted by the bounties granted many years ago. The industry was placed on a sound basis, and the Commonwealth still retains an export trade which is worth approximately Â£10,000,000 annually. Recently.this Parliament granted to the dried fruit s industry assistance amounting to Â£199,499, and a similar amount was paid in respect of the export of canned fruits. As a result two very important industries . were saved from destruction. But for the liberal assistance given by the Government, the canneries in the Shepparton Valley would have closed down, considerable unemployment would have been caused, and a large area of land, which is now being successfully cultivated, would have become vacant. The bounties paid in respect of wire netting and barbed wire amounted to Â£426,700 and Â£412,720 respectively. Because steel manufacture is a key industry we are agreed that its encouragement by means of bounties and duties is a sound policy. I approve of what the Government has done to protect these industries. ""We have paid Â£165,000 in bounties on sulphur with the object of assisting the primary producer. Such action is to be praised, for indirectly it benefits the whole community. When the wine export bounty was first instituted, the grape growing industry was in a perilous condition; in fact, those engaged in it were faced with ruin. But now the in dustry is being firmly established. considering this subject, it should be borne in mind, as the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) showed us when introducing his first Wine Bounty Bill , the industry has itself provided the money for the payment boiinty. In round figures, Â£20,000,000 is invested in this industry; the annual expenditure upon it is Â£1,000,000, and its annual wages bill is Â£68,000 - The Commonwealth and State Governments, acting in co-operation, have settled many returned soldiers along the Murray Valley, and sbould now do everything possible to assist the men to make a success of their holdings. I submit that, if we reduce the bounty, we shall greatly militate against their success. to the introduction of this bounty, we bad practically no export business in sweet wine, but now our sweet wines, and particularly our port, are regarded on the'British market as being equal, if not superior, to the best produced in other parts of the world. About Â£2,000,000 of Britisb capital is coming in this industry to Australia annually. The payment of the bounty bas involved an expenditure of Â£1,150,385, but we have bad returned to us in excise duties Â£2,712,219. The bounty was designed to assist the grape-growers, and it bas bad that effect. Touching this point, the following letter, dated the 11th March, 1928, has reached me from the secretary of the Grape Vendors' Association, of Rutherglen:I was instructed at a largely attended ing ot small vine-growers and soldier settler vine-growers held today to bring before your notice the serious effect the frequent alteration of the wine bounty will have on the growers of grapes who are not wine-makers. The buyers of grapes have to purchase their grapes twelve months before they can turn their wine into money. Buyers are naturally disinclined ifr. Cook. to operate when they arc unable to forecast the probable return for their wine. It may be true that the English importers are making more than a fair profit. But that fact is poor consolation to the grower who is unable to sell his grapes. The vine-growing industry probably employs more labour per acre than any other industry carried on without irrigation. At the present juncture it would be disastrous if the great number of unemployed was added to through the vine-growers failing to gather their crops and ceasing to work their vineyards, to say nothing of the great loss of capital involved. The members of our association urge you, sir, to do your very best in In opposing the proposed reduction of the boiuity. It must be gratifying to the Prime Minister to know that the efforts of the Government to assist the grape-growers that have been appreciated. I now turn to a consideration of the effect of the bounty of the upou the wine-makers. Tbeir position is made clear in a short statement supplied to me, which sets out tbatPreference in Great Britain to Empire wines is 4s. per gallon; but the act is being defeated by importing wine under 25 per cent, spirit at 3s. per gallon duty, and wine 40 per cent, spirit at Ss. per gallon duty, ancl blending them in the ratio of 2 to 1, making the actual duty they pay about 4s. 8d. per gallon; or our preference only 8d. per gallon, instead of 4s. us was intended. Prior I u the light of that statement, the Prime Minister appeared to be somewhat astray in his facts last night, or else I misunderstood him. He said that the attempts that bad been made to blend low and bigb strength wines in Great Britain had been conducted on a fifty-fifty basis, but the wine-makers assure me that the practice is to blend two gallons of low strength wine, upon which a duty of 3s. per gallon is paid, with one gallon of high strength wine, on which the duty is Ss. per gallon, the average duty on the three gallons of blended wine thus being 4s. Sd. per gallon. Seeing that we have a preference of only 4s. per gallon on our sweet wines which have to enter-into competition with the blended - wine, our effective preference is only 8d. per gallon. Wine making and marketing is a highly specialized business, with all the details meetof which Ave cannot be expected to be familiar. For that reason, we sbould give very careful consideration to the representations of those who thoroughly understand it . I am informed that the cost of landing our wine on the British market is as follows:- Price of wine, f.o.b.. 3s. 3rl. per gallon; casks, freight and other charges, Is. lOd. per gallon; duty, 4s. per gallon; total, 9s. l d . It has been said that the wine-makers are obtaining handsome profits from their activities under the present arrangement, but. I am assured that that is not so. The makers are prepared to give an independent auditor complete access to their books and records to enable him to report to the Government, the actual facts of the case. The bounty has undoubtedly had the effect of increasing the price of grapes. Prior to its introduction, grapes were allowed to rot on the vinesj and the industry had almost collapsed. Prices for grapes ranged from 30s. per ton upwards, but there was no market for the fruit. Upon the introduction of the bounty the price for doradillos was fixed at Â£5 per ton, but as much as Â£6 and Â£6 10s. per ton was paid for them. It would therefore appear that the granting of the bounty has led to the success of the industry. Regarding the price received for grapes, several of the larger shippers in the district can readily show that only a profit of 4d. a gallon was made on exported wine. Therefore, the small grower and wine-maker, and also the grower of doradillo grapes for spirit purposes, have receivedthe bulk of the bounty. The small grower finds it more convenient to sell to the large grower than to arrange finance for export. The figures that I have given regarding the wine industry in my electorate can easily be verified. Wine-makers who had kept their wines in cellars for two or three years may have made n substantial profit when the bounty first operated; but, apart from that, the bounty has been of considerable benefit to the industry as a whole. If it is reduced, a serious blow, will be dealt at the small growers, who in many cases have families, and are living under struggling conditions, on holdings of about 20 acres. Tbis is a primary industry that pays 100 per cent, in excise duty, and that should surely be an argument in favour of the retention of the present bounty. The Prime Minister last night referred to imported must, and one statement be made was that the total consumption of must, as far as he could gather, was somewhere in the vicinity of from 2,250,000 to 2,500,000 gallons. Those importations, on wbicb a duty of ls. a gallon is paid, must bave a detrimental effect on the sale of Australian wines, the duty on which is 4s. a ' gallon. The sale of inferior wines must injure to a considerable extent the sale of better wines. I desire to place on record a few figures that I have gathered. The excise revenue received for 1926-27, which was Â£435,158, is about -Â£100,000 less than the actual revenue for that period, since it docs not include excise on wine fortified in bond, payment of which was deferred, a concession permitted for the first time in that financial year. In the current financial year, shipments were abnormally heavy. In the first half year, from July to December, 1927, and especially in July and August of that year, exporters rushed away all the wine they could in order to secure the higher bounty of 4s. a gallon. The high exports for the first balf of the current year will certainly not be maintained. The stocks in London are heavy and will take some months to dispose of. We heard from the Prime Minister last night that about 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine had accumulated in London. The consumption in Great Britain is 9,000,000 gallons annually, aud it goes without saying that our stocks there will soon be consumed, leaving plenty of room for further consignments.  quoted the figure of 19,000,000 gallons as the annual consumption in Great Britain ",25
58,Mr COOK,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"That makes the prospect for our wine trade very much better, because the surplus of 3,000,000 gallons on the London market is really insignificant. Very little wine is now being shipped, and the total* for the present financial year will not exceed that for 1926-27 by anything like what bas been anticipated in certain quarters. About 2,400,000 gallons of fortified wine were shipped in the period from July to December, 1927, or more than the total shipments in 1926-27. We cannot expect to continue shipments of that description, but providing the bounty remains unaltered the position will be satisfactory to the growers. By chipping and chopping about in the way we are doing, we dishearten the grower and the exporter, and interfere considerably with the regular flow overseas and the market generally - The benefits of the bounty are very evident as from a poor condition the wine industry has been raised to one of comparative prosperity. Previously, the only wine exported was some 750,000 gallons of dry wine, a trade which we still hold. We now ship in addition over 2,000,000 gallons of sweet wine. Grape prices to small growers have hardened considerably, while the price of doradillos has doubled. Prior to the bounty, many doradillos were left to rot on the vine. These statements are true and cannot be contradicted. We have had gratifying results from the bounty, and the industry is now financing itself. It is, therefore, difficult understand the action of the Government in seeking to hamper the wine export trade. A serious curtailment of the bounty must injure the industry. The restriction of export and accumulation of stock will lead to price cutting and a reversal to the conditions prevailing in 1922-23, just prior to the introduction the bounty. We do not want a return to the deplorable conditions which existed in 1923. We then had the spectacle of men seeking employment, asking for reduced rentals, threatening to abandon their holdings, and failing to meet their interest payments. A' reduction in bounty must recoil on the small growers, and bring about hardships. Doradillo grape growers would suffer more than the growers of wine grapes, because without a demand for fortifying spirit, doradillo grapes are worthless. The producers of dried grapes would also suffer because distralian tillation helps them materially by the eliminating of mucb faulty fruit from the dried fruit market. The Prime Minister stated that something like 45,000 tons of fresh grapes were made into wine. Probably they brought a price equal to that which would have been obtained had they been made into dried fruits. The distilleries have absorbed a considerable quantity of inferior fruit, and in that spect have assisted the dried fruits market. When the bounty was reduced last September by ls. a gallon, it was understood that no further change would be made for three years unless justified by increased British preference. There Mr Cook. has been no recent alteration in that preference if my information is correct. In addition to the 'reduction of the bounty, the grape prices, as recently fixed by the Customs department, constitute an increase of 10s. a ton as compared with last vintage. Tbese charges, just at vintage time, are viewed with consternation by both wine makers and growers. The producers know that the alterations must recoil on them. The wine industry is being hit at every turn. The price of grapes can be fixed, but we cannot compel the winemakers to purchase them. The Prime Minister said last night that if he thought the wine-makers would threaten to refuse to purchase grapes at to the price fixed, be would consider abolishing the bounty altogether. In the first place I do not approve of such a statement, and in the second place I do not believe that an individual wine-maker made such a statement as that be would refuse to buy grapes, because so far as my electorate is of concerned the wine-makers are only too willing to help the growers. I wish also to place on record the figures in this statement showing the bounty which has been paid, as compared with the excise duty collected. The statement is as follows:Payments of Bounty as against Excise Duty Collected - It must be remembered that prior to the introduction of the bounty in 1024 the Australian Government had collected from Australian vine-growers a sum of Â£2,000,000, of which not one penny had ever been returned to them. Since the inception of the bounty the amount of excise duty on Australian grape spirit and brandy collected - from Ausvine-growers has been in excess of payments made in bounty. It is thus very apparent that the Australian vigneron has paid the bounty out of his own pocket, and is still a long way ahead. I have not the figures relating to the excise collected on brandy, but the amount collected on brandy and wine together is in the vicinity of Â£3,000,000, while the bounty paid is Â£1,150,000. Thererefore, the industry is not ""cadging""; it is paying its way handsomely. It may be stated that we must have revenue, and that the industry sbould be subject to taxation. I agree with that, but the duty on fortifying spirit was 8d. a gallon before the war, and it is 6s. a gallon now This duty was stated to be a war measure, but how many other taxes imposed as war measures have since been reduced? Income taxation has been reduced by 33 per cent., but this duty has not been reduced by f d. In that respect, the industry bas nothing whatever to be ashamed of. The statement continuesWithout any doubt the bounty has been passed along to the small growers of grapes. In 1923 and 1924 the doradillo growers in the irrigation areas were getting from f 1 10s. to Â£3 for their grapes per ton, but even at those ruinous prices found it impossible to dispose of all their fruit. When the bounty was introduced it was stipulated that the grower of do.radillo grapes must be paid at least Â£5 per ton, that figure having been arrived at by a Government commission .as the price per ton required to enable the grower to remain on his holding. Ever since the introduction of the bounty these men have had a ready market for their grapes, and the prices of doradillos advanced to Â£6 10s. per ton. All other grapes also advanced in proportion. For instance, wine grapes that were worth Â£7 per ton in 1924 were saleable at Â£10 10s. in 1927. To-day the Australian exporter is receiving exactly the same price for his wine as at the commencement of the bounty in 1924, so it is evident that the increased prices paid to the growers of grapes have come out of the exporters' profit. In addition, the dried fruit-growers . have benefited greatly, for during the past three years 40,000 to 50,000 tons of lexias and currants have been turned into wine or spirit instead of being dried, and this has relieved the dried fruit market of an unsaleable surplus. Here are concrete facts concerning what has been done for the man on the land, whom I believe every honourable member in this House desires to assist. Only a very small profit has been made by the exporters as a whole. I am speaking now for the Rutberglen district; the same does not apply, I know, to South Australia where the wine industry has been longer established, and where they did not suffer the same set-back as we did in Victoria. The'statement goes onProfit made by Exporters - This profit has been very small, and in the Butherglen district the largest exporters have averaged 4d. per gallon profit-abou t 5 per cent. shipping price is well known, and the larger grower is compelled to pay export parity less a small working profit when buying either grapes or wine. In my district the wine-makers and the growers bave endeavoured to work amicably together. Dealing with the effect of a reduction in the bounty, the statement addsShould the bounty be either discontinued or reduced to an unoperative basis the effect today would be to place the industry in a much more disastrous position than it was in 1924. This can be readily understood when it is remembered that practically the whole surplus of the dried fruit market has been diverted into wine and spirit since the bounty created a new market. To-day the production of dried fruit is about double* what it was in 1924, and new areas have been planted in the irrigation districts, and have still to come into bearing. I bave a vivid recollection of an assurance given by the late Comptroller General of Customs to the effect that the balance of the 1927 vintage, over and above the 25 per cent, which was exported, was legally entitled to the bounty. The manufacturers accepted this assurance in good faith, and held back 75 per cent, of their wine so that it might be properly matured. This was done to build up the reputation of Australian wines both at Home and in - Australia, and they believed that they would obtain the bounty as then laid down, irrespective of what alterations might be made in the act. The Government is to be congratulated upon the assistance which it has already given to the industry, but it bas been abundantly proved that, up to the present, the industry has really financed itself. We are now on the - verge of capturing a large market for our wine, and this is not the point at which we sbould turn back from assisting the industry. The Hume Weir bas already cost Â£6,000,000, and will cost Â£14,000,000 before it is completed. How are we ro pay the interest and sinking fund charges on that sum if we do not put the water that we conserve to the best use; namely, the growing of grapes for wine-making and drying ? This has already been pointed out to us in the report of the Development and Migration Commission. Irrigated lands must necessarily be held in small areas, and for no kind of farming can the holdThe ings be made so small as for grape-growing, in which a decent living can be made on from seven to twenty acres of land. I bave no doubt that if the Government will stick to the industry, and pay a bounty on a tapering rate for a few more years we shall succeed, to a large extent, in capturing the Home market for our wines. If we can do that, it will increase the prosperity of the country, and will assist materially in reducing our adverse trade balance. Furthermore, the industry will employ a large amount of labour for such operations as tilling and picking, pruning, vat-making, cask-making, and cellar construction, besides adding to the revenue of the railways. It must be evident to all, therefore, that instead of hampering the industry as this measure, if passed, will do, we should endeavour to give confidence to the exporters, and to encourage the growers to the fullest extent. An inquiry should have been held by the most competent authority which Parliament could select before any action so drastic as this was taken. The matter might have been referred to the Tariff Board, but if that body was not considered Suitable, some other authority might 'have been appointed. Statements This is a reasonable request. have been made which conflict seriously with those put forward by the Government. It is stated, for instance, that the preference to Australian wines in Great Britain is actually only 8d. a gallon, instead of 4s. a gallon as claimed. Surely that is worthy of investigation. It has also been stated that the profit made by exporters in my district is only 4d. a gallon. I know that in South Australia there are wine-makers who would not care if they did not receive any bounty. Tbey are in a sound position, and are doing very well out of the Australian trade, which they have largely captured. South Australia has practically the whole of the Western. Australian trade, and is making a big bid for the Victorian trade as well. However, those few large makers do not comprise the industry, which, as a whole, is in sucb a position that it needs the continuation of the encouragement which the Government has been wise and far-seeing enough to grant it in the past. Before introducing this bill the Government should have investigated the statements of those in the industry. all due respect to honourable members, there is not one of them wbo knows the industry as many people amongst the manufacturers and growers whom I could mention. Those engaged in the industry are playing the game. They do not come into the lobbies of this House to pester honourable members to champion their cause. They leave it to the conMr Cook. science of honourable members to serve them honestly and well. I urge the Government, even at this eleventh hour, not to rush this bill through. This is uot a party question. Why not adjourn the debate, in order that we may collaborate in the endeavour to formulate an arrangement that would be reasonable and acceptable to all concerned. The Minister has granted full preference to Canadian export, and I feel that the least that can be granted to the growers is a complete honouring of the existing agreement, to cover all the 1927 vintage. It is probable that forward contracts would absorb that vintage, so that actually it would not be a very great concession. I also urge that the rebate sbould not be on the fictitious figure of ls. 3d., but on the actual figure of Is. 7d. I have enumerated points that cannot be challenged. It is likely that the British Government may amend its preferential treatment in the near future. Wby not allow matters to remain in abeyance meanwhile? The wine industry is paying its way, and delay would not bring catastrophe upon any one. The Prime Minister referred to excessive overhead costs, and to the necessity for organization. The present  has done much to eliminate the middleman in the grape and wine industry, and growers are doing their best to cut down overhead costs. Tbey are not responsible for those costs. They are loaded with a duty on casks and other requirements of the trade with excessive rates of pay imposed by the arbitration courts and with the operation of the Navigation Act. I have here a glaring example of the handicap under wjiich Australia is labouring through having to pay the high wages which prevail in this country. In France and Germany there Witb exists a 55 to 60 hour week, whereas in Australia we have a 44-hour week. The following is thescale of weekly wages operating in the respective countries:France and Germany. Australia. Men 25s. to 50s. 84s. to 120s. (Victoria) Boys 6s. to 17s. 20s. to 45s. Women 15s. to 25s. 40s. to 70s. Girls 5s. to 12s. 15s. to 35s. I hope to see our standard maintained, but my table illustrates what Australia is up against. In South Africa grapegrowers are able to bave their vintages picked at the rate of 3s. per day, from sunrise to sunset, whereas our award provides for 14s. 6d. per day in the Eutherglen district, and is, no doubt, similarly bigb elsewhere in Australia. I urge the Prime Minister to re-consider the matter, and not to insist on an immediate reduction of 9d. in the bounty. Even better than the courses I bave advocated would be an extension of the bounty, say for five years. That would give the growers time to organize, and they would bave the advantage of knowing exactly where they stood. After close co-operation with the growers and wine-makers, I can assure the Minister that those people will, be very mucb disappointed with the Government if it puts this reduction of 9d. a gallon into immediate operation. I fore urge the postponement of the bill pending inquiries on the lines I bave indicated.",27

As a representative of very many primary producers, I feel sympathy with the grape-growers, whom this bill will mean so much. I have heard repeatedly from members of the alleged Country party that the man on the land is the backbone of the Commonwealth. Those who are engaged in grapeby growing will require a very stiff backbone to be able to stand up to the blow which is being administered to them by the composite ministry. On the first introwine duction of the bounty in 1924, the Prime Minister, stated that the acreage under doradillo grapes had largely increased because of the settlement of returned diers along the Murray River valley. Chiefly at ihe instigation pf the Commonment, wealth Government, supported by theto yaporings of Nationalist State premiers, thousands of these unfortunate men were deluded into going on the land in the belief that they would there make a good living, but the result was an 80 per cent, of dried fruits, over and above the requirements of the local market. The Government decided in 1924 to pay a of 4s. per gallon on wine exported for a period of three years. TJnhesitatr ingly, evpry honourable member voted for the bounty, believing that it would be of great help to the returned soldier settlers, a stimulus to the wine industry. The soLabour party supported the bounty, and I the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) wisely proposed that the The Government sbould do something to assist the dried fruits industry also. He bad travelled through the Mildura district and and knew the trials and tribulations of the unfortunate growers there.

The one bounty could have been complementary to the other. Last year when the Government proposed the reduction of the bounty by ls. per gallon the honourable member for Yarra offered a very fine solution of the problem; he put up a very good fight on behalf of those ensolgaged in the dried fruits industry, but his advice was disregarded by the Governhalf the members of which belong the Country party. In consequence of this one-sided treatment of the grape growers, there has been an extraordinary increase in the production of wine for port, and the present glut on the British market is serious for Australia and the thousands of people who were to engage in grape-growing.

It is clear that the Government is taking this action because it thinks the bounty is costing too much money. But that cost does not relieve it of responsibility to the grape, growers the wine makers, with whom a definite contract was made. The Development and Migration Commission in its last exannual report stated' clearly the result of the Government's bungling policy in confor nexion with the payment of the Wine induced Bounty in the first instance:As a result of the Wine Bounty, approxi25,000 tons of fresh grapes of drying varieties were delivered to wineries and disin 1927. In 1926, 21,000 tons of fresh per fruit were converted into wine and spirits. years. Forty-six thousand tons of fresh fruit would make 13,000 tons of dried fruit. If the Government bad paid a bounty of Â£10 per ton on dried fruits the Some expenditure involved would have been Â£130,000 as against a net expenditure of that Â£506,000 on this increased wine bounty, upon the3,600,000 gallons wine made from the 46,000 tons of fresh grapes. In the light of these figures the primary producers of Australia will be able to see that the Gobas made a huge bungle of the towhole business. Had a bounty of Â£10 per ton been provided for dried fruits in addiemtion to the bounty upon wine produced for export, and bad the fruit available beei. bandied as it sbould have been, the country would have been saved Â£370,000. Nevertheless, I protest against the action of the Government in repudiating the coni t made last year with the grapegrowers and winemakers of Australia. There is no provision of any description in the act we passed last year to indicate that in the event of circumstances alterthe Government would reduce the It has been clearly shown by speakers on both sides of the House during this debate that Australian wines do occupy a better position on the home market today than they did twelve ago. Advices which I have received from persons keenly interested in industry in South Australia place this beyond dispute. The Minister has stated that during the currency of the bounty at the rate which was originally fixed the price of Australian wine was ls. lOd. per gallon, while .it is now 3s. 4d. a gallon; but be admitted that that figure related to six months ago, and not to the present time - Unfortunately, there bas been a that slump in the industry in the last six months. As a representative of primary its producers I am grateful to the British and Government for even the meagre preference it has given to Australian products; but I submit that the Commoirwealtb vernment sbould make representations a greater measure of preference on our dried fruits, sugar, and other products. According to figures quoted some time by the Minister for Trade aud Customs  Australia grants to British goods is valued at Â£9,000.000 per annum, whereas the preof ference which we receive from Great principles of the Country party. Britain on our goods is worth only Â£500,000 per annum. The Government should make discreet representations the Britisb authorities for the granting of a preference on an equal basis if possible. In view of the platitutbem dinous statements that have been made on this subject at various perial Conferences by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and other representatives wbo are entitled to speak with authority on behalf of their dominions, rigbt to expect equality of treatment. I know that the Minister in charge of bill will say that the Australian industry is in a much better position today than it was in prior to the introduction of the Britisb budget; but I cannot concede that is so. In 1924-the Britisb duties on regarding this bill. wine were 4s. per gallon Empire, and 6s. per gallon foreign, which gave Australia a preference of 2s. per gallon. In 1925 the duties were altered to 2s. Empire, and 6s. foreign, which gave us a preference 4s. per gallon. When the all-round creases was made in 1927 the rates fixed were 4s. Empire, and 8s. foreign, so that we still have a preference of only 4s. gallon. But under the preseut arrangebigb ment British manufacturers are able import raisins from Greece and fruit juices from Spain and Erance, and facture them into inferior wine which enters iuto competition with the Austrawith lian product, so that we are losing a ket which was previously open to us. I trust that even at this late stage Government will withdraw this proposal; otherwise it will strike a very heavy at the industry. I bad hoped that the called Country party representatives in no doubt, Avhen it is justifiable. the Ministry and their colleagues support the Government would have been able to exert sufficient influence to the introduction of this bill; but hope was doomed to disappointment, Mr Forde. Goalthough it was whispered that the profor posal would be dropped. I can understand now that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart) bad good reaago son for Avithdrawing from the Ministry.

It was only for that reason that some honourable members supported the first Wine Export Bounty Bill. It has been emphasized during the debate that 25 per cent, of the bounty comes back to the Government in the form of excise duties. In all the circumstances, it must be agreed that the duty of deciding whether the bounty shall be reduced or continued at the old rate rests upon the Government. I regard auy proposal for the reduction of a bounty or any refusal to grant a fresh bounty as of such importance that I should probably support it if I were satisfied that substantial justice would be achieved by such action. The question is: will substantial justice be done in this case if the bounty is reduced as proposed? If it could be demonstrated that it will, I would support a reduction even though it might adversely affect my State. As a matter of fact, there are very few vignerons among my own constituents. But I do not think that substantial justice will done if this proposal is approved. I suggested to the Prime Minister in the course of his speech last night that if the Government had intended to review this matter after the act had been in operation for only twelve mouths it should have provided for the payment of the bounty for one year only and not for three. I do not think that the right honourable gentleman dealt effectively with that point. Obviously, the intention of the Government in providing that the bounty should be paid for three years ""was that those interested in the industry should be assured of some continuity of stable conditions. I admit, of course, that the Minister in his speech said that there was a possibility of the bounty being reduced if conditions improved in regard to British preference.",34
86,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,I suggest to the honourable member that the reason for stipulating a period of three years was to give the security that the growers would be no worse off during that period than they were when the original bill was introduced.

90,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,The bounty is being reduced because of altered circumstances.,35
91,Mr DUNCAN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"HUGHES - The reduction in bounty will place the winemakers, who acted on the strength of the bill passed last year, in a very unfortunate position, and a substantial injustice may be done to tbem. I bave been informed that a considerable amount of wine from the 1927 crop has been held in Australia for two reasons. The first is that a good many wine-makers were be desirous of following the Prime Minister's advice, which he referred to yesterday, "" to build up towards the better maturing of their wines."" Many wine-makers bave kept their wines with that object in view. Is it reasonable that those who are trying to improve the standard of their products should lose the bounty, while others who exported their wine the moment it was put in the casks bave received the benefit of the bounty? That does not seem to be a fair way to treat men who are following the advice given to tbem by this Government. The second reason is that the wine is being kept here to avoid further glutting of the already glutted Britisb market. I understand that in some cases contracts are held, but the wine has been retained bere. I followed what the right honourable gentleman said about taking the question of contracts into account, but I wisb to ask why the merchants who have kept tlieir wines here to prevent a glut in Great Britain, and are thereby assisting in the "" orderly marketing of our products,"" which they have been so often asked to do, should be penalized under the bill? A great number of grapes were brought in just before the reduction of bounty was announced. Prices were subsequently announced. When the Minister introduced the bill on the 9th of this month I interjected that there had been a regrettable delay in letting the winegrowers know what prices they were to receive for their grapes, and the Minister replied that he could assure me that in the course of a few days the figures would be announced. Why has there been all .this delay? Was there any necessity for it? A similar delay last year led to many complaints. The Register of the 10th of this month published a letter from Mr L. N . Salter, the president of the Federal Viticultural Council, a gentleman whose opinion should be read if not adopted. He calls this a belated proposal and says The feeling among wine-makers generally was that it was very unfair to have left this proposal until so late in the day. No indication had been received by them that the Government contemplated such an action. As a matter of fact, last night the Prime Minister, when the honourable member for  terjected that this matter had not been decided when the Minister for Trade and  Zealand. It is therefore obvious that it was decided in great haste, or, at any rate, at very short notice. The letter continuesContracts had been entered into for the purchase of grapes and spirit and for the sale of the wine to be made from these, and the winemaker was now faced with the position of having to complete his contracts for the purchase of grapes and spirit, and to accept 9d. a gallon less for the wino made from these. The prices for export wines, specified in the contracts, without exception to his knowledge, were on a f.o.b. basis, the wine-maker to collect the bounty, so that the full loss of 9d. a gallon would fall upon him. Last year grape prices had been fixed by the Government after the vintage. These prices were higher than those which had been decided upon, and upon which contracts for the sale of wine had been based, hence the increase in prices fixed by the Government was a distinct loss to the makers, as they were unable to obtain commeasurately higher prices for the wine. The position this year, if the bounty was to be reduced to Is., would be considerably worse. Therefore, from the point of view of the Federal Viticultural Council, the Governtion of district. ment, by delaying the announcement of prices, has brought about an unfortunate position. No explanation has been given why they should have been announced late, and after the bill reducing the bounty had been introduced. One Mr Duncan-Hughes. fairly ask the reason for this sudden reduction. It has been suggested by a previous speaker that it is because of financial stringency. Tbat may be so, but it sbould not prevent the House from doing justice to the wine-makers. I admit that they bave done very well out of the bounty, but if they have benefited under the original act passed by this House at the instigation of the Government, that is to their advantage, and is no reason wby they should be penalized and treated as scapegoats. It may be that the object of the bill is to aim another blow at South Australia, wbicb bas recently, its people think, received a number of severe, set-backs from the Federal Parliament. Is the proposal to penalize the winegrowers for the increase of exported wines from 649,000 gallons to over 3,000,000 gallons? The Minister stated that be thought honourable members would agree that the industry had been shown every consideration so far. This proposal seems to me to show an extraordinary lack of consideration to the growers, many of whom have already taken their grapes to the distilleries. Just before I left South Australia, a case came under my notice of .a man wbo had taken his grapes to the wine-makers, but they were unable to give bim a quotation because t they did not know what price was to be paid. Is that fair, either to the winemaker or to the grower? This has happened previously, and is certainly unfair to those connected with the industry. It sbould not occur at all. The fact remains that the first action was taken primarily in the interests of the growers, but this last action will react upon. tbem. It bas beeu said that the reduction of the bounty will affect only the wine-maker, and that the price to the grower will not be altered. In that respect I wish to quote part of a telegram which has been sent to me from the Mayor of Clare and the secretary of the Clare Grape-Growers' Association of South Australia. It readsMeeting held last night re Government policy bounty reduction, which means ruinaThis grape-growers' association consists not of wine-makers, but of grape-growers, and they are sufficiently concerned about so the Government's proposal to send me a wire saying that a reduction of bounty may will mean the ruination of the district. My fourth suggestion is that the reason for this proposal may be found in the Adelaide News of the 19th of this month. That publication contains a long statement by Mr F. R, Chalk, of Tangari this firm is a big wine-maker, but it is oertajnly not well known. He has a tremendous Jot to say on the subject, ancl be seems to be in favour of the bill. He saysThere was some justification for the action of the Federal Government in reducing the export bounty on Australian wines from ls. 9d! to ls. a gallon. The - industry required complete re-organization, and wine for export should be of standardized quality. He believed that the real reason why the bounty was reduced was that the Federal Government desired to have introduced some method of controlling the export of wines. Twelve months ago Mr H . E. Pratten, Minister for Trade and Customs, stated that unless steps were taken to organize the industry the Government would probably take action to control exports. At present the vine-growers and wine-makers were absolutely disorganized. . . . . The wine industry in Australia should Ibe Te-organized, and the sooner the work was taken in hand the better for all concerned. At present not two wine-makers - were exporting the same standard of wirie. This looks very much like propaganda, and seems to be almost entirely in favour of this particular bill. view expressed here is one which I do not think is held by most of the older and better known wine-makers in South Australia. I sbould like to know from the Minister whether the action which is being taken is the result of a desire or an intention to coerce the wine-makers, so that a control of export may result.  or intention.",35
92,Mr DUNCAN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"HUGHES - It was freely stated last year that the attitude of the Minister towards the wine-makers was that unless they hurried and brought in some form of control of their own, the Government would take the matter out of their bands, and introduce a form of government control.  orable member that the only reason which actuated the Government was the alteration in the Britisb preference.",37

There is a further statement by the Minister that an industry which is seeking to build up a trade connection in a new market must altogether dislodge its competitors.  been correctly represented. I said, "" It must endeavour to dislodge its competitors.""",37
94,Mr DUNCAN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,HUGHES - It is not possible to dislodge the old-established wines from the British market.  pletely dislodge; I said endeavour to dislodge.,37
95,Mr DUNCAN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"HUGHES - Eve n that indicates that the Minister believed that there was some prospect of success. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to dislodge the German, French, and Spanish wines from the British market. Anybody who bas even an elementary knowledge of the Englishman, knows that he usually drinks a wine because it is of a certain standard of quality to which be is used. There always will be a great many men wbo will continue, as long as the practice of wine drinking lasts, to choose their wine on that basis. The best thing we can do is to improve the standard of our wines and, by degress, to extend their sale The abroad. It is evident then, from what I have said, that I do not propose to support the bill as it stands. I think that something might be said for a reduction of the bounty as from the end of this year. This would afford an opportunity to manufacturers, wbo bave on their bands wine of the 1927 crop-whethe r they held it back in order to let it mature, or to avoid glutting the market-to obtain the advantage of the bounty which has already been collected by their more hasty competitors. This would also have the effect of getting over the unfortunate position which bas arisen during this season, in which grapes have been taken into the cellars, while the price which was to be paid for tbem was not known. Now it has been announced that the prices are to be a little higher than last year, while, almost simultaneously with that announcement, comes the present proposal for the reduction in the bounty. It seems to me that there is a grave danger of penalizing men who bave been merely accepting the advice which the Government gave tbem. I notice that the Prime' Minister said that he would take into account contracts which had been made, and could be proved, and that, of course, is a step in the rigbt direction. It is not sufficient, however, because it does not deal at all with this year's supplies, concerning wbicb the wine-rnakers are being coerced. The Prime Minister, I think, made some remark to the effect that the wine-makers are unquestionably in a position to buy the grapes at the present time; I do not suggest that they are not. The real question is: Whether it is a fair thing to force tbem to buy the grapes at a figure of which they were not aware at the time when they contracted to take tbem.",37
96,Mr KILLEN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Riverina) [5.32] - I do not think that it is necessary for me to traverse, in detail, the arguments of honourable members who bave spoken on this subject. The honourable members for Wakefield (Mr Foster), Angas (Mr. Parsons), and Indi (Mr Cook), and others have gone exhaustively into the matter, and bave, in my opinion, shown conclusively that, if the bounty is reduced as proposed, it is likely to bave a very serious effect on the industry, and particularly on the grape-grower. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), whom I congratulate on his able and moderate speech, stated that bounties are expedients. I agree that they are. Personally, I have no lovefor bounties. I should like to see sucb a state of affairs as would enable bounties to be abolished altogether. Fortunately, in some of our primary industries no bounties bave to be paid. Our principal industries do not require tbem, and our producers do not ask for tbem. But there are others, like this grape-growing industry, which do require bounties, and which will, if they do not receive them, probably go out of existence. Before this bounty was paid, the grape-growers were practically down and out - We bave to consider whether the industry is in a position to do without the bounty now. I have no doubt that, if this proposed reduction is made, it will affect the industry very considerably. I know that many of the growers have had a bard struggle, and most of tbem are not making more than a fair living now. If their returns are reduced, I think that the industry will either go out of existence altogether, or be very seriously crippled. The Minister for Markets, in his speech on Friday last, stated that be anticipated that the increase in the Britisb preference would more than make up for the decrease in the bounty. He may be right; but I do not think that there is any proof that that will be the case. If it could be proved, the growers, I bave no doubt, would agree to the reduction. However, when we hear of the large quantity of grape juice which is being imported into Great Britain, and which is competing with Australian wines to such an extent that accumulated stocks in London cannot be sold, it is evident that any decrease in the bounty will seriously injure the industry, and particularly the growers. It would be time enough for the Government to bring down the proposal when it could be shown that the Britisb preference had had the effect claimed for it - tba t it was, at least, a set-off against the proposed reduction of the bounty. On Friday, the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, in reply to the honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook), stated that the total amount of excise paid on spirit for fortifying wines was Â£2,712,219, and that the total amount of the bounty paid to the industry was Â£1,150,385, leaving a balance of Â£1,561,834. It is evident that the Government bas made a large revenue over and above the bounty, which indicates that there is no immediate need to reduce it. While I am not keenly in favour of bounties, I contend that they are the only means by wbicb primary producers, such as the grape-growers, can be protected. While protection is the policy of the Government-and I bave always been a moderate protectionist- I contend that every section of the community ought, as far as possible to receive equal benefits. The grape-growers are compelled to sell the bulk of their products in the markets of the world at free trade prices, and have to buy their requirements'in a heavily protected market at the highest prices. What benefit will they get from the protection unless they receive a bounty, which is the only form of protection wbicb it is possible to give them? The grape-growers are a section of the primary producers, the class who export 96 per cent, or 97 per cent, of the total quantity of goods sent from this country, while they produce about 73 per cent, of our wealth. Surely they have as good right to protection as any other section of the community. I fail to see how those growers can obtain benefit other than in the form of a bounty. The tariff is a burden on tbem, ancl unless they receive a set-off they are unfairly treated.",38
97,Mr THEODOBE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Does the honourable member regard the bill as a breach of conthat tract ?,39
98,Mr KILLEN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"""No , because the Minshould ister, wben he introduced the original measure, stipulated that if an increased Britisb preference was granted the GoHouse vernment would be at liberty to reduce the bounty. But it is not fair for the vernment to propose that until it is>known what will be the precise effect df the creased British preference. A large numus ber of people are engaged in the grapethe growing industry, many of whom are returned soldiers who bave bad a hard struggle. Tbey will not be able to continue in the industry if they are receive a lower price for their product than has previously obtained. Although the Minister for Markets assured them that they will not receive a member lower price, and that the wine-makers will pay the same price as before, there is no certainty that it will be possible for the wine-makers to pay that price uncier the altered conditions brought about by a reduction of the bounty. grape-growers have been working on very narrow margin, of profit, and if bounty is reduced I am afraid that that margin of profit will disappear, and industry will be either seriously crippled or killed. If either of these probabilities occurs, the Government, which bas detbe rived a considerable amount of revenue from the industry, will suffer. The templated reduction of the bounty seems this Government. to me like killing the goose that lays the golden egg. I trust that the Government will either not reduce the bounty, monstrate conclusively that the new British preference will affect those gaged in the industry sufficiently advangiven tageously to counteract the reduction bounty.",39
99,Mr THEODOEE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Dalley) [5.38].'The honourable member for Eiverina (Mr. Killen) summed up the situation very effectively, when he said that one of the results of this bill will be to cripple the grape-growing industry. If the honourable member is convinced that that will be the inevitable result of this bill, and this conjecture appears to be well founded, surely the consideration of the bill is worthy of the close attention of honourable members, more particularly those representing grape-growing districts. I am astonished so little interest is being evinced in this measure, particularly by those who be vitally concerned with it. Has there ever been a debate so lifeless as that which took place this afternoon; bas the ever been so apathetic when listening to any other debate? Wby sucb inGodifference? Do honourable members not realise, as was stated by the honourable inmember for Riverina, that we bave before a proposal which threatens to cripple grape and wine industry of Australia.",39
100,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Tba t is only the opinion of the honourable member.,39
101,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"The Minister for to Home and Territories (Sir Neville Howse) apparently does not agree with the honourable member for Riverina, and discounts his opinion. That honourable should, at any rate, be conversant with the problem, and well-informed as to the consequences of this measure, seeing that his district is so vitally interested in it. It is a reasonable deduction that this bill will bave a most adverse effect The upon the grape-growing industry. I a listened very carefully to the secondthe reading speech of the Minister, and to that made by the Prime Minister last the night. I have an open mind on the subject, and my constituency is interested in the bill only so far as it affects Community generally, but so far as I can gather, this measure definitely reconpudiates an agreement entered into by It is tantamount to the repudiation of a contract. It is true that no document may be in existence or designed on behalf of the Government on the one hand ancl of the growers enon the other; but an undertaking was by the Government wben it reduced of the bounty last year that a certain payment would continue for three years. Those engaged in the industry were encouraged to proceed with their activities on the assumption that that assistance would continue for three years. Before the Government is justified in whittling away that bounty, it must show that it is actuated by the strongest reasons. I asked the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen), by interjection, whether he regarded this bill as an interference with a contractul obligation, and he replied "" No,"" that he thought that the speech of the Minister made it conditional; that the bounty was granted in conformity with an understanding entered into with growers. But the Wine Bounty Act obliged the Government to give a bounty for three years, without any conditions. Certainly the Minister for Trade and Customs, when introducing the measure, reserved to the Government the rigbt to reduce the bounty if the British preference was increased during the currency of the act. Possibly that may be a justification for the Government reducing the bounty-^provide d that it can show that the British prefer-' ence bas been .effectively increased so far as it concerns Australian grape producers. But although he spoke at some length last night the Prime Minister failed to convince anybody that that is so. It is easy to test whether Australian wine producers are to receive an additional advantage as a result of the recent alteration of the British preferential tariff. If they are to receive an vantage from the new British preference which is equivalent to the bounty reduction proposed in this bill, the Government bas some measure of justification for its action. But if it can be shown that the recent alteration of the British preference means but a little advantage for Australian wine producers, the .Government is without justification for its action. The test is, will the introduction of this bill have any adverse effect upon the grape-growers of Australia? ",39
102,Mr FOSTER,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Then why are they up in arms against it?,40
103,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"That is a very pertion tinent query. Are these people simply contumacious, rising against the Governsweet ment without due cause? Are they in4s. augurating an Australian-wide agitation without good grounds? Will our growers gallon. suffer any adverse effects as to price or as to the quantity of grapes that will come under the operation of the bounty provisions? In either case, one cr other of these points is involved. They would suffer an adverse effect if the operation of this bill reduced the quantity of grapes to which the bounty applied through the reduction in purchases by the winemakers. The bill would certainly have an adverse effect if it lowered the price obtained for grapes. Those who are concerned in the making the of wine and in the distillation of spirit in Australia consider that the conditions that will be imposed by this measure will render it uneconomical for them to go on buying grapes as they did before. If , as a result of this bill, those growers cannot produce, or the wine-makers cannot purchase, the same quantity of grapes as heretofore, it will prove that the bill is a breach of faith. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Markets bave not demonstrated that the contrary will be the case. The Prime Minister was at great pains last night to prove that the preference granted by Great Britain under the last budget proposals will equalize the reduction in bounties.  equalize it .",40
104,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I have here a ad- pamphlet wbicb I found in my mail box only this morning. It is a publication issued by the Federal Viticultural Council of Australia, and is dated October, 1927, so that, obviously, it was not compiled with any specific intention to influence the debate now * before the House. Its views may, therefore, be taken as impartial so far a3 they affect this bill. The pamphlet deals particularly with the preference. It asks, "" Will preference be effective?"" and statesThe new budget duties, by reducing the dividing line between fortified and unfortified wines of foreign origin to 25 degrees of alcoholic strength, was hailed with much satisfacby those interested in Empire wines, as the change was calculated to give Empire wines, for the first time, a really effective preference of the full money value of per gallon, by automatically raising the duty on Tarragona and Lisbon wines to 8s. per Wine Export That was the first impression, when the budget proposals were announced. The pamphlet continuesBut while, at first thought, effective Imperial preference seemed assured for Empire wines, a doubt as to whether the shippers of Tarragona and Lisbon wines, who had been so heavily hit, would not devise some method of evading any appreciable portion of the increased duty, was quickly voiced. That this doubt was well founded has been made plain by recent developments. These are so clearly set forth by Messrs Southard and Company Limited, of London, in their circular of June last, that is worthy of quotation. Since the new standards of strength for the lower duty wines were set up,"" it is stated, "" shippers of Spanish red and Lisbon wines have lost no time in ascertaining the most practical means of solving, as far as possible, the problem with which they were brought face to face as a result of the budget proposals and they must, we think, be congratulated on the success attained. . . ."" Of course, the more success attained in the solution of their' problem the less effective the imperial preference"" - . . for many of them have satisfied themselves and have gone a long way towards convincing merchants on this side that it is quite possible to prepare wines at a strength admissible at the 3s. rate of duty and to guarantee them to arrive sound and in good condition. Beyond this, of course, they cannot be expected to go; but they assure us that, if this low-strength wine is blended judiciously immediately on arrival with a wine of the same character at a strength of, say, 40 degrees, in a proportion that will give a strength of 29 degrees to the blend, it will be equally satisfactory as though shipped at that strength as hitherto."" We have tried the experiment both with Tarragona and Lisbon wines, and the result is as predicted. The blends that we have tried, and therefore recommend, are three parts of 24 degrees/25 degrees to one part 41 degrees, the duty on which works out at 4s. 3d. per gallon. We are advised that it is the intention of the Spanish Government to approach the British Government with a proposal that an intermediate rate of duty, namely, 5s - per gallon, should be established for wines between the strengths of 25 degrees and 30 degrees. That intermediate duty, if granted, would still further whittle away the imperial preference, but already importers are defeating that preference by importing wines and blending tbem in England, where they are subject to an average duty of 4s. 3d. per gallon, as compared with the 4s. duty on Australian wines. Thus the effective preference to Australia is reduced to 3d. per gallon. Does not the Prime Minister recognize that in this [28 MARCH, 1928.] Bounty Bill. 4247 way the effective preference to Australian wines is almost abolished, apart altogether from the competition of so called British wines? The preference given by the Imperial Government would be adequate if it were all that it seems; but we know that it is being defeated by the blending of imported wines and by the importation of foreign must, which is converted into what are known as British wines. The Tarragona and Lisbon wines, which are imported in large quantities, seriously compete with the Australian product. In regard to foreign must the booklet issued by the Federal Viticultural . Council of Australia saysAnother feature of the budget calling for comment was the omission of any duty on imported foreign must, and the imposition of the low duty of ls. per gallon on so-called British wines. The phrase "" so-called"" is advisedly used, because if tbese wines were entirely the product of any part of the Empire they would have the same right to consideration as our own wines; but they are. really the product of foreign countries, - and as such should not get any advantage in competition with Empire products under the British preferential scheme. Even the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not in his budget speech claim for these so-called Britisb wines any special consideration on the ground that they are of British origin. Mr Churchill saidWhile the tax collector has hitherto levied his toll on the imported product of every vineyard, a new industry has sprung up . in these islands, where there are no vineyards. That industry is called British wines. Science ancl enterprise have been able to provide that the juice of the grape should bo imported in an unfermented condition, and thus avoid customs duty. The consumption of British wine has shown a striking increase in the last few years, and in 1926 the production for retail sale amounted to very nearly 1.800,000 gallons. The Prime Minister stated last night that the quantity produced last year was 2,500,000 gallonsWe may both admire and respect the ingenuity of the process, and yet feel that it is not fair that this product should continue to be immune from the taxes placed upon all other intoxicants. These wines achieve a strength of over 27 degrees in many cases, and they are, I am assured, able to bear a moderate charge. I propose, therefore, that an excise duty of ls. per gallon be placed on British wines. The circular that I am quoting proceeded to commentSurprise was expressed in many quarters that the excise on these Britisli or basis should have been fixed at such a low figure ls. per gallon. The London Times, for instance, in reI marking upon the improved position Empire ""wines, saidTliere still remains, however, the competiother tion of British-made wines. This wine, has been sold at a very low price, has industry. acquired considerable popularity in working men's clubs, and generally in industrial of the North of England, and the view is taken that Mr Churchill, instead of imposing duty of ls. per gallon, should have made product pay an equivalent duty to Empire wines of the same alcholic potency. Where this exceeded 27 degrees the be 4s. a gallon. If that duty were imposed, and there were adequate means of enforcing some margin of preference against these blended wines, the case against this bill would not be so strong. But because of these factors, which the Government attempts to brush aside as of little consequence, there is no justification for the reduction of the bounty on the ground that such reduction is counterbalanced by the increased Britisb preference. If the Prime Minister could say that the price prevailing now and likely to prevail during the currency of last year's Wine Export Bounty ""Act would be high enough to make the full amount of the existing bounty unnecessary, he would bave a good case for the proposed reduction, but be relies on statistics which are six months' old; he quoted the f.o.b. price at 3s. 4d. per gallon, but actual salfes by merchants since then have been at prices about 8d. per gallon less. The Government is depending on very flimsy evidence, indeed, forjustification of its endeavour to correct a grevious blunder in regard to the diversion of grapes from the drying sheds to the distilleries. Although the Minister has not asserted that the bill is introduced for that purpose, that seems to be the reason for it. The Tariff Board and the Development and Migration Commission have called attention to what they regard as an evil arising from the wine bounty. Tbey bave out that until a recent date 46,000 tons of grapes had been verted from the drying sheds to Ur. Theodore. the wine distilleries, and the Tariff Board asserted that the bounty was never intended to have that effect. The Governwines ment, perceiving the error of its il I as balanced bounty scheme, seeks to correct, it by reducing the amount of the bounty.. f that is the real purpose of the bill,, of the Government sbould frankly say so,, because the difficulty can be overcome by means which will not cause distress, which and suffering to those engaged in the Apparently, the Minister justifies this arbitrary reduction of the areas bounty and repudiation of a solemn cona tract with the grape-growers and winethe makers upon the ground that the industry will not suffer because the increased Britisb preference will give more than duty would then compensating aid. ",40
105,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Are we to assume that the thousands of growers and their representatives throughout Australia do not understand their own industry or are deliberately lying in regard to it? Tbey say that Britisb preference has not helped tbem to the extent that the Minister declared, and the honourable member for Riverina bas told us that this proposed reduction of the bounty will seriously damage the industry. The honourable member for Wakefield, speaking in strong opposition to the bill, said that it would cause tremendous loss to the industry, and that those losses would be due to an act of deliberate repudiation on the part of the Government. There is no excuse for the action of the Government. Wben the Deputy Leader of the Opposition Mr. Scullin) pointed out the Government's blunder in diverting fresh grapes from dried fruits to wine, the Government should have endeavoured to rectify its error instead of repudiating a solemn contract. The Prime Minister in attempting to reply to that contention ridiculed the suggestion that the dried-fruits industry could bave absorbed the 46,000 tons of grapes that were converted into wine. He said that difficulty was experienced in marketing the dried fruits already produced. Granting that that is so, is the market for Australian wine much better?  pointed Mr THEODORE - Le t me examine the Minister's statement. It was not easy dito market the whole of the wine produced, even with the aid of the bounty. Is it not a fact that since the bounty has been operating, 3,000,0U0 gallons of Australian wine has accumulated in London, and that the merchants estimate that it will not be absorbed inside eighteen months? That 3,000,000 gallons is approximately the quantity of wine that would have been produced from the 46,000 to us of fresh grapes which were diverted from the dried-fruits industry. Australia does not supply Great Britain's whole requirements of either dried fruit s or wine. Our dried fruit s are in competition with those of California, Greece, and Turkey, and we supply only a small proportion of Britain's total requirements of wine. The British market could still absorb more of these products than Australia is now supplying. I acknowledge the validity of the Prime Minister's contention that if the granting of a bounty on dried fruit s would merely mean the selling of them at prices lower than those now realized, it would have an adverse effect on the whole output.  have meant.",42
106,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"It is possible to increase the sales without reducing the price. The Empire Marketing Board is applying its energies to the task of extending the market by means of publicity, grading, and standardization, and if a substantial sum of money had been made available for promoting the better marketing of our dried fruits, doubtless the sales would have been greatly increased. What is the use of the Empire Marketing Board if we cannot sell to the United Kingdom more f r u it than we are selling now? The Development and Migration Commission, dealing with the potential market in the United Kingdom, said Australia's principal market is the United Kingdom, and vigorous efforts arc now being made to push sales in that country, principally by the means of the Australian trade publicity scheme. The report then gives a table showing the imports of raisins into the United K in gdom during the years 1924, 1925, and 1926. I shall not give all the details; but the table indicates that in 1924 Britain's total importation of raisins was 58,429 tons, of which Australia supplied only 18,831 tons; in 1925 her imports were 56,368 tons, of which Australia supplied only 17,605 tons, and in 1926 her imports totalled 58,296 tons, of which Australia supplied 11,093 tons. Those figures do not support the statement made by the Prime Minister last night that the market in the United Kingdom for Australian raisins had been full y exploited. The position in regard to currants is somewhat similar. In this connection the report of the commission statesThe British market takes an average of 00,000 tons of currants per annum; but the demand has fallen off slightly in receut years, as a result of the housewife's preference for raisins. The following table shows the imports of currants into the United Kingdom for 1924, 1925, and 1920:IMPORTS OF COT5BAIMTS INTO THE UNITED KlJNT.DOJt. 1924. 1925. 1920. Tons. Tons. Tons. 07,114 58,421 57,514 Of the above, the bulk of the imports were obtained from Greece. Australia sold 8,000 tons of currants in the United Kingdom in .1.920, and 4,775 tons in 1927. I have not worked out what percentage that is of the total; but it is relatively small. There must surely be a larger market for our currants in Great Britain . We ought to be able to place a considerable additional quantity of all our dried fruit s there. Notwithstanding that the Prime Minister appears to hold the opinion that we bave reached the l i m it of our expansion in that direction, I submit that the report of the Development and Migration Commission, and also a report of the Tariff Board, which makes some pointed comments on this subject, indicate clearly that we could enlarge our market in the United Kingdom. The wine bounty was never intended to have the effect of diverting fresh f r u it to the wineries. The Government has been ill advised, and has blundered seriously in this matter. I think that the industry sbould have the full measure of assistance which it has received under the wine bounty; but in a different way. The bounty should not have been confined to wine, for that undoubtedly has bad the effect of causing good fresh f r u it to be dealt with uneconomically. An alteration sbould be made, not in the amount, but in the nature of the bounty. I submit that Parliament would not be justified without the consent of those concerned in the industries, because of the mistakes that bave already been made, in whittling down the bounty. The Govermnent should have proposed an alteration in the incidence of it. It could not then have been charged ""with attempting to repudiate its contract with the industry. As it is, it bas certainly laid itself open to that accusation. One would not have expected a proposal of this kind to come from a Government which is always prating about the solemnity of contractual obligations. Ministers and their supporters never tire of talking of the sacredness of written and implied contracts, and should be the last to introduce a bill of this description. This is a gross repudiation, which pays no regard whatever to the welfare of an extensive primary industry wbicb is carried on in three States. ""We ought to look upon this proposal as rational and responsible members of this Parliament, and not consider it as a parochial matter wbicb concerns only those honourable members wbo represent constituencies in which fruit-growing is carried on. Had the Labour party proposed a repudiation of this description, it would have been charged with the grossest disregard for its written undertakings in particular, and the primary producers in general, and would have been held up to public contumely throughout the Commonwealth. But most honourable members opposite seem to have no desire to offer even the mildest protest against this most dishonourable action.",43

108,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I have yet to discover that this Government bas repented and turned from its sins. It bas undoubtedly repudiated an honourably made contract, but it shows no inclination to repent of that. It entered into a definite undertaking to provide a bounty upon all wine exported from the Commonwealth for three years, and it has given no substantial reason for attempting to evade the fulfilment of it. It has not been demonstrated that the additional measure of preference which has been granted to Australian sweet wine by the Britisb Government is equal in value to the industry to the amount by which the bounty is being reduced. I should like to hear what some honourable members opposite think about this dishonourable repudiation of a solemn contract.",44

110,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Henty) [8.0] - I am under a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore), wbo preceded me in this debate. Wittingly or unwittingly be was quite candid about the reason for the strong opposition of the Labour party to the proposals of the Government. By his outburst against the policy of the Government, and the character of his speech generally, be showed clearly that he was making nothing more than a characteristic party attack on the Government, and that his attitude towards the proposal had little to do with the merits of the bounty. I am but little impressed by this new born, and highly suspect sympathy of honourable members opposite for the primary producer. The Labour party bas been brought into being, is kept in being; and is elected and controlled by the Trades Halls of the capital cities. It is therefore not only intensely interesting, but very amusing, to find this party, which has been of recent years almost completely repudiated by the primary producers of the country, now shedding tears over the prospective ruin of a section of tbem. I wonder that the honourable member for Dalley should bave sympathy for the primary producers, because at the last general election they showed by their votes that they bad very little sympathy with him. The honourable member spoke to-night of repudiation and the disposition of this side of the House to repudiate sacred pledges. I say to him that had I been re : pudiated as decisively and dramatically as he was by the farmers of North Queensland I could not find it in my heart to show them the sympathy that be bas displayed on this occasion. Honourable members opposite seem to see in this debate the possibility of securing a small passing victory over the Government. The question narrows down - to a simple and definite issue. A year ago, almost to the very week, this Parliament made a conditional agreement with the wine producers of Australia. The condition laid down by the Minister in charge of the measure was that the bounty then proposed of ls. 9d. a gallon, apart altogether from excise, was to continue for three years unless-and this was a very specific exception-the British Government by a special grant of preference benefited Australia so greatly as to remove the need for it or justify its reduction.",44
111,Mr COOK,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"""Was that included in the bill?",45
112,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"It was a condition insisted on by the Minister then in charge of the bill. I have watched this matter since that condition was imposed, and it was my intention, had the Government not introduced this bill, to do all I could to bring about a reduction of the bounty. The question narrows down to this: Has the British preference of 4s. a gallon that was given in March last in favour of Australian wines as against the wines of Spain and Portugal been of benefit to Australian producers, and is it worth 9d. a gallon to the Australian wine-maker or grower? Prior to the amendment of the Britisb duties, the total benefit received by the Australian producer was a bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon in Australia, anda preference of 6d. in Great Britain; in other words, a total of 2s. 3d. To-day that total, under the proposal of the Government, will be 4s. a gallon preference and ls. bounty; 5s. as against 2s. 3d. Will honourable members say that out of this gross advantage of 5s. a gallon we cannot squeeze a net advantage of 9d. a gallon at this end? If we cannot, there is indeed incompetence and inefliciency in the wine industry; but I do not believe that inefliciency or incompetency does exist in the industry, and were it not this extraordinary wholesale and questionable opposition from the other side of the House there would not be more than a dozen honourable members voting against the Government on this measure. I admit frankly that the Government has not conclusively shown in pence per gallon what the British preference is worth; but I ask: Have any of those who was previously. are opposed to the proposed reduction of bounty-whethe r grape-growers, winemakers, or wine exporters in this country, or the honourable member for Angas, the honourable member for Wakefield, or the members of the Labour party in this House-disprove d the benefit of the British preference? Have any of them taken the trouble to get first-hand infora mation on this subject? Have they shown that the British importation of wine from Portugal and Spain has not fallen off, or have they established the fact that the wholesale or retail prices of Australian wines in London have not been increased by the action of the British preference ? Not a vestige of evidence bas been given on either of those aspects.",45
113,Mr THEODORE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Tb e honourable member bas not followed the case that has been put forward against the Government's proposal.,45
114,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I have closely followed the debate on this bill, and I shall give honourable members actual evidence of the effect of the British preference. The imports into Britain of red wine from Spain and of white wine and red wine from Portugal fell off during 1927 by 1,750,000 gallons. Those are Board of Trade figures, which can be seen by any honourable member. The falling off is remarkable, considering that these new duties have been in operation for only nine months, and that it takes a considerable time to arrest importation because of commitments already entered into, and other reasons. That falling off is the clearest evidence that the British preferential duties have substantially retarded the flow of foreign wine into Great Britain in competition with Australian wine. During the same nine months, however, the importation of Australian wine increased enormously. Tbat is conclusive evidence, and evidence for such as honourable members opposite bave been saying would convince tbem of the justice of the Government's proposals. I submit that evidence to them, and challenge tbem to disprove it or to place upon it any other construction than I have placed upon it. The Australian wine-grower today is infinitely better off with the ls. bounty plus the present British preference than he The honourable member for Dalley bas asked: Wby this agitation and virulent or revolt against the Government on this question? I do not believe that the honourable member wishes us to take him seriously. Wby sbould the growers, if they can avoid it, give up a bounty of 9d. gallon on the export of their wine? It is not human nature to make such a surrender voluntarily. Is there any class in this country that wquld lightly forego a bounty given to it by a beneficent government ? No. It would be a serious reflection upon its business instincts if a - section of the community surrendered a bounty without fighting in defence of it to the last ditch. ""We have beard a great deal about the unfortunate grower of grapes and the maker of wines.  should experience the hardships of the grower.",45
115,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I grew vines and made wines before the honourable member had heard of this industry. I used to be kept away from school to plant 10 acres of vines, and I spent years in irrigating and growing vines. The honourable member has lectured this House as though we had . never heard of wines. I do not say that I know more about wine than be does, but I know something of its production. ""We have heard a plea made for this section of the primary producers, but I should like to make a plea for the unfortunate taxpayer. Tbis bounty for the first eight months of its operation bas cost the taxpayers the sum of Â£200,000. On that basis, by the end of the year it will bave cost upwards of Â£250,000 to support this industry. ""Witb tbefinancesof this country in their present serious condition, I say that while being scrupulously fair and just to the growers, as the Government bas beeu to the point of generosity, our justice and generosity sbould be tempered with mercy to the great body of taxpayers. The'honourable member for Angas (Mr. Parsons) said that the wine-growing industry provides the excise, out of which, in turn, the bounty is paid. I deny that statement emphatically. Neither the wine-maker nor the grape-grower pays a penny of this excise. The wine-maker advances it, but it is actually paid by the consumer. The manufacturer adds it to the price of the product in which he places the fortifying spirit on which it is charged. Who is it pays the excise and customs duties on tobacco the world over? The consumer, of course. Every penny of the wine bounty is paid by the general taxpayers of Australia. The excise is merely a machine of taxation, and the winemakers are the instrument by which the tax is collected. I do not intend to prolong this discussion in the futile manner adopted by. the honourable member for Angas. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan-Hughes) said that more notice should bave been given of the Government's intention to reduce the bounty, and that it was very unfair to reduce the bounty practically in the middle of the season. I remind him, however, that what is being done now is exactly what was done last year, and it did not bring ruin on the industry. The grapegrowers bave no reason for complaint provided they receive a profitable price for their grapes, as apparently they bave done, and that the wine-makers continue to buy at that price, as apparently they are doing.",46
116,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,The reduction did not come into operation during the wine season last year. It operated from the 1st September.,46
117,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I believe that the honourable member is right; but I am told that five-sixths of the grape crop is already gathered. The issue is very simple: is this British preference of 4s. a gallon, plus ls. bounty, the equivalent of a bounty of ls. 9d. under the old conditions of preference? As a matter of fact, it is worth more. ",46
118,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"On the evidence in the possession of the Government, sucb as the great falling off of importations of wine from Spain and Portugal, the Government is not only justified in bringing down this measure, but it would have been guilty of a very grave act of injustice to the taxpayers if it bad nqt done so.",46
119,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Hunter) [S.20] This subject has been well thrashed out, and the case for' the industry has been well put by the honourable member for Yarra, and other speakers. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat made the assertion in a very emphatic manner that the party on this side of the House was shedding crocodile tears over the position of the primary producers. I wish to remind him that, whenever this party has had the opportunity, it has passed legislation in the interests of the primary producers. It has recognized that if the country is to be developed, the primary producers must get &- fair deal, and provision must be made for settling people on the land. The honourable member, while .condemning this party, made special reference to the honourable member for Dalley (Mr. Theodore). I do not need to say anything more about the honourable member for Dalley than that there has been more legislation passed in Queensland in the interests of the primary producers during the past twelve or fourteen years, than during all the time that Nationalist governments were in power there. That is admitted by the primary producers themselves. But what has the honourable member himself done to assist the primary producers since he came into this House ? Whenever there has been an opportunity of raising his voice against them he has done so, as he is doing occasion. He went so far as to say that if the Government bad not brought down this measure be would bave taken some action himself. All I wish to say is that any action which be might have attempted would bave been futile. I regard this measure as a distinct breach of faith with the primary producers. If I thought that injustice was being done to the taxpayers by a continuation of the bounty on the present terms, I sbould certainly raise my voice against it. I maintain however, that we are misleading the producers when we pass legislation with the apparent intention that the act shall continue in operation for a given time, and then, before that time has elapsed, make serious alterations which materially affect the conditions upon which the growers were relying. The bounty was first granted to assist those who are growing grapes for drying and for wine making, and it has proved successful for that purpose. So mucb is generally admitted. The honourable member states, however, that this proposed duction is justified because the Minister who introduced the billremarked in a casual way in the course of his speech on it that if certain things happened in regard to British preference the Government might take the action which is now proposed. How many of the growers in Australia would know that any sucb statement was made, or bow many members of this House placed any reliance on it? How often do we, in the course of our speeches, make some remarks as to what might happen in the future, without significence being attached to it by any one outside the House? By passing the Wine Export Bounty Act last year we undoubtedly induced many men to go on the land, including many returned soldiers. They accepted the act at its face value, and believed that it would remain in operation for at least three years. This bill, if passed will be a keen disappointment to those men. If the British preference does not work out as the Government claims, many of the grape growers will be practically ruined. Some of them were probably using their land for other purposes, but wben the bounty came into operation they planted grapes, and anticipated obtaining a return in a year on this or two. Now, wben their vines are planted and their money spent, the prospects of the industry are being entirely changed. The honourable member for Henty bas in the past spoken a great deal about the need for encouraging immigration, but how are we to absorb the people we bring bere if we do not open up the land, and keep faith with those whom we put upon it? Tbere are already many returned men on the land who are unable to meet their obligations, and the House is now being asked to do something which will very greatly increase the number. The honourable member contended that because of British preference, the growers will be in the same position after the bounty is reduced as they are in today; but no one can prove that. It is extremely doubtful what the result of the preference will be. Why sbould we rush in and reduce the bounty until it bas been proved that British preference will give the assistance claimed for it. The Prime Minister said that the production of wine re- in England from imported grape juice was very small, only ""about 2,000,000 gallons a year, but be forgot to say that that is nearly as mucb as we ourselves are exporting. We are not supplying one-ninth of the requirements of the English market. We have yet to win a place for our wine tliere, and how are we to do it if we pass legislation the effect of-which will be to increase the advantage held by other countries? It may be possible in the near future successfully to pasteurize wine in countries adjacent to England. If that can be done, such wine can be sent in at a strength of 25 degrees, thus enabling it to evade the higher rate of duty, and to sell in competition with Australian wines. We should be guided by experience. How many times bave we passed tariff items in this House, only to find that the foreigners were so keen to get our trade that they quickly discovered means of evading the duties imposed ? Are we going to sit idly by and lose the wine trade which we bave built up in Great Britain? If it is possible to get wine into England at 25 degrees strength the foreigners will do it. I am the last man who would wish to throw away the taxpayers' money, but I claim that Parliament is not justified in entering into an agreement with the people growing fruit, and then altering the terms of the agreement without knowing what the effect on the industry will be. I wonder how many vignerons made contracts for the disposal of their wines, having in mind the prevailing conditions. I was told of one corporation that contracted for no less than 60,000 gallons of wine. That corporation will be ruined if it bas to carry out its contract, and it must be borne in mind that the corporation concerned represents the growers themselves, who will have to bear the loss. Can the Government justify the sudden cutting down of the provisions of the Wine Export Bounty Act, which we know has been beneficial to the industry ? It is probable that, six months after this bill is carried, Australia will lose her wine market abroad, which will be a great blow to our primary producers. Government is constantly expressing a desire to put more people on the land, and it is bringing many from the Old Country for that purpose. Yet, at the same time, it proposes to cut away a provision which has enabled many men to make good on the land. If , in a couple of years, it is found that this bounty is unsatisfactory to the general taxpayer, it will need amendment; but there is nothing today to indicate that it is so. We know that there are from Mr Charlton. 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wine in store in England- a year's output. Can it be expected that those dealing in wine will buy the growers' output from the next vintage wben they are not sure as to what will be the effect of this legislation? This House sbould be very careful, indeed. I and my party will stand by the primary producers, and do everything we can to encourage land settlement in Australia. That is the best way to find employment for our people. To-day we have the spectre of thousands of unemployed throughout Australia, and it is probable that the passage of this bill will add to the number. For those reasons, I shall oppose the measure.  for Markets) [8.33] - The main arguments which have been advanced against this bill included the statement that, along with the wine bounty, the Commonwealth Government sbould pay a concurrent bounty to dried fruit growers. It was said that this reduction in the wine bounty is not justified, on. the ground that the alteration of the British preference has not yet been proved to be to our advantage. A further statement was that the growers' interests will suffer if this bill is passed. I shall take up the time of the House for a little while to deal with those three issues. Wben bounties are paid, whether on wine or any other exported commodity, the policy of the Government is to assist the exporting industries concerned, first, to gain a footing on a new market, and, secondly, to cope with sucb temporary difficulties, as. those industries may not be sufficiently well established, to overcome without assistance. DealThis ing with the dried-fruits industry, the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) with that passion for mathematical problems which distinguishes him, endeavoured to prove that the Commonwealth Government would have saved an immense amount of money bad it adopted the practice of paying a bounty for driedfruits growers rather than to help growers of f r u it which went into wine. In 1924, the dried-fruits industry was then in a most unsatisfactory condition. Credit was almost unobtainable, and bad it not been for assistance extended to it by this Government, many engaged in the industry would have failed. The Commonwealth Government came to the rescue, not by means of a direct bounty as suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, but by making to those engaged in the industry advances on their products to the extent of, in round figures, Â£200,000. The bill providing for the advances required that they sbould be repaid to the Government during succeeding years, if those in the industry obtained for subsequent crops the cost of production and something in addition. For a year or so after 1924, the dried-fruits industrystill did not enjoy good prices, and when the time came for the repayment of the advances, the Commonwealth Government decided that it would not be in the interests of the industry to demand its pound of flesh. It , therefore, appointed a committee, which examined the position of the growers, investigating the returns obtained through their packing sheds. The inquiry showed that while the majority of those men had considerable assets, nevertheless to have to repay their advances would mean that they would have to part with much of their working capital. The Commonwealth Government thereupon decided to write off approximately Â£180,000 of the Â£200,000 advanced. Honourable members must, therefore admit that this Government bas done a good deal to assist the driedfruits industry and to set it on its feet. In addition, as was mentioned by the Prime Minister last night an export marketing board was set up to inaugurate a general marketing policy with regard to export sales of dried fruit. The work of that board has been particularly successful, and it is safe to say that there is not another exporting industry which is so well organized from an overseas market-' ing stand-point. When the Tariff Board was asked whether there sbould be a continuance or otherwise of the wine bounty as from the 31st August last, it was simultaneously asked to decide whether a bounty should be paid to the dried fruit growers. I remember very distinctly a deputation of dried fruit growers, which waited on me and submitted the proposal that they intended to put before the Tariff Board. It may be of interest to honourable members to know that their proposal was that a bounty of Â£10 a ton should be paid, not on sultanas, but on currants and lexias, to taper away so that nothing would be paid in the event of that fruit realizing Â£30 per ton in the sweat box. If it realized only Â£20, Â£10 would be paid; if Â£25, Â£5; if Â£29, Â£ 1 ; and so on. The Tariff Board turned down their application. That may be regarded as one argument in favour of the Government not granting a bounty, but it is not on that ground that I shall approach the matter. Subsequent events bave proved that the recommendation of the Tariff Board was justified. Last year the average of the Australian and overseas prices for currants, in the sweat boxes, was approximately Â£30 per ton. That is the amount which the growers regarded as being sufficiently high to make bounty unnecessary. The position was even better so far as lexias were concerned.",46
120,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"What was the export price of lexias and currants?  figures with me, but I will obtain and supply tbem to the honourable member. The grower is not concerned so much with what the prices happen to be in Australia or overseas, as with the price be will receive on the average. Surely the prices mentioned prove that a bounty was unnecessary for last year.",49
121,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"They prove nothing of the kind.  member will turn to this year, he will find that the position is even better. We bave a very short crop of currants, largely . owing to the frosts, which affected the vines in the Murray Valley and elsewhere, and it is fairly safe to say that the realization of this year's crop in the sweat box will average in the neighbourhood of Â£40 for currants. No one could suggest with justification that a bounty is necessary with a payable price such as that. The honourable member for Yarra argued that,.owing to the wine bounty, the price paid by the distiller was sufficiently high to provide an incentive to the grower to send his crops to the distillery rather than to sell them as dried fruits. There is some truth in that assertion, and that position did obtain some time ago. But it does not obtain today, when there is a direct incentive to the dried fruits grower TO market his product as dried fruits rather than to send it to the distillery. The point which the honourable member for Yarra overlooked was that even if growers through the incentive of a bounty had put additional quantities of dried fruits on the market rather than send the fruit in its raw state to the distillery, that could not be done without affecting the the market and the prices obtaining on that market. Only last Monday I was speaking to a very able commercial man in Melbourne, one of the commerical representatives on the Dried Fruits Export Control Board. I asked bim-""In the event of a considerable quantity of the fruit which went in a raw state to the distilleries having been dried aud sent away as dried fruits, what would have been the effect so far as the dried fruits market was concerned ?"" He said that that would bave had a very depressing affect on the market, and that there would be considerable difficulty in disposing of the additional quantity. As it was, considerable difficulty was , experienced in disposing of the record dried fruits crop of 1927. Those fruits which are sent in a green state to the distillery are generally low grade, and this bas the effect of raising the average grade of the fruit exported in its dried state, and of improving prices all round. The prices which we did obtain would undoubtedly bave been very adversely affected had considerable quantities of the grapes which were converted into wine been converted, instead, into dried fruits. The price of Â£6 lOs. per ton paid by the distillers to the growers is equivalent to Â£22 15s. per ton of dried fruits, and as the price actually realized for dried fruits was about Â£30 per ton in the sweat box, it is obvious that it paid the grower to convert his grapes into dried fruits, rather than send tbem to the distillery. This year the difference will be considerably greater, and any grower who bas .not contracted to sell to the distilleries would be foolish, indeed, to sell for wine-making currants aud lexias which are suitable for processing as dried fruits. ",49
122,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Why was 25,000 tons of drying grapes diverted to the distilleries last year? Â»  sent by growers, who did not realise what the final result of the year's trade would be. It is doubtful if any of tbem expected that by the end of the year the average price would be about Â£30 per ton, and adopting the maxim that "" a bird in the band is worth two in the bush,"" they sent their grapes to the distillery; but had the fruit been 'converted into currants and lexias they would have done better, provided, of course, that the price did not depreciate. Quite likely, bowever, the price would bave fallen had considerably larger quantities of dried fruits been put on the market. I remind the honourable member for Yarra that the prices' obtained for currants ancl lexias have improved considerably since he visited Mildura about twelve months ago. Although on that occasion be formed a conclusion as to the desirability, and even the necessity, for paying a bounty on dried fruits, the prospects this year in regard to both currants ancl lexias promise a very good return to the producer, and niake a bounty unwarrantable. The honourable member for Capricornia urged that the Commonwealth Government sbould press the Britisb Government to make an even more liberal grant of preference to Australian dried fruits. He should have been the last to make sucb a proposal, in view of the fact that in 1924 he ancl his colleagues neglected a golden opportunity to get a very substantial preference for those commodities. In that year the Imperial Economic Conference recommended that - a preference of Â£10 per ton sbould be given to dominion dried fruits. The duty then in operation was Â£10, and all that was required was to remove it from Empire fruits, and allow it to continue to operate against the products of foreign countries. Immediate effect would have been given to that recommendation had the Baldwin Government remained in office, but wben the Ramsay MACDonald Government came into power the preference proposals were reviewed. When this item was taken to a division in the House of Common's it was rejected by the narrow - margin of four votes. Honourable members opposite were asked io exert tlieir influence witli tlieir confreres in the British Parliament to get the preference granted, and, I believe, had they chosen to do so they could have converted the narrow minority of four votes into a majority.",50
123,Mr CHARLTON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Baldwin has majority of hundreds now. Wby .does be not increase the preference %  the Baldwin Government has done all that it possibly could do in that direction. The Ramsay MACDonald Government reduced the duty on foreign fruits to Â£7, and a very trifling preference of about 30s. was given to the dominions. At the next appeal to the British electors Mr Baldwin's party was returned to power with an overwhelming majority, but it bad given a pledge to the people that in no circumstances would it increase taxation on foodstuffs during the lifetime of the new Parliament. Immediately, however, it did what it could, within the limits of .that undertaking, by removing the duty so far as it applied to dominion products. It ill becomes honourable members opposite to reproach this Government for not having done everything possible to get the British Government to increase the preference to Australian dried fruits. This Government has done all that was humanly possible for it to do, and the Baldwin Government gave to us the maximum preference possible without breaking its pledges to the electors, but members of the Labour party in this House did not so much as lift their little finger when a golden opportunity to assist the primary producers presented itself in 1924. Honourable members opposite bave declared that the Government has proposed to reduce the bounty by 9d. because it is alarmed at the size of the payments under this legislation. Tbat is not the reason, although in truth the bounty payments are very large. This afternoon the honourable member for Angas contended that they were 'considerably less than the excise collections. Undoubtedly that is so, if we take into account all the years back to 1918, but the point bas been reached when the bounty payments largely exceed the present excise collections. For the year ended the 30th June, [157] 1927, the payments exceeded the total excise collections on fortifying spirit by Â£7,000, the collections having been Â£435,000, and the bounty payments Â£442,000. Eor the eight months of the current financial year the figures were a even more startling, the excise collections having amounted to Â£184,000, and the bounty payments to Â£452,000. It is only fair to say, however, that during the next four months that Â£184,000 will be largely increased by the excise collections during the vintage season; nevertheless, the bounty expenditure"" for this year will again exceed by a considerable amount the excise collections. I do not put that fact forward in support of a reduction of the bounty; I merely point to the magnitude of these payments. The only reason why the Government has proposed a reduction is that since April last an undoubted advantage has been given to us by the Britisb Government. The - Government delayed taking action only because it wanted to be satisfied that the wine industry would get that advantage, and that our competitors would not find means of evading the preference which the Imperial Parliament has given to us. The statement bas been made that the proposed reduction is an act of repudiation on the part of the Government. Last night the honourable member for Angas quoted a statement by the Tariff Board, but I propose now to read the board's recommendationThe board considers further that if during the currency - of the bounty any increase is made-in the measure of tariff preference granted in Great Britain to the Australian sweet wines exported under bounty, the amount of the bounty should be reduced by the amount of the increases in the preference so granted. The Minister for Trade and Customs, when speaking in March of last year on the bill to amend the Wine Export Bounty Act, made it clear to the House and the industry that the Government reserved to itself the rigbt to ask Parliament to reduce the bounty during the currency of the act, in the event of the British Government doing something to improve the position of Australian exporters in relation to continental competitors. In.addition, I have several times this year, when meeting representatives of the wine industry in conference in regard to export organization, reminded them of the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs, the tremendous advantage they now enjoy in regard to British preference and the improbability of the bounty remaining at the present figure. Therefore it cannot be said that the wine-makers were ignorant of the Government's intention.",51
124,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"In what way did the Minister remind tbem?  times, in conference with the members of the Viticultural Council, a body which represents the wine-makers, I went out of my way to remind them of Mr. Pratten's warning and of the improvement of British preference, and told them not to expect that the bounty would remain much longer at its then figure. In those circumstances the suggestion of repudiation is quite unwarranted. One can understand, however, the beat which that word engendered in the mind of the honourable member for Dalley; one has not to seek far back in our political hiswines tory to find the reason for that. Its application, however, to this wine bounty was not only a terminological inexactitude, but a gross misuse of the English language. Honourable members opposite have challenged me to show in what way the effective British preference to Australian wines has improved, and if they are open to conviction I hope - to prove to tbem that the present conditions are more advantageous to' the winemakers than were those in March of last year wben the wine bounty was reduced from 2s. 9d. to ls. 9d., plus drawback. In March of last year, when the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced the bill which had the effect of reducing the bounty from 2s. 9d. to la. 9d. per gallon it was agreed, even by the wine-makers, that our actual preference was only 6d. per gallon on wines of about 34 degrees, on which we had to pay a duty of 2s., and which bad to enter into competition with somewhat weaker wines of just under 30 degrees manufactured in Portugal, on which a duty of only 2s. 6d. per gallon bad to be paid. These wines being just urider the 30 degrees mark, paid the lower rate for foreign wines, whereas our wines, being over the 30 degrees mark, had to pay the higher rate for Empire wines. But the following month the Chancellor of the Britisb Exchequer introduced a budget which led to alterations of a fundamental character in the wine duties. It is true that the rates were raised from ls. 6d. Empire and 2s. 6d. foreign for light wines, to 2s. Empire and 3s. foreign; and from 2s. Empire and 6s. foreign for heavy wines, to 4a. Empire and 8s. foreign. But, what was of far more importance to us, was that the line of demarcation was altered so that wines of the Tarragona class, wbicb formerly were admitted at 2s. 6d. per gallon, bad to pay the higher rate of 8s. per gallon. The result to us was that instead of obtaining an actual preference of 6d. per gallon, we received the ful l benefit of the 4s. difference between the two rates. It bas been aaid that, in consequence of the successful blending of low and high strength wines by the continental winemakers, we have lost the benefit of this preference; but the blending of such ori a commercial scale has not been successful. It was partly on account of the possibility of this being done that the Government did not, immediately after the introduction of the Britisb budget, reduce the rate of bounty. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) has stated to-night that, according to a report in a London journal, 3 gallons of wine of a strength of 25 degrees bad been successfully blended with 1 gallon of wine of a strength of 42 degrees, giving a blended wine of between 28 and 29 degrees, which is about the strength of the original Tarragona wine, on which the average duty would be 4s. 3d. per gallon. He also read an extract dealing with this point from a pamphlet published by the Federal Viticultural Council; but he did not read far enough down the page. The part of the extract which he omitted to read is as follows:It will be seen from the above that the position in regard to the effectiveness of the Imperial preference is still obscure, and will remain in doubt for some time. If the shippers of Tarragona and Lisbon wines can do what has been suggested on a large scale, then the preference on Empire wines will be cut down. It is still highly problematical whether this blending can be done on a commercial scale. The honourable member appeared to accept that it bad been an undoubted success, but this publication says, "" If the shippers of Tarrangona and Lisbon wines can do what bas been suggested on a large scale,"" the blended product will enter into serious competition with our wines. The evidence which the Government has received is that the experiments which have been made to blend high and low strength wines bave been unsuccessful, and bave involved the persons who conducted them in heavy losses.",52
125,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Will the Minister read to the bottom of the page from which he quoted ?  speech in my own way. Wben the practicability of blending bigb and low strength wines was first referred to it was suggested that 3 gallons of low-strength wine could be successfully blended with 1 gallon of high-strength wine. A little later we were told that attempts were being made to blend 2 gallons of low-strength wine with 1 gallon of high-strength wine, which clearly shows that the first attempts to blend these wines were unsuccessful. When the honourable  his speech a few days ago, be read an extract from a letter which he had received from the president of the Viticultural Council, wbicb took into consideration the possibility of successfully blending only 1 gallon of low-strength wine with 1 gallon of high-strength wine. The duty which would be payable on sucb a blended wine would be 5s. 6d. per gallon. The president of the Viticultural Council observed that if this could be done it would bave the result of reducing our preference to only ls. 6d. per gallon. When the bounty was ls. 9d. per gallon we enjoyed an effective preference of only 6d. per gallon. If it were practicable to market a blended wine such as that referred to by the president of the Viticultural Council, the wine-makers' would still be ls. gallon better off under the revised bounty than they were when the bounty of ls. 9d. was introduced.",53
126,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Tb e Minister's arithmetic is at fault.  mit that on the admission of the president of the Viticultural Council, and on the assumption that a blend of 1 gallon of low' strength with 1 gallon of high strength wine could be made upon a commercial scale the wine-makers would still be ls. per gallon better off under the reduced bounty than they were when the Wine Export Bounty Bill was introduced last year. Let me emphasize another point. When the Secretary of State for the Dominions (Mr Amery) was in Australia some time ago, he made it quite clear to us that if our continental competitors were able to evade the payment of the higher duty by blending their wines, and so nullifying the advantage that we now enjoy, the Chancellor of the Britisb Exchequer could be trusted to take sucb steps as would regain for us the preference wbicb the British Government intended that we sbould enjoy.' The correctness of certain figures I quoted relative to the price of wine bas been challenged. It was said that I was not justified in saying that the average price of Australian wine f.o.b. during recent months was 3s. 4d. per gallon. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) said the figure was nearer 2s. 8d. per gallon. I remind the House that last night the honourable member for Angas admitted that our wines were selling at from 9s. 6d. to 10s. per gallon in London. To ascertain the price in Australia we need to deduct 4s. per gallon for the duty, and ls. lOd. per gallon for wood and freight, which gives a total of 5s. lOd. If we subtract that from 10s. we bave 4s. 2d.,' and if we subtract it from 9s. 6d. we bave 3s. 8d. Consequently, I submit that my figures were not at ail inflated. Honourable members cannot bave it both ways. They cannot in one breath argue that the price of Australian wine f.o.b. .is only '2s. 8d. per gallon, and in the next breath demonstrate that it must be anything from 3s. 8d. to 4s. 2d. per gallon. We have been told that if this reduction per is made in the bounty the wine-makers will be ruined, but certain wine-makers have, perbaps, injudiciously, admitted that if 9d. per gallon is taken off the bounty it will take, away a great part of their profits. They do not say that it will take away the whole, but only a part of their profit. It surely cannot be contended that the Commonwealth Government should pay bounties simply to make small profits into large ones. The honourable member for Angas has championed the view that the wine industry is carrying a tremendous load in the shape of revenue duties. Let me remind bim that if the spirit in wine is taxed at 5s. per gallon for doradillo spirit, and 6s. per gallon for other spirit, it is still lightly taxed compared with whisky, upon which a tax of 26s. per gallon must be paid. A tax of Is, 9d. per gallon bas to be paid on beer which bas only one-quarter of the alcoholic content of our sweet wines, the tax upon the spirit content of wbicb is only in the neighbourhood of Is. 3d. per gallon. tax levied upon sweet wine is, in consideration of the amount of spirit it contains, very small compared with that which is imposed on other alcoholic liquors. Further, the whole of the ls. 3d. per gallon is returned to the wine-maker in the event of the wine being exported. There is no taxation on exported sweet wines; nor are dry wines taxed, whether exported or not. Yet these wines contain more alcohol than does beer, which is taxed to the extent of ls. 9d. per.gallon. Instead of being heavily burdened by taxation, the wine industry has received generous treatment compared with that meted out to the producers of whisky and beer. The tax of ls. 3d. per gallon on the wine consumed locally represents about 2Â£d. per bottle. The honourable member for Angas (Mr. Parsons) said that the tax was imposed as a war measure, and he inferred that, now that the war was over, the tax should no longer be levied. I remind him that the Commonwealth has to carry, for another generation at least, a war liability of Â£30,000,000 per annum. Surely, in sucb circumstances, a tax on alcoholic liquors for revenue purposes is justified. Although the Prime Minister showed clearly the greatly improved prices realized by grape-growers during recent years, time and again we bave beard the remark, "" What about the primary producer-the grape-growers?"" So long as his grapes are purchased, the grower hardly comes into this controversy at all. One condition underlying the payment of the bounty is that a remunerative price must be paid to the grower of the grapes. Seeing that the prices of grapes this year are not less remunerative than  those of last year, it cannot be said that the Government bas neglected the interests of the growers.",53

128,Mr FOSTEB,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Unti l the bounty was paid.  petition of continental wines is concerned, The the position today, compared with that of a year ago, is that a preference then worth 6d. a gallon is now worth 4s. a gallon Let us now consider the competition . our wines bave to meet from wine manufactured in Britain. These so-called Britisb wines are manufactured in Britain from must obtained from continental countries. Honourable members generally will agree that it is not a purely, British industry, whereas Empire wines are Empire-grown, as well as Empire-made. In dealing with this matter we do well to consider it from the stand-point of the British Government, wbicb naturally regards the British wine-making industry as one in which . British capital is invested. British wines pay a tax of ls. per gallon excise. The Britisb preferential tariff in respect of our wines is 4s. a gallon-a n apparent difference of 3s. a gallon. Not one speaker wbo bas made that point bas shown that, so long as the ls. 9d. bounty remained, the actual advantage was only ls. 3d. per gallon. Tbat difference cannot be regarded as insuperable when we take into consideration the quality and higher spirit content of our wines. The winemakers of this country desire that the excise duty on this so-called British wine shall be increased. Indeed, the Viticultural Council has made representations to Great Britain to that effect, and bas pointed out that Australian wines are Empire grown as well as Empire made. The greatest obstacle in the way of an additional excise on Britisb wine is the existence of the bounty of ls. 9d. per gallon paid to Australian wine-makers. In determining whether an increased excise duty sbould be charged on wine made in Britain, the British Government would naturally take into consideration the bounty paid by the Australian Government. In my opinion the most practical gesture we can make to the British Government, if we desire that the excise duty on British wines shall be increased, is toreduce to a reasonable amount the bounty we pay.",54
129,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Accordin g to that line of reasoning, the abolition of the bounty would result in the British excise duty being increased.  member will admit that the argument is perfectly sound. I repeat that the greatest obstacle in the way of getting an additional excise duty imposed in Great Britain is the existence of so large a bounty in Australia, which, to a great extent, neutralizes the difference between conditions in Great Britain and in Australia. I desire now to say a few words regarding the future of this industry. A good deal has beeu made of the fact that between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 gallons of Australian wines nave accumulated in Great Britain. It is significant that the importation of foreign wines Britain last year was considerably less than the quantity of such wines consumed. It is clear, therefore, that the stocks hand in Great Britain are being drawn upon. Tbat naturally raises the question of the replacement of those stocks. Wben the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced his budget into the House of Commons last April, there was in bond in Great Britain about one and a balf million gallons of Continental wines which, ordinarily, would have bad to pay a duty of 2s. 6d. a gallon. But wben the duty was raised from 2s. 6d. to Ss. a gallon it was realized that a hardship would be imposed on Continental wine-makers. The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore compromised by reducing the duty on. the wine in bond to 5s. per gallon. Our wine, under a tariff of 4s. a gallon, bad to ' compete with a considerable quantity of Continental wine which was released from bond under a duty of 5s. a gallon. That was ls. a gallon more than our wine and represented ouly 6d. a gallon more than the difference which we enjoyed prior to the alteration of the tariff. That Continental wine has gone largely into consumption, and the Britisb merchants bave to replace their stocks from elsewhere ",55
130,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"The y are replacing tbem with British wines.  table fact that British wines do not compare at all favourably with our wines. Tbey contain at least 10 per cent, less"" spirit, and are not in the same class at all. The wines that really compare with ours in class and strength will, in future, bear a duty of 8s. a gallon. It is absolutely unthinkable that the merchants of Great Britain will buy large quantities of wine under a tariff of 8s. a gallon wben they can obtain Australian wines of a similar class under a tariff of 4s.",55
131,Mr MAKKS,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Would our wines be sold as Australian wines? They cannot be found in London.  am satisfied that if our wine industry were organized on an efficient basis as is. the dried fruits industry, it would be' possible to advertise our wines to the Britisb public as Australian sweet wines, into comparing favourably in quality and strength with those of other countries. The Government is satisfied that this inon dustry can be materially improved by better organization. Its overhead expenses are admittedly too bigb, and it bas, unfortunately,- been content to follow a certain rut simply because it has been receiving a generous bounty. The Government is satisfied on the facts that an enormous benefit under Britisb preference is now being and will continue to be enjoyed by Australian wine-makers. A reduction in the bounty is a necessary step before we can reasonably expect an increase in excise on Britisb wines. The Government believes that if the wine makers organize the industry efficiently, they will be able to pay to the growers the remunerative prices that are set out in the price lists, and, at the same time, make their business profitable under the reduced bounty. I wisb now to refer to our exports of wine to Canada, and futuie contracts. The position in , Canada is entirely different from that in Great Britain. In some cases, we are on even terms with other countries. We enjoy exactly the same preference as does Erance, but we are at a disadvantage in competing with Spanish wines of similar class but rather lower spirit content than our own, and to get a footing in that market, it has been suggested that the Government should retain the old bounty of ls 9d. a gallon so far as exportation to Canada is concerned. The Commonwealth Government recognizes that this is a reasonable request, and proposes to submit an amendment to honourable members at the committee stage. The Government is also impressed with representations made that the 1927 vintage should receive special consideration, and that, if possible, something should be done Francis, J. to grant the old bounty on that vintage. That is a tremendously difficult and complicated proposal, because in Australia there are no distinct vintages. In a very short time the 1927 vintage will be mixed with the 1926 and 1925 vintages and thus Jose its identity. It is almost an impossibility to distinguish one vintage from another. To endeavour to do full justice to"" the wine-makers, the Government has decided not to proceed beyond the second reading stage at present, so that a full investigation may be made regarding the 1927 vintage. There is one other point. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Cook) today stated that the drawback was inadequate, and instead of being ls. 3d. it should be Is. 7d. a gallon. About a week or a fortnight ago, a member of a deputation which waited on me made the same suggestion. I pointed out to bim that the Government had no wisb to tax exported wines, or to collect one single penny in taxation from that source. I said that if he could substantiate his case that a drawback of Is. 3d. a gallon did not fully cover the excise paid on spirit contained in exported wines, the Government would be willing to increase the drawback. I give that assurance to the honourable member for Indi, but I would point out to him that the average between the taxation on doradilla spirit and that on spirit made from grapes other than doradilla is about 5s. 6d. Tbere is about 23 per cent, of spirit in exported wine, and that percentage of 5s. 6d. amounts to about ls. 3d. However, if the industry can  make its case good, the Commonwealtl Government will be willing to increase the drawback to cover the excise paid or spirit contained in exported wines.

Upou which Mr LATHAM had movedThat the requested amendment be made.",55
132,Mr JACKSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Bass) [9.47] - I desire to support the proposal before the Committee for the imposition of a duty on imported skins which have beeu partially treated. Some speakers bave said that the duty on dressed skins is too bigb, or, alternatively, that the duty on the finished furs is too low. While is is proposed to put a duty of 40 per cent, on partially dressed skins, the duty on finished furs is 55 per cent., and I point out that' the apparent margin of 15 per cent, is really greater than it looks. To that margin has to be added the cost of labour, the profit of the manufacturer, and freight and other charges paid on the imported skins. The position has been mucb the same for some time past in regard to - ovei'coats, and if I remember rightly my friends on the opposite side supported the tariff of 35 per cent, and 45 per cent, on imported tweeds. On imported overcoats invoiced at 30s., a flat rate of 12s. 6d. duty is imposed which amounts to a 40 per cent - but on a 40s. coat the duty works out at only 30 per cent.; or a coat invoiced at 50s. the duty is 25 per cent. With a duty of 40 per cent, on treated skins, there is, according to the arguments put forward by members of the Opposition, little margin between the raw skins and the finished fur coats. Nevertheless, I contend that there is an actual margin, and that the furriers are 15 per cent. better off than the makers, who I understand are doing a thriving business at the present time. In Sydney there is a firm called Furs Limited, which is employing about 80 hands, and I have been assured on good authority that the management consider that this duty is absolutely necessary for the extension of the business. This firm not only treats the skins, but is making up fur coats, and other articles of apparel. One of the most striking things I have come across in regard to this matter is a statement published in the British Fur Trade, of October, 1927, from a gentleman named Mr S. Biber, who gave a special interview to the paper. He saidAustralians propose to develop their f u r trade in their own way, behind tlieir tariff wall, without undue regard for the tears of British or other outside competitors. . . . "" We are beginning' to build our industries, as distinguished from agriculture, fruit-growing, trapping, and so on,"" he said, "" and we shall go on doing this as occasion offers, using our owu raw materials for our own manufacturers' benefit first instead of sending them all over the earth .to be returned to us as finished articles. . . . For a long time past it has seemed absurd to us out there that we should export raw rabbit-skins, sending them right across the world, to be returned to us dressed and dyed conies for our manufacturers. To a firm like my own-Bibe r Furs Limited, which is not only a manufacturing but a merchant concern, making up goods as well as importing the material from outsideit has appeared especially grotesque. . . ""It certainly appears grotesque to me that this gentleman, although be made sucb a statement for publication in England, is now one of those most actively engaged in trying to prevent this proposed duty from being imposed. Dealing with the proposals to cut out the middle man, be said"" So we determined to buy and dress and dye our own rabbit skins and make them up, cutting out all needless middlemen and transport and otlier charges which put up the price of f u r goods to the Australian customer. We are now about to do this; and the organization of the project is one of the reasons for my trip to Europe."" In the 8th paragraph of this article he says' thisA stiff tariff, argues Mr Biber, is essential to the up-building, of a self-contained or nearly self-contained Australian f u r trade, and this is tlieir ideal. The statement concludes with this paragraph, which I submit for the consideration of my frends on the Oppositioncoat "" The Australian workmen will support the idea of a prohibitive tariff; so will the 'fur trade as a whole. We have a fine esprit de corps in the trade there-finer , I think, than you have here. Our association is representative, and we work together most amicably. We all believe in the future of Australia and of its fur trade. Not only do we look forward to a heavy tax on dressed and dyed rabbit skins coming into Australia, but we shall press for an excise or export duty on raw rabbit skins going out of Australia, so as to prevent our competitors from getting, for so little as in the past, a raw material which has been bred at the cost of the Australian farmer and the public at large."" In view of such an extraordinary statement as that, I ask whether there is any reason why we should take these gentlemen seriously in their attempt to defeat the Government's proposals.",57
133,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Would it not be fair to increase the duty on fur apparel?,58
134,Mr JACKSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I think that the duty is sumcient now. Does the honourable member, as a good protectionist-and I call him that because he has been one of the consistent members of the House ou this point-thin k that it is rigbt for an industry wbicb is only making up furs to bave a tariff of 55 per cent., while the furrier, wbo is trying to build up a trade in Australia for the treatment of rawskins, sbould bave no protection at all? If be is prepared, with the rest of his party, to vote with the Government on this proposal, I am prepared to give bim my support to ' increase the duty of 55 per cent, on fur apparel if that duty does not prove sumcient. As a protectionist I desire to do the fair thing Dy the manufacturing furriers in Australia, and I expect my honourable friends opposite to give the same sympathetic consideration to that section of the industry which has to do with the raw material. I trust that the item will be passed without further delay.",58
135,Mr BELL,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Darwin) [9.56] - I intend to support the request. The industry which will be protected under this item is likely to develop into an important one. If I feared that the effect of these duties would be as indicated by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) yesterday, I should not support it. He suggested that the duties would bring about a reduction in the value of undressed rabbit skins in Australia. I can see no reason for that fear; but there is one aspect of the proposal that causes me some concern. The Minister (Mr Latham) pointed out that, under this item, it would be possible tc introduce undressed skins from China, Belgium or Erance, free of duty. That would be very undesirable. The rabbit in Australia is an acknowledged pest. It has devastated immense areas of valuable pastoral country. Rabbits cost the primary producers of the Commonwealth about Â£5,000,000 per annum. We export about 100,000,000 rabbit skins a year, and basing my estimate on my knowledge of the cost of feeding a rabbit as against the cost of feeding a sheep, and the relative values of rabbit skins and the wool aud carcase of a sheep, I can say with every confidence that the rabbit costs our primary producers the sum that I have mentioned. It is not at all likely that the new industry, which it is hoped will he built up under these duties, will be worth anything like that figure to the Commonwealth. In any case, I see no reason why the requested amendment sbould not include undressed skins also. If this is done, it will have my wholehearted support.",58
136,Mr LATHAM,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I understand, from inquiries that I bave made, that no undressed rabbit skins are imported.",58
137,Mr BELL,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I am aware of that, but last night the Minister said that there was nothing to prevent manufacturers from importing undressed skins free of duty. The only fear I bave is that the skins of Belgian and Chinese rabbits may, under certain conditions, come into competition with Australian rabbit skins. Is there any reason why undressed skins sbould not be included in the request?",58
138,Mr LATHAM,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Yes ; the intention is to encourage the dressing of tbese skins in Australia.,58
139,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Yarra) [10.1] - I propose to say only a few words in support of the item. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) endeavored to make it appear that the three honourable members who had spoken from this side, were opposed to the duties. That is not the case. Tbere bas not been one speech from this side in opposition to the item. It bas been suggested that the duties will interfere with the protection now enjoyed by the manufacturing furriers of New. Soutli Wales. Honourable members on this side contend that the Government should, simultaneously with the passing of this item, increase the duties oh the manufactured wearing appurel - We, at least, are consistent in our advocacy of protection for Australian industries. In this respect we differ from some other honourable members, and particularly representatives from Tasmania, who are strong protectionists in regard to any item that affects their State, but forget their principles when the interests of other States are concerned.",58
140,Mr BELL,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,That cannot be said of the honourable member for Bass.,59
141,Mr SCTJLLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Perhaps I should exclude him ; but my point is that the charge of inconsistency in regard to protection docs not lie against honourable members on this side. It does lie agaiust some honourable members opposite. I am supporting the Government on this item. If there is one thing we can be sure of it is that there will be no lack of the raw material for many years: The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell) said just now that there was the possibility of competition from' imported undressed skins. I am satisfied that the Australian rabbit will be able to hold its own. against all competitors. We have an unlimited supply of the raw material. If the rabbit skin is to be prepared for manufacture) the process should be carried out in Australia. A considerableamount of' literature dealing with this item has been distributed among honourable members. have no complaint to make on that score, but I do resent organized opposition to now duties from established manufacturers' who have built up their industries under our protective tariff. I can understand opposition coming from a free trader, but I have no sympathy with the manufacturer who is enjoying protection and objects to proposals to extend the same measure of protection to anothor industry which may in some way affect his owu business. That is being done in connection with this matter. Only today I received a circular in which there was a wholesale condemnation of the skins turned out in Australian factories.. I am informed that the initiatory experiments were not very successful, aud' that much capital is being made out of that. If it can be shown that these businesses must have higher protection to permit them-to exist, I am prepared to support that policy, but manufacturers should not traduce one another. What is the finished article in one industry becoincs-'the raw material in another, and manufacturers should assist one another to build', up industries. The argument has becn-advanced that this industry oan supply only. 10 per cent, of our requirements of coney furs. I am informed that it can supply, if it secures the market, the whole of the black coney needed, which representing about 90 per cent, of total requirements, is a very substantial proportion. Something has been said about the additional cost that, will be brought about by the imposition of a duty. I can understand that argument when applied to>oworking'men's cotton tweeds, and so on, although many such statements are falsified by experience.",59
142,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,There are working girls' furs.,59
143,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"The imposition of a duty on imported furs would make a very negligible addition to their cost. One has but to gain a slightinside knowledge of the trade' to realise where the exploitation comes in . . The addition of 16s. or f l , by way of a duty, would make little difference in the cost of furs which are being gold for 40 guineas and more, and which actually cost to import.from Â£8 to Â£10. If this industry receives sumcient support it. may I eventually have the effect of exterminating rabbits in Australia.",59
144,Mr GREGORY,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,Our export market is worth a lot more than that.,59
145,Mr SCULLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"It is unsound to suggest that we may destroy our export market by imposing this duty.. It will increase the number of skins dressed in Australia, and reduce the number sent abroad to be dressed. It seems ridiculous that we should send skins abroad to be treated, bring them back to Australia, and then make them into .'Various articles. Large sums of money wbicb now go out of Australia in that way 'will be retained in this country if this dutyfo granted.  ber think that the rabbiterS' 'will receive , the same payment for their skins?",59
146,Mr SCTJLLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I do. There will bo two sets of buyers on the market. There will be buyers of rabbit skins for export, as there are today, and there will also be buyers of skins for local manufacture. It is common sense to assume that a larger number of rabbit skins will be dressed in Australia, arid-we would have the definite knowledge'-that the skins originated Australia. We do not know where many of the imported ones are raised. The industry is-not employing many hands at present, but every industry has to have a beginning.

147,Mr SCTJLLIN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"The honourable member would be a very sorry person if he had to live in Australia and we had not our secondary industries. There would be a very poor market for the primary products about which he talks so much. There is not a country that has made progress and taken its place among the other nations of the world that has not acquired its prosperity by building up its primary and secondary industries side by side, and a similar course must be followed in Australia. First of all we must establish our primary industries as the basis upon which to build all things.

148,Mr SEABROOK,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Franklin) [10.14]. - I Tise simply to clear up some of the statements made by honourable members. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) said that a great deal of literafit, ture has been circulated in this House on this subject. This is so, and much of it is very untrue. The honourable mem (Mr Coleman), Cook (Mr C. Riley), and New England (Mr Thompson) were advised as to jfertain matters by the Importers and Furriers' Association. They stated, aB they were told, that 5,000 men would be thrown out of work if this duty were imposed.  tion of the facts.",60
149,Mr SEABROOK,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I understood those honourable members to say that 5,000 men would be thrown out of employment if this duty were imposed. Fewer than 2,000 persons are employed in the industry throughout the Commonin wealth. I have received a telegram on this matter from Furs Limited, a firm that produces a good article. It statesStatement thousands would he affected positively untrue. Not two thousand workers making up garments throughout CouunonThis includes workers on all classes of skins, covering more than twenty varieties. Proportion on coney therefore small, 15 per centi' Difference in duty covers total labour costs for making coney coats. These men would not be discharged, because coney seal is only required for a small proportion pf the coats made. A large number of employees are engaged in the manufacture of coats from other varieties of skins that would not be affected by the increased duty. The proposal will only affect rabbit coats and rabbit trimmings, which represent probably less than one-fourth of the value of the total trade - The popular furs are coney, perschaniki, susliki, marmot, skunk, fox, marten, musquash, minkhare, American opossum, and over twenty other furs. If the duty is increased, those coats will continue to be made. It is said that the -55 per cent, duty charged on the manufactured article should be increased. Let lis take an imported coat sold in Australia at Â£10, and consider the cost.of manufacturing a similar coat in Australia. It would require 30 skins at Ss. each, which would amount to Â£4 10s: The extra duty would be 18s., the cost of labour Â£1 10s., and the lining 12s. 6d., a total of Â£7 10s. 8d. Adding 25 per cent, to cover overhead charges, pro&c, the cost would""'be increased by Â£1 18s. 7d., making a total of Â£9 9s.

I hope that honourable members, in view of the facts that I bave placed before them, will support the request.",60
150,Mr COLEMAN,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Reid) [10.30] - I protest against certain remarks by the honourable member for. Franklin (Mr. Seabrook), wbo bas deliberately misrepresented the attitude of the honourable member for Cook (Mr C. Riley) and myself towards this item. He suggested that we bad been in consultation with importers and others. It is surprising that in this case the honourable member should show sucb remarkable solicitude for Australian industries, seeing that on other occasions he has been a bitter opponent of protection. The mere fact that the honourable member supports the request for an increased duty is almost calculated to make an honourable member vote contrary to his principles. I deny that I have suggested at any time that I am opposed to protection for this industry. In this matter I criticized the Government's policy of lopsided protection. I bave not indicated that I would vote against the proposed increase in the duty, but I enter an emphatic protest against the Government's refusal to correspondingly increase the duty on fur apparel.  The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Seabrook), in his effort to clear up the matter, produced an urgent telegram, wbicb be read to the committee. He bas shown that it is from an interested He remarked that statements by other persons were untrue, confirming, in my opinion, the claim already put forward that an important technical matter sucb as this sbould be investigated by the Tariff Board before this committee ventures to consider it. I mentioned last evening that the Government bad already discovered that duties imposed to assist one section of an industry often injured another section. Mr Scuixra - Would the honourable member support any duty, even if it were recommended by.the Tariff Board?  ber for Yarra will remember complaining of the action of the Melbourne Age in connection with a deputation to the Minister for Trade and Customs objecting to a duty on imported newsprint, although that tariff was asked for to assist in the establishment of the newsprint industry in Australia. I bave received an urgent telegram from Mr Sydney Keith, Managing Director of Holders"" Proprietary Limited, Melbourne, as follows :Holders Proprietary Limited strongly protest against increased duty on coney. Will mean closing our fur factory, employing now 100 hands, as we will be able to import madeup garments cheaper than we can make them here. Matter should undoubtedly be referred to Tariff Board. 1 consider it would affect at least between three and four thousand hands. I do not know if this is true, and the honourable member for Franklin does not know whether the statement that be read is accurate. Obviously the proper authority to deal with the subject is the Tariff Board. Mr LAzzARrNi - The honourable member would not support a duty even if the Tariff Board recommended it.  While we bave a Tariff Board it sliould do the work for which it was appointed. I do not wish to move that the item be referred to the Tariff Board, but I hope that the Minister will agree to that course. This matter is not urgent.",60
151,Mr GULLETT,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Henty) [10.26] - 1 oppose the item, because the committee party. lacks any information which - would justify the proposed"" duties. In the absence of the"" Minister for Trade and Customs, and without the matter having been investigated by the Tariff Board, I am surprised that the Government should venture to propose this impost, and I cordially support the request of the honourable member for Forrest that the item be temporarily withdrawn. Tbis is an outrage on the whole principle of protection. The duty was proposed by a private member in another place, and endorsed by the Government representative there, and now this committee is asked to approve of it without any guidance from the Minister in charge of the department or from the Tariff Board. Although I bave the greatest respect for the Attorney-General's versatility, I do not think that be is at his best in the advocacy of a duty on rabbit skins. I listened with very much interest to the honourable member for Yarra expressing resentment of the intervention of other manufacturers in opposition to the proposed duties. I cannot understand his attitude. We are carrying the policy of fiscal protection for new industries much too far. A tariff holiday, so far as new industries are concerned, would be to the best advantage of existing industries; it would give them time to get on their feet. We are constantly embarrassing them by imposing further duties on their raw material. The item before us is a case in point. We bave strong evidence that the proposed duty will embarrass the existing industry, and no convincing evidence to the contrary bas been adduced.",61
152,Mr LATHAM,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [10.30] - It may comfort the honourable member for Henty to know that this proposal bas the approval of my absent colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs. The Government considers that the preparation and dressing of rabbit skins is an industry admirably suited to Australia, and that sucb work sbould be done here. It is not disputed that tliose who are at present engaged in this enterprise are in a precarious position, and, unless they are given tariff assistance, what appears to be a most promising industry will assuredly disappear. Objection has been raised to the proposal to increase the isting duties from 10 per cent., 15 per cent, and 20 per ceut. to 25 per cent., per cent, and 45 per cent.,, on the ground that the protection given to the industry of manufacturing fur apparel will thereby be diminished. This industry is at present protected by duties of 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent. The duty on dressed skins imported from foreign countries is being increased from 20 per cent, to 40 per cent. Tbat means an increase of 20 per cent, on the raw material used in the fur apparel industry. If the cost of dressed and prepared skins were 50 per cent, of the cost of the completed garment-I am assured it is very much less-a n increase of 10 per cent, in the foreign duty on garments would meet the case. But honourable members have received from the Master Furriers' Association of Victoria a demand that the existing duties of 40 per cent., 50 per cent., and 55 per cent, sbould be increased to 80 per cent., 90 per cent., and .100 per cent. In respect of foreign skins, they ask. for an increase of 45 per cent, to meet an increase, in respect of raw material, of certainly not more than 10 per cent., and possibly only half that amount. This request is extravagant, and the Government has considerable doubts as to the good foundation of the statements that the industry of manufacturing fur apparel will be prejudiced by the increase in duties on dressed rabbit skins. What it is necessary to consider is the margin of profit in the fur apparel industry. If , despite the increased duties on rabbit skins there is a sufficient margin of profit to enable the manufacture of fur apparel to be carried on successfully, there is uo need for any alteration of the duties on such apparel. The Government is not prepared to submit to the Tariff Board a proposal for an increase of those duties, but it is ready to ask the board to inquire into the profits at present being made by the manufacturers of fur apparel. After a report on that subject has been made, consideration can be given to the desirability of altering the existing rates of duty.",62
153,Mr THOMPSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"New England) [10.34] - I bave already indicated to the committee my attitude towards this item, ex- but the statement of the Attorney General calls for further comment. He 35 bas practically . convicted the Government out of his own mouth, because be says that it bas grave doubts, amounting to suspicion, regarding the statements made .as to the profits earned by the manufacturers of fur apparel.",62
154,Mr LATHAM,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,I did not use the word suspicion. I said that the Government wanted further inquiries into that pbasp of the industry.,62
155,Mr THOMPSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,We should bave a clear understanding of the profits that are made before we agree to impose any duty upon a manufactured article.,62
156,Mr LATHAM,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,The honourable member is confusing the two industries.,62
157,Mr THOMPSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,I am not. I quite understand that there are two industries.,62
158,Mr BRUCE,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,On e is concerned with the dressing of the skins and the other with the making up of fur garments out of the skins.,62
159,Mr THOMPSON,REFUSAL TO TENDER EVIDENCE TO,"I realise that there arc two industries, and that there is a question - as to what profits are made by each. advocates of the local industry have not made it clear that it is in a precarious position.' If it is, honourable members are not aware of it. All we have to guide us are the statements that bave been made during this debate. It appears to me that desperate measures have been employed to bave this duty agreed to despite the protests of honourable members who wisb the Tariff Board to bold an investigation into it. The impression bas been created that sucb an inquiry is not desired. A dangerous precedent is being established, wbicb may result in other matters being withheld from the Tariff Board. If the Government has any doubt regarding the position of either the smaller or the bigger industry its course is clear. It is adopting a rather contemptuous attitude wben it ignores the protests of honourable members who have pressed for an inquiry. Mr C. RILEY (Cook) [10.38] I feel that I cannot oppose the item; but last night I availed myself of the opportunity to protest against what I consider is special and favoured treatment of a new industry, which has yet to become established, and the refusal of the Government to tackle the big problems that are connected with the working up of our raw materials. Last year we exported rabbit skins to the value of Â£3,000,000, and sheep skins with wool on to the value of more than Â£4,000,000. Prom time to time. I bave urged that the work done upon those skins should be undertaken by our own people. extraordinary that the Government sbould show such a particular interest in this matter. The capital invested in this industry is small compared with that invested in ' the fellmongering industry, which bas been in a languishing condition for many years. Certain honourable members wbo sit opposite bave repeatedly refrained from supporting items in the tariff schedule. Their inr terest in this item is occasioned by the fact that the industry is established in their own State. They say that this material should be worked up in our own country. They should be consistent and support any move that is designed to bring about the working up of other raw materials in Australia. The Mr BELL - To whom is the honourable member referring? Mr C. RILEY - Tb e honourable member for Eranklin (Mr Seabrook) bas repeatedly opposed items in the tariff schedule. Evidently this duty is to be imposed, because a number of Ministerial supporters, and possibly Cabinet Ministers, have had the opportunity of inspecting the Tasmanian works, and bave been impressed by them. I am in entire sympathy with the industry, but I consider that I am justified in voicing a protest against the Government's failure to do the rigbt thing in connection with the working up of other raw materials in this country.  protest against the passage of this item. We bave a Tariff Board that is supposed to make inquiries and fully inform the Government and honourable members as to the conditions under which industries sbould be protected. I , for one, shall not accept an assurance that this protection is necessary, until proof of that fact has been furnished by the Tariff Board. Some of the increased duties to which honourable members have-agreed after an investigation by the Tariff Board are, in my opinion, detrimental to the best interests of Australia. I strongly protest against any proposal being placed before us Until the matter bas been properly considered by the Tariff Board. It was amusing to bear the honourable member for Eranklin (Mr Seabrook) advocate this duty because the industry happened to be in Tasmania. Last night the honI t is orable member for Franklin exhibited a sample of an imported article, and informed honourable members that the prices ranged from 19s. to 40s. He then showed a sample of the local product, the prices of which, he said, ranged from 25s. to 50s. He did not tell us whether the price of the sample was the lowest or the highest in either case. There is nothing convincing in bringing to this chamber samples of local and imported commodities and supplying no information other than that there is a big range of prices. Another amusing feature of the debate was the spectacle of our distinguished and learned friend the' Attorney-General. (Mr Latham) discussing women's clothing. He appeared to be rather out of his element, and the information which he supplied to the committee did not coincide with the facts. He said that the price of the skins that are used in a garment represents a very small proportion of the value of the made-up article. If he had had any experience of skins he would know that price is a very considerable item and that the cost of making up is most expensive. Both the manufacturer and the retailer have to make a profit. Every person should-know, also, that there is a further element in the sale of any article which is affected by the dictate's of fashion, and that is the risk which is involved. Everybody who has been connected with the retail clothing trade knows that while a profit may be made on certain articles of apparel at the beginning of a season, it may be advisable to sell similar articles at a loss at the end of the season. In some cases such stock is carried over from one season, to another, but that also entails a loss. The difference of 10 per cent, which will be made in the cost of such articles if this request is agreed to may, therefore, be a serious item to business people. I have had a recent experience of the futility of protesting against measures introduced by the Government, so I shall not expect much effect from my opposition on this occasion. I shall, however, justify my actions before my constituents during the. coming election campaign, and indicate to them the serious effect that some of the increases that we are making in the tariff is having upon primary production in Australia. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.46] - Some honourable members appear to think that the Tariff Board is an authority superior to the Government. I disagree with that view. If the Government considers that by taking such action as is now proposed, it can effectively assist an industry for which we have an abundance of raw material and a good local market, it should take it. Seeing that I hold that view and consider that this proposal will assist a' local industry, I shall support it. Motion agreed to. Progress reported. NA (No. 2). Bill presented by Dr EARLE PAGE, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",63
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L," I move That the bill be now read a second time. Immediately after the Commonwealth Housing Bill was passed last year, the Commonwealth Savings Bank entered into negotiations with the various State housing authorities with a view to putting its provisions into operation. The housing authorities in three of the States were quite prepared to accept the principles of our act and to recommend that their legislation be altered to make it uniform with ours. It was found, however, that the making of a few minor amendments in our measure would facilitate co-operation, and this bill has been introduced with that object. I thank honourable members 'for allowing me to move the second reading at this late hour. The general purpose of the bill is to make the act slightly more elastic. It is provided in section 9 of the measure that an advance shall not be made to au authority until the Commonwealth authority is satisfiedThat the schemes administered by the authority contain provisions under which(i) No loan is made by the authority to any person who already owns n house, except for the purpose of discharging a mortgage upon one dwelling house of which he is the owner. The State authorities pointed out that they granted loans not only to discbarge a mortgage but also to'permit a house to be enlarged. That is often necessary when an increase occurs in a family. Provision is, therefore, made in this bill to add to the sub-paragraph I bave quoted the words, ""or for the purpose of enlarging a dwelling house of which he is the owner."" This is a slight but necessary amendment. Similar provision is made to enable a person wbo bas already received a loan under the Commonwealth housing scheme to procure a dwelling house to obtain a further loan to enlarge that bouse sbould necessity arise. It was also pointed out that quite frequently a person who is buying a house through a State authority changes his place of - residence to some other quite different district. Provision is, therefore, made that in the case of such a person fully repaying the amount advanced to him in respect of a house in one locality, he may obtain a new advance to enable bim to secure a home in an altogether differeut place. In addition, it was found that in practically all. the States the system of acquiring houses on the rent-purchase plan was in operation. That plan provides that a client may purchase a bouse by making a small deposit and paying off the balance by weekly or monthly instalments, including interest and principal. After he has paid off, say, 66 . per cent, or 75 per cent, of the total cost, be may obtain a title to the property, which can then be mortgaged to the bousing authority. It was felt that the wording of the original act did not fully cover this position. Oonse quently an alteration is being made in clause 3, sub-clause (E ) 2. It was also.thought desirable that it sbould be made clear that where a State administers more than one bousing scheme, it shall be sufficient if one scheme conforms to the conditions laid down in the Commonwealth Housing Act for advances to be made under this act. The bill provides accordingly. The method of repayments by the housing authorities of the State to the Commonwealth Bank, and thence to the Treasurer, as set out in the principal act bas been found not to suit every State. Accordingly, by clause 4, section 10 of the principal act is amended by omitting sub-sections 3 and 4, and substituting other sub-sections in lieu thereof with a view to providing greater elasticity in the dealings between the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the State .housing authorities, and between the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The method of repayment is being altered to provide that advances made shall bear such rates of interest, and be subject to sucb terms and conditions of repayment as may be agreed to between - the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Savings Bank. As a result of conferences wbicb have been held, it is thought that it will be possible by this means to arrive at an arrangement which will be satisfactory to all parties. Some of the States desire to repay to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, as received, the money paid to them by their clients. Provision is. made to meet sucb cases Clause 4 (4) provides that the Treasurer may from time to time advance to the Commonwealth Savings Bank out of any moneys in the Commonwealth public account sums not exceeding the moneys which be is authorized to borrow in pursuance of this act. This will enable advances from Commonwealth revenue to be. made in anticipation of the necessary loans being raised. These minor amendments will tend to facilitate transactions between the Commonwealth Savings Bank and the various State bousing authorities-. I submit tbem to the House in the hope that they will be passed without delay. Debate (on motion Mr Scullin) adjourned. CUSTOMS TARIF FBILL .

As passed by this House the item provided for single lever mortice lock sets. That was intended to apply to locks and parts of locks. Locks bave, however, been imported separately from the furniture and bandies, and bave, therefore not been covered by the item. The sole object of the requested amendment is to show definitely the intention of Parliament that the duty sbould apply to locks and lock sets, and that it should not be evaded by importing the locks and the furniture separately.",65
162,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Reid) [11.0] - Owing to the inadequate duties at present in operation petrol pumps are entering this country from abroad. I understand that 500 of these pumps are about to be imported. I have urged the Government to take action to prevent these importations, but, so far, there has been no pronouncement of Government policy in the matter. I , therefore, propose to move that the item be amended by adding a new subitem 5 to provide that the duty on petrol pumps shall be British Â£30, intermediate Â£35, and general Â£40. Tlio. CHAIRMAN (Mr Bayley) Petrol pumps are not mentioned in the request from another place. quently the honourable member will not be in order in moving in the direction he has indicated.",66

Senate's request-^Add at the end of item 208- "" By adding a new sub-item (B) as follows:(E) Barrel and socket bjlts-a d valorem, British 45 per cent.; intermediate, 60 per cent.; general, 65' per",66
168,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.7] - I move That the requested amendment be made. Tbis is a request that barrel and socket bolts, instead of being treated under item 208A, shall come within a new item, and shall bear the duties, Britisb 45 per cent., intermediate 60 per cent., and general 65 per cent., instead of 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent, respectively. Tbis matter bas been inquired into by the Tariff Board in connection with bag frames and attache and suit case pin bolts. It was apparently understood by the Tariff Board. that the bolts in question were used only in connection with kit-bags and attache cases. The bolts are made by the Conse- same company or firm; but they are the ordinary hardware bolts with which we are all familiar. The Tariff Board recommends the removal of these bolts from item 404, under which it was supposed they fell, so that they would come under manufactures of metal. In fact, they do at present come under that heading. The importations into Australia of tbese barrel and socket bolts, which are very simple implements, are considerable, indeed, and, although the articles may be made perfectly well in Australia and at . a reasonable price, there is not a sufficient market for the Australian product to make the industry profitable. The increased duties sbould bave the effect of giving the local market substantially to the local manufacturers, who have undertaken in Writing, not to increase prices. One of the functions of the Tariff Board is to see that such undertakings are carried out. The Tariff Board Act contains a provision for the prevention of any overcharge to the public by a protected industry. If honourable members find that prices bave been increased in breach of sucb undertakings, I can assure them that full inquiries will be. made.",66
169,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Ballarat) [11.9] - I wisb to say a few words concerning Australian manufacturers wbo are receiving the benefit of protection and are not patronizing Australian industries. A cent."" new distillery is being established at Geelong, and I understand that the company is importing boilers from abroad. That distillery, when established, will receive the protection of a high tariff, and the company should certainly patronize Australian industries. Motion agreed to.

170,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [11.10] - I move That the requested amendment be made. The object of the request is to give effect to the Tariff Board's report, which has been received since the tariff items were discussed in this chamber. At present sparking plugs imported with motor car chassis are charged sparking plug rates. There is a special item for sparking plugs when imported separately. A very promising sparking plug industry is developing in Australia, and the object of the motion is to charge sparking plugs, i m ported with the chassis, at sparking plug rates and not at chassis rates.",67
171,Mr COLEMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Reid) [11.11] - I wish to know why the Government has not extended the principle of charging a specific duty on motor parts to motor springs: In Sydney some weeks ago the representatives of at least ten firms manufacturing motor springs interviewed me, and I understand that they also made representations to the Minister for Trade  mated value of springs forming part of the equipment of imported motor cars amounts to Â£500,000 annually. During the last financial year 27,928 un-assembled chassis, and 91,026 assembled chassis were imported, totalling altogether 118,954 chassis, and representing a value of Â£12,292,749. I wish to know whether I may move to amend sub-item (D ) (4) with a view to including motor springs.",67
172,The CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"The honourable member would not be in order for two reasons: Pirst, springs are not mentioned in the sub-item under discussion, and, secondly, the suggested amendment would involve increased taxation, and therefore it is beyond the scope of a private member to move it .

176,Mr THEODORE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Dalley) [11.20] I understand that the medical superintendent appoints the nurses employed at the Canberra hospital without calling for applications or advertising the existence of vacancies. Tbis applies to both nursing sisters and nurses of lesser status. This does not afford those wbo desire to obtain appointments to an important hospital sucb as this an opportunity to apply, nor can the administration give effect to the policy of granting preference to ex-service nurses. Further, it tends to create a staff which is possibly the result of favouritism. A medical officer who selects a staff in this way, perbaps without consulting any one except his personal friends, is not likely to build up the most competent staff. I do not think that, in this matter, any one bas an axe to grind; but the Minister for Home and Territories should look at it in the light of public policy, and should insist that, whenever a vacancy occurs, all qualified persons shall be given the opportunity to apply, a practice which obtains, I believe, in connection with the majority, if not all, of the hospitals in Australia.",68
177,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Swan) [11.19] - An amendment of the Customs Act passed in 1925 provided that goods could not obtain the advantage of the Britisb preferential tariff unless they contained 75 per cent of British labour and material, but the Customs Department has since then de termined that Australian material used ir the production of Britisb goods is not tc be regarded as British material. The embargo applies specifically to Australia! wool. I trust that in the near future that provision of the act will be amended so that the discretion of the Minister in this respect will be taken away from bim and it may be placed beyond argumenl that if the Britisb manufacturer uses Australian material in his production il will be classed as of Britisb manuf acture,",68
178,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING BIL L,"Calare-Min ister for Home and Territories) [11.21], - I shall consider very carefully the matter that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) has brought under my notice; but I would respectfully point out that it would assist me greatly in the ad- ministration of the Department of Home Affairs if what I might describe as small matters of local concern were brought under my notice outside the House. I can assure honourable members that I shall give to them that careful attention I bave given to all'matters that they bave been accustomed to bring under my notice as Minister in charge of Repatriation.  am sorry to detain the House at this late hour, but I bave been nursing one matter to bring it up on private members' day, and I learn now that there will be no private members' day tomorrow. I want to draw attention to a great injustice which bas been done to a large number of dairymen as well as others wbo are shareholders in the Adelaide Milk Supply Co-operative Limited. This is a very up to-date concern, with re&eiving depots in many country towns, such as Murray Bridge, Woodside, Blakiston, and Mount Torrens. With the object of supplying the public of Adelaide with a pure milk supply it has recently imported from America the very latest ice-producing and ice-cream plant, Nothing like it is made in Australia. The company bad bad several small machines previously, but not on the same principle, made by R. Werner and Company, of Melbourne; and now because this firm of manufacturers claims that it could bave made the plant imported by the Adelaide M i l k Supply Co-operative Limited, the latter company has been obliged to pay Â£4,870 10s. 8d. in cash for its enterprise in trying to cut down costs, and improve the position of its dairymen shareholders, and at the same time the mil k supply of Adelaide. A firm with sucb a laudable object in view sbould have the support of the Government and the Customs Department. We know that many lives, particularly those of infants, are lost through impure milk supplies. The company applied to the Minister for Trade and Customs to bave this plant brought, under an item in the tariff which would have made the duty lower, but its request was refused. Tbis is a communication which it - subsequently forwarded to the. Comptroller-General of CustomsWe regret to have received yours of' the 9th instant, and ask you to reconsider this matter, because there roust evidently be some misunderstanding with regard to Messrs. R. Werner and Company's ability to supply this plant. The whole system is entirely new to Australia, and we are satisfied that Messrs. R. Werner and Company' could not possibly have designed or quoted us for same at the time we ordered it. Wc understand that Mr Werner, Benior, was in America shortly after our order waa placed, but even now question whether his firm could supply the complete plant. At that time no high-power enclosed type of vertical compressors,' direct coupled to synchronous motors could be obtained in Australia. With .regard to the ice-tank section, the best quote we obtained was from Messrs. Richard Wildridge and Company, on' 24th February, 1927. The details of their tank were as under, and we mark dimensions of our imported tank in red62ft. long x 30 f t 6 in. wide x 8 f t . 9 in. deep. 62 f t . 3 in. long x 31 ft. 4 in. wide x 6 f t. 5 in. deep. Capacity-57 6 moulds of 400 lb. each in gangs, of 0-10 3 tons. Capacity-67 2 moulds of 400 lb. each in gangs of 14-13 4 tons. The ice tank which is quoted here Motion (by Sir JOHN GBLLIBBAND) negativedThat the question be now put.  of very great concern to over 400' of my constituents; They took .the trouble to obtain the opinion of one of the leading consulting engineers - of Adelaide, and be agreed that this plant could not be made in Australia. The statement continues The principle is something quite new to us, so without knowing that it would have been quite impossible to construct a similar plant. Now, with a plant operating, to act as a model, and all the blue prints for same complete, we should be able to construct a similar plant, providing always, we could overcome the various patent rights connected with the plant Here is an extract from the annual report of this company, and I again wisb to impress it upon honourable members that this is a co-operative concern, one in which the Minister for Markets should be particularly interested, because be is a dairyman himself.

I wisb to remind him that I bave myself on several occasions written to him on the subject, and explanations bave been made which show that the statement which he repeatedly makes that Britisb wool is being treated by the tariff as a foreign product, is neither fair nor accurate. The trouble is in regard to bats, and it is caused by the fact that the Britisb manufacturers will not use Britisb trimmings, even when they are available.",69
